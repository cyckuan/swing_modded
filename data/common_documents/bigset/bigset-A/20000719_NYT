DE BRUIJN VICTIMIZED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   This time the feat police have gone too far. They've charged
swimmer Inge de Bruijn, whose only known crime is that she is a
serial record-setter, with illicit use of performance-enhancing
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the feat police have yet to turn up a single
shred of evidence with which to convict the Dutch sprinter; the
mere fact that her fingerprints are all over seven world-record
performances since May is proof enough in their eyes to pronounce
her guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, profiling is rampant in sports today. Athletes who push
the envelope of performance beyond what was thought possible come
under suspicion automtically. Drug rumors dog them. Innuendo tails
them. The feat police give chase.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration of achievement _ the essence of sports _ now
finds itself on trial. In sport's kangaroo court, record-setters
are considered guilty even after their drug tests prove their
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   We're taking up de Bruijn's case in the name of Studio City's
Lenny Krayzelburg and Thousand Oaks' Marion Jones and all the
countless kids out there aspiring to athletic greatness. Because if
somebody doesn't come to de Bruijn's defense today, the cynics will
wrest sports from the dreamers tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   We tracked de Bruijn down in a hotel in Portland, Ore. Almost
two months have passed since the most amazing of her swims _ a
stunning clocking of 56.69 in the 100-meter butterfly, a 1.19
second improvement over American Jenny Thompson's year-old world
record.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old is living out of a suitcase, far from her family
and friends in Rotterdam, battling homesickness the 19 hours of the
day when she isn't tearing down her muscles and building them back
up under the watchful eye of coach Paul Bergen.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen is the reason de Bruijn is still swimming. Serendipity
brought her to him in September of 1997. She followed him from
Virginia to Oregon in late 1998 when he took the head-coaching job
at Tualatin Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really lucky I met coach Bergen,'' de Bruijn said. ``I put
so much confidence in what he says. I've never trained harder in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   De Bruijn didn't know it at first, but in the late 1970s, Bergen
oversaw the development of Joan Pennington, a onetime
American-record holder in the 100-meter butterfly, and Tracy
Caulkins, a 48-time national champion, a four-time world-record
holder and arguably the most outstanding female swimmer of any era.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen is a wonderful stroke technician and an unapologetic
taskmaster. He calls de Bruijn ``the most explosive female I've
ever coached.'' He marvels at her 26-inch vertical jump and admires
her elegant armstrokes, though that hasn't stopped him from
tinkering with her technique the past few months in an effort to
maximize her power and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen's disciplined, didactic approach counteracted perfectly
the driftlessness de Bruijn, a regular on the European swimming
scene, had started to feel as the 1996 Olympics drew near.
</P>
<P>
   She pulled out of the competition in Atlanta after being named
to the Dutch team because ``I hadn't been motivated to train,'' she
said. ``I wasn't getting myself to the pool. I felt like it wasn't
worth it to me to go because I wasn't that focused. I didn't want
to embarrass my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the fact, the feat police have assigned more
sinister motives to her withdrawal. They have conjectured that a
fear of testing positive for steroids is what kept de Bruijn away.
</P>
<P>
   De Bruijn, who has never failed a drug test, also has heard the
rumors that her brother is the husband of 1996 triple Olympic gold
medalist Michele Smith, who later tested positive for
androstenedione and was banned from swimming for allegedly
tampering with a drug sample.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is no relation. De Bruijn does have a brother of
some interest to the aquatics community; he is a water polo player
on the Dutch Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   De Bruijn would be less than truthful if she said she wasn't
bothered by the personal attacks. She finds it curious that
American sprinters Thompson, 28, and Dara Torres, 33, recently have
set U.S. records in the 100 and 50 freestyles, respectively,
without drawing so much as a ripple of suspicion from the feat
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., people think everything their champions do is
awesome,'' de Bruijn said. ``They give their champions nicknames
like `Madame Butterfly.' I think it's maybe because I'm not from
the U.S. that there is this suspicion. I don't know if it's
jealousy or what. I think it's pretty sad.''
</P>
<P>
   De Bruijn said that when Thompson shaved .05-second off Mary T.
Meagher's 18-year-old world record in the 100 butterfly last year,
de Bruijn saw a clear blue sky where before there had been a
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That record looked so far away to me,'' de Bruijn said.
``Jenny Thompson really made a big change in swimming when she
broke it. It made me think, 'Wow, if she can break it, maybe I can
break it, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson planted the seed, de Bruijn bloomed and now the feat
police are trying to chop her down. That's what passes for sports
these days. &QL;

STEALING NOT A CRIME _ HONEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imagine the conversation with Jimmy Sheckard, if
Sheckard were alive and not rolling over in his grave because of
the sad state of the Los Angeles Dodgers' running game.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy, how many bases would you steal if you were playing today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard to say a number. But I'd lead the Dodgers in steals,
that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd only lead the Dodgers? Not the whole National League?
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the Dodgers. Hey, I'm 121 years old!''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Sheckard was a 67-base stealer at the turn of the LAST
century, a little Brooklyn outfielder who dueled with Honus Wagner
and Frank Chance for the league lead. The Dodgers' long tradition
of footspeed and daring began with him.
</P>
<P>
   It continued with Pete Reiser, Arky Vaughan, Jackie Robinson and
Pee Wee Reese. It peaked with Maury Wills, Davey Lopes and Steve
Sax. It lived on in Eric Young and Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   It has died with the 2000 Dodgers. The numbers say they couldn't
steal a base if you gave them a ski mask and a getaway limo.
</P>
<P>
   The six Dodgers who have batted leadoff this season have stolen
13 bases, total. That's how many Wills swiped in a week. The rest
of the Dodgers have stolen 36.
</P>
<P>
   The team ranks 13th in its 16-team league in steals. It's on its
slowest pace since the 1989 team that had just said goodbye to Sax
and lost Kirk Gibson for most of the year with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Two things the Dodgers could always do, decade after decade, it
seemed. They could pitch. And they could run.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of their pitching has been beaten to death. What of
their running?
</P>
<P>
   Last season they were second in the major leagues with 167
steals. Davey Johnson, reared in the pitching-and-three-run-homers
philosophy of Earl Weaver, forced himself to manage more
aggressively than usual, seeing the need to manufacture runs.
</P>
<P>
   Then Young (51 steals) was traded to the Chicago Cubs and Raul
Mondesi (36) was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays. Then Devon White
(19) went on the disabled list in May.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has gone back to waiting for the three-run homer. And
while Gary Sheffield and Eric Karros have made that strategy look
good so far, you wonder if it's the answer for a team that plays
half its games at Dodger Stadium, never before a home run hitters'
park.
</P>
<P>
   As on many topics, you can find different thinking on this in
the Dodgers braintrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think bases are stolen to give yourself an advantage. Just
to steal to be stealing doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me,''
said Jim Tracy, the coach who is managing the team while Johnson is
hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat. ``I think it (depends on)
the type of ballclub you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Malone, the general manager, knew he was giving up speed
when he traded away Young (to improve the defense) and Mondesi (to
improve the clubhouse atmosphere). But Malone didn't envision the
collection of statues that takes the field these days in the
uniform of Robinson, Wills and Lopes. Only Shawn Green (15 steals),
Todd Hollandsworth (9) and Mark Grudzielanek (8) are on pace to
match their 1999 totals.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, a one-time 25-steals man, got his second during the
Dodgers' 8-6 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a matter of philosophy,'' Malone said this week.
``Davey and I talk about it a lot. Davey doesn't want to give away
outs (risking having runners thrown out). That's Davey's
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers are 21-11 when they steal at least one base, 7-6
when they attempt at least one steal but fail, and only 19-28 when
they don't attempt a steal. They're averaging nearly 7 runs a game
when they steal, only 4 when they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Their record when they steal is better than their record when
they homer (39-27).
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that they seem to be looking for opportunities
to run.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the Dodgers led the Pirates 5-3 with two out in
the bottom of the seventh inning. Adrian Beltre and Chad Kreuter
singled to bring up Kevin Elster. Tracy said later that he had left
the decision whether to steal up to Beltre. The interim manager was
willing to risk an out that would take the bat out of Elster's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre broke for third, and Pirates reliever Marc Wilkins, in
his haste to get the ball to the plate, bounced it for a wild pitch
that got Kreuter to second. After Elster walked, Jim Leyritz
singled home Beltre and Kreuter for runs that turned out to matter
in a 9-6 Dodgers victory.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's steal was the kind of aggressive move the Dodgers have
made too rarely this season, one of those ``little things'' they
keep talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see more of that in the second half. I think
we're just going to do everything we can to win ballgames,'' Malone
said.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, in case they've forgotten, it is possible to hit a
lot of home runs and steal a lot of bases in the same season. Jimmy
Sheckard led the league in both, but that was 97 years ago. These
days the Dodgers might not be able to sign him, so trade him to
Florida instead. &QL;

DODGERS CAN'T SEE THE LIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By the time you read this, Mike Judd will be gone,
back to Albuquerque after getting scorched Tuesday afternoon in the
big-league sun.
</P>
<P>
   His one-day Los Angeles Dodgers teammates, however, are still
here, left wondering where the momentum went in an 8-6 loss to the
Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   They had won the first two games of the series to move into
third place and had extended the Pirates' losing streak to six. But
Jeff Shaw isn't the only one who has had trouble closing out teams
this season. The Dodgers haven't swept a three-game series since
May 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we didn't sweep,'' acting manager Jim Tracy said. ``But we
did take two of three. I'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodger Stadium crowd of 34,872 had trouble buying four
errors, which could have been five when Gary Sheffield lost John
Vander Wal's eighth-inning liner in the sun. Vander Wal was
credited with a double, but the boos told a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who has become one of the team's most popular
players, leads the majors with 32 homers, but he got an earful,
too, just like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who are only 22-22 at home, loaded the bases in the
seventh but didn't score. The eighth might have been even more
painful after reserve catcher Paul LoDuca opened with a single. The
Dodgers had the heart of their order coming up, but Sheffield,
Shawn Green and Eric Karros couldn't get LoDuca past first.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had a built-in excuse of having to turn to a minor-
leaguer to fill the spot of suspended Carlos Perez, who despite his
own problems this year has an ERA under three in his last five
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Judd, who has failed in brief callups the previous two years,
impressed pitching coach Claude Osteen warming up in the bullpen.
That all changed when Judd walked Warren Morris to open the first,
then hit Jason Kendall and gave up a three-run homer to Wil
Cordero. The Pirates added two more in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a good arm, I don't know how long it is going to take
to get over this hump and have a little more confidence in
himself,'' Osteen said. ``A couple of times Paul came back to the
bench after an inning and said, `When he gets ahead of the hitters,
they aren't hitting him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Judd might get bailed out when the Dodgers scored
six runs in the third.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. The Pirates went back on top in the fifth when
Morris walked and Kendall homered to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home runs happen,'' Tracy said. ``The problem is putting guys
on base before the home runs. That's what put us in a hole. At one
time they had seven runs on four hits. There's the answer to this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca, who caught Judd in the minors, said the early runs shook
the pitcher's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that he wanted to do well and maybe he put too much
pressure on himself,'' LoDuca said. ``But this guy is going to win
some games in the big leagues. He has too good a stuff not to.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the team, which opens a two-game
series tonight against Colorado, the team that took back third
place Tuesday by routing Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had two six-run innings in this series. The first
led to a victory Sunday night, but Tuesday's only brought more
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who has been battling a slump the past month, had a
two-run double off Pirates starter Todd Ritchie. Green just made
contact on a 1-2 breaking ball to stay alive, then drove the next
pitch, sailing it over Vander Wal's head in right.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the inning, Karros had a two-run single and shortstop
Kevin Elster gave the Dodgers a 6-5 lead with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   It was Green, though, who made Tracy smile. After an exciting
first two months with the team, Green has gone into a tailspin.
Earlier this month he had an 0-for-17 slump and entered Tuesday's
game just 3 for 20 on the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   But he had a game-tying RBI single against the Angels last week
in an extra-inning, come-from-behind victory. Monday night, he had
a triple. And even though he was thrown out attempting an
inside-the-park homer, the crowd gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be there for us,'' Tracy said. ``It doesn't happen
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Or in the afternoon sun.

 Big Tobacco a victim of big injustice  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ The $145 billion punitive-damage award against
cigarette makers exposes tort law for the fraud it has become.
</P>
<P>
   This case is, pure and simple, a grotesque example of legal
immorality. It represents a legal lynching.
</P>
<P>
   A Philip Morris executive defined the crux of the problem by
noting that those making ``informed choices about smoking should
not be rewarded for choosing to smoke.'' Speaking on behalf of
former smokers unwilling to be a party to legal larceny, I think
he's absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind this shameful perversion of tort law is
the big lie holding that manufacturers misled smokers concerning
smoking's health risks. Many of those seeking to get into Big
Tobacco's deep pockets may have told themselves this lie so often
that they actually believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ills tobacco causes, its bad ends cannot justify the
legal looting of the tobacco industry. Big Tobacco is in the very
legal business of producing something demanded by hundreds of
millions of people throughout the world. Despite this, it is denied
the basic constitutional protections afforded even the most heinous
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, anyone who has ever smoked has been reminded
constantly that ``coffin nails'' and ``cancer sticks'' may be
terminally bad for them. My paternal grandfather, a heavy smoker
who died at 75 in 1950, tried to warn me off cigarettes many times
with the admonition, ``Jerry, these things will kill you.'' His
frequent coughing-wheezing fits underscored his message.
</P>
<P>
   Granddad's warnings were ignored, because although smokers know
the risk, they decide the trade-off of enjoyment provided by
tobacco is acceptable. Nearly all, it's safe to say, do so thinking
they are bulletproof.
</P>
<P>
   As if this weakness wasn't bad enough, Americans rejected the
concept of personal responsibility for their actions. Once enough
of the population could agree that nothing was ever the fault of
the individual, the tobacco companies became ripe for the
demonization that would justify their looting.
</P>
<P>
   The winning lawyer announced piously at a victory news
conference that ``this isn't about money,'' but this is precisely
what it's about. It's not about justice or righteousness. It's
about money.
</P>
<P>
   Only money's lure could cause smokers to accept the
rationalization that tobacco causes all their maladies. The human
body is a complex mechanism. Some people smoke their entire lives
without resulting disease or debilitation. Some live lives of
abstinence and still die of ailments routinely associated with
tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the legal system has been perverted to the point
of pretending not only that virtually all smokers suffer
afflictions caused exclusively by tobacco use, but also that all
these plaintiffs are blameless victims in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Society, meanwhile, pretends the money comes from the ``evil''
tobacco companies. In fact, the industry is merely a transfer agent
for its customers, who are paying more and more for their smokes.
</P>
<P>
   So, as long as we're so eager to abuse the legal system in
pursuit of ill-gotten gain, here's a new wrinkle to consider: Why
shouldn't smokers sue those involved in tobacco lawsuits for the
economic damage suffered by skyrocketing cigarette prices?

 American Century Investments invests in Euronet Services  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ The venture capital arm of American Century
Investments has invested $6 million in Leawood-based Euronet
Services Inc. through a private purchase of Euronet stock, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Euronet operates a network of automated teller machines, mostly
in Europe. Euronet, which is publicly owned, sold a 4.9 percent
stake to American Century Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Henry, co-founder and chief operating officer of Euronet,
said the company didn't need to raise the cash but valued the
strategic link to American Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategic value of their investment far outweighed the
dollar value of their investment,'' Henry said. ``We were not in a
desperate need for that cash.''
</P>
<P>
   American Century, the Kansas City-based mutual fund company,
created American Century Ventures earlier this year. Its mission is
not merely to make financial bets. It invests in companies in which
American Century sees a strategic gain, such as using and helping
to further develop those companies' products or services.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Mulcahy, vice president of American Century Ventures, said
the company is interested in Euronet's global distribution in
financial services and particularly its wireless applications.
</P>
<P>
   Euronet's ATM network offers transactions beyond cash
withdrawals, transfers and account balances. It also recently
introduced Arrowz Wireless Banking, which allows customers to
access banking information with their mobile phones, and Arrowz
Event Messaging.
</P>
<P>
   American Century Ventures has made 10 such investments,
including one in RecordsCenter.com, which is based in Kansas City.

 Everest Connections to begin area cable construction today  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANAS CITY _ Everest Connections Inc. today will begin building
its fiberoptic network to provide cable TV, local and long-distance
telephone service, and high-speed Internet connections in the
Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   The company said construction of the network will begin today in
Lenexa and expand to Kansas City next month. An Everest executive
said it should have its first Lenexa subscribers by October and its
first Kansas City customers by November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beginning construction is a milestone for us,'' said Steve
Gaul, Everest's general manager for the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Construction comes three months after Everest announced that the
Kansas City area would be its first market. Subsequently, the
company has decided to also enter the Minneapolis and Tulsa, Okla.,
markets. UtiliCorp United Inc., the international utility and
energy trading company based in Kansas City, is an Everest partner.
</P>
<P>
   The start of construction for Everest is another indication that
the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is beginning to bear fruit. The
federal law made it easier for competitors to enter the business
against such companies as Southwestern Bell and Time Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Anderson, vice president of UtiliCorp Communication
Services, a UtiliCorp subsidiary, said Everest and another
UtiliCorp affiliate eventually will give consumers in much of
western Missouri a choice of cable TV services and a wider choice
in telecommunications and high-speed Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Everest has not released prices for its services but has said
they will be competitive and save customers of its full package 20
percent to 30 percent compared with today's prices for such
services.
</P>
<P>
   Another company _ Digital Access Inc. _ has similar plans to
offer a bundle of cable TV and telecommunications services to
Kansas City area consumers. But Digital Access executives have
scaled back the company's original plans to serve the entire area
because, they have said, it's not profitable for two companies to
build networks in the same neighborhoods and seek the same
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it will concentrate initially on Johnson County. A
Digital Access spokesman said Tuesday that no date has been set to
begin construction but that it is continuing with its plans _
including building in Lenexa.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, Lenexa is still a go,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Everest and Digital Access have received franchise agreements to
offer telecommunications in Lenexa, which has a separate
application process for cable TV. Everest so far has a franchise
agreement to offer cable TV and telecommunications in Kansas City
and cable TV in Mission.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have other franchises pending. Everest is seeking
agreements in Kansas City, Kan.; Leawood; Olathe; Merriam; Mission
Hills; Overland Park; Prairie Village; Shawnee; Westwood; Blue
Springs; Grandview; Independence; Lee's Summit; and Raytown.
</P>
<P>
   The Mid-America Regional Council has been working with area
cities to standardize franchise agreements. That work should be
done by mid-August and is expected to speed the issuing of
franchise agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Katerndahl, a manager for the council, said one issue that
had emerged was whether companies should build extra underground
conduit and sell the additional space to other companies who want
to enter the market. Such a provision in a franchise agreement
would limit disruptions on area streets caused by construction.
</P>
<P>
   Above ground, some utility poles have no more room to string
cable. In those cases, bigger poles would have to be installed, and
some cities have concerns about their appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are issues, but I don't think there are big obstacles
here,'' Katerndahl said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaul, of Everest, estimates it will take eight months to wire
Lenexa. As customers are wired, they will be offered the full
bundle of cable TV, telecommunications and Internet services.
Construction should begin in Mission late this year or in early
2001.
</P>
<P>
   It will take up to three years to complete work in Kansas City.
Construction will begin in southern and midtown Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Everest's area network will have 11,000 miles of cable and take
three to five years to complete. Plans call for Lawrence and
Leavenworth to be included, he said.
</P>
<P>
   UtiliCorp is also a partner in Kearney's ExOp. ExOp offers cable
TV, telephone and Internet service in Kearney and is building a
system in Platte City. ExOp will be building systems in other towns
with populations of less than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Everest has bought a building at 9669 Lackman Road in Lenexa,
which will house the company's primary telecommunications and cable
TV equipment. It's from that location that construction starts
today. The building has 20,000 square feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   It also has leased 12,000 square feet of administrative office
space at 4740 Grand Ave. in Kansas City. Those offices will be
filled in the fall. In the meantime, it will have a temporary
office in the same building beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Everest, which is based in St. Louis, will have 60 to 70 area
employees by the end of the year and eventually 300 employees.
Those figures don't include people building the network.
</P>
<P>
   Par Electrical Contractors Inc. will be building the network.
Construction will start slowly but will eventually employ 500 to
750 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about this,'' said John Wilson, president of
Par.

 Police introduce program to eliminate racial profiling  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Under the white glare of public scrutiny, police
chiefs in Johnson County's two largest cities stepped into the
bright lights of a news conference Tuesday and made a frank
admission: We're human.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we are all human with human frailties, perceptions,
experiences, which set the stage for the possibility of biased
decision-making,'' Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglass and Olathe Police Chief Art Mabry, as well as a host of
watchdog organizations, formally introduced Operation Vanguard to
the public on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under way since July 1, Operation Vanguard is designed to root
out race-biased decisions made by individual police officers who
unfairly single out minority motorists. It also provides training
to challenge officers to dispel old-school police tactics that
trade on stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to our communities and the people who live, work and
travel through them to do everything we can to ensure that their
contacts with the police are fair, equitable and appropriate,''
Douglass said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 17 days of data collection, 530 Vanguard reports
have been filed in Olathe: about 30 a day, 10 per shift.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry says he'll use the data to spot behavior trends and the
potential need to step up cultural sensitivity training. So far, he
says, nothing in the data alarms him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very confident that our officers do not deliberately
racially profile,'' Mabry said. ``But if somebody was to ask me to
statistically prove that, I have nothing tangible to lay my hands
on. The data will answer these questions, one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Data will be reviewed periodically, perhaps once a month, and
shared with other police departments through the Johnson County
Police Chiefs' and Sheriff Association, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That group met Tuesday and issued a news release supporting
race-profiling studies. The release said law enforcement officials
have an ethical and moral responsibility to ensure ``consistent
treatment to every member of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Operation Vanguard news conference, Henry Gueary III,
president of the Olathe chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said: ``We hope this serves as a
wake-up call to the issue of racial profiling. Our feeling is there
is nothing to fear because eventually (data collection) will be
required by law.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gueary's office logged 38 complaints of racial
profiling. This year 16 reports have been called in to the Olathe
chapter, with the summer peak season half-complete.

 Foundations commit money to `giant steps' for KC area  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY _ Kansas City's two largest
foundations announced a dual commitment Tuesday of at least $150
million toward areawide development and beautification ideas known
as the ``10 Giant Steps,'' which were unveiled during Kansas City's
150th birthday last month.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The steps range from specific projects, such as creating ``the
world's largest river fountain'' and developing a network of
bicycle trails, to more general subjects, such as improving
life-sciences research and upgrading cultural facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the
Hall Family Foundation represents the first funding commitments for
the 10 ideas. The foundations' contributions will not be in
addition to the millions of dollars they already give out. Rather,
Tuesday's announcement means that part of the Kauffman and Hall
foundations' annual spending will be more tailored toward the 10
steps' projects and subjects.
</P>
<P>
   There's no sense yet, however, of which initiatives will get
done first.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, this is underlining our existing commitment to the
community and tying it to the KC150 work,'' said Dave Lady, the
Kauffman Foundation's senior vice president and chief financial
officer. ``It's broader than one grant. It's more of a focus
area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kauffman Foundation, created from the wealth of
pharmaceutical entrepreneur Ewing M. Kauffman, concentrates on such
issues as education and youths. It intends to focus on two giant
steps that correspond to those issues _ early-childhood care and
life-sciences research.
</P>
<P>
   Early-childhood care is a longstanding issue in Kansas City,
with government agencies and civic task forces repeatedly calling
for more day-care programs and better-paid caretakers. The
life-sciences initiative is an attempt to build upon the creation
of the Stowers Institute for Medical Research, scheduled to open
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, both the Kauffman and Hall foundations already are
linked in raising funds for a $300 million, dual-stage downtown
performing-arts center, which fits into one of the 10 initiatives,
upgrading cultural facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall Family Foundation's further commitment is more open to
any of the 10 steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think each one of the steps has merit and each one needs to
be explored,'' said Bill Hall, president of the Hall Family
Foundation. ``We're not discounting any of the ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall foundation, created from the family of Hallmark Cards
founder Joyce Hall, has made sizable gifts to such civic endeavors
as the renovation of Union Station and the expansion of Children's
Mercy Hospital. It also routinely gives to neighborhood-improvement
ventures and fund-raising campaigns for fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hall indicated the foundation probably could be counted on
to favor the river fountain and the step aimed at ``livability
standards'' for such things as reducing crime and cleaning up
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some new ideas that we would not undertake except
for the fact that they came out of the giant steps,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two foundations gave out roughly $75 million last
year. By comparison, their commitment to the 10 steps works out to
$75 million for each foundation. But Hall and Lady additionally
said that each foundation probably would spend more on the ideas
during the next decade; the announced $150 million figure merely
corresponded to KC150.
</P>
<P>
   The giant steps themselves _ besides a fountain, bike trails,
cultural facilities, early-childhood care, life sciences and
neighborhood ``livability standards'' _ also included: painting
bridges over rivers in different colors, putting up colorful
welcome signs at the region's main entry points, creating a school
curriculum on local history, and promoting the region's image as a
family vacation destination.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these steps are being worked on already, such as bike
trails. Others are high on other civic agendas, such as
life-sciences research with the Civic Council of top local
executives. And some are traditionally the work of government, such
as painting bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The steps were conceived by a group of civic leaders involved in
Kansas City's 150th birthday celebration. The group was led by
Arthur S. Brisbane, publisher of /{The Kansas City Star/}; Michael
Carter, chairman of Carter Broadcast Group; and Carol Marinovich,
mayor of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas
City, Kan. However, the group left no blueprint for how its 10
steps should be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   With the foundations now committing their funds, Brisbane said
the leaders would ``regroup'' and serve as a ``catalyst'' for the
10 steps. The intention is to get other community agencies behind
the effort, then track progress of the steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy and enthusiasm with which these ideas were brought
forward is exciting,'' Hall said in a statement accompanying
Tuesday's announcement. ``We look forward to working with a variety
of community groups and organizations to translate some of these
ideas into reality and to continue to make our community a more
vibrant place to live and work.''

GRUDZIELANEK SHAKY BUT EXPECTED TO START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek has gained back two pounds from the 10 he lost while
missing more than a week with a viral infection. But the true test
of his condition comes tonight when he returns to the starting
lineup against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek is trying to find his legs after striking out all
three times he batted during the series with the Pittsburgh
Pirates. He has said he will need five more days to be 100 percent,
but progress remains slow.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's 8-6 loss, Grudzielanek came up with the bases
loaded in the seventh and two outs and took a called third strike
from left-hander Jason Christiansen to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, he told the club he could hit but was still rocky
and had to be reminded by the home-plate umpire when he struck out
in the seventh. He remained in the game at second and also fanned
during the Dodgers' six-run eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he stranded six base runners in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is getting better, but it is still going to take some
time,'' said Jim Tracy, who managed his third game in place of
ailing Davey Johnson. ``This thing really has taken a lot out of
him and there is no rushing him back too quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who batted .326 in 123 games last year as the
team's shortstop, came into Tuesday's game hitting .301 with five
homers and 31 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   __ More Davey: Johnson remained in the hospital for a third day,
undergoing tests for an irregular heartbeat. ``I talked to him last
night and he sounded pretty good,'' Tracy said. ``He was in good
spirits, but you could tell how much he wants to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is expected to return to the club before the end of the
home stand, which runs through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Spring-training update: The Vero Beach, Fla., City Council
and Indian River County Commission will meet Monday to consider a
memo detailing a $19 million public buyout that would keep the
Dodgers training there for at least 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is only designed to outline where the money will be
spent and does not seal the deal in favor of Vero Beach. The club
still is considering an offer from Las Vegas, which is putting
together plans for a spring complex that will accommodate six
major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers hope to have a decision by September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just a process document and doesn't get us any closer to
getting the deal done,'' Dodgers vice president Derrick Hall said.
``These are just broad-range parameters that have been agreed upon
with all of the fine detail still needing to be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The money will be spent to renovate Holman Stadium, surrounding
practice fields and locker rooms. Among the issues under review are
details about parking and concession revenue.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Dodgers reliever Antonio Osuna took over for
starter Mike Judd and pitched a season-high three innings. Osuna
allowed two hits and an unearned run. . . . The Dodgers scored 22
runs in the series, the most by the team in a three-game set since
May 19-21 when they swept the Florida Marlins. . . . Pittsburgh
starter Todd Ritchie, who won a club-high 15 games last season, did
not get out of the third inning Tuesday, allowing nine hits and six
runs. . . . Former Dodgers reliever Roger McDowell (1991-94) was a
clubhouse visitor before the game.

 HOUSE PASSES RESTRAINTS ON JUNK E-MAIL  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to shrink the rising heaps of unwanted
clutter in everyone's electronic in boxes, the House almost
unanimously approved legislation Tuesday to crack down on
unsolicited commercial e-mail known as spam.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed 427 to 1, would help halt repeated
electronic solicitations from advertisers, permitting consumers and
Internet service providers (ISPs) to sue advertisers for as much as
$500 per unwanted e-mail, up to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Courts could triple that amount in certain cases and award
attorneys fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most annoying thing about the Internet is junk e-mail,''
said Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., who sponsored the bill. The
Constitution, she said, ``guarantees a right to commercial free
speech, but there is no right to force us to listen to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The single ``no'' vote was cast by Ron Paul, a Texas Republican
with strong libertarian leanings. A similar bill is under
consideration in the Senate, but has not moved out of committee
despite broad bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   The popular spam crackdown is part of a continuing drive in
Congress to write rules for the Internet _ an effort that spans
everything from attempts to ban Internet gambling to sorting out
such hugely complicated and controversial issues as digital
copyrights and access to high-speed ``broadband'' communication
networks.
</P>
<P>
   But even on an issue as seemingly simple as banning spam,
lawmakers found themselves trying to sidestep a thicket of basic
conflicts _ in this case between privacy and free speech _ that
have complicated Washington's efforts to update the nation's legal
infrastructure for the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   While the spam crackdown passed nearly without dissent, the
measure took more than a year to draft after earlier versions
brought complaints from free-speech advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was about the 50th draft,'' said Wilson spokesman Kevin
McDermott. ``It went through a lot of reworking to get to a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ban spam outright, lawmakers were careful to draw a
narrow bill that essentially allows consumers to simply ``opt out''
of further solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhat to my surprise, given all the not-very-good laws I've
seen, this one seems pretty solid,'' said Eugene Volokh, a law
professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who
specializes in cyberspace issues and free speech. ``It's suitably
narrow. It merely requires that the sender provide an opt out.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires advertisers to include a valid return address
in all commercial e-mails and prohibits further transmission after
a recipient objects.
</P>
<P>
   Senders must label all advertisements ``in a manner that is
clear and conspicuous'' and clearly provide a method for recipients
to refuse any further solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson cited estimates saying that more than a third of
unsolicited commercial e-mails are pornography. And at
congressional hearings, Federal Trade Commission official Eileen
Harrington testified that spam is rife with false information and
extravagant claims, calling spam the ``fraud artists' calling card
on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill could prove a boon to ISPs, which said that spam
campaigns can overwhelm their systems and slow service, costing
them $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would permit ISPs to prohibit anyone from using
their systems to send unsolicited commercial e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the nation's largest ISP, estimates that up to
30 percent of its traffic coming from outside its system consists
of spam.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson cited a small ISP in her state of New Mexico,
Albuquerque-based Associated Information Services, which complained
of being inundated with anywhere from 400,000 to 2 million junk
e-mails a day, clogging traffic and in some cases causing system
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Steven Fox told Wilson his business is being
``spam-bombed,'' causing delays in client e-mails and preventing
some from even connecting to the service.
</P>
<P>
   If an ISP is working with spammers _ say by collecting a fee
from advertisers who send spam _ the measure would require the
provider to give its subscribers the option of not receiving such
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Like other legislation that gives ISPs a safe harbor from
litigation over activity that takes place on their systems, the
bill would protect ISPs from any spam lawsuits involving their
networks.
</P>
<P>
   The bill stopped short of a ban on spam to avoid trampling on
commercial free-speech rights and to protect consumers who do want
to receive unsolicited commercial e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers nixed earlier ideas for a central government
clearinghouse where consumers could register to prevent unsolicited
mail _ seen as a potentially dangerous depository of information
that could be misused by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not apply to all unsolicited commercial messages,
which taken literally could include sending job resumes to
employers or asking friends if they are interested in buying a used
car.
</P>
<P>
   The measure resembles earlier laws aimed at mitigating the
unwanted side effects of older technologies, from automated
telemarketing calls to junk faxes. Volokh said the bill follows
Supreme Court precedent that allows Congress to limit commercial
solicitations on the grounds that there exists ``no right to press
even good ideas on an unwilling listener.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would pre-empt 16 state anti-spam laws, including
California's, which has been challenged in court as a violation of
the Constitution's protection of the free flow of interstate
commerce.

 SENATE PASSES GOP TAX CUT FOR COUPLES  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved a measure Tuesday to cut taxes
for married couples by $248 billion over the next 10 years, setting
up an election year showdown with President Clinton over how to
spend the growing budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Triumphant Republicans heralded the 61-to-38 vote as a step
toward eliminating the much-maligned ``marriage penalty,'' a quirk
in the tax code that causes many married couples to pay more in
taxes than they would if they remained single.
</P>
<P>
   Warning Clinton that Democrats will pay a political price if he
makes good on his veto threat, GOP leaders pushed through the bill
in time for it to be on the president's desk before the Republican
National Convention later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill goes far beyond providing relief for
couples who pay a marriage penalty and accused Republicans of
trying to reward their wealthiest supporters. They noted that
billions of dollars in relief also would be directed to those who
currently enjoy a tax benefit from marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will veto the bill, unless Republicans agree to
a $250 billion companion measure to provide prescription drug
coverage to Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``By itself, I will veto this bill,'' Clinton said in a
statement from Camp David. ``The marriage penalty bill put forth by
the majority in Congress is one part of a fiscally irresponsible,
poorly targeted and regressive tax plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote came less than a week after the Senate approved a
measure eliminating the estate tax over the next 10 years. Later
this week, the House of Representatives is expected to pass
legislation expanding tax breaks for contributions to retirement
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the tax cuts represent a cornerstone of the GOP's
election year strategy to return a sizable portion of the federal
budget surplus to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office released new figures Tuesday
that estimate the budget surplus will be $2.17 trillion over the
next 10 years, up from the $838 billion estimate in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these families have contributed to the record surplus
that we have in Washington,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the
Finance Committee chairman. ``They deserve to get some of it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, Republicans hope to convince voters that
Democratic intransigence is all that is standing in the way of
meaningful tax cuts. Within hours of the Senate's vote, 10
Republican governors distributed statements applauding the
legislation and calling on Clinton to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, including Clinton, have advocated smaller, targeted
tax cuts and called for using the bulk of the surplus to pay down
the debt and expand social programs. Democrats have been more
receptive to tax cuts as estimates of the surplus rise.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Democrats joined 53 Republicans in supporting the marriage
tax measure, including California Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if Congress only passes into law one piece of
tax reform legislation this year, it should be the marriage penalty
relief,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also supported a more limited Democratic tax cut
proposal that failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providing marriage penalty relief is a matter of common sense,
fairness and decency,'' Feinstein said. ``Couples should not be
penalized by the tax code simply because they are married.''
</P>
<P>
   California Sen. Barbara Boxer voted against the GOP measure,
while supporting a Democratic alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``marriage penalty'' arises, among other reasons,
because of the combined income of two wage earners pushing a couple
into a higher tax bracket. Republicans estimate about 25 million
couples pay more income tax than they would if they were single,
averaging about $1,400 in ``marriage penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some glaring, unfair provisions in the tax code, and
this is one of the most offensive,'' said Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would address the problem by boosting a couple's
standard income tax deduction so it is equal to double that of a
single taxpayer. In 2000 dollars, that would be an increase from
$7,350 to $8,800. The bill also would expand the 15 percent and 28
percent income tax brackets and make changes in the earned income
tax credit for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the changes go far beyond alleviating the tax
burden on married couples, amounting to a giveaway to the wealthy.
Combined with the GOP plan to eliminate the estate tax, Democrats
said 43 percent of the cuts would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., called the
Republican plan ``another reckless tax scheme that favors the
wealthiest Americans and leaves little money for the issues that
Americans care most about.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats offered an alternative that would allow married
couples to choose to file together or separately, whichever was in
their financial interest. Democrats said their plan would wipe out
the ``marriage penalty'' for all couples earning less than
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than costing $248 billion over 10 years, Democrats said
their measure would have cost $54 billion. The Senate defeated the
measure by a 50-to-46 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate must reconcile its bill with a House version passed
last week. The House version is approximately $70 billion smaller.
Congressional leaders are expected to send a final version of the
bill to the White House this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict right now the president will sign this bill,'' Lott
said, ignoring Cliton's veto threat, ``because it will be very hard
to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be clear, very clear, Mr. President. Are you
for eliminating the marriage penalty tax or not?''

 LAST ROYAL SERVES BRITAIN WITH CLASS  &HT;     By LEAH GARCHIK 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In merry modern-day England, where a notable number of Windsors
have been caught with knickers down or hands out, Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth the Queen Mother is the human tea cosy of the family:
pleasant, plump, predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unwieldy formality of her official two-queen title _
chosen specifically by her when her daughter became Queen Elizabeth
II _ the 99-year-old Queen Mum seems to relish being Britain's most
cuddly royal, never varying from the twinkly-eyed grandmotherly
image so carefully crafted over the years. Before she celebrates
her real 100th birthday on August 4, Wednesday's official pageant
in London will allow her family, 12,000 invited guests and 7,000
participants (pilots flying by, a 1,000-person choir, scores of
marchers and drummers and float riders) to give official thanks to
the one in their midst who has never flagged in the greatest royal
duty of all: waving at the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   If her daughter sometimes shows more interest in corgis than
people, and her son-in-law flashes embarrassing bursts of temper
and racism, and the generation those two begat chases after sex and
commercial success in ways unthinkable in prior years, the Queen
Mother never slips. She is always there, in floral print or baby
blue or pearly pink with matching hat, nodding, smiling, pivoting
her forearm and flapping her palm from side to side in the
direction of the hoi polloi.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Royalty Personified
</P>
<P>
   Like Queen Victoria, who was on the throne the year the Queen
Mum was born, she knows her job, and she does it without griping.
She is the only royal to personify the value of royal reputation,
which as the new century begins, seems to be the only remaining
virtue of the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The Windsors can't make foreign policy, and they don't dare
venture opinions on social questions. They are there, simply, as
icons. And while the Queen Mum has served superbly as a sort of
human ornament, there are always people who think that figurines
are nothing but dust collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as the cries of anti-royalists have grown louder
in the United Kingdom, so have whispers about the old lady. She
never once opened a door, says iconoclast mischief-maker
Christopher Hitchens in Vanity Fair, nor pulled a curtain. But such
were the ways of aristocrats in the castle in Scotland in which
Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was raised.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MUM19 (61639 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  She was the spoiled child of the middle-aged Earl and Countess of
Strathmore, and her childhood nickname was ``Princess.'' She
rejected her future husband's first two proposals of marriage and
only acquiesced after it was clear she would be unable to attract
his older brother, who it seemed was the man who would be king.
</P>
<P>
   It's said she was a domineering wife. Most people thought
``Bertie,'' Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon's husband, was an introverted and
weak-willed milquetoast. But when his brother threw away the throne
for love and Bertie became King George VI, it was his strong wife
who bucked him up, insisted he take lessons to rid himself of a
speech impediment and gave him the strength to lead during wartime.
</P>
<P>
   There are critics who point out now that both Elizabeth and the
King were fans of Neville Chamberlain's policies of appeasement
toward Nazi Germany, but World War II was the setting for the
royals' finest hour. The Queen Mother permanently placed her
portrait in the nation's lockets when she risked her children and
herself by refusing to escape to safety and insisting on standing
her ground in London.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, she was accused of ruining the life of her
younger daughter, Princess Margaret, by thwarting Margaret's love
affair with Capt. Peter Townsend, a divorced man. Ironically, her
own husband had become king as a result of his brother's love for a
divorced woman. In public, her resentment of the Duke and Duchess
of Windsor never wavered (some said because she jealously believed
that the former king was more popular with the public than her
husband, who took the throne when he left). Her unforgiving
attitude toward the Duke may have caused her to be so hard on
Margaret, whose sanctioned marriage to Anthony Armstrong-Jones
ended in divorce, followed by much public profligacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some even blamed the Queen Mother for encouraging the unhappy
marriage of Diana and her grandson, Charles. Diana was the
granddaughter of the Queen's lady-in-waiting, Lady Fermoy, and it
was said the older royal saw herself reflected in the younger one.
</P>
<P>
   They both seemed eager to please, putting on shows of
flirtatious warmth and naivete. The public and crowds adored them.
But while the Queen Mother's husband was willing to bask in the
accolades accorded his beloved wife, Charles was jealous of his
wife's popularity. Although the Queen Mother's marriage held, and
Diana's didn't, both women made use of personal magnetism to hold
on to public affection long after their blue-blood husbands, by
death and divorce, were out of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MUM19 (61639 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Critics' ``accusations'' _ the Queen Mother likes the horses; she
likes more than the occasional slug of gin and tonic; she's partial
to jokes and candy and an army of aging gays she employs as
servants _ seem strangely Victorian. A hundred years ago, these
``perversions'' would have been scandalous; nowadays, her secret
fondnesses make her all the more lovable.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, as if she knows that she's the last of the
thoroughly adored Windsors, she hangs in there. She's very much
aware that she's the family member least splashed by the mud of
scandal and least criticized for failing to acknowledge real issues
of modern life. Everyone knows she's of another age; she's happy to
be there up on the balcony acknowledging the tributes.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the royals, she seems to have understood and accepted the
duties of the position, one of the few left in the world where
looking like you can do the job is the essence of performance.

 I'LL PASS ON THE MALIGNANT BURGER  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If I was a meat-eater (he wrote, smugly), I
would be tempted to peek under the bun and the pickle next time.
Looking for, you know, funny stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Federal food inspection authorities have ruled that it's safe to
eat animals with cancer, tumors and open sores. Mix 'n' match.
</P>
<P>
   Those defects will be classified as ``aesthetic problems.''
Please pass the pork chops and the Clearasil.
</P>
<P>
   I had a good chuckle over this news story with my next-door
neighbor, Upton Sinclair. OK, Upton is dead, but his 1906 book,
``The Jungle,'' was a muckraking expose of the American meatpacking
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair wouldn't bother to write that book today, because who
cares if the meat people are tossing floor-sweepin's into the
sausage? That's only the tip of the tumor. And it's all legal.
</P>
<P>
   The new ruling has to make the meat inspectors' job easier. What
meat could possibly be rejected?
</P>
<P>
   MOVING ON to less tasteful stuff:
</P>
<P>
   Famed screenwriter Joe Eszterhas has written a book, ``American
Rhapsody,'' released Tuesday, a fact-fiction stew about the
Clinton-Monica stuff.
</P>
<P>
   One character in the book is Willard, who is Bill Clinton's
manhood.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Drudge Report, there will be an audio
presentation of the book, and the voice of Willard will be comedian
Bill Maher.
</P>
<P>
   This from the Drudge Report: ``President Clinton has privately
expressed disappointment in Maher playing his penis, the senior
adviser said.''
</P>
<P>
   Which causes reader Gar Smith to wonder, ``Who did the president
want to play his penis? Sylvester Stallone? Arnold?''
</P>
<P>
   No, Schwarzenegger is a Republican; it's doubtful he would play
the role sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   BAD TASTE in every item today? That was not my intention, but
sometimes the best-laid plans of mice and men wind up as items
about men eating mice.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's New Yorker magazine was a fascinating article,
seriously, on the squirrel-brain eaters of rural Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The meat is sweet, but the brain is to die for. Literally, some
medical researchers fear.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; this  &LR; week's New Yorker, I swear: ``The Joy of Rats ...
South China Delicacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In next week's issue, I'm guessing: ``Cockroach crunch cookies:
High protein from low places.''
</P>
<P>
   I'M A NAZI. That's what Larry Ellison's Sausalito-based
motoryacht Izanami spells backwards.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get inatizi, Lizzy. Izanami is a mythological goddess,
one of two beings who created Japan. She wound up being stir-fried
to death in a volcano.
</P>
<P>
   More Larry boat stuff: The 192-foot-long Izanami isn't Ellison's
biggest boat. That would be his 234-foot Eco.
</P>
<P>
   When Ellison bought Eco, he turned one deck into a basketball
court. He also races yachts and plays guitar in his own blues band.
Ah, to be filthy rich and 15 forever.
</P>
<P>
   WE'LL EACH grab two legs and make a wish:
</P>
<P>
   From the Carmel Pine Cone's ``Police and Sheriff's Log'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Sky Ranch Road residents both claim ownership of the same
rottweiler.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a story worth watching. This could develop into the sequel
to Elian.
</P>
<P>
   FINEST NAME ever for a toy: Irritating Stick.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Irritating Stick is not an actual stick, but a video game.
It's based on a Japanese game show where contestants take a giant
electrical rod and maneuver it through a metal maze, trying to
avoid shock.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be confused with today's column theme: Irritating Shtick.
</P>
<P>
   YOU KNOW you're old when ... they tell you you're too old for an
old folks' home.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Schneider of Walnut Creek and a friend motored off
recently to check out a retirement home near Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist at the home informed Ethel and her friend that
there is a waiting list, and the home does not accept anyone unless
they can move in before their 85th birthday, ``and obviously you
two don't qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Durn, and it seems  &LR; seemed like such a warm-hearted place.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAILBAG: ``I always start at the back of the paper, skipping
most of the columnists except Miss Manners and Top of the Sixth,
and I look forward to your Forty-Nine Stories, or even that daily
goo you painfully dredge up.'' (Eleanor Peterson)

   THURMONT, Md. _ With an accord to end half a century of Mideast
bloodshed within his grasp, President Clinton scratched a scheduled
visit to Tokyo early Wednesday, throwing the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which extends the talks for 24 hours past their
Wednesday morning deadline, was announced at 12:30 a.m. (ET)
Wednesday, as Clinton pressed the talks toward the pre-dawn hours.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat still at odds over the core disputes dividing them,
Clinton felt that extending the negotiations for one more day
offered the best chance for a successful outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president regrets that he will have to delay his trip to
Japan for one day,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a
prepared statement issued from Camp David, five miles from this
Catoctin Mountain hamlet. ``The president will now travel Thursday
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was due in Tokyo Thursday afternoon for a bilateral
meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to leave Washington Thursday morning and go
directly to Okinawa _ the southernmost island in the Japanese
archipelago _ in time for the main event of his trip: the annual
summit of the leaders of the so-called Group of Eight democratic
powers.
</P>
<P>
   That gets him 24 hours of overtime to try to wrest a peace
treaty out of the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are centered on the core issues in the
52-year-old Palestinian-Israeli dispute. Those include the question
of Palestinian statehood, the future of Jerusalem, territory and
security, and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations intensified, Clinton met with Barak four times
between Monday night and 4:30 a.m. (ET) Tuesday. He caught a few
hours of sleep, then went into a one-hour meeting with Arafat
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton's mood has swung with the atmospherics
inside Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all of them, you go through various emotions ranging from
moments where you see promise to moments where the only thing you
see is frustration,'' said Lockhart. In a word, though, he
described Clinton as ``determined,'' to broker a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Arafat and Barak have run so high that U.S.
diplomats have kept them apart since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In eight days of talks, Arafat and Barak have held just two
direct, one-on-one meetings, the last of which was Saturday. Since
then, they've encountered each other only informally, at a meal,
for example, with others present and seated between them.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart stressed, though, that the lack of direct talks between
Barak and Arafat doesn't mean the negotiations have stalled. Much
can be done to narrow the gaps between them, said Lockhart, by
using Clinton as an intermediary and a buffer to preserve what
diplomatic goodwill still exists between the Israeli and
Palestinian sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 52 years of debate behind them, so the atmosphere at
times has been tense,'' Lockhart said. ``But they are still working
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lending the weight of his own schedule to the brinkmanship,
Lockhart told reporters late Tuesday ``this may be the last time''
for him to hold his twice-daily summit briefings.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed, though, that he had not yet packed his bags to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Washington, D.C.-based Arab American Institute
released the results of a nationwide poll Tuesday that showed a
majority of American voters support the Palestinians' right to an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 890 likely voters, conducted by New York-based
Zogby International July 14-17, showed 66 percent favored a
Palestinian state as well as 63 percent agreeing with Clinton's
handling of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The poll had a margin of error of +/-3.4 percent.

 CSU MAY UNIFY TEACHER PROGRAM ENTRY STANDARDS  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California State University is working to simplify its
admissions and transfer process for education students to help the
state in its push to get 250,000 new secondary and elementary
school teachers in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urgently need teachers, so we are trying to eliminate the
barriers that frustrate people and discourage them when they
apply,'' said Arthurlene Towner, dean of CSU Hayward's education
department.
</P>
<P>
   Admission standards for the 21 campuses offering teacher
preparation now require varying grade-point averages for students
from different disciplines. And requirements for students who share
the same major can vary from campus to campus. All this makes it
difficult for students applying to teaching programs at more than
one university within the system.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees for CSU, which trains 60 percent of the state's
teachers, will consider a proposal at their meeting at CSU
headquarters in Long Beach Wednesday to establish uniform GPA
requirements for admission to education programs across the system.
</P>
<P>
   They also will weigh a proposal to increase the number of
transferable community college education courses.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only transfer credits from a single, generally
three-unit, course _ Introduction to Education _ can be applied to
a CSU program. The change would allow up to six units from
education courses to be applied to a teacher preparation program at
CSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a great deal of attention put on this issue,
and we are big players. We are trying to facilitate that production
of teachers for the classrooms,'' said Thomas La Belle, provost and
vice president for academic affairs for San Francisco State
University. ``Each one of the CSU campuses has been relatively
autonomous, and this brings them together.''
</P>
<P>
   The actions are part of a move by the system to make the
admissions and graduation process easier for all students. Last
year, it aligned its course requirements with the University of
California's admission standards to ensure incoming freshmen and
transfer students could be eligible for both systems with one set
of courses. To further reconcile with UC's requirements, they will
vote Wednesday to lower the minimum number of units required for a
bachelor's degree from 124 semester units to 120, and to count only
college preparatory classes to calculate GPAs for admission.
</P>
<P>
   The latest effort to ease access for those seeking teaching
credentials comes as the state has about 34,000 teachers in
classrooms on emergency credentials and is struggling to attract
and retain enough new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The CSU system has added an online teacher credentialing program
and increased the flexibility of its teacher preparation programs.
It has also incorporated the fifth-year credentialing program into
the bachelor's degree on many campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of those things in and of itself doesn't amount to a
whole lot, but each one contributes to expediting the process,'' La
Belle said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Commission on Teacher Credentialing requires that
those seeking acceptance to teacher preparation programs have
grades in the upper half of all students. But there are multiple
ways to calculate who is in that upper half, said David Spence,
CSU's executive vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, each campus sets separate GPA requirements for each
discipline. Under the new system, admission to all teaching
programs would be based on a common GPA, which will be determined
by the chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirements would not lower academic standards because
applicants with GPAs in the top half would still be chosen, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators worry that students in the most rigorous fields
such as mathematics and engineering _ where it is difficult to get
top grades _ may be excluded from teaching programs, he said. But,
he added, campuses will be allowed the flexibility to make
exceptions in individual cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high standard,'' he said. ``California needs
teachers and needs them to be prepared in a quality way. Part of
that has to do with the kind of people we admit.''

 BROTHERS SEEM BORN TO BE BUSINESSMEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY PETER SINTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2000 San Francisco Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A case could be made that entrepreneurs are
born, not bred.
</P>
<P>
   The Case brothers, for example, have come a long way from their
lemonade stand in Hawaii. Dan Case heads Chase H&AMP;Q, the investment
bank that recently became part of Chase Manhattan Corp. Brother
Steve heads America Online, which is about to merge with Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Sandler is longtime co-chief executive officer of Golden
West Financial Corp., the Oakland holding company for World Savings
and Loan, and her brother, Bernard Osher, headed the venerable
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield auction house, which was bought by eBay
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Other local examples of sibling CEOs include the Dibachi
brothers. Yesterday, Farid Dibachi officially launched Arzoon, a
San Mateo B2B e-commerce company that lets rail and other freight
customers procure and track shipments involving more than one mode
of transportation. Meanwhile, brother Farzad is founder and CEO of
Niku Corp., a Redwood City developer of Internet software that
allows law firms, ad agencies and other professional services to
automate many of their services.
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers spent their early years in Iran, where their
father, a microwave engineer, helped build the country's first
ground satellite station.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, when Farid was 16 and Farzad 14, the family moved to
the United States. Both brothers were drawn to technology. By the
time he was 20, Farid not only had an undergraduate degree from the
University of Tennessee but also a master's degree in mechanical
engineering from Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Then Farid went to work for Hewlett-Packard for about six years,
picking up a second master's degree in electrical engineering along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he left HP to become vice president of engineering for
a small electronic test equipment company ``to get acquainted with
how small businesses run,'' he said. Two years later, he launched
his first startup, Wavetron Microsystems, in the basement of his
San Carlos house.
</P>
<P>
   Wavetron did well selling digital signal-processing hardware and
software to military contractors. But by 1995, Farid was talking
with his younger brother about pioneering the development of an
``information appliance'' _ a low-cost computer, with all functions
built into push buttons on the casing that was as simple to use as
a microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   Farid sold Wavetron for millions of dollars to SBS Technologies
and co-founded Diba with Farzad, who previously was senior vice
president of Oracle and helped lead the development of its
multimedia database and networking products.
</P>
<P>
   After just 18 months, the two brothers sold their fledgling
company to Sun Microsystems for an estimated $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Farzad quickly went on to found Niku, which means ``do-gooder''
in Farsi. The Redwood City company went public in February at $24
per share and quickly soared to $105. Even after slipping back to
$33.75 in the recent Internet stock retrenchments, Niku still has a
market value topping $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While Farzad was building his second startup, Farid took a
two-year sabbatical from the entrepreneurial rat race. ``I was
burned out after seven years and all the emotional ups and downs,''
he said. ``I decided to spend time with my family, pick up golf,
sit on some boards but never do another startup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never'' turned out to be a short time. In September, Farid got
excited by the idea for an online service that would help
businesses navigate the very fragmented transportation industry and
allow them to arrange freight shipments by truck, rail, plane or
ship from a single access point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entrepreneurial spirit is like a virus,'' Farid said.
``It's not something you can really get rid of.'' He named his new
venture Arzoon, which means ``inexpensive'' or ``good value'' in
Farsi. The startup doesn't have the value of Niku yet, but Farid is
working to match his younger brother's most recent success.
</P>
<P>
   Arzoon has raised $34 million from private investors, including
J.&AMP;W. Seligman and Co., Venrock Associates and a venture capital
fund of Thomas Weisel Partners. In May, it also received financing
from four strategic partners _ the Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk
Southern and Canadian Pacific railroads.
</P>
<P>
   RETIREMENT PLANNING: The U.S. Small Business Administration, the
U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Merrill
Lynch announced yesterday that they are launching a Web site in
August to help small business owners develop appropriate retirement
plans for their employees. The site will be called
 &LR; selectaretirementplan.org &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's tight labor market, more and more business owners
are recognizing the need to offer retirement plan benefits to their
employees, both for retention and recruitment,'' said SBA
Administrator Aida Alvarez. ``However, many business owners have
been deterred from doing so because of the lack of educational
resources and the difficulty of deciding on which plan to adopt.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Web site will answer questions about plan contribution
flexibility, record-keeping, administrative responsibilities and
overall business advantages. It will also guide users to specific
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Grow a Business appears every Wednesday in The Chronicle. Send
small-business tips, comments and questions to

 EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS OFFER SOMETHING FOR ALMOST EVERYONE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY KATHLEEN PENDER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Exchange-traded funds are marketed as a dirt-cheap,
tax-efficient way to invest in a broad basket of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   That they are.
</P>
<P>
   But some people fear they could turn long-term index-fund
investors into trigger-happy day traders.
</P>
<P>
   ETFs trade throughout the day, just like stocks, on the American
Stock Exchange. Regular mutual funds can only be traded at the
closing price, which eliminates intraday trading.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional funds, ETFs can also be sold short _ a risky
way to bet on market downturns _ and bought on margin, another
perilous strategy using borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Vanguard Group founder John Bogle has said ETFs are ``like
handing an arsonist gasoline and a match.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogle no longer runs Vanguard, which plans to introduce nine
ETFs nicknamed Vipers later this year if it can resolve a legal
dispute with Standard &AMP; Poor's about licensing S&AMP;P's name and
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard initially resisted offering ETFs, fearing they might
encourage speculation. But now it says ETFs will benefit long-term
shareholders by moving frequent traders out of its regular mutual
funds, where they drive up expenses for everyone, and into ETFs,
where shareholders pay their own trading costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short-term investors inflict harm on long-term investors in a
regular mutual fund,'' says Morningstar analyst Frank Stanton.
``Short- and long-term investors can exist peacefully in an ETF.''
</P>
<P>
   Presently, all ETFs are index funds, which own baskets of stocks
that mirror market barometers ranging from the broad-based S&AMP;P 500
to the specialty Dow Jones Internet index.
</P>
<P>
   There are already 58 ETFs, with $47 billion in combined assets,
listed on the Amex, with more coming every day. Yesterday, State
Street Global Advisors, which manages the original Spider ETF,
announced two new ETFs tracking companies in the Fortune 500 and
the new-economy Fortune e-50.
</P>
<P>
   ETFs appeal not only to short-term, aggressive market timers,
but also to buy-and-hold investors who make lump-sum contributions.
They are not ideal for investors who make smaller, more frequent
investments. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   To buy an ETF, you must go through a brokerage firm and pay a
commission ranging from less than $10 at some online brokers to $40
and up at full-commission firms. You pay a commission on every
investment, no matter how small.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, plenty of no-load mutual funds let you invest
small amounts at regular intervals without paying any commission.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage commission on ETFs is somewhat offset by the fact
that they usually charge shareholders lower annual fees than
regular mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the cheapest traditional fund, Vanguard 500 Index
Trust, charges 0.18 percent per year, or $1.80 per $1,000
investment.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ETF from Barclay's Investors _ the iShares 500 _
charges only 0.095 percent, or 95 cents per $1,000 investment per
year.
</P>
<P>
   The cost savings really add up over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ETFs are cheaper to run than regular mutual funds because they
only deal with a handful of institutional investors who trade in
``creation units,'' which are $5 million to $10 million blocks of
stock. Each creation unit usually contains 50,000 ``retail'' shares
in the ETF.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors such as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter act
as wholesalers. They buy creation units from the ETF manufacturer
(such as Barclays or soon, Vanguard), then split them up and sell
them in smaller pieces to their retail customers.
</P>
<P>
   Regular mutual funds sell and redeem shares directly with their
shareholders, which costs more than dealing with a few large
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Other differences: ETFs don't have to keep much cash on hand to
meet shareholder redemptions, or to sell some of the fund's stock
holdings to meet redemptions when they run out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   This makes ETFs more tax efficient than regular funds because
they realize fewer capital gains that have to be distributed to
shareholders each year. Most shareholders don't like to get capital
gains because they are taxable in the year received.
</P>
<P>
   ETFs tend to keep their capital gains in the fund, and investors
pay taxes when they sell their fund shares. So it really comes down
to paying the tax man now or later. ETFs offer an advantage for
people who would rather pay later.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest knock on ETFs is that they don't always
trade at net asset value, like regular funds do. NAV is the value
of all a fund's stock holdings divided by the number of fund shares
outstanding. It is the price mutual fund investors should rightly
expect because it represents their pro-rata share of the fund's
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end mutual funds, which also trade like stock on
exchanges, frequently trade at substantial discounts or premiums to
net asset value, and that's one reason they've never become hugely
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Suppose you buy a fund at a premium to net asset value. If
the premium shrinks _ or even worse, turns into a discount _ you'll
have less money, regardless of the fund's performance. Conversely,
if the premium widens, you'd have more money. But many investors
don't like that added risk and complexity.
</P>
<P>
   ETFs were designed to trade at NAV, like regular funds, and most
of them usually do.
</P>
<P>
   But some ETFs, mainly those based on foreign-stock indexes,
sometimes sell at premiums and discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ETF promoters don't generally publicize this fact and say it's
mainly because of differences between the time foreign stock
markets close and the time the funds are priced.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercer Bullard, founder of the shareholder advocacy group
Fund Democracy, says there's another reason. ``The arbitrage
mechanism (that's supposed to keep ETFs trading at NAV) works
imperfectly,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of consumer groups, Barclays of San Francisco
agreed in May to publish premiums and discounts for its ETFs on its
Web site ( &LR; www.ishares.com &LR; ), but it hasn't yet done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barclays continues to downplay the problem,'' Bullard says.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that ETFs generally trade at smaller premiums and
discounts that comparable closed-end funds. And in general, he
likes ETFs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take index investing to a new level,'' Bullard says.
``They provide investors a low-cost, easy way to access the market.
The downside is they hold out the possibility of being abused by
investors who want to engage in short-term trading.'' He thinks
that problem could be overcome by education.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing investors should be educated about: Some ETFs
are not technically mutual funds, but unit investment trusts.
</P>
<P>
   UITs can only reinvest dividends quarterly, whereas mutual funds
can reinvest them every day. When markets are rising, this gives
mutual funds an advantage over UITs. But when markets are falling,
the edge goes to UITs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, UITs do not have have a board of directors who are
supposed to look out for shareholders; mutual funds do.
</P>
<P>
   The iShares and the Select Sector Spiders are mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The original Spider 500 ETF, the MidCap Spider, the Diamonds
(tracking the Dow Jones industrial average) and the Nasdaq-100
Trust all are unit investment trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice between the Spider 500 and the iShare 500, which
both track the S&AMP;P 500, Stanton says he'd choose the iShare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cheaper (fees are 0.095 percent annually versus 0.12
percent for the Spider) and it's structured like a mutual fund
instead of a UIT.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he might hold out for the forthcoming Viper 500 from
Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanguard is bar none the best index tracker,'' says Stanton.
Its index guru, Gus Sauter, ``has done a phenomenal job of tracking
the index. In some years, he has even outperformed the index. Those
index funds are so large they've been able to strike lucrative
deals with brokers, and Vanguard passes on those savings to
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   He says Barclays is a large money manager _ bigger even than
Vanguard _ but ``most of its experience is with international
investing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's S&AMP;P 500 fund ``has outperformed Barclay's
institutional S&AMP;P 500 fund by a good margin over the last couple
years,'' Stanton says. ``The proof is in the pudding.''

 THEY'RE ACHING TO SHARE INFORMATION ON PAIN

   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some 2,000 pain care specialists from 45
countries have converged on San Francisco for the first Worldwide
Pain Conference, a weeklong exposition of the latest techniques for
relieving chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which ends Friday, was organized by Dr. Elliot
Krames, a San Francisco pain care specialist who says millions of
Americans suffer needlessly because they're afraid of becoming
addicted to painkillers or because their physicians are reluctant
to prescribe powerful drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chronic pain is undertreated,'' Krames said, adding that
medicine has treatments that patients and doctors are afraid to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic pain is defined as a severe, recurring discomfort that
can cause physical and emotional distress, estrange a person from
family and friends, and make it difficult or impossible to hold a
job.
</P>
<P>
   About 95 percent of chronic pain is caused by back, neck or
spinal cord ailments which, together with osteoporosis and other
symptoms of aging, can make daily life agonizing. Only 5 percent of
chronic pain stems from cancer, AIDS or other life-threatening
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Because most chronic pain is not associated with a deadly
disease, Krames said doctors have been reluctant to prescribe
powerful painkillers, such as Demerol, which belong to the opioid
family. Opioids are synthetic compounds that mimic endorphins, the
body's natural pain-supression chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Krames said doctors have been reluctant to prescribe opioids
because these medicinal drugs, which are related to heroin and
morphine, create physical dependencies that can, in about 3 percent
of medicinal uses, lead to psychological addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major, major change in pain management is the
understanding that addiction is rare,'' Krames said, which has in
turn prompted ``a greater willingness on the part of physicians to
prescribe opioid painkillers.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts at two health insurance firms echoed the view that many
chronic pain sufferers would be better off taking opioids than
trying to grimace and bear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that medical literature supports what this
conference is promoting,'' said Dr. Sandra Aronberg, a statewide
medical director for Blue Shield of California.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Justin McKendry, a pain management specialist with Kaiser
Permanente, took time out from listening to a lecture at the
conference to concur that while dependency is a potential side
effect of opioid painkillers, addiction is quite rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has definitely been a move within the medical community
toward the greater prescription of opioid medications,'' McKendry
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to advocating greater use of painkillers, the
conference demonstrated new devices that can be implanted under the
skin to suppress pain signals before they reach the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central nervous system operates on two primary processes,
electrical-conduction and chemical-information messengers,'' said
Scott Ward, an executive with Medtronic Corp. of Minneapolis.
``Implantable devices that use electricity or drugs can intercept
the pain signals as they transit the spinal cord.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward said one device for people with chronic lower back pain
consists of two electrodes implanted on either side of the spinal
cord. A battery implanted under the skin delivers a slight
electrical charge that modulates pain signals. The system costs
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The conference at the San Francisco Marriott, with its roughly
50 exhibitors and 150 research presentations, is not meant for the
general public. But Krames will conduct an online discussion of
pain management techniques at noon on Monday at  &LR; www.webmd.com &LR; .
Persons with questions should visit the Web site one hour early to
submit their queries.

 APPLE LEADERS PROMISE TO DAZZLE AT MACWORLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY HENRY NORR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Apple Tuesday reported quarterly revenues that were a
shade below expectations, but profits were solid and both company
officials and analysts said new products to be announced today
should push sales growth back onto the fast track.
</P>
<P>
   For its third fiscal quarter, which ended July 1, the Cupertino
Mac-maker posted sales of $1.83 billion. Compared with revenues of
$1.56 billion in the same period last year, sales were up 17
percent, but they fell short of the $1.9 billion analysts had
predicted after lowering their estimates from an original target of
$2 billion for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Net profits for the quarter added up to $200 million (55 cents
per share), compared with $203 million (60 cents) during the same
three months last year. But the figures for both years included
significant gains from investments rather than operations _ mainly
sales of shares in ARM Holdings, a British chip designer.
</P>
<P>
   When those gains are excluded, net profits for the most-recent
quarter totaled $163 million, up a whopping 43 percent over the
comparable figure last year. On a per-share basis, earnings without
the investment gains were 45 cents, 29 percent higher than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm OK with this,'' said Daniel Kunstler of J.P. Morgan
Securities in San Francisco. ``We've grown accustomed to upside
surprises from Apple, and this time there wasn't so much pizzazz,
but we'll deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple shares, which were recently split 2 for 1, closed at
$57.14, down $1.06, in regular trading yesterday. In after-hours
trading, they slipped further, to below $55.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Fred Anderson, Apple's chief
financial officer, cited three factors to explain why profits held
up well despite the revenue shortfall: Component prices during the
quarter fell below expectations; the company's product mix shifted
slightly toward its higher-margin ``professional'' products; and
the percentage of sales through Apple's online store rather than
dealers hit a record 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, gross margins for the quarter were 29.8 percent,
well above industry norms.
</P>
<P>
   The lower-than-anticipated revenues resulted from a slowdown in
sales of the iMac, the company's consumer- and education-oriented
model, and a preference on the part of education buyers, who are
especially important during the third quarter, for the
lowest-priced iMac, which lists for $999. IMac sales for the
quarter were just shy of 450,000 units, out of the company's total
volume of 1.016 million units.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson blamed the iMac slowdown on the fact that Apple hasn't
introduced new models in nine months, but he said that would change
today, when company chief executive Steve Jobs delivers the keynote
address at the East Coast edition of Macworld Expo, the semiannual
Mac trade show, in New York. ``I think you'll be impressed,'' he
told analysts, adding that the company has ``a very strong pipeline
of products'' and that new models will be introduced more
frequently during the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Anderson declined to provide specifics about the
new models, but Apple watchers expect the new iMacs to come with
faster processors and graphics, new color options and improved
keyboards, mice and audio. ATI Technologies, the Montreal company
that supplies graphics chips to Apple, yesterday briefly posted a
press release boasting that its latest chips will be included in
new iMac and PowerMac models to be announced at the Expo.
</P>
<P>
   Mac rumor sites on the Web have also been abuzz with speculation
about a ``cube Mac,'' a new cube-shaped model without a built-in
screen, and accompanying audio components made by Harman Kardon. .
During the past week, several sites that had posted reports about
the cube removed them after receiving messages from Apple lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers had predicted that the previously promised
``public beta'' version of Mac OS X, a major overhaul of the
company's operating system software, would be released this week.
But in yesterday's conference call, Anderson said the beta is
``still on target for release in the late summer,'' with the
``first customer release'' still set for January.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party developers are also expected to announce a variety
of new programs and peripherals for the Mac today. Topping the list
will be Microsoft Office 2001, a new Mac edition of the popular
productivity suite.

 HEALTHY PROFITS FOR WELLS FARGO
<TEXT>
<P>

   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wells Fargo's second-quarter profit climbed 12
percent, fueled by rapid loan growth, higher fee income and robust
venture capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, the largest bank based in the West, said Tuesday that it
earned a record $1.04 billion (63 cents per diluted share) in the
three months ending in June, as most of its consumer and commercial
businesses operated in high gear. In the 1999 second quarter, the
bank earned $931 million (55 cents).
</P>
<P>
   The bank boosted revenue to $4.56 billion in the quarter, up 11
percent from a year ago, a solid showing in an industry in which
top-line growth is typically in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   After the report, Wells shares fell $1.31 to $42.06 amid a broad
retreat in bank stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The bank took its current form in 1998 when Minnesota's Norwest
Corp. bought San Francisco's Wells, took its name and moved its
headquarters here. The new Wells has largely avoided the loan
problems and sluggish profit gains that have dogged some other big
banks, including several that went through megamergers a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very steady quarter, with high-quality earnings,''
said Joseph Morford, an analyst with the brokerage Dain Rauscher
Wessels. ``Wells is the dominant bank in much of the West and
that's the fastest-growing area of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank has not stumbled in its big merger or in several
smaller purchases because it has taken a cautious approach to
combining the old Wells and Norwest.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks had sharply different styles in the retail
marketplace. Wells favored telephones, ATMs and computers for
reaching customers, while Norwest stressed more traditional branch
banking.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wells has converted about 70 percent of the products and
computer networks of the two banks to common systems, Chief
Executive Officer Dick Kovacevich said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the profit jump in the second quarter stemmed from a
twenty-fivefold surge in gains from venture capital investments to
$320 million. The bank also had hefty increases in deposit, trust
and investment account fees.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' outstanding loans jumped 21 percent to $135 billion, with
strong gains in both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The
bank said it had a slight increase in problem loans, which stayed
below 1 percent of total credits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the bank added some 100,000 online customers per
month, passing the 2 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   The only area of the bank that reported a lower profit was the
mortgage business, which felt the effects of rising interest rates.
Mortgage originations dropped to $18 billion from $23 billion a
year ago, trimming earnings in the business 7.5 percent to $62
million.

 SCHWAB EARNINGS AND ACCOUNTS UP

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Charles Schwab Corp. reported second-quarter
earnings precisely in line with Wall Street expectations Tuesday,
but its stock shot up on news that the company added a whopping
400,000 customers during a tumultuous period for the brokerage
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco discount broker said its operating income for
the quarter ended last month rose 16 percent to $199 million (14
cents per share) from $171 million (12 cents) in the year-earlier
quarter. Revenues surged 25 percent to $1.4 billion from $1.12
billion.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the leading market indicators were down sharply,
Schwab's stock jumped $1 to $38.25. It has gained more than 50
percent in less than eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Smith, an analyst with Chase H&AMP;Q in San Francisco, said the
addition of 400,000 new accounts _ bringing the total to 7.2
million _ ``is a good indicator of how well Schwab is doing in this
competitive market'' and ``bodes well for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a lot of investors and prospective investors sat
on their hands last quarter because of the wild volatility and
steep plunges in stock prices that began in April.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the only sour disclosure in Schwab's report was the
fact that the average commission per trade during the second
quarter slipped to $36.65 from $40.12 in the first quarter,
continuing a trend that has persisted for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab customers have been steadily increasing the percentage of
trades that they place online, where commissions are lowest. In
addition, Smith noted, Schwab has lately scaled down the
commissions it charges its most-active traders and also has reduced
commissions for financial advisers.
</P>
<P>
   David Pottruck, president and co-chief executive of Schwab,
noted that 4.1 million of Schwab's 7.2 million accounts now place
at least some trades online _ a 46 percent gain from a year ago.
Online trades accounted for 81 percent of all trades last quarter,
compared with 67 percent in the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its operating results for the second quarter
exclude an after-tax total of $61 million in charges stemming from
its acquisitions of U.S. Trust Corp. and CyBerCorp Inc.

 TECHNOLOGY DRIVING LAW-FIRM MERGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY CAROL EMERT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite the dot-com bust, technology is the
catalyst in the planned law-firm merger of San Francisco's
Pillsbury Madison &AMP; Sutro with New York's Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam
&AMP; Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The combination, announced Monday, will give Pillsbury a sizable
presence in New York, where it can pursue securities underwriting
as well as mergers and acquisition work for its Bay Area tech and
other clients, Marina Park, the firm's managing partner, said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Pillsbury, founded in 1874, operates a small New York
office with just one partner and two or three associates.
</P>
<P>
   Winthrop, founded in 1868, also gives Pillsbury a significant
overseas presence, with offices in London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and
Singapore. Half of Winthrop's revenues come from outside of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Winthrop, meanwhile, will be able to tap into Pillsbury's
technology business. Winthrop ``has a very strong capital and
finance practice and a nascent technology practice that they very
much want to grow,'' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is expected to be finalized by year end. The combined
firm, which will be called Pillsbury Madison, will have some 860
lawyers and 16 offices. As measured by combined 1999 revenues, it
will be the second-largest law firm in the Bay Area and the
18th-largest in the United States, according to American Lawyer, a
trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Park said she expects Pillsbury Madison to become the largest
Bay Area law firm by 2001, barring any mergers by its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury has been building its technology practice since 1991,
when it opened a Menlo Park office specializing in intellectual
property. That office later moved to Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Pillsbury expanded its intellectual property business
by merging with a boutique firm, Cushman Darby &AMP; Cushman of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the ability to serve those clients on a global
basis,'' said Park. Tech companies ``as well as our Fortune 500
clients, are going global very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm's technology clients include dot-coms WebEx and
Support.com and Kinera, a maker of ``unified messaging'' software.
Kinera is just a few months old but is already asking for legal
advice as it plans a global expansion, Park said. ``A lot of
Silicon Valley companies are global just by their very nature,''
Park said.
</P>
<P>
   For Fortune 500 clients such as Chevron, the New York office
will allow Pillsbury to handle projects that require loans, such as
for building large power plants overseas. Typically those deals are
handled out of New York or London.
</P>
<P>
   The Winthrop merger is a key step in an ongoing effort by
Pillsbury to boost its revenues and its reputation. During the
1990s, the firm was plagued by lackluster revenues, high staff
turnover and a reputation as being somewhat sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   Park and Chairwoman Mary Cranston were put in charge in January
1999 with the mandate to turn things around. They immediately
raised the number of hours associates and partners are required to
work and tilted compensation more heavily toward the firm's biggest
rainmakers.
</P>
<P>
   They also formulated a vision statement and a strategic plan
that included boosting the firm's New York and overseas presences.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the firm's total revenues rose to a healthy $252.6
million, which translates into compensation per partner of
$506,000. Winthrop's compensation per partner is similar, about
$520,000.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's goal is to be among the top 25 percent of law firms
in terms of per-partner revenue. ``So far, we're ahead of that
target for this year,'' Park said.

KYLE PETTY TO DRIVE SON'S CAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In rolling tribute to his late son, NASCAR driver Kyle Petty
plans to replace Adam Petty as permanent driver of the No. 45 car
in the Busch Grand National Series later this summer and take the
entire team to the Winston Cup ranks beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty's return to the BGN series fulltime, scheduled to
begin at Darlington Raceway on Sept. 2, signals a major
restructuring at Petty Enterprises. Petty, 40, will relinquish his
seat in the No. 44 Hot Wheels Pontiac Grand Prix, which is
scheduled to be driven for the final 11 races of the season by
former Cup regular Steve Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty, 19, was killed while practicing his Busch car at New
Hampshire International Speedway on May 12. The first
fourth-generation athlete in any sport, Adam Petty made his Winston
Cup debut at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on April 2. He was
scheduled to graduate to the Cup ranks fulltime beginning in 2001,
and carry on the family legacy begun by NASCAR pioneer Lee Petty
and seven-time Cup champion Richard Petty, Kyle's father and Adam's
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a doubt that a Petty should be driving that
\RNo. 45\S car. I'm just taking up space,'' Kyle Petty said
yesterday afternoon. ``Adam's accident happened on a Friday. On
Monday, I went to his shop and talked to his entire group. From
that day forward, that was Adam's car and Adam's team. We never got
the opportunity because of the accident to do what we wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a personal thing. I want that car to succeed. We
want to take the 45 car and win races with it, so I can prove _
probably to myself _ that I gave Adam everything I could have given
him so that if things had worked out, he could have won races.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty's No. 45 BGN Chevrolet Monte Carlo is sponsored by
Sprint, and the long-distance telephone company will continue next
year when Petty Enterprises switches manufacturers to the Dodge
Intrepid R/T.
</P>
<P>
   Petty also announced that Mattel's Hot Wheels brand would end
its primary sponsorship of the No. 44 car at season's end, although
the toymaker plans to continue as a major associate on the Cup cars
Petty Enterprises will field for Petty, John Andretti and Grissom
beginning in 2001. Grissom currently drives the No. 43 Dodge for
Petty Enterprises in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. He will
compete in both series through the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of eight Cup races, Kyle Petty first drove Adam's BGN
car at Dover, Del., on June 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a better race car driver, I'd probably be running
better right now,'' said Petty, who scored a fifth-place finish at
Nazareth Speedway on Sunday. ``To run fifth, it makes you feel like
you can run a race car again.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty also said that driving Adam's car has helped him
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the car, we haven't changed anything, no matter
how strange that sounds,'' Petty said. ``It still says `Adam Petty'
on the car \Rroof\S. It's still Adam's seat, Adam's steering wheel.
For me to get in the car and sit in the same seat and drive with
the same wheel and look out the window ... I know he's been there
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound strange, but with the loss we've experienced, it
makes me feel so much closer to him. For me, that's comforting.
That's helping me, and I cherish it right now.''

OFFENSIVE TACKLE WILLIAMS A HOLDOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ It just wouldn't be a Cowboys training
camp without a little strife.
</P>
<P>
   All the positive vibes of the first day of ``Camp Campo'' were
interrupted yesterday by an old-fashioned holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran offensive tackle Erik Williams didn't report with the
rest of the team Monday and was still nowhere to be found when the
Cowboys took the field for practice yesterday at Midwestern State
University.
</P>
<P>
   A source said Williams' absence is rooted in his desire to
restructure his contract. Williams, 31, is signed for two more
years. He is scheduled to make $1.9 million in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' agent, Alan Herman, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the situation is disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erik Williams is obviously not here; we're real disappointed
that he's not here,'' Jones said. ``What his status is and where we
go from there will just have to evolve. That's an internal matter
and we'll see how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the 10-year veteran is subject to being fined up to
$5,000 for each day he misses.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, however, said he has not decided if the Cowboys would
levy a fine against Williams at this point. And while he was
disappointed, he also said he was not surprised by the the player's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we basically counted heads yesterday, we thought he might
be a late arrival, but then we started visiting with his agent and
realized he wouldn't be here,'' Jones said. ``I had a good visit
with him last week and we were aware of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Williams' issues have more to do with his status and
future on the field than money. Jones, however, refused to
elaborate any further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my understanding that he is mulling his professional
options,'' the owner said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who made the Pro Bowl for the fourth time last season,
had been slowed during the off-season after elbow surgery to remove
bone chips. The 6-foot-6, 311-pounder, however, is fully recovered
and has been cleared by doctors for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams does have two years left on his contract, there
has been some speculation that this could be his last with the
team. Solomon Page, last year's second-round pick, is considered
the team's right tackle of the future. If the Cowboys cut Williams
after the 2000 season, they would only have to eat $1.4 million in
pro-rated signing bonus money.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while Williams' holdout is putting a hitch in the
Cowboys' plans for this season, it is giving them a glimpse of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Page, who was expected to replace Everett McIver at right guard,
replaced Williams in the starting lineup at tackle yesterday.
Free-agent signee Jorge Diaz, who started in Tampa Bay the past few
years, played right guard. Veteran backup Tony Hutson will
alternate with Diaz at guard in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Page will know both spots,'' offensive line coach Hudson Houck
said. ``But right now, we're looking at it like he is going to be
our right tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo downplayed Williams' holdout, terming
it a business decision, and said that he would not consider it
anything major unless Williams is out for a few weeks. However,
like Houck, he said he has a lot of confidence in Page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Solomon Page,'' Campo said. ``I like him a lot. He may
be the best athlete of the whole group on the offensive line. He is
very talented. He is going to have to come to the front. I'm
confident he will be able to step in and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Page said he would like to see the Williams' situation resolved
because ``Erik is a friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he did not hide his personal excitement about returning
to his ``natural position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't bother me,'' Page said. ``I'm a natural tackle. I
don't expect to have any problems at tackle.''

Cowboys' swift wide receivers at the center of offensive attack 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Troy Aikman liked what he saw yesterday.
What he saw was Joey Galloway or Rocket Ismail running under balls
that Aikman lobbed to open areas in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams will have to honor the speed we have this year,'' Aikman
said at the start of training camp for a third consecutive summer
at Midwestern State University. ``Teams will have to decide on how
they want to play us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys plan to use training camp as an open-air laboratory
to create an offense resembling what the Cowboys used during their
Super Bowl years, with modifications such as the ones implemented
last season by the Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge in this training camp is to really get this
thing going offensively,'' said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who
invested handsomely this off-season to add speed to the offense,
namely speed receiver Galloway and tight end Jackie Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, who signed a seven-year, $42 million deal, including a
$12.5 million signing bonus, is one of the fastest players in the
NFL. Harris is a wide receiver in a tight end's body. Both players
are part of what should make the Cowboys more difficult to defend
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going to change the most about this offense is,
hopefully, we're going to be a little more unpredictable than we've
been,'' said head coach Dave Campo, the former defensive
coordinator who is using his past to make suggestions that should
make the Cowboys more problematic for opposing defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be times when we're more of an
off-the-seat-of-our-pants operation, which puts pressure on the
defense,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who turns 34 in November, is the centerpiece of
offensive coordinator Jack Reilly's offense.
</P>
<P>
   After two seasons in New England, Reilly and Ernie Zampese have
returned as offensive coordinator and offensive consultant,
respectively. Virtually the entire offense was put in during two
minicamps and two quarterback schools this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The old offense with a new look is designed to take advantage of
Aikman's ability to read defenses and hits spots. Now the ``spots''
are simply moving faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have a real deep threat now,'' said Aikman,
referring to Galloway and Ismail, and Harris running the big-play
routes down the middle that haven't been seen since Jay Novacek
retired three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has found a comfort zone with Ismail, who is starting his
second season with the Cowboys, although he is still adapting to
Galloway's speed. It's easy to underthrow both of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey is a flyer,'' Aikman said. ``If we keep throwing into the
wind like we did today, I'm not going to have an arm by the end of
training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo sees the addition of Harris and rookie running back
Michael Wiley, who will compete with Chris Warren for the job of
third-down back, as important keys to success ``because there is
going to be some double-coverage on those wideouts, I can promise
you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is coming off what he admits to be a ``disappointing''
season, both from a team standpoint (8-8) as well as individually
(17 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, two concussions). Physically,
though, Aikman is fine. He hasn't even talked to a neurosurgeon
since November.
</P>
<P>
   Learning the offense and adjusting to his new offensive
teammates now have his total attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be naive in saying that we'll be where we
eventually want to be when training camp is over \Rug. 18\S,''
Aikman said of the pass offense. ``But I certainly believe we'll be
where we need to be to at least be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   When the games begin (July 30 vs. Pittsburgh), Reilly will call
the plays. Zampese, 64, will provide the expertise, serving purely
in a consulting role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie Zampese is a tremendous asset because he has seen
everything that you can see in the NFL,'' Campo said. ``Plus,
there's a calming effect that Ernie has with Troy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, after all, this training camp is about Aikman and the
offense. nn

 EYE FOR ONLINE OPPORTUNITIES LED TO SUCCESS FOR VENTRO FOUNDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY PETER SINTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE SENIOR WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ David Perry, the 32-year-old founder and chief
executive of Ventro Corp. in Mountain View, helped invent the
business-to-business online marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Like many pioneering entrepreneurs, Perry didn't start off with
a grand vision. But he had the intelligence, fortitude and
competitive spirit to spot opportunity when it arose and then do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when Perry was simultaneously studying for an
MBA degree at Harvard University and heading a biotech startup, he
saw a huge opportunity for industries with lots of buyers and
sellers to eliminate inefficiency and make more money by handling
procurement online.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this is a major part of the B2B market that analysts
project could be worth between $2.7 trillion and $7.3 trillion
within four years.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's company seeks to serve a big chunk of it, and Wall
Street was enthusiastic, at least at first.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, the company went public under its previous name,
Chemdex, and soared from its offering price of $15 to a peak
$239.81 in late February. Since then, it has gone into a tailspin
along with many other Internet infrastructure companies and
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ventro's stock is trading at $23.25 a share, and Perry's
approximate 5 percent slice of the company is down from more than
$500 million to a mere $51 million. But Perry remains upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Arkansas in a house with concrete floors and two
years ago had a negative (net worth) of $200,000,'' he said. ``I
try not to run the company by the stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a successful entrepreneur takes an ability to roll with
the punches and the plunges.
</P>
<P>
   Perry did not originally plan to land in business at all. He
attended the Air Force Academy but a serious shoulder injury not
only knocked him out of varsity football, it dislocated his chances
of becoming a fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   So Perry switched to the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma,
studied chemical engineering and went to work for Exxon. By age 26,
he was managing a $200 million piece of the Benicia oil refinery in
the East Bay. Then it occurred to Perry that because the oil
business was growing at what he jokingly calls ``a blistering 11/2
percent-a-year pace,'' it would be wise to jump into higher-growth
high technology.
</P>
<P>
   However, companies such as Intel and Cisco would not give him
the same management responsibilities he had at Exxon, where he had
a couple hundred people reporting to him. So he went to Harvard to
earn an MBA degree and make himself more marketable.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to studying entrepreneurship, Perry wanted more
hands-on experience. So he teamed up with two Harvard and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists to write a
business plan for a biotech company.
</P>
<P>
   While his partners worked on ways to create tests for HIV and
other viruses that would show the degree of infection rather than
just indicate positive or negative, Perry handled the business
side. That entailed working 15 to 20 hours a week negotiating
equipment and real estate leases, hiring employees and managing
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Virogen's goal of revolutionizing viral testing was not
commercially feasible, it dawned on Perry that going through
catalogs to find and buy chemical agents, beakers and thousands of
other supplies was inefficient. The process and paperwork were
similarly tedious for the buyers of Virogen's initial products.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on his experience at the biotech startup with his
classroom insights into the Internet, Perry envisioned an online
marketplace that might connect more than 5,000 suppliers with
250,000 life scientists who buy materials for pharmaceutical and
biotech firms as well as government and academic labs.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's new enterprise, dubbed Chemdex over beers in his Boston
apartment, started in mid-1997. It received early financing from
Genentech founder Robert Swanson, who died last year, and venture
capital firms CMGI and Bay City Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Chemdex charges a 2 to 12 percent fee per transaction. Its
customers include major pharmaceutical, biotech and academic
customers including Bristol-Myers Squibb and SmithKline Beecham.
</P>
<P>
   With one market up and running, Perry began looking at how he
might get more bang for the buck out of Chemdex's experience and
investment of more than $100 million in technology. It turned out
that the template for the life sciences products industry could be
used to transform the business supply chains of other industries
that are characterized as ``fragmented'' for having many suppliers
and differently priced products.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of buyers and sellers is a good sign of
inefficiency,'' said Perry.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Chemdex established a holding company called Ventro
Corp. to provide e-commerce software and other services to Chemdex
and its growing lineup of other online marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Chemdex, Ventro has started five operating
companies: Amphire Solutions to serve operators, distributors and
suppliers of the $150 billion U.S. food service market; Broadlane
and Promedix for hospital and medical supplies and services;
Industria Solutions for the fluid processing (oil to shampoo)
market; and Ventro Life Sciences to serve Europe's scientific
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care, food services and life sciences are non-sexy
industries,'' said Perry. ``But tens of billions of dollars of
goods are bought and sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ventro was one of the first companies to develop B2B
infrastructure services, it is not alone. Hardly a day goes by
without news of a new online buying consortium such as Johnson &AMP;
Johnson banding together with Baxter International and other
providers to create a health care marketplace or Ford, General
Motors and DaimlerChrysler starting an exchange for the automotive
industry.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 600 online marketplaces and thousands more
anticipated in the next few years, Perry acknowledged that ``the
current B2B landscape looks like a game of 6-year-olds playing
soccer, with everyone crowding the ball and no obvious strategy for
getting the ball into the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he believes B2B e-commerce is unlocking
significant value for buyers, sellers and companies such as Ventro
that bring them together. Perry is not the only believer in his
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perry was one of the first to see the opportunity for online
exchanges for buyers and sellers in fragmented industries,'' said
venture capitalist Brook Byers of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers,
who succeeded Swanson as Ventro's chairman. ``When he started, B2B
was not in the lexicon.''
</P>
<P>
   AMR Research recently ranked Chemdex, which generated nearly all
of Ventro's $23 million revenues in the first quarter, as the No. 2
net marketmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Group analyst Lisa Williams is confident Ventro will be a
survivor. ``They are first mover in many markets. They don't have
all their eggs in one basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they are not just putting up marketplaces to see if people
will come; they have backing from people with authority in each
supply chain they go after,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is keen on Ventro. David Hines, president of
Avalon Research in Boca Raton, Fla., believes B2B marketplaces such
as those offered by Ventro and rival SciQuest are not much
different from electronic catalogs provided by companies such as
Fisher Scientific. ``We question what value is added,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hines also is concerned that Ventro's vendors have nonexclusive
contracts that allow them to create competing electronic solutions.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, he feels that Ventro and others distort the market
potential by talking about the dollar value of all sales
transactions instead of their fees from those deals. ``It's like
Realtors talking about the value of the houses they sell rather
than their commissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines' bottom line: ``The business model is unlikely to produce
a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and his backers disagree. They say &UR;  &LR; Ventro not only will
be profitable but has plenty of cash. Although it has cumulative
operating losses of about $150 million, it has close to double that
in cash reserves.
</P>
<P>
   On the golf course, Byers said that Perry always likes to
``swing for the green'' and that he takes the same approach in
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aggressive,'' Perry agrees. ``My philosophy is to hit
away; it's easier to correct on the short distances.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ventro already serves industries with total sales of
$500 billion, Perry is aiming much higher. ``The gross domestic
product _ all goods and services _ is our potential market,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing for a second, he amends that: ``Actually, it might be
bigger. We have international aspirations as well.''

EYES OF TEXAS, FOOTBALL WORLD STILL ON AIKMAN
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Was Troy Aikman really that busy in the
off-season? Did he use his power and influence to mastermind the
firing of Chan Gailey? Did he demand a return to the Norv Turner
offensive system? Did he strong-arm Jerry Jones on getting
free-agent receiver Joey Galloway signed?
</P>
<P>
   As those questions were asked yesterday, Aikman stood in the
middle of the practice field at Midwestern State University, and a
smile spread across his sweaty face. It wasn't, however, a ha-ha
kind of smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exactly amused,'' Aikman said, ``but more like amazed.
None of it is accurate. But I do understand why some people might
feel that way, although I obviously don't like my name being
associated with something like Chan being fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, it's there, although voices within the Cowboys'
hierarchy say that among players who have the ear of Jones, and
among key assistant coaches, Aikman's private comments on Gailey
were basically nonexistent compared to the others.
</P>
<P>
   But Aikman became the lightning rod the day Jones held the press
conference to fire Gailey in January. Jerry dumped the hot rivet in
a certain lap when he said he wanted to return to an offense that
Aikman was comfortable with. What were people supposed to think,
particularly when Aikman went a week without publicly attempting to
defuse what Jones had said?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, however, the quarterback was in shock for that week after
hearing Jerry link him directly to the firing. ``I was watching at
home on TV, I heard that, and I wanted to kick in the screen,''
said Aikman, smiling again and shaking his head. Then again, he
shouldn't have been surprised _ the owner and the quarterback
always have had a close relationship. Jerry rarely makes a major
personnel move at Valley Ranch without somehow connecting Aikman to
it. And with or without Troy's approval.
</P>
<P>
   But for those keeping score at home, that's two consecutive head
coaches at Valley Ranch supposedly done in by the muscle of Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize as much as anybody, how disruptive to our football
team the firing of head coaches has been,'' Aikman said. ``It is
the one area where you have to have stability, and we've been just
the opposite. I know there were reasons behind what happened to the
three previous head coaches since I've been here. But if we are
ever going to get back to where we need to be, this has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   It was interesting that Aikman was nowhere to be seen or heard
when Jones went looking for a new head coach. His respect for the
two in-house candidates, Dave Campo and Joe Avezzano, kept the
quarterback very neutral. But it was also a given that with either
of the assistants, or even if a longshot candidate from the outside
had been hired, that the old offense was coming back. Aikman admits
he thought that was very important.
</P>
<P>
   So now, here the Cowboys are, in training camp again, and
attempting to follow a football theme that Campo coined as the
third head coach in four summers: ``An old plan for a new future.''
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with the territory that the Campo era is opening
with a noose attached to Aikman's neck, more so than even with the
new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a flood of media opinions that Aikman is on the
spot as never before in his career. Why? Because Jones supposedly
has given him everything he wanted _ Gailey gone, the old offense,
the quality receiver, etc. Therefore, Aikman must now reverse a
career that has been trending downward the past few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's silly stuff, actually. When has there not been pressure on
Aikman, going all the way back to the beginning of the Jimmy
Johnson regime when many of us thought Johnson wanted Steve Walsh
as his quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Same ol' story for all quarterbacks _ no one receives more blame
when things are going badly, or more credit when things are going
well. But that goes double when your name is Aikman and your team
is the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard it, and I've read it about all the new pressure on
me, and my response is ... well, actually it'd be best if I not
give my response to that,'' Aikman said. ``But what have people
been watching all these years if they think that? Yes, the pressure
is immense. But is that new? I accept it. I don't try to dodge
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another twist is that while the Cowboys have been regarded as a
fading team the past three seasons (and have performed as such),
the negative on Aikman is he's not what he has been at QB. So is
that him, or is that the talent around him, or both?
</P>
<P>
   One way or the other, answers will come this season. And so will
either blame or praise, making it nothing more than another typical
season for Aikman. nn

   SAN FRANCISCO _ With Esteban Loaiza going to the bullpen and
Mark Clark released, manager Johnny Oates said Ryan Glynn and Matt
Perisho will be given every opportunity to establish themselves as
major-league starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want them looking over their shoulders or to feel that
one bad pitch is going to get them sent to the minors,'' Oates
said. ``Certainly they're going to be evaluated, and at some point
we have to see improvement. But I'm not basing my opinion on one or
two outings; it will be 10, 15 _ and in some cases _ 30 outings.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates also said going with Glynn and Perisho instead of Loaiza
does not mean the Rangers are giving up on the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us the best chance to win now,'' Oates said. ``We
gave the veterans a chance first, Clark and Loaiza. Now we're going
to see how this works. I don't see it as an experiment; it gives us
a chance to win right now and will enable to make decisions at the
right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davis stays in the bullpen as the second left-hander but
Oates said, ``I'll make sure I see enough of him, too.''
\Nsubheds:Loaiza accepts move Esteban Loaiza accepted his move to
the bullpen without complaint yesterday, although he knows there's
a good chance he could be traded within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do anything about it,'' Loaiza said. ``I can't be
upset because I know I've been struggling. We'll just see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, who irked Johnny Oates by being late to the clubhouse
Monday, said he doesn't want to be traded but admitted it's a
strong possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here, and I like it here,'' Loaiza said. ``But I
really can't do anything about it; that's not my decision.'' OLIVER
BEFORE PERISHO
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates has decided to pitch Darren Oliver tomorrow
against the Anaheim Angels and move Matt Perisho back one day to
pitch against the Seattle Mariners. Both are left-handed, but Oates
wants Perisho to pitch against Seattle's predominately
right-handed-hitting lineup. Left-handers are hitting .389 off him
this season, and right-handers are hitting .253. Oliver, who will
face the Angels' predominately left-handed lineup, has been tough
on left-handers in the past, but they're hitting .338 off him this
year and hit .325 off him last year. MARTINEZ WANTS TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   Count outfielder Dave Martinez among the Rangers' potential free
agents who want to be back next year. Martinez has been with three
clubs this season and six in his 15-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' Martinez said. ``I think this team is going
to be fine. It's just a young team that needs a little time to
develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, acquired June 9 from the Chicago Cubs, has been
platooning in right field with Chad Curtis and went into last
night's game hitting .259 with the Rangers. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   -- Reliever John Wetteland fulfilled a boyhood dream yesterday
when he met Giants Hall of Famer Willie McCovey and got his
autograph. Wetteland, who grew up in North California, said, ``The
only two autographs I wanted growing up were McCovey and \RNolan\S
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Frank Catalanotto entered yesterday's game with eight
pinch-hits, second most in the American League and the most by a
Rangers player since Geno Petralli had eight in 1992. The club
record is 12, set by Bill Stein in 1980 and tied by Kevin Reimer in
1990. nn

 INTEL PROFITS UP DESPITE CHIP DELAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY DAN FOST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a booming tech market, you can always count
on Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest chipmaker reported record revenues for the
second quarter Tuesday, with net income soaring 79 percent to $3.14
billion (45 cents per share).
</P>
<P>
   Intel said revenue will continue to rise. If there was anything
to darken the sunny picture the company painted Tuesday, it was
that the Itanium chip _ which will ultimately supplant Intel's
flagship Pentium processors _ will be further delayed and won't
start selling until the fourth quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Joseph Osha of Merrill Lynch and Co. said the delay
should not hurt the big picture for Intel. ``Nobody thought Itanium
would do much for them this year,'' Osha said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's biggest challenge lies in merely meeting the demand for
its products, as the growth of the Internet fuels a seemingly
insatiable appetite for high-powered computer chips. Santa Clara's
Intel and its chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale, are
both showing signs of robust financial health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's way out in front. It'll take AMD a long time to catch
them,'' Osha said. ``At this point, both companies are trying to
keep up with demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Intel chief executive Craig Barrett said the
implementation of new manufacturing technology will allow Intel to
squeeze more chips out of a single silicon wafer, which ``will
allow us to substantially increase second-half supply to help us
meet this anticipated strong demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the three months that ended July 1 was $8.3 billion,
up 23 percent from the second quarter of last year, when the
company reported revenue of $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A significant part of the strong revenue jump came from interest
and other income _ essentially, $2.34 billion in gains on
investments, mostly the sale of stock in Micron Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel also shipped a record number of microprocessors, as
well as record amounts of flash memory _ the chips used in wireless
devices such as cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's stock this year has reflected its leadership in a
healthy business climate. Before yesterday's numbers were released,
Intel shares closed at $143, down $3.31. Earlier in the day, the
stock hit a 52-week high of $147.50.

ONE CHAMPION SAW TIGER'S PROMISE EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 REPORT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hail him as a visionary. Discount his comment as premature
hyperbole. Either stance, at this juncture, is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But don't accuse Peter Thomson, a five-time British Open
champion, of piling on in the rush to project Tiger Woods as the
youngest golfer to complete a career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 24, can capture his fourth major championship at this
week's British Open. If he hoists the claret jug Sunday on the Old
Course in St. Andrews, Scotland, Woods will have won each of golf's
major titles one time. He will join Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Gene
Sarazen and Gary Player as the only players to hit for the cycle in
professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, he would fulfill the predictions of countless Tiger
praisers who have overloaded the bandwagon since Woods won the U.S.
Open by a startling 15 strokes June 18. And he'd make a prophet of
Thomson, who uttered these words in 1997:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would win every time on the Old Course at St.
Andrews,'' Thomson said after watching Woods finish 24th in the
1997 British Open, his first professional appearance at golf's
oldest major championship. ``Better get a bet down on him for 2000.
I could see him going around in 64 every day. I think he'll win by
a mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Thomson's sentiment is the prevailing one in
professional golf circles. If Woods plays St. Andrews with the same
focus and flair he exhibited last month at Pebble Beach Golf Links,
he'll make Thomson's observation the most valuable potential
investment tip since Bill Gates alerted friends he was launching a
computer software venture called Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Roll back the calendar to the summer of 1997, when Woods began
retooling his swing and triggered a stretch where he won one PGA
Tour event in 17 months, and you could have gotten 100-1 odds
against him winning the 2000 British Open. Maybe 200-1. Now, he's
an even-money proposition, with 12 victories in his past 22 starts
at tour events. He's won two of the past three majors.
</P>
<P>
   And he's clearly smitten with the notion of a slam-clinching
victory at St. Andrews, the course where the first documented round
of golf was played in 1552.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no better site to have it occur than at the home of
golf,'' Woods said. ``That's where it all started. Every person who
has ever played the game has wanted to win a British Open at St.
Andrews ... If I could somehow be fortunate enough to play well and
get that claret jug, it would be a good feeling. That's something I
would love to have happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win major championships in the same year at Pebble Beach
and St. Andrews, it doesn't get much better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The topper, of course, would be achieving a career grand slam _
and golf immortality _ at 24, two years younger than Nicklaus. For
anyone else, surpassing the Golden Bear would rank as a daunting
mental stumbling block. For Woods, it's par for the course.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, at 24, already has 20 victories on the PGA Tour.
Nicklaus, at the same age, had 12. Woods has won major
championships by 15 and 12 strokes, two of the three biggest
landslides in golf history. Nicklaus never lapped an elite field by
more than nine strokes, his winning margin at the 1965 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Woods has shown a flair for the dramatic while
dominating professional golf for the past 14 months. That's why St.
Andrews _ with its wide fairways, driveable par-4 greens and
unmatched history _ seems the perfect backdrop for Woods to etch
his name into golf lore by becoming the fifth player to complete a
career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first shot is fired at the 2000 British Open, there
is a thick air of inevitability about its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tiger doesn't win at St. Andrews, there should be a
stewards' inquiry,'' said Sir Michael Bonallack, former
administrator of the Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is playing better than he ever has,'' said Butch Harmon,
Woods' instructor. ``His swing ... is pretty easy to tweak if
something goes wrong. If he plays good golf, he's going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If history unfolds at St. Andrews, remember that Peter Thomson
told you so. And he did it three years before the rest of the golf
world joined the chorus.
STANFORD GRANTS FATHER'S OFF-THE-CUFF WISH TO CADDIE AT OPEN
</P>
<P>
   Steve Stanford considers himself living proof of a time-honored
adage: Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Stanford wished himself into a caddie's vest for
tomorrow's opening round of the U.S. Women's Open at the Merit Club
in Libertyville, Ill. That is where his daughter, TCU graduate
Angela Stanford, will make her debut in an LPGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 500 people who would do a better job for her
than I would,'' Stanford said. ``But I remember once, when she was
young, she asked, `If I ever make it, what would you want?' I
mouthed off and said, `I'd like to caddie one time at the U.S.
Open.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, he gets his chance. His daughter wouldn't have it any
other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to do it ... for a lot of emotional reasons,'' said
Angela Stanford, whose Open gallery will include several friends
and family members, as well as longtime instructor Amy Fox. ``He
helped me get started in the game. He always made sure I had
options and did the right thing. He talked me into seeing Amy. I
thought it would be neat for him to be inside the ropes with me at
my first Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties agree this will be a limited engagement. Steve
Stanford described both himself and his daughter as
``hard-headed,'' which could make for a combustible combination.
Because of that, Angela said the two will huddle before tomorrow's
opening round to define the caddie's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, he still sees me as a 12 year old. We're going to
have to have a little talk about that,'' said Angela Stanford, 22,
a member of the U.S. team that won the 2000 Curtis Cup, the Ryder
Cup equivalent for women's amateur golf.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Stanford nodded and laughed. He vowed to let Angela call
the shots at the Merit Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll offer her advice, but she's the boss,'' he said. ``I'll
carry the bag. I'll give her the yardage. But she'll make the last
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties, in turn, figure to leave the Open with a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.
CHIP SHOTS Open overlap With 52 weeks available on the calendar,
why would golf's big cigars pick the same one to contest both the
British Open and the U.S. Women's Open?
</P>
<P>
   Good question.
</P>
<P>
   Simple answer: Scheduling conflicts at the Merit Club in
Libertyville, Ill., site of the Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   Originally selected to play host to the event in 1999, officials
at the Merit Club requested a switch to 2000 when the 1999 PGA
Championship was booked at Medinah (Ill.) Country Club, another
course in suburban Chicago. Their wish was granted. In selecting
dates for 2000, tournament officials sought at least a two-week gap
from the Western Open (July 6-9), the PGA Tour's annual stop in the
Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
   Based on available dates at the Merit Club in 2000, that made
this week the best option, even though it coincides with the
British Open. U.S. Golf Association officials characterized the
overlap as a one-year aberration and said steps will be taken to
prevent future overlaps. SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez, 43, said she hopes to make the most of a special
exemption into the U.S. Women's Open field granted by USGA
officials. Lopez will be making her 20th career appearance at the
Open, where she has three runner-up finishes but no victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had to qualify for the Open, so I was flying around
the house when they told me about the special exemption,'' said
Lopez, an LPGA Hall of Famer with 48 career victories. ``For me,
missing the Open just wouldn't be right. I need to be there. And I
plan on being more prepared for this tournament than any I've
played this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez finished second at the 1997 Open, the only time in the
past four years that she's survived the 36-hole cut. As for her
chances to win this week, two months after gall bladder surgery,
Lopez said: ``The older you get, the less chance you have to do it.
If I never win an Open, I would have to say something would be
missing in my career. But it's not in God's plans if it doesn't
happen, and I just have to accept that.''
LPGA GOLDEN MOMENTS June 6, 1999
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the LPGA Tour's 50th anniversary, the
Star-Telegram will feature a significant moment in tour history
each week this season.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Inkster rolled to a five-stroke victory at the U.S. Women's
Open, posting the lowest total in relation to par (16 under) of any
player in tournament history. With rounds of 65-69-67-71, Inkster
broke even-par 72 each day at Old Waverly Golf Club in West Point,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   By finishing at 16-under, Inkster established a record for
lowest finish in relation to par of any player at a U.S. Open,
men's or women's. Tiger Woods set the men's mark June 18 at Pebble
Beach Golf Links, where he shot 12 under and won by 15 strokes.
Hale Irwin bettered both totals July 2, winning the 2000 U.S.
Senior Open by finishing at 17 under.
</P>
<P>
   Both Inkster and Woods will be in the spotlight this week.
Woods, 24, seeks to become the youngest player in history to
complete a career grand slam by winning the British Open. Inkster,
40, will defend her U.S. Women's Open title at the Merit Club in
Libertyville, Ill. nn

U.S. WOMEN'S OPEN EXHIBITION NO SLAM DUNK FOR JORDAN

<P>
   LIBERTYVILLE, Ill. _ He reigned as ESPN's top athlete of the
20th century. But Michael Jordan was no match for three U.S.
Women's Open competitors in a three-hole exhibition yesterday at
the Merit Club.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan posted the highest score on each hole during the
competition, with Jordan and teammate Nancy Lopez losing all three
holes to Laura Davies and Meg Mallon in a best-ball match. Davies
birdied all three holes.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Jordan-Lopez team came to a birdie was on the
first hole. Lopez missed a 3-foot birdie attempt after Jordan
hooked a drive into the woods and picked up his ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need much humbling. I know I'm a hack,'' said Jordan,
a member of the Merit Club. ``I got beat by everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, president of basketball operations for the Washington
Wizards, said his best round at the course was a 69, but that came
``three years ago, when I didn't really have a job.''
</P>
<P>
   As for a pretournament favorite, the NBA legend identified
defending champ Juli Inkster, rather than any of yesterday's
playing partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a putter's course,'' Jordan said. ``I would pick Juli
right now. When she gets that putter straight, she can shoot some
low numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster expressed surprise at receiving the nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored,'' Inkster said. ``I didn't even know he knew who
I was.'' STANFORD OPTIMISTIC
</P>
<P>
   Angela Stanford, a TCU graduate, said she was pleasantly
surprised by how crisply she struck the ball yesterday in her
initial practice round at an Open venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary. I don't like to be hitting it this good this early
in the week,'' said Stanford, 22, an amateur who is making her Open
debut. ``There's too many days left in the tournament for things to
change. But that's a good situation to deal with. I like the fact
that I'm hitting everything solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, an All-American who won four college tournaments
during the 1999-2000 season, practiced yesterday with two-time Open
champ Hollis Stacy and two teammates from the 2000 U.S. Curtis Cup
team: Carol Semple Thompson and Robin Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford said she liked the Merit Club layout (6,540 yards, par
72), which plays to her strength as a long hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fairways are pretty generous, bigger than I expected,''
Stanford said. ``And the greens are holding, at least for now. I
really like it. I think I can do well here.'' ROUGHER ROUGH
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year's event, when unseasonably cool temperatures in
Mississippi prevented the rough from filling in at Old Waverly Golf
Club, fairways at the Merit Club are ringed by thick, 3-inch rough.
Karrie Webb, a five-event winner this season on the LPGA Tour,
predicted the winning score would not be better than 6-under par.
That's 10 strokes higher than Juli Inkster's 16-under total in
1999, a tournament record.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Davies concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to keep it out of the rough,'' Davies said. ``It's
hard to deal with. I tried to move the ball out of the rough
\Ryesterday\R, and it really grabbed hold of my back. It got my
attention.'' nn

chips, is answered in ``Just Curious, Jeeves'' (Ask Jeeves;

MAVS MIGHT LOSE FREE-AGENT GUARDS DAVIS, BUCKNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The agent for Mavericks free-agent guards Greg Buckner and
Hubert Davis said yesterday that his clients might be better served
by leaving Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kauffman said Davis is entertaining several multi-year
offers and Buckner would prefer not having the Mavs match his
three-year offer from Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the league leader in 3-point shooting last season, signed
a six-year deal for $4.2 million with the Mavericks three years
ago, with an opttion to leave after the third season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a deal under market value because that's all the
Mavericks could do back then,'' Kauffman said. ``Hubert waited for
this day with the understanding that he would be rewarded. Now that
looks like it's out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs are offering Davis a one-year deal at $3.5 million.
Davis is in the market for a three- or four-year contract starting
at Sacramento, Boston and New Jersey are among the teams that have
shown interest and Celtics coach Rick Pitino is scheduled to visit
with Davis today.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Mavs' deal is for more this season, Kauffman said
Davis is looking for the security of a longer contract. Kauffman
said he did understand the Mavs' dilemma regarding Davis. The Mavs
could be up to $19 million under the salary cap next season and are
hesitant to sign their free agents, such as Davis and Gary Trent,
to long-term deals.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the promises made to Davis were in the previous ownership.
Kauffman is expected to talk about Davis' situation with new Mavs
owner Mark Cuban today.
</P>
<P>
   With Buckner, the Mavs have the right to keep him by matching
Vancouver's three-year, $2.5 million tender offer. After Buckner
signs the offer sheet, the Mavs have 15 days to match it or the
team will lose him. The first day free agents can sign is Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mavs' glut of guards, Kauffman said the second-year's
guard development is better served with the Grizzlies, where
minutes figure to be more plentiful. Kauffman wouldn't confirm that
the Mavs offered Buckner a two-year deal at the NBA minimum, but
the agent did say the Buckner wasn't happy with the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great situation in Vancouver,'' Steve Kauffman said.
``They stepped up and went after him.'' nn

BEFORE LABOR WAR RAZES BASEBALL, ENJOY WHAT A CARPENTER HAS BUILT
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One does not have to be Nostradamus to foresee dark days ahead
for the sport of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations of Major League Baseball's blue-ribbon
committee _ increased revenue sharing and luxury taxes and other
measures that could curb the free-spending habits of some teams _
aren't likely to pass muster with the union, even if commissioner
Bud Selig can convince the owners to go along.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, another labor war looms. At this time next year,
the stories surrounding baseball will focus on the possibility of a
strike by the players to pre-empt an off-season lockout by the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon to a ballpark near you: no baseball.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason to savor this season, to relish every
unexpected Chicago White Sox victory, every Randy Johnson
strikeout, every Mark McGwire home run (so just where will the big
guy end up on the all-time list when the next strike/lockout forces
him into premature retirement?).
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason to appreciate the feel-good stories of the
year, to thrill at every Andres Galarraga smile, every Kerry Wood
pitch, every Geraldo Guzman victory.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, perhaps the casual fan _ an endangered species to be sure if
there's another work stoppage _ isn't familiar with Geraldo Guzman.
An introduction is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman was a carpenter in his native Dominican Republic less
than two years ago. Monday, he pitched eight shutout innings in the
Arizona Diamondbacks' 7-0 victory against the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a shot in the arm,'' Diamondbacks manager Buck
Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   And not just for a team struggling to hold on to a tenuous lead
in its division. A story like Guzman's _ a story of perseverance,
of overcoming odds, of unlikely success _ provides a lift for an
entire industry that's all too often dragged down by matters of
money.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who should give a bonus to their entire
scouting department, have uncovered several overlooked gems. Closer
Byung-Hyun Kim signed out of Korea. Reliever Vicente Padilla signed
out of Nicaragua. Slugger Alex Cabrera signed after a season with
the China Trust Whales in Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball
League. Productive first baseman Erubiel Durazo signed out of the
Mexican League.
</P>
<P>
   None of those stories, though, can match Guzman's.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman was signed by the Montreal Expos in September 1989, when
he was 16, and pitched decently in two seasons in the Dominican
Summer League. But he sustained a shoulder injury, and was released
after the '91 season.
</P>
<P>
   He went into carpentry, an honorable profession, and figured
that would be his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really think I would be back in baseball,'' Guzman
said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't play baseball for the next six seasons, but, in 1997,
Diamondbacks part-time scout Rafael Mena convinced him to pitch in
weekend pickup games. Junior Noboa, the club's Latin America
coordinator, like what he saw and arranged for Guzman to play in
Taiwan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona then signed the pitcher to a minor-league deal, and,
after Guzman pitched well in the Dominican Winter League, the
Diamondbacks decided to protect him on the 40-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman began the season at Double-A El Paso, and was promoted to
Triple-A Tucson in June. He made it to the majors July 6. Pitching
for a first-place team in front of more than 36,000 fans in
Houston, the erstwhile carpenter held the Astros to one run in
eight innings of a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where he's come from, from what he's had to overcome, I
don't think he would consider this pressure,'' Showalter said.
``Getting through what he's gotten through to get to this point is
a lot more pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman, 27, throws a hard, sinking slider and a lively fastball.
He has allowed only one run in 16 innings. Monday, he struck out
nine, walked three and allowed only two runners to reach second. He
retired 13 of the last 14 batters he faced and threw 70 of his 108
pitches for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   After the club built a big lead, he nailed down the victory.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great story.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman will have time to relive it by reading his scrapbook
during the next strike. nn

ANGELS IGNORE WRITING ON WALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Right fielder Orlando Palmeiro will run through
walls for his Anaheim Angels teammates, as he tried to do Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The problem he had was that the wall didn't give, Palmeiro hit
the ground hard and Ruben Rivera rounded the bases with an
inside-the-park home run that allowed the San Diego Padres to tie
the game with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Garret Anderson didn't trail the play, making it
possible for Rivera to circle the bases. But the Angels benefited
from a misplay by Padres right fielder Eric Owens one inning later
and managed to escape with a 3-2 win in 11 innings before 21,835 at
Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After Owens misplayed Troy Glaus' two-out, 11th-inning blooper
into a triple, Padres closer Trevor Hoffman threw a wild pitch and
Glaus scored the winning run. Al Levine (2-2) pitched a scoreless
10th and 11th to earn the win for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wild finish to what had been a relatively quiet game,
thanks to Angels starter Ken Hill and Padres starter Brian
Tollberg. Hill gave up one run and four hits in six innings;
Tollberg gave up two runs and four hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a 2-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth and were
on the verge of winning it, considering closer Troy Percival
appeared unhittable. He struck out Bret Boone and Ben Davis with
overpowering fastballs. Strike three to Davis was clocked at 98
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Percival got ahead on Rivera 0-2 with two fastballs, then threw
another that Rivera was able to hit to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro raced back on the ball, but instead of playing it off
the wall and holding Rivera to no more than double, he tried to
make a heroic catch. He crashed into the wall and fell hard onto
the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to get it, but it carried a little more
than I thought it would,'' Palmeiro said. ``When I hit the wall, I
had no idea where (the ball) was.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson failed to back up the play from his center-field spot,
making his move to the ball only after Palmeiro hit the ground.
Palmeiro eventually retrieved the ball himself and threw it to
cutoff man Benji Gil, whose throw home to catcher Bengie Molina was
too late to get Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Anderson's failure to back up Palmeiro even more
notable was that only last week the center fielder failed to back
up Tim Salmon in right field on a ball hit off the wall in right by
the Dodgers' Adrian Beltre. Beltre ended up with a triple and
eventually scored the winning run in the 10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that happened and I'll learn from it,''
Anderson said. ``If I was the reason we went extra innings; I'll
take the blame for it. I'm not going to make excuses. If we had
lost the game, I would take the loss on my shoulders. There was a
lot of finger-pointing last year, but that's not going to happen
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't get on somebody for not being where he should be,''
Percival said of Anderson. ``He knows it. If I throw a curveball in
the dirt, the game's over. You start finger-pointing and it gets
right back at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia spoke with Anderson about the play but also praised
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Garret's played excellent center field in his first
full season out there,'' Scioscia said. ``There are going to be
plays he has to learn to react to. He has to experience things. He
gets good jumps on the ball and he's done a good job coordinating
things out here. There are going to be plays (where) he has to make
adjustments, and he will.''

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia is always full
of praise when talking about his players, but when it comes to
Darin Erstad, Scioscia can't say enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say incredible, it's incredible,'' he said. ``What he's
done is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad is on pace to put up many record-breaking numbers, but
none is as prestigious as the single-season hits record. George
Sisler had 257 hits in 1920 for the St. Louis Browns. Erstad has
155, on pace for 267.
</P>
<P>
   The most hits by a player in the 1990s was 227 by Lance Johnson
of the New York Mets in 1996. The last player with 240 hits was
Wade Boggs in 1985 for Boston. The last player with 250 hits was
Bill Terry of the New York Giants in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Tony Gwynn from a distance, but I've never seen
first-hand anybody hit .380 for this long,'' Scioscia said. ``You
put together every part of his game and he's the leading candidate
for MVP. I can't see how he could be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys have more RBI, some guys have more home runs, one
guy is hitting for a higher average. Nobody plays a better
defensive left field. When you package it together, nobody means
more to his club than Darin Erstad.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hasegawa stands out: Shigetoshi Hasegawa has probably been
the best reliever in what has been a solid bullpen this season. He
is 6-2 with two saves and an ERA of 4.40. He leads the pitchers
with 40 appearances, and in his past nine outings he is 1-0 with a
0.57 ERA and 16 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is resilient,'' Scioscia said. ``He's evolved to
where he is flexible. He can pitch middle relief or be a set-up
guy. His stuff is very, very good to be a set-up man. And the good
thing about Shige is he can get the last out of the sixth and still
get you to (closer Troy) Percival (for the ninth inning).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Salmon set to return: Right fielder Tim Salmon had a
cortisone injection in his left shoulder Monday and remained in
Anaheim. He is expected to be in the lineup tonight against Texas
at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon has an inflamed left shoulder, which he aggravated Sunday
in San Diego when trying to make a sliding catch.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the past two games, Salmon has now missed only
four of the club's 94 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Minding their own business: The Angels finished 12-6 in
interleague games this season, but Scioscia said it doesn't matter
much at this point in the season whether they are playing National
League teams or American League teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still a long way away from scoreboard watching,'' he
said. ``It still comes down to realizing these games have a bearing
on the outcome of your season. It still doesn't matter who you're
playing or where you're playing, it's how you're playing. If you're
playing well, you can go into a visiting ballpark and beat good
pitchers like Kevin Brown and Matt Clement. That's still our focus
right now.''

ANGELS IGNORE WRITING ON WALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Right fielder Orlando Palmeiro will run through
walls for his Anaheim Angels teammates, as he tried to do Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The problem he had was that the wall didn't give, Palmeiro hit
the ground hard and Ruben Rivera rounded the bases with an
inside-the-park home run that allowed the San Diego Padres to tie
the game with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Garret Anderson didn't trail the play, making it
possible for Rivera to circle the bases. But the Angels benefited
from a misplay by Padres right fielder Eric Owens one inning later
and managed to escape with a 3-2 win in 11 innings before 21,835 at
Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After Owens misplayed Troy Glaus' two-out, 11th-inning blooper
into a triple, Padres closer Trevor Hoffman threw a wild pitch and
Glaus scored the winning run. Al Levine (2-2) pitched a scoreless
10th and 11th to earn the win for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wild finish to what had been a relatively quiet game,
thanks to Angels starter Ken Hill and Padres starter Brian
Tollberg. Hill gave up one run and four hits in six innings;
Tollberg gave up two runs and four hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a 2-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth and were
on the verge of winning it, considering closer Troy Percival
appeared unhittable. He struck out Bret Boone and Ben Davis with
overpowering fastballs. Strike three to Davis was clocked at 98
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Percival got ahead on Rivera 0-2 with two fastballs, then threw
another that Rivera was able to hit to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro raced back on the ball, but instead of playing it off
the wall and holding Rivera to no more than double, he tried to
make a heroic catch. He crashed into the wall and fell hard onto
the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to get it, but it carried a little more
than I thought it would,'' Palmeiro said. ``When I hit the wall, I
had no idea where (the ball) was.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson failed to back up the play from his center-field spot,
making his move to the ball only after Palmeiro hit the ground.
Palmeiro eventually retrieved the ball himself and threw it to
cutoff man Benji Gil, whose throw home to catcher Bengie Molina was
too late to get Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Anderson's failure to back up Palmeiro even more
notable was that only last week the center fielder failed to back
up Tim Salmon in right field on a ball hit off the wall in right by
the Dodgers' Adrian Beltre. Beltre ended up with a triple and
eventually scored the winning run in the 10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that happened and I'll learn from it,''
Anderson said. ``If I was the reason we went extra innings; I'll
take the blame for it. I'm not going to make excuses. If we had
lost the game, I would take the loss on my shoulders. There was a
lot of finger-pointing last year, but that's not going to happen
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't get on somebody for not being where he should be,''
Percival said of Anderson. ``He knows it. If I throw a curveball in
the dirt, the game's over. You start finger-pointing and it gets
right back at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia spoke with Anderson about the play but also praised
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Garret's played excellent center field in his first
full season out there,'' Scioscia said. ``There are going to be
plays he has to learn to react to. He has to experience things. He
gets good jumps on the ball and he's done a good job coordinating
things out here. There are going to be plays (where) he has to make
adjustments, and he will.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ In an effort to finalize a Middle East peace
accord, President Clinton has delayed his trip to Japan by one day
and will stay at Camp David with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, the White House
announced just after midnight on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now plans to leave for a summit meeting in Japan of the
seven leading industrial nations on Thursday morning, giving him at
least another 24 hours to urge the two leaders to come to an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The chief White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the
president believed that delaying his departure was in the best
interests of the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, described as increasingly intense and heated,
were still going after midnight, the third straight night of very
late talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still at it,'' a White House spokesman, P.J. Crowley,
said at 12:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to stay at Camp David appeared to reflect the up
and down twists of the talks. On Tuesday, it seemed that the
impossible might be possible: an agreement on all the issues,
including Jerusalem. At other times, the temperature fell to the
more sober expectation of a modest agreement and a second meeting
before Mr. Arafat's Sept. 13 deadline for declaring a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   The Haaretz newspaper in Israel reported in its Wednesday paper
that negotiations were focused on what the paper described as a
package of American-mediated proposals on the ``core issues of
borders, refugees and Jerusalem.'' The paper said Arafat had yet to
approve the proposals, implying that Israel had.
</P>
<P>
   The article said that under these proposals Jerusalem would
remain united under Israeli sovereignty, that major settlements on
the West Bank would be annexed by Israel and that Palestinian
refugees could return to Israel only for family reunifications and
without Israel accepting any responsibility for their original
expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the account said, Israel would agree to ``broad
autonomy'' for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, and to accept some
one hundred thousand Palestinian refugees into Israel. According to
this report, Israel could end the summit meeting with a ``partial
accord,'' which would include its recognition of a Palestinian
state.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment on the report from negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Israeli delegation have called home in the
last 24 hours, leaking news that the question of Jerusalem had been
under discussion since Monday and hinting at progress on this most
intractable issue.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Arafat was reported to have called his headquarters
in Gaza and told his aides to spread the word that he was
considering packing his bags and leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were playing to their constituents, and preparing
public opinion for posssible outcomes. Arafat, presumably, was
showing that he was not going to give up on his long-held stance
that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the same script, Barak was demonstrating that he was
a man of reason, and was prepared as Israel television reported
Tuesday night to make ``unprecedented steps'' toward the
Palestinian position on Jerusalem. If an agreement were not reached
on the future status of Jerusalem, Barak would be able to say that
he had tried his best and that the Palestinians were unmovable.
</P>
<P>
   But that Jerusalem was on the table was itself progress over the
seven-year time line of negotiations between the Palestinians and
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astonished by the degree of progress in the last few
hours,'' said an Israeli who was in contact with the delegation by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Only several months ago, Jerusalem was a virtually taboo subject
in back-channel talks in Stockholm, where the top negotiators of
Arafat and Barak met and made progress on a variety of issues.
These included what might constitute the territorial boundaries of
a Palestinian state and what would be the fate of the 3 million
Palestinian refugees scattered across the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But on Jerusalem, there was only generalized talk in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports attributed to Israeli officials, the
Israeli delegation at Camp David was presenting a plan that would
incorporate the Israeli bedroom communities that are now a de facto
part of the capital into the legal entity of Jerusalem. Among the
West Bank settlements near Jerusalem being mentioned are Maale
Advmim and Givat Zeev.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for areas populated by Palestinians, such as
Beit Hanina and the Shuafat refugee camp, to be placed under
Palestinian control. The moves together would provide more
demographic balance in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But this version of a solution for Jerusalem leaves unanswered
the top concerns of Arafat, who has insisted all along that East
Jerusalem, annexed by the Israelis in the 1967 war, should be the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   From the Palestinian point of view, the Israeli plan does not
deal with the heart of the matter: it leaves under Israeli
sovereignty the Old City of Jerusalem, home of the main religious
sites of Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been reports that Arafat has stood firm on
Jerusalem, insisting that no agreement can come out of these
negotiations without Palestinian control over the Al Aqsa Mosque
and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, stood studiously above the
fray on the issue of Jerusalem. He did not utter the word Jerusalem
or mention any of the other substantive matters, such as
Palestinian refugees or the boundaries of a new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, through the release of bits of minutae on who was
meeting with whom or who was not meeting with whom, he depicted
Clinton as a president waiting to do some down-to-the-line
persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   Now into the eighth day, the negotiations have produced a
roller-coaster of emotions, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through various emotions, ranging from moments where
you see promise, to moments where the only thing you see is
frustration,'' Lockhart said. ``Not only the president, the leaders
and all the delegations, have run the entire range over the last
eight days.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the technique of ostentatiously threatening to walk
out has been used in the past _ Anwar el Sadat of Egypt packed his
bags at Camp David 22 years ago, and Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel
did the same at Wye, Md., three years ago _ Lockhart was asked if a
similar approach had been made this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I know of,'' Lockhart said. ``It would be a long
walk. You've got to go all the way down the mountain.''

 &HT;    AMWEST 3-MONTH EARNINGS FALL 21%(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Some of the pain America West passengers have been
feeling lately is finally being felt by the airline.
</P>
<P>
   America West on Tuesday reported a 21percent drop in profits for
its second quarter, largely because of soaring fuel prices and
problems maintaining its planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in two words is maintenance reliability,'' Douglas
Parker, the Tempe-based airline's president, said in a conference
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not delivering to the gate reliable aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline, with the worst reliability record of the 10 major
U.S. carriers, escaped the quarter without the series of
cancellations that stalled passengers in February and earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure on the airline's profits may not abate for the next
few months: jet fuel prices remain high and monsoon weather
typically disrupts flights during summer storms.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, more than 40percent of America West's flights were
delayed, in part due to storms at its Phoenix and Las Vegas hubs.
On-time results only improved a few points in August.
</P>
<P>
   America West's competitors appear to be faring better.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines said Tuesday that earnings surged
13percent, and Southwest Airlines reported a 21percent jump in
profits. Both companies said an increase in passengers offset
higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that America West didn't show sustained
improvement in operations yet,'' said Brian Harris, who follows the
airline industry for Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``It's the
same thing that plagued them in the first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   That is driving away many higher-paying business travelers who
can't depend on America West, according to airline industry
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   More business travelers would flee America West for a more
reliable carrier if they weren't so hooked on its frequent-flier
miles, said John Andrews, owner of Global Travel Management in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, overall bookings remain strong and are in
line with industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   America West filled 73.7percent of its seats in April, May and
June, up 4.7points from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   America West flew 96.1percent of its flights during the quarter,
up from 95percent in the first quarter. The industry average is
98percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel costs are the biggest cloud on America West's horizon. Fuel
expenses were up 57percent in the second quarter, to $83million,
and ticket surcharges did not come close to offsetting the higher
jet fuel costs, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   A $30million increase in fuel expenses in the second quarter
accounted for about 40percent of the company's $75.4million
increase in operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, second-quarter net income declined to $33.5million,
down $8.8million from a year earlier. Earnings per share of 91
cents were 2 cents higher than analysts' estimates. The earnings
included a gain of $6.2million, or 17cents a share, from the sale
of a stake in the Leisure Co., a vacation package business.
</P>
<P>
   America West's revenue was up 9.1percent in the second quarter,
to $604.8million.
</P>
<P>
   The company saved $6million in fuel costs in the quarter by
hedging, or locking in lower fuel prices in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But it decided against much hedging the rest of this year
because there weren't any bargains on the market, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   America West has partial hedging positions on 17percent of its
fuel purchases in the third quarter and 5percent in the fourth
quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That could prove costly if prices don't moderate. Crude-oil
prices, an indicator for jet fuel prices, could level off or
decline as oil nations begin to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said America West must do a better job of preventive
maintenance and be more efficient in repairing aircraft. The
airline is in the midst of an industrywide safety audit by the
Federal Aviation Administration after a review of Alaska Airlines
maintenance following a January crash.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of America West closed down 50 cents on Tuesday, at
$17.75.

<P>
   (Phoenix) - The last time the Phoenix City Council ruled on an
issue involving homosexuality, it faced a crowd of 3,000 warring
citizens monitored by police in riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   This time, nobody noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Which, some say, was exactly the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Aug. 1, same-sex and heterosexual unmarried partners
of city employees will for the first time be eligible to share city
health, life and other insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded benefit was contained in city union contracts that
the council unanimously, and quietly, passed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the city's Gay and Lesbian Employees Association,
unable to get a majority of council members to publicly
support &UR; domestic-partner benefits, said they finally turned for
help to the city's unions, representing about 8,300 of the city's
12,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Most union benefits are routinely extended to non-union
employees to save the city extra administration costs. All five
unions negotiated the domestic-partner benefits into their two-year
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Was this part of a strategy to keep this whole thing quiet?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Michael Ingersoll, assistant personnel director .
</P>
<P>
   Not really.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had that effect. It made it easier for everyone to deal
with,'' he said. ``But I wouldn't call it a deliberate effort to
depoliticize it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not at all what we did,'' said Mayor Skip Rimsza, who
called the new benefits a way to compete in a tight job market.
``It's just part of a modern labor contract. It's not tied at all
to a gay and lesbian issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly Armstrong, a city accountant and founding member of
the Gay and Lesbian Employees Association, has a different take.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terribly political,'' he said. ``We didn't want it to
turn into another debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he wanted to avoid a repeat of the 1992 meeting
where City Council members, two wearing bulletproof vests, faced
off with 3,000 citizens at the Phoenix Civic Plaza over the city's
effort to include sexual orientation in its internal
anti-discrimination policy.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, council members approved the addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a city policy issue, and a public debate was
appropriate, while this is a wage and benefit issue,'' said Vice
Mayor Doug Lingner, who wasn't on the council in 1992. Lingner said
domestic-partner benefits weren't a high priority with the council,
but were important to many union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lets employees know we are listening to them,'' Lingner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The successful pairing of Phoenix's gay and lesbian employee
group with the unions ``will have wide-reaching effects,'' said
Armstrong, who expects more cities to begin using unions to aid in
passing similar measures and prevent political headaches for
elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps by keeping the heat off them,'' he said, ``and the
issue out of their laps.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Phoenix Firefighters Association said they
didn't care about politics, they care about their members and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our members were in a situation where their dependents
and domestic partners were not covered for medical and dental and
some surplus life insurance,'' Capt. Tim Knobbe said. ``That's why
we supported it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was simply an idea whose time had come to Phoenix, Ingersoll
said. Phoenix competes in a market filled with municipalities,
including Tempe, Tucson and eight other Western cities, along with
many private companies, that already offer domestic-partner
benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the city approved domestic benefits for 45 employees, 26
of them to cover heterosexual partners and 19 same-sex partners, at
a cost to the city of $170,000.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, partners must sign a notarized statement annually
that they have lived together for at least a year, are not related
and are financially interdependent, such as owning joint checking
accounts, mortgages or leases.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson has provided domestic-partner benefits to same-sex
couples since 1997. About 15 to 25 of its 5,000 employees sign up
each year at a cost to the city of about $25,000, Tucson officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe started providing benefits to same or opposite-sex
domestic partners last year, a spokeswoman said. Of about 15,500
employees, 23 employees and one retiree take advantage of the
policy, at a cost to the city of $52,000 a year.

LAX, VAN NUYS TO HIKE LOT FEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Daily fees at some LAX parking lots will
increase 50 &UR;  &LR; percent and double at the Van Nuys Airport Flyaway Bus
Terminal under a plan approved Tuesday by the Board of Airport
Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hope the increases will force more people to carpool
or hire airport shuttles to get to Los Angeles International
Airport. They also hope to cut down on long-term storage of
recreational vehicles at Van Nuys. Critics say the increase is just
another financial burden on the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``As passenger facility charges increase, the L.A. World
Airports should do everything in their power to keep parking costs
down,'' said Sherman Oaks resident David Rankell. ``The L.A.
Department of Airports should think about using vacant spots for
long-term storage rather than increasing fees, an additional burden
on area residents.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-member Board of Airport Commissioners unanimously
approved the plan, which includes increasing parking fees at LAX's
Central Terminal Area from $16 to $24 a day, and an increase from
$1 to $2 a day at the Van Nuys flyaway, at Saticoy Street and
Woodley Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The increases are set to take effect Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``At LAX, we're trying to alleviate congestion in the parking
lots and terminal roadways, and at Van Nuys, we're trying to
discourage people from storing RVs and campers long term,'' said
Airport Commissioner Michael DiGirolamo.
</P>
<P>
   Airport leaders say Van Nuys flyaway's current rate of $1 per
day attracted many nontravelers who would store vehicles in the
2,000-space lot for a real bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the increase is small, but our issue was that we
wanted to have a conservative increase at this point because we
don't want to turn patrons away,'' said Van Nuys Airport spokesman
Richard French.
</P>
<P>
   Two dollars a day might not be enough, though, to keep away car
salesman Russ Ballew, who uses the parking lot to store cars for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cheap here,'' he said Tuesday while parking a
Dodge truck that he was getting ready to sell to a Westlake Village
wholesale auto dealer. ``I bring the cars up here from the South
Bay, store them here, and pay $3.50 to take the bus to LAX, where I
have one of my guys pick me up.''
</P>
<P>
   LAX's Central Terminal Area parking fee increase is the first
since 1990. Van Nuys hasn't boosted its rates since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the length of time since the previous increase
that upset Gerald A. Silver, a member of the Airport Citizens
Advisory Committee Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charging people more to park won't work,'' said Silver, who is
also president of Homeowners of Encino. ``They should take the
available land at the Air National Guard site and let residents use
that for storing their boats, campers and RVs. They need a
long-term storage lot that solves their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. World Airports commissioned a study in 1998 to investigate
existing and future traffic conditions and to develop a series of
ground transportation improvements. A rate increase was one of the
improvements the study recommended to reduce congestion and improve
parking that could be done quickly and at low capital cost,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Nuys Airport officials are drawing up plans for expansion
there, French said. Over the next two months, officials will study
how much traffic is turned away every day due to the lack of
parking spots taken by RVs, French said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get a more accurate gauge of how important the parking
spots are to our customers,'' he said.

WEYERHAEUSER SETTLES LAWSUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Moving to avoid a nationwide class-action suit,
wood-products giant Weyerhaeuser Co. will pay homeowners to replace
warped, buckled or failed composite siding installed as far back as
1981, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   California consumers bought nearly 40 percent of the estimated 2
billion board feet of the hardboard siding and plaintiffs'
attorneys estimate that at least 500,000 homes across the nation
could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement covers the Weyerhaeuser product -- wood fibers
compressed with resins and wax -- installed from Jan. 1, 1981,
through Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Among the disgruntled homeowners is Mark Hollinger, who
installed the siding on his Studio City house about five years ago
when the wood paneling gave out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, it shrunk to the extent that all of a sudden there
was a space that I could stick my finger in,'' said Hollinger.
``That stuff should not shrink -- it's prefabricated. This was
supposed to be forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser, based in Federal Way, Wash., stands by the quality
of the product and blamed improper installation for the bulk of the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that it's a very effective exterior product and
that if it's installed and maintained properly it will be just
fine,'' said Weyerhaeuser spokeswoman Eileen Cavanagh.
</P>
<P>
   Settling rather than engaging in a court fight was in the best
interest of the company, shareholders and consumers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Weyerhaeuser said Tuesday that it took an $82
million charge in the second quarter to cover the cost of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the company's second-quarter profits jumped 24 percent
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned $203 million, or 89 cents per share, on sales
of $4.2 billion for the quarter ended June 30. That's up from the
$164 million, or 82 cents per share, on sales of $3 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the company were up 31.2 cents Tuesday to close at
$45.88 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, given preliminary approval in San Francisco
Superior Court on July 12, sets no limits on the number of claims
or potential costs, leading plaintiffs' attorney Chris Brain to
predict that the total payout could be far more than Weyerhaeuser
anticipates.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case, Louisiana Pacific has paid nearly $500
million, some five times more than it expected, to replace
defective siding.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, publicity about the Louisiana Pacific case led hundreds
of homeowners to come forward with complaints about the
Weyerhaeuser product. The case was filed in June 1998 and certified
as a class action in California last year. An effort to take the
class action nationally was under way when the settlement talks
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unreasonably high percentage of the product failed because
it was defective,'' Brain said from his Seattle office Tuesday.
``It's basically a moisture-sensitive, fragile product. The water
causes buckling, warping, a breakdown of the glue bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month the estimated 10,000 known class members will be
notified by mail that they can file a claim. Ads in national media
will follow and the claims process is expected to get under way if
the final settlement is approved Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   An independent administrator will be appointed in coming weeks
to oversee the claims, which will be verified by independent
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Weyerhaeuser will handle siding defects through its
regular warranty process. The warranties will no longer be valid
after the administrator is appointed, Cavanagh said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company had only received a few complaints about
the hardwood siding over the past two decades, less than 1 percent
of which resulted in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   And a company decision last year to halt production of the
siding had nothing to do with the lawsuit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't properly paint or caulk or if the nails are not
flush with the siding it allows water to get in behind the siding
and that can cause problems with warping and deterioration,''
Cavanagh said.

<P>
   PASADENA -- It's a network without a ``Big Brother'' or a
``Millionaire'' that's looking for a ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacock network surprised TV critics Tuesday by admitting it
wants to jump into reality television -- despite the controversy
surrounding the shows -- possibly with a woman in chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ignore this as something that's going to go away,''
said Garth Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment, at the
semiannual TV press tour. ``The public spoke, and they want these
shows. The challenge is not just chasing a clone (of `Survivor' or
`Millionaire').
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find the next genre of this programming that
will have some life. We've heard every variation of putting people
on a bus or train or whatever and have them kicked off one by one.
Nothing we've seen so far is something we're happy announcing (as
being in development).''
</P>
<P>
   It's been reported that NBC was looking at a program developed
in Europe of a woman chained to prospective boyfriends. She must
make a decision who to stay with and who to set free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality programming is definitely here,'' agreed Scott Sassa,
president of NBC West Coast. ``This is not a fad; it's a trend
that's going to be around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The line of what is acceptable has definitely been blurred.
It's a moving target defined by public tastes and public sentiment.
We weren't as aggressive as we should have been in pursuing that
type of programming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa conceded that the network's success in traditional
fictional series programming such as ``ER'' and ``Law and Order,''
and its adherence to a concrete schedule contributed to NBC's
flat-footed response to reality TV's explosion on competing
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success in story form hurts us in (developing reality
shows),'' he said. ``Because of our stability, we're more
vulnerable because we have none of those shows.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC was second in the network ratings last season for the
much-sought-after 18-to-49 viewers coming in behind ABC, whose
success can be planted squarely on ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa has taken some criticism for not jumping into reality
programming sooner and boosting the network's ratings. He was in
for some good-natured ribbing Tuesday during a skit that introduced
him and hinted at his demise at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports had Jack Welch, head of NBC's parent company,
General Electric, and one of the best-known and toughest executives
in the country, pressuring and criticizing Sassa for having missed
the reality programming trend.
</P>
<P>
   Reality programming will likely pop up on NBC next summer,
despite the added costs of generating original programming during
the season when viewers are watching the networks the least. It
has, however, been a success for CBS this summer with its popular
``Survivor'' series and to a much lesser extent with ``Big
Brother,'' which has taken a caning from critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``One smart thing about placing them in summer is that they're
against competition that's not as great,'' Sassa said, admitting
that due to the fact that such programs have such short shelf lives
-- they can't really be repeated or syndicated -- their ostensibly
lower price tag is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tricky field -- one of the trepidations is that you
don't want to inhibit the brand of quality we've established with
NBC over the years,'' Sassa said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa suggested that criticisms that series such as ``Big
Brother'' have debased network airwaves are ``not a good thing or
bad thing. It is what it is. Public sentiment and morals have
changed. I'm not comfortable making value judgments of other
people's programming.''

$1 million OK'd for convention security &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The county Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to
allocate $1 million to pay more than 1,000 sheriff's deputies and
other law enforcement personnel during the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same 3-2 vote, the board refused to give the Los
Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau $500,000 to charter tour
buses to take 4,000 delegates and 6,000 reporters to and from their
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairwoman Gloria Molina's original motion included both
the $1 million and $500,000. But due to a lack of support for it,
she backed an amended proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors bureau officials said they would pay for the 286 buses
out of their own budget.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Lee Baca will use the $1 million for overtime pay of 300
deputies to provide security on the buses, another 100 to 200
support staff, and two teams of 70 deputies each that will remain
on standby to help the Los Angeles Police Department in case of
violent disturbances, Undersheriff Bill Stonich said.
</P>
<P>
   Other police agencies in the county will provide six teams of 60
officers apiece to be on standby. The LAPD and California Highway
Patrol also plan to have thousands of officers at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   To call attention to policy issues, protest groups threaten
disturbances during the convention, to be held Aug. 14-17 at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term `peaceful protest' is an oxymoron when it comes to
some activists,'' Stonich said.
</P>
<P>
   D2K protest spokeswoman Margaret Prescod said the allocation for
the sheriff brings the total police protection budget to
potentially $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's an unnecessary use of taxpayer dollars,'' said
Prescod, who said the growing number of law enforcement officers e
convention is making protesters ``increasingly defiant.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``They hope a 14-foot high fence around Staples Center will
silence us,'' she said. ``They hope keeping us out of Pershing
Square will silence us. (But) we will not be silenced.''
</P>
<P>
   Although county supervisors are nonpartisan positions, the vote
fell along party lines as Democrats Gloria Molina, Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke and Zev Yaroslavsky voted yes and Republicans
Michael D. Antonovich and Don Knabe voted no.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky said officials of the city, the DNC and the local
host committee for the convention -- who had promised to pay for
the convention with private funds -- ``have basically fallen flat
on their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonovich blasted the cost. ``Subsidizing the multibillionaires
and multimillionaires who are co-chairing the Democratic National
Convention with tax dollars is wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayer's Association, said the city, DNC or host committee should
reimburse the county.

HEAT IS HERE TO STAY

   LOS ANGELES -- The San Fernando Valley paid up Tuesday for a
summer of cool temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Chatsworth broke a 2-year-old record when thermometers hit 105
degrees, an afternoon high that was shared by Woodland Hills.
Northridge reached 102. At the University of Southern California,
where Los Angeles' official temperature is recorded and shared with
the rest of the world, the temperature gauge topped out at 87.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotter weather seems more noticeable because it's been
cooler lately,'' said Bruce Rockwell, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service. ``But, in fact, we have days all the time
like this during the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this summer.
</P>
<P>
   June saw only a few temperatures that were slightly above the
normal average of 86 degrees. July has actually seen temperatures
nearly 10 degrees below the normal 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only halfway through the summer,'' Rockwell said. ``A
lot can happen in the next two months.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not good news for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the heat,'' said Marcy Liu, who owns Liu's Won Moo
Hapkido studio in Northridge. ``We've got to keep the air
conditioning on all the time, so my electricity (bill) is going to
be huge this month.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief won't be coming soon. Temperatures in the Valley are
expected to reach the 90s to lower 100s for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a bad thing for people who work outdoors,''
said Brian Budworth, 22, of Glendale, while seeking cool comfort
from Foster's Old Fashioned Freeze in Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely opposed to all this hot weather,'' he
deadpanned before breaking into a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people opposed to the heat are hitting the beach. Chuck
Moore, a lifeguard at Zuma Beach, said the temperatures there have
averaged about 65 degrees during the day, drawing thousands.
</P>
<P>
   For Moore, the working climate is a breeze. Not so for Mark
Dennett, who's working on a supermarket construction project in
Encino and building up a heat immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pain to work outside right now. Once you get outside,
you build up a tolerance, though,'' Moore said.

 PM-MIDEAST-SUMMIT-0719-COX &HT;    CLINTON DELAYS JAPAN TRIP, TAKE MIDEAST SUMMIT TALKS INTO
OVERTIME
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

   THURMONT, Md. _ Casting crucial Mideast peace talks into extra
innings, President Clinton scrubbed a scheduled visit to Tokyo
early Wednesday, hoping to push Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
the final painful steps toward an accord to end their 52-year-old
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to go ahead with a second leg of his long
planned trip to Japan, leaving Washington Thursday morning, a day
later than he was originally slated to depart.
</P>
<P>
   The decision buys Clinton up to 24 additional hours to try to
wrest a peace agreement from a Camp David peace summit that
stretched into its ninth inconclusive day early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials announced the schedule change at 12:30
a.m. (ET) Wednesday, as Clinton and top U.S. diplomats pressed
forward with marathon talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still at it,'' National Security Council spokesman
P.J. Crowley told reporters at 12:30 a.m. (ET).
</P>
<P>
   With the long-term adversaries still at odds over issues
centered on territory, security, the future of Jerusalem and the
question of Palestinian statehood, Clinton determined that
extending the negotiations for one more day offered the best chance
for a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president regrets that he will have to delay his trip to
Japan for one day,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a
prepared statement issued from Camp David, five miles from this
Catoctin Mountain hamlet. ``The president believes this is in the
best interest of the Mideast peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been due to arrive in Tokyo Thursday afternoon for a
bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   After cancelling that leg of his trip, Clinton planned to leave
Washington Thursday morning and go directly to Okinawa _ the
southernmost island in the Japanese archipelago _ in time for what
had always been the main event of his visit: the annual summit of
the leaders of the so-called Group of Eight democratic powers.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations intensified at Camp David late Tuesday, Lockhart
said Clinton's mood has swung with the atmospherics inside Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all of them, you go through various emotions ranging from
moments where you see promise to moments where the only thing you
see is frustration,'' Lockhart said. In a word, though, he
described Clinton as ``determined,'' to broker a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israeli radio was reporting Wednesday morning that
Barak is preparing to leave the Camp David summit talks despite
President Clinton's 24-hour delay. The radio report quoted a senior
Israeli source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak is preparing to return home at the soonest moment after
it became clear to him that the Palestinians are not a true partner
for peace,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many rumors swirling around the tension-filled summit
for eight days, however, the source's comments could not be
confirmed here Wednesday. The participants have been operating
under a strict news blackout, broken only briefly by Clinton
himself in an impromptu interview with a New York newspaper on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Arafat and Barak have run so high that, in
eight days of talks, the two men have held just two direct,
one-on-one meetings, the last of which was Saturday. Since then,
they've encountered each other only informally, at a meal, for
example, with others present and seated between them.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart stressed, though, that the lack of direct talks between
Barak and Arafat doesn't mean the negotiations have stalled. Much
can be done to narrow the gaps between them, said Lockhart, by
using Clinton as an intermediary and a buffer to preserve what
diplomatic goodwill still exists between the Israeli and
Palestinian sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 52 years of debate behind them, so the atmosphere at
times has been tense,'' said Lockhart. ``But they are still working
at it.''

 &HT;    Having fun with form and function
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ken Medernach is on to something. With killer heat and
drought, gardening isn't much fun _ though it surely will be again.
Meanwhile, Ken has found a way to enhance just about any growing
space: those still looking good, as well as the many that are dying
and dragging and flagging.
</P>
<P>
   He goes to his basement workshop and creates all sorts of copper
pieces, including statuary, garden torches, tomato cages. Fountains
and birdbaths with recycling pumps _ and whatever else his clients'
imaginations might come up with.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ken showed off his wares at home in Atlanta (a sign on
the gate says, ``Warning _ Strange Dog''), where he grows a
demonstration garden of copper, seeded and nurtured by the
companionable characteristics of form and function. Gardeners
always have valued the pairing of those traits, seen in so many
plants. How beautiful the form and flowers of the peach tree, the
plum, apple and cherry. How tasty their fruit. Okra's sumptuous
yellow blossom, recalling its lovely cousin, hibiscus, gets outdone
only by the taste of those fine pods sliced and fried in cornmeal.
That's function for you.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Ken's tomato cage, I thought, this would look good in
my garden even if I had my usual short crop of squirrel-devastated
'maters. Similarly, his spiral sprinkler of copper tubing adds zip
and flash even if it's standing dry half the time because of the
drought-imposed cuts in water usage. Ken says he tells gardeners
that, when they buy sprinklers these days, they're ``serving art.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Ken is doing. A 15-year building contractor (also
a buddy with a serious gift for cooking and martini-making), he has
loved metal art and craft since the 1950s, when he held an
after-school job in a Savannah welding shop. Over the years, Ken
has worked mostly with copper but also with steel, wood and stone.
His art, which provides a calming counterpoint to the hassles of
building and remodeling, began asserting itself dramatically about
a year ago, when Ken, mentored by metal artist Ivan Bailey, spent
more and more time working with the copper sheets, tubing and pipe,
using heat, anvil, hammer, band saw and snips to make the metal
what he wants it to be. He first set up on a concrete pad outside,
but when a pignut hickory began throwing down on him, ``I figured
I'd have to move inside or wear a hard hat.'' No, wife Meg and
daughter Erin don't bend and pound metal; ``they kibitz.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many who have seen a pastime grow into a passion, Ken
nurtures a hope for his metal sculpting: ``to at some point make a
living at it and stop being a building contractor.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the appeal of copper?
</P>
<P>
   An avid gardener, Ken likes the metal's aging process,
describing it in ways he might talk about the changes in a shrub or
tree as it matures, grows great bark, changes appearance with the
seasons: ``Copper enhances itself, taking on a rich brown patina
that becomes mahogany. After many years _ it could take up to 20 _
it turns green.''
</P>
<P>
   As garden material, copper gets beautiful competition from
bamboo. But, says Ken, the reeds are good for a mere season or so,
while ``copper is virtually forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Long enough for all the down-pressed, heat-struck,
drought-stricken gardens to recover their form and function. I
hope.

 &HT;    Stage 4 water law: Get lost, newcomers
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With Austin residents using a record-setting
amount of water and putting a strain on the city's distribution
system, we present for your consideration Kelso's Stage 4 Mandatory
Water Conservation Program.
</P>
<P>
   Under Stage 4, people who have lived in Austin less than five
years will have to move to another town on days corresponding with
their home addresses.
</P>
<P>
   If the last digit of your house number is three or six, you'll
have to move out of Austin on Tuesday, so call Mayflower
immediately. Those with house numbers ending in four or five have
to leave Wednesday. Zero and nine have to go Thursday, and one and
eight have to be out of town on Friday. Two and seven gotta go
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The city regrets the inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   City officials realize this isn't fair, especially since so much
gas has been blown up your skirts by the city and the Chamber of
Commerce to get you newcomers to move here. You came here after
much huffing and puffing by the city about what a great place this
is to start up a business. Some of you may have even been offered
tax incentives to sucker you into moving here.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we're sorry that we can't keep up with your demands, but
that's just too darned bad. We just can't get enough water out
there to accommodate the growth. Oh, we'll have this mess fixed in
a couple of years. Improvements to the city's water system should
make mandatory watering restrictions a thing of the past by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? This is 2000. So come back in two years.
Meanwhile, pack the minivan, get your sorry butt out of here and go
somewhere else. I understand Buffalo is nice this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   We'd also like to apologize to you about the roads. You may have
noticed that while we didn't have the water treatment capacity to
serve y'all, we also didn't have enough roads built to service
y'all, either. We just didn't plan ahead. We know it. Boy, are we
sorry. But there's not much we can do about it except tell you to
split. Call us when you get there.
</P>
<P>
   Stage 5, incidentally, is expected to start in a couple of
weeks. Stage 5 is really ugly. You don't even want to hear about
Stage 5.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I'm just kidding about Stages 4 and 5, and right now
we're really in Stage 2 of water rationing in Austin. Under Stage
2, you can water your yard every five days, determined by your
address.
</P>
<P>
   But the really fun part is that if you see watering abuses, you
can call the city at 512-499-2199 and turn in your neighbors.
There's nothing quite as satisfying as ruining somebody's day with
a simple self-righteous phone call to the authorities, is there?
You know that jerk whose kid is learning to play the trombone about
10 feet from your bedroom window? Here's your chance to fix his
horn.
</P>
<P>
   There's probably some old trout living on a fixed income on your
street who is a little nearsighted and therefore is watering about
three inches into the road. Go ahead. Turn her in and make her life
miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could always call 499-2199 and ask them if they
have Prince Albert in a can.
</P>
<P>
   John Kelso can be reached at 512- 445-3606 or at
jkelso(at)statesman.com.

 &HT;    Courting revival of city hub
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1850, the people of Montgomery County, Ohio invested the
staggering sum of $100,000 to erect what U.S. Magistrate Judge
Michael Merz calls the ``finest remaining example in the nation of
Greek Revival Temple-style architecture in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's what Merz would call foresight.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, it seemed that every 30 years or so, somebody
talked about tearing down the Old Court House. In 1968, a developer
proposed tearing down the building and putting a gas station in its
place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's what Merz would call lack of foresight.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, farsighted city leaders stepped in, preventing the
kind of catastrophe that left Merz's mother crying on the steps of
Steele High School before her alma mater met the wrecking ball in
1955.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a BP station instead of the Old Court House. Here was
the site where Ohioians listened to an address by Abraham Lincoln,
rallied after the Great Flood, sold war bonds during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Merz thinks the Old Court House should be restored to its
original grandeur: ``You don't let the front steps of your house
deteriorate. You make them sparkle.''
</P>
<P>
   Merz, who is president of the board of trustees of the
Montgomery County Historical Society, is spearheading the
save-the-courthouse movement, a creative partnership of county
officials and the Historical Society. ``It is one of a kind in the
nation,'' Merz said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hackett, director of the historical society, called Merz
the ``sparkplug'' of the drive to restore the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Merz is so passionate about the Old Court House because
he understands that buildings do have soul, do have character.
``Having spent a good deal of my career in the Public Safety
Building, I know you don't require good architecture to provide
good public service,'' Merz told the Montgomery County Commission
on Tuesday afternoon. ``I'd describe that architecture as 1950s
Greyhound station.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps fearful of committing any further architecture crimes,
commissioners speedily approved the Partnership for History plan,
agreeing to spend up to $3.7 million on the courthouse and $200,000
on a feasibility study on the conversion of Memorial Hall into a
regional history museum, while continuing to serve as a memorial to
veterans. The county initially will spend $1.7 million on
structural repairs, while the Historical Society will launch a $2
million fund-raising drive to finance restoration of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   It's a partnership that has folks on both sides of the aisle
equally excited. ``This is my favorite project, something you don't
generally get to do _ the restoration of a building that is
timeless,'' said assistant county administrator Jim Dinneen.
``We're not restoring it as a museum, but as a center of
government, a live building.''
</P>
<P>
   A place for visiting dignitaries, swearing-in ceremonies,
state-of-the-city addresses, naturalization proceedings. A
community gathering place, once again, instead of merely a
community landmark. ``If you asked people to take a pushpin and
find the center of Dayton, they would pick Third and Main,''
Dinneen said. ``Yet very few go inside the courthouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Merz looks around him and sees millions being invested in the
baseball stadium, the RiverScape riverfront development, the
performing arts center. ``Here we have a gem in the middle of the
city,'' he said. ``How can we spend millions on these other
projects and let the courthouse sit in the heart of the city and
not improve it?''
</P>
<P>
   A good question _ and one that he has challenged all of us to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's what I call foresight.

 &HT;    Florida jury's verdict a reminder to Big Tobacco of its own
mortality
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big Tobacco may still own the Republican majority in Congress,
but the unregulated days of this deadly industry are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   No one believes that the tobacco industry will have to pay the
historic Florida verdict _ $12.7 billion in actual damages and
$144.8 billion in punitive damages to an unidentified half million
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco stocks hardly flinched at the verdict, which will either
be sliced to the bone or, more likely, thrown out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the tobacco companies once again walk away without
shelling out a single red cent, the industry took an old-fashioned
behind-the-barn whipping at the hands of a six-member Miami-Dade
County jury.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors sat through two years' worth of testimony. They
decided on the largest damage award in U.S. history in only five
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the verdict was stunning but not nearly as important
as the message the jurors sent to the tobacco executives and their
protectors in Congress: Tobacco bullies can be beat.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has always enjoyed a privileged status
among other American businesses. It produces a legal product that
cripples and kills hundreds of thousands of Americans annually.
</P>
<P>
   No other product, including all illegal drugs lumped together,
comes close to killing as many citizens as tobacco. Yet this highly
addictive and deadly pro- duct not only remains free of government
regulation, it actually is subsidized by order of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Congress did the tobacco industry its biggest favor in 1965 when
it ordered cigarette packages to carry warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry wanted Congress to do this because the
warning labels made the industry bullet-proof in court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, tobacco industry executives stuffed more money into the
pockets of their congressional protectors and walked away with even
stronger warning labels. The labels were designed to usurp the
ability of Americans harmed by highly addictive tobacco products
from receiving damage awards. Plaintiffs could not easily claim
that they were not warned.
</P>
<P>
   Drug pushers should get Congress to put warning labels on
cocaine and heroin and make their products legal. That should solve
the drug problem. The only difference would be that cocaine and
heroin have never come close to killing and maiming as many
Americans each year as tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida jury sent a message to Congress and Big Tobacco that
warning labels on cigarettes do not inoculate the industry from
liability.
</P>
<P>
   This verdict coupled with several other court decisions in the
past several years indicates that public resentment over the
tobacco industry's history of deceit and arrogance has reached a
critical mass. The tide has shifted. That means Big Tobacco may
lose its traditional clout in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what we know now, it's inconceivable that Congress would
permit the legal sale of tobacco if the product was just now
discovered and offered for sale to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   No lawmaker would dare support the sale of a product described
by medical scientists as more addictive than cocaine and more
deadly than world war.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, tobacco should not now be made illegal.
Prohibition was a disaster. There's no need to repeat that mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida jurors said they wanted to send a message even if
their verdict is overturned. They succeeded. The tobacco industry
can no longer push plaintiffs and jurors around.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the day is coming when protecting Big Tobacco will be a
political death sentence in Congress.

   Q: How did Camp David get its name?
</P>
<P>
   A: Established in 1942 by President Franklin Roosevelt and known
initially as Shangri-La, the presidential retreat was renamed by
President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 for his grandson, David
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The death and career of actor Walter Matthau were well
covered by the media, but I never saw anything about his family.
Was he ever married? Any children?
</P>
<P>
   A: Matthau was married twice, first in 1948 to Grace Geraldine
Johnson, with whom he had two children, David and Jenny. They were
divorced in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1959, he married actress Carol Wellington-Smythe
Marcus, said to be the inspiration for Truman Capote's character
Holly Golightly in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' They met when
Matthau starred on Broadway in ``Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?''
She played a small role in it, acting under the name Carol Grace.
They had one son, Charles, who directed his father in a few TV
movies and the 1996 feature film ``The Grass Harp,'' which also
starred Jack Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that a couple was detained at
Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta because the woman
discovered a pistol in a carry-on bag and reported it to airport
police. The couple had flown to Atlanta from Little Rock, Ark. I
never saw any mention of how the bag got through security in Little
Rock in the first place. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Security guards in Little Rock made Alison Reed walk through
the security checkpoint twice, but never checked her bag, Reed told
police. Security officials at the Little Rock airport wouldn't
answer questions about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, a University of Arkansas student, and her husband, Jason
Combs, had just gotten married and were on their way to Cancun,
Mexico, via Atlanta when the incident occurred in May. After
reporting her discovery of the gun, Reed was held at the airport,
then jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Reed told officers the gun belonged to her mother, Tommie Reed,
since the bag also belonged to her. Her mother, who confirmed that
information with police, said she used it to shoot snakes at the
family farm.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Reed was dropped the next day after her
appearance in Municipal Court, and the newlyweds continued on to
Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I depend a good deal on closed-caption TV. How does it work?
Sometimes the words appearing on the screen are far behind the
spoken words, and there are many spelling errors. Do humans type in
the words, or is it done with computers that decipher speech?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several methods are used to provide subtitles, or printed
dialogue, for hearing-impaired viewers. When programs are
prerecorded for later broadcast, captions are typed into a computer
and added to the videotape before broadcast. If a script is
available, captions also are typed in advance for programs that are
broadcast live, and then are added to the TV signal during
broadast.
</P>
<P>
   For live ``real time'' broadcasts with spontaneous dialogue, the
dialogue is recorded by a ``stenocaptioner'' on a shorthand machine
linked to a computer. The computer produces encoded subtitles.
Unlike normal typists, stenocaptioners can write entire words or
phrases with a single hand motion known as a ``stroke.'' A
``misstroke'' won't have an incorrect or missing letter, but can
have entirely different words or phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Missing or dropped letters also can be the result of
transmission problems or poor reception.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: Did cowboy-western actor Gabby Hayes ever win an Academy
Award?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Nor was he ever nominated for an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was surprised to learn that Elvis Presley had a twin
brother, although the brother died at birth. Was he a fraternal or
identical twin?
</P>
<P>
   A: Identical. Jessie Garon Presley was stillborn on Jan. 8,
1935. Vernon Elvis and Gladys Presley had no other children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Both the play and the movie about Buddy Holly indicated that
his wife, Maria Elena, was pregnant at the time of Buddy's death.
What has beome of either her or the child?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a 1998 interview with the London Daily Telegraph, Maria
Elena Santiago Holly said she lost the child two days after Holly
died in a plane crash in Iowa on Feb. 3, 1959. Eventually she
married again and had three children by her second husband, but
continued to use the name Holly ``for reasons of the estate.''
</P>

   She told the interviewer that she operates an office in Dallas
from which she guards Buddy's image and name. She said she even
helped push through a Texas law that prevents the defamation of a
deceased celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Although she doesn't own the publishing rights _ Paul McCartney
has those _ nor the recording rights to Buddy's songs, she shares
royalties from the 50 songs Buddy Holly wrote, and the 50 or more
that he sang. Even so, ``I'm not rich, rich,'' she said.

   Daily Telegraph, Millis said Deutch had done enormous damage to
American intelligence capability through his ``incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, U.S. News &AMP; World Report said in its ``Washington
Whispers'' column that Millis had called Deutch the ``first-,
second-, and third-worst'' CIA director.
</P>
<P>
   Millis, 47, was found dead of an apparent gunshot wound June 4
in a motel room near Washington. A spokesman for the Fairfax City
(Va.) police said officers were called to the motel because a man
was threatening suicide. When they arrived, they found Millis'
body.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch is a controversial figure. His successor as CIA chief,
George Tenet, stripped Deutch of his CIA security access because
Deutch allegedly violated rules on safeguarding classified
material.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get the absolutely correct time? When I try to
set my antique clocks by TV, I find there's at least a minute's
difference on various channels.
</P>
<P>
   A: Call this number for the master clock at the U.S. Naval
Observatory: 202-762-1401.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In weather reporting, I often see and hear references to a
``trace.'' Can you define that? How many ``traces'' make up an
inch?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the intensity of rainfall is too slight to be measured,
it's called a trace. So there's no way to judge how many traces
make up any measurable amount, because it cannot be measured.
</P>
<P>
   Other rain terms are more definitive. A ``light rain'' is more
than a trace, but less than 0.10 inch (2.5 millimeters) per hour. A
``moderate rain'' falls at rates from 0.11 to 0.30 inch (2.8 to 7.6
millimeters) per hour. A ``heavy rain'' falls faster than 0.30 inch
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you list the U.S. presidents who were related to one
another, and the nature of their relationship?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the book ``Facts About the Presidents,'' John
Adams and John Quincy Adams _ father and son_ were the most closely
related presidents. Others: William Henry Harrison was the
grandfather of Benjamin Harrison; James Madison and Zachary Taylor
were second cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The book adds that genealogists have shown that Franklin Delano
Roosevelt was remotely related to 11 former presidents, five by
blood and six by marriage (names or relationships not outlined). He
also was a fifth cousin of Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why would a Russian be on the Tour de France racing team
sponsored by the U.S. Postal Service? Can you list all members and
their countries? Also, are team members paid?
</P>
<P>
   A: The team has 20 members, 11 of whom are Americans: Frankie
Andreu, Lance Armstrong, Dylan Casey, Tyler Hamilton, George
Hincapie, Marty Jemison, Kenny Labbe, Levi Leipheimer, Kevin
Livingston, Kirk O'Bee and Christian Vande Velde. The others: Jamie
Burrow (England); Julian Dean (New Zealand); Viatcheslav Ekimov
(Russia); David George (South Africa); Benoit Joachim (Luxembourg);
Patrick Jonker (Netherlands); Steffen Kjaergaard (Norway); Cedric
Vasseur (France); and Stive Vermault (Belgium).
</P>
<P>
   They are full-time professional athletes and employees of
Disson, Furst and Partners, a sports marketing firm in Sausalito,
Calif., said Margot Myers of the Postal Service. The slight
exception is Labbe, who is a letter carrier, but he also is paid by
Disson Furst when he races.
</P>
<P>
   Riders are selected to provide ``the best possible talent for
the team'' regardless of nationality, Myers added. ``We want the
riders who will get us the best results.''
</P>
<P>
   Disson, Furst negotiates contracts with the riders and pays
them. Contracts aren't public information, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service pays an annual fee to Disson, Furst and
Partners to be the title sponsor of the team. That amount isn't
made public either, Myers said. Other sponsors include Nike,
Yahoo!, Volkswagen, Trek (bicycles), Thomas Weisel Partners
Merchant Banking, Visa, Gatorade and various equipment suppliers.

</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall reading years ago about scientists seeding clouds in
an effort to produce rain. Whatever happened with that? Is it a
possibility to combat the drought in the Southeast this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Research with cloud seeding began in the late 1940s after
World War II and continues today, but results have been
inconclusive, said Raymond Ban, senior vice president of
meteorology operations at the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   freeze, get heavier, then fall, melt and produce rain. Recent
experiments have used nitrates or other chemicals that attract
water so that even when the humidity is relatively low, water
droplets would condense on the particles and produce rain.
</P>
<P>
   While there's some evidence that seeding may enhance rainfall in
clouds that already are producing rain, there's no way to determine
how much rain would have fallen if clouds hadn't been seeded in the
first place, Ban said.
</P>
<P>
   And so far as a drought-relief measure, cloud seeding is a
``poor bet'' because clouds are scarce during a drought, the
humidity is generally low, and overall the air is sinking, which
inhibits the formation of clouds in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read last year about the ``world's longest garage sale,''
which was in late July or August, as I recall. Will it be held
again this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The dates: Aug. 17-20.
</P>
<P>
   The ``450-Mile Highway 127 Corridor Sale,'' as it's called,
stretches through parts of Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. The
Fentress County (Tenn.) Chamber of Commerce is coordinator of the
annual event, which began in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available online at www.127sale.com or from the
Fentress County Chamber of Commerce, 931-879-9948.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper column about stamps referred to a sheet
reproducing 20 U.S. flags. My husband thinks there was a flag with
49 stamps that was left out. Was this a complete list of U.S.
flags, or only 20 representrative flags?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latter. Your husband is correct in remebering that the
United States had a 49-star flag. It was in use for only one year _
July 4, 1959, through July 3, 1960 _ before the 50-star flag was
introduced in recognition of Hawaii's statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The recent issue of flag stamps wasn't intended to show all U.S.
flags throughout history. As the USPS says, the stamp pane
``loosely charts the evolution of the Stars and Stripes from
colonial times to the present.'' It goes on to say these 20 flags
were selected ``for their significance in American history as well
as for their aesthetic value,'' and cites as a reason for their
choice ``the diversity of the designs.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has had 27 official flags and one unofficial
one (not including variations both official and unofficial found in
the arrangement of stars), according to ``The Flag Book of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of skier Jill Kinmont, an Olympic hopeful who
was in an accident some years ago that left her a quadriplegic? Two
movies in the '70s told her story, but I haven't seen or heard
anything about her lately.
</P>
<P>
   A: Kinmont was a 1956 Olympic contender in the slalom when she
suffered a tragic fall that ended her athletic career. But it
didn't end her life.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has said she suffered depression after the
accident, she was able to turn her life around and began a new
career as a teacher at Bishop Union Elementary School in her
hometown of Bishop, Calif. She retired in 1996, but continues to
volunteer at the school.
</P>
<P>
   She also continues her hobbies, a vegetable garden and painting,
and has become locally well known for her art. Her husband, whom
she married in 1976, frames her works.
</P>
<P>
   The movies about her were ``The Other Side of the Mountain''
(1975) and ``The Other Side of the Mountain, Part 2'' (1978). In
both films, Marilyn Hassett portrayed Kinmont.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The government of South Korea is issuing a medal to veterans
of the Korean War. Do you have any details? How do we apply?
</P>
<P>
   A: South Korea originally offered the Korean War Service Medals
in 1951 to all United Nations forces serving in Korea and adjacent
waters, but at the time U.S. law prohibited members of the military
from wearing medals issued by foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Congress changed that law in 1954, but by then most U.S. service
members eligible for the Korean medal had returned home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Korean government renewed the offer to award the
medal to U.S. veterans of the Korean War who served between June
25, 1950, and July 27, 1953. The Pentagon approved the medal last
August. Nearly 1.8 million Americans are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   To apply, veterans must provide a copy of their discharge paper
(DD-214 or DD-215). National Guard members must provide their
statement of service equivalent (NGB Form 22). Applications will be
accepted through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Air Force Personnel Center, 1-800-558-1404; or
online at www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/awards; or write HQ AFPC/DPPPRA,
550 C St. West, Suite 12, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas
78150-4714.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ABC-TV recently broadcast Peter Jennings' ``The Search for
Jesus.'' Is a videotape available for purchase?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Call 1-800-225-5222 to order the two-hour documentary. A
spokeswoman said the cost is $34.95 plus $4.95 for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The media always refers to the Confederate ``battle flag.''
Was there a national flag for the Confederate States of America,
and a separate ``battle flag''? Or was there only one flag?
</P>
<P>
   A: There were several Confederate flags.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and Bars, adopted in 1861, had white stars for the
seven seceding states in a circle within a blue square at the upper
left of the flag, which had three horizontal stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was believed to look too much like the U.S. flag,
troops carried a battle flag, which was a large red square with an
X shape in blue from corner to corner, within which were white
stars representing 11 states and secession governments in Kentucky
and Missouri. It's this flag, usually in rectangular form, that is
familiar and controversial today.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate national flag of 1863 was white, with a red
square in the upper left corner which also had the blue X shape and
the same 13 stars.
</P>
<P>
   Because that flag was considered to resemble a flag of truce, in
1865 a red vertical bar was added to the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some 10-12 years ago, Allison Atlas and her family launched a
nationwide campaign to recruit volunteers for a national bone
marrow donor program and hopefully to find a donor for Allison
herself. I put my name on the list, but I never heard what became
of her. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: Friends of Allison was the name of the organization founded
by Alvin and Arline Atlas of Bethesda, Md., to fund bone marrow
testing. Their daughter, Allison, died of leukemia in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If something happens to a president-elect after election day
but before he takes office, what then? Is there another election?
</P>
<P>
   A: What would happen in this scenario is uncertain, according to
the National Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Electoral College is technically the official method our
political system uses to select a president. While the election
occurs in November, the Electoral College doesn't meet until near
the middle of December. During that time period, the issues of
disability and succession become murky, said the NTU's Pete Sepp
and Jerry Terry.
</P>
<P>
   The 25th Amendment and associated statutory law provide for
orderly succession if a president dies or declares his incapacity
to serve. Statutory law also addresses instances where a party's
bona fide nominee for president dies or becomes disabled between a
convention and a general election.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Ellis Katz, professor emeritus of political
science and fellow of the Center for the Study of Federalism at
Temple University, ``No provision is made for a disability that
occurs between the general election and the general meeting of
electors. At this time, the only constitutional solution is elector
discretion.'' This would seem to dissuade the holding of another
election, said the NTU.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's International Information Programs Web
site _ www.usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/politics/eleccol/katz.htm _
has posted Katz's commentary.

   Q: What kind of money did the Wimbledon tennis tournament
winners receive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Pete Sampras, the men's singles champion, won 477,500 pounds
(about $723,500, depending on currency exchange fluctuations).
Venus Williams, women's singles champion, won 430,000 pounds
($651,500).
</P>
<P>
   Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde, men's doubles winners, each
received 195,630 pounds ($297,000). Sers married twice, first in
1948 to Grace Geraldine Johnson, with whom he had two children,
David and Jenny. They were divorced in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1959, he married actress Carol Wellington-Smythe
Marcus, said to be the inspiration for Truman Capote's character
Holly Golightly in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' They met when
Matthau starred on Broadway in ``Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?''
She played a small role in it, acting under the name Carol Grace.
They had one son, Charles, who directed his father in a few TV
movies and the 1996 feature film f aromatic plants or bitter herbs.
The red vermouths, most notably from France and Italy, are always
sweet and contain about 130-160 grams of sugar per liter. The white
vermouths, also mainly from France and Italy, can be dry, semidry
or sweet, and contain less than 40 grams of sugar per liter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On June 4, John Millis, staff director of the House
Intelligence Committee, committed suicide while under a probe by
the House committee. No details of the circumstances surrounding
the probe have come out. Is any news available?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not much. According to a British newspaper, reports in
Washington suggested the investigation could be linked to remarks
Millis made in a February speech at the Smithsonian Institution
critical of John Deutch, former CIA director. In the speech,
according to The Daily Telegraph, Millis said Deutch had done
enormous damage to American intelligence capability through his
``incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, U.S. News &AMP; World Report said in its ``Washington
Whispers'' column that Millis had called Deutch the ``first-,
second-, and third-worst'' CIA director.
</P>
<P>
   Millis, 47, was found dead of an apparent gunshot wound June 4
in a motel room near Washington. A spokesman for the Fairfax City
(Va.) police said officers were called to the motel because a man
was threatening suicide. When they arrived, they found Millis'
body.

   Deutch is a controversial figure. His successor as CIA chief,
George Tenet, stripped Deutch of his CIA security access because
Deutch allegedly violated rules on safeguarding classified

Calif., said Margot Myers of the Postal Service. The slight
exception is Labbe, who is a letter carrier, but he also is paid by
Disson Furst when he races.
</P>
<P>
   Riders are selected to provide ``the best possible talent for
the team'' regardless of nationality, Myers added. ``We want the
riders who will get us the best results.''
</P>
<P>
   Disson, Furst negotiates contracts with the riders and pays
them. Contracts aren't public information, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service pays an annual fee to Disson, Furst and
Partners to be the title sponsor of the team. That amount isn't
made public either, Myers said. Other sponsors include Nike,
Yahoo!, Volkswagen, Trek (bicycles), Thomas Weisel Partners
Merchant Banking, Visa, Gatorade and various equipment suppliers.

<P>
   Q: I recall reading years ago about scientists seeding clouds in
an effort to produce rain. Whatever happened with that? Is it a
possibility to combat the drought in the Southeast this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Research with cloud seeding began in the late 1940s after
World War II and continues today, but results have been
inconclusive, said Raymond Ban, senior vice president of
meteorology operations at the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Early experiments used dry ice crystals and, later, silver
iodide particles, he explained. The theory was that these particles
would serve as nuclei upon which water droplets would freeze, get
heavier, then fall, melt and produce rain. Recent experiments have
used nitrates or other chemicals that attract water so that even
when the humidity is relatively low, water droplets would condense
on the particles and produce rain.
</P>
<P>
   While there's some evidence that seeding may enhance rae
selected ``for their significance in American history as well as
for their aesthetic value,'' and cites as a reason for their choice
``the diversity of the designs.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has had 27 official flags and one unofficial
one (not including variations both official and unofficial found in
the arrangement of stars), according to ``The Flag Book of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of skier Jill Kinmont, an Olympic hopeful who
was in an accident some years ago that left her a quadriplegic? Two
movies in the '70s told her story, but I haven't seen or heard
anything about her lately.
</P>
<P>
   A: Kinmont was a 1956 Olympic contender in the slalom when she
suffered a tragic fall that ended her athletic career. But it
didn't end her life.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has said she suffered depression after the
accident, she was able to turn her life around and began a new
career as a teacher at Bishop Union Elementary School in her
hometown of Bishop, Calif. She retired in 1996, but continues to
volunteer at the school.
</P>
<P>
   She also continues her hobbies, a vegetable garden and painting,
and has become locally well known for her art. Her husband, whom
she married in 1976, frames her works.
</P>
<P>
   The movies about her were ``The Other Side of the Mountain''
(1975) and ``The Other Side of the Mountain, Part 2'' (1978). In
both films, Marilyn Hassett portrayed Kinmont.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The government of South Korea is issuing a medal to veterans
of the Korean War. Do you have any details? How do we apply?
</P>
<P>
   A: South Korea originally offered the Korean War Service Medals
in 1951 to all United Nations forces serving in Korea and adjacent
waters, but at the time U.S. law prohibited members of the military
from wearing medals issued by foreign governments. (DD-214 or
DD-215). National Guard members must provide their statement of
service equivalent (NGB Form 22). Applications will be accepted
through 2003.

550 C St. West, Suite 12, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas
78150-4714.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ABC-TV recently broadcast Peter Jennings' ``The Search for
Jesus.'' Is a videotape available for purchase?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Call 1-800-225-5222 to order the two-hour documentary. A
spokeswoman said the cost is $34.95 plus $4.95 for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The media always refers to the Confederate ``battle flag.''
Was there a national flag for the Confederate States of America,
and a separate ``battle flag''? Or was there only one flag?
</P>
<P>
   A: There were several Confederate flags.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and Bars, adopted in 1861, had white stars for the
seven seceding states in a circle within a blue square at the upper
left of the flagu know?
</P>
<P>
   A: Friends of Allison was the name of the organization founded
by Alvin and Arline Atlas of Bethesda, Md., to fund bone marrow
testing. Their daughter, Allison, died of leukemia in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If something happens to a president-elect after election day
but before he takes office, what then? Is there another election?
</P>
<P>
   A: What would happen in this scenario is uncertain, according to
the National Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Electoral College is technically the official method our
political system uses to select a president. While the election
occurs in November, the Electoral College doesn't meet until near
the middle of December. During that time period, the issues of
disability and succession become murky, said the NTU's Pete Sepp
and Jerry Terry.
</P>
<P>
   The 25th Amendment and associated statutory law provide for
orderly succession if a president dies or declares his incapacity
to serve. Statutory law also addresses instances where a party's
bona fide nominee for president dies or becomes disabled between a
convention and a general election.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Ellis Katz, professor emeritus of political
science and fellow of the Center for the Study of Federalism at
Temple University, ``No provision is made for a disability that
occurs between the general election and the general meeting of
electors. At this time, the only constitutional solution is elector
discretion.'' This would seem to dissuade the holding of another
election, said the NTU.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's International Information Programs Web
site _ www.usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/politics/eleccol/katz.htm _
has posted Katz's commentary.

&HT;     MILLER `SERIOUS' ABOUT `MNF' ROLE

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It's late in the fourth quarter, the Miami
Dolphins trail by two but are marching into New York Jets
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, sit down and shut up. Dan and Al have it covered.
</P>
<P>
   But say the same two teams are playing, and the Jets are beating
up on the Fish by four-plus touchdowns in the third, then Mr.
Miller, the stage is yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be the place,'' Miller said recently. ``I don't
think I'm the most savvy guy about doing a football broadcast, but
I know when you got a game that's cooking, the last thing you want
to be is like the guy who is trying to score humor points. They
will crucify you for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, 38-6, beginning of the fourth quarter, everyone is going
to bed _ maybe I can try my act.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, there is never a dog game on ``MNF.''
</P>
<P>
   With just two weeks to go until the Hall of Fame Game and the
first preseason ``Monday Night Football'' telecast, the
reconstituted ABC crew gathered before the Television Critics
Association. It was an interesting but telling blunder that the
first question from a critic was directed to the ``cast.''
</P>
<P>
   It's show time.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a joke. By all accounts, the comic Miller has been
in intense training camp sessions with Al Michaels and fellow
newcomer, Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts, practicing by calling
games from tape.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved with the telecast, from executive producer Don
Ohlmeyer on down, insists that Miller is not there just to provide
comic relief. Rather, ``Dennis will give us an attitude,'' which is
what Ohlmeyer also hopes to get from Fouts and fellow newcomers
Melissa Stark and Eric Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Miller insists that while he comes with a fan's perspective and
a comic's wit, he is not going to be lobbing endless punch lines.
Nor will he be lost by the complexities of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's football _ it's not like I'm on the medical channel,''
Miller said. ``I just don't want to convey that I'm going to be the
court jester. My prime directive is to be an integral member of a
three-man booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Miller is not treating this ``Monday Night Football'' gig
as a joke. He is 46, looking to go mainstream, and incredibly
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very serious about this _ very,'' said play-by-play man
Michaels, whose job will be to serve as traffic cop and know when
to go to Fouts (himself having a pretty decent sense of humor) or
Miller. ``He wants to do this perfectly ... he knows when he has to
be out (there); he has a great sense of timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for dropping obscure cultural references, Miller said he
will not dumb down for ABC. But the man known for launching F-bombs
on his HBO show ``Dennis Miller Live'' is prepared to go network:
Expect to hear him say ``Golly!'' a lot. Here's a hint: It's a code
word.
</P>
<P>
   He is counting on you knowing what he means.

 &HT;    CHINESE PROVINCE CRACKS DOWN ON CHEATING HUSBANDS, AND THEIR
CONCUBINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, just
over the border from high-flying Hong Kong, there's a saying: If a
man doesn't keep a concubine, he's not successful.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are a lot of successful men in Guangdong. So
successful, in fact, some men have acquired not only a second
``wife,'' they have even a third or a fourth. It's called bao ernai
in Chinese, or taking a second wife. And like the concubines of
traditional China, she gets money, gifts and usually even a house
to live in from her married lover. She often even bears him
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Guangdong, the bao ernai phenomenon has reached the point
where we can no longer ignore it,'' Cui Shuhui, an official of the
state-run All-China Women's Federation recently told the Yangcheng
Evening News, a Guangdong newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so serious, local law enforcement could
no longer wait for China's outdated divorce laws to catch up. So
last month, four provincial law-enforcement and judicial agencies
jointly issued a legal ``opinion'' _ which they claim has the
weight of law _ that makes it easier for women to divorce husbands
who bao ernai.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion entitles the wife to half of everything her husband
has bought for his mistress, even if the item, such as a house, car
or stocks, is in the other woman's name. If the wife has no hard
evidence that her husband has been cheating, the opinion allows
police to help her obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   Local women's groups that had been demanding something be done
to protect the financial interests of wives are over-joyed. Since
the legal opinion was announced, the phones at local offices of the
All-China Women's Federation, which operates at all levels of
government, have been ringing off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   The Yangcheng Evening News called the opinion a ``huge bomb.''
One reporter wrote that in two days of interviewing women, the
phrase he heard most often was: ``I was so excited I couldn't sleep
all night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guangdong opinion comes just as the communist National
People's Congress, China's legislature, is in the midst of debating
a badly-needed revision of the marriage law. Chinese society has
seen huge changes since the law was last updated in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce rates have more than tripled; domestic violence has
increased; and marriages now are based more on individuals'
feelings rather than the old standard of political or familial
ties. The current law gives few guidelines on how to handle issues
such as support payments, splitting assets and custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to amend the law comes at a time when Chinese
society is increasingly troubled by such social problems as
proliferating concubinage and worsening family violence,'' said
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce rate was just 3 percent in 1980 but has climbed to
13 percent. In large cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, it is
well over 25 percent. A 1998 survey in Shanghai found that 36
percent of divorces were due to incompatibility and 22 percent to
extramarital affairs, according to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Lu Ying, who teaches marriage and family law at Zhongshan
University in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, said
women often lose out in divorce because the husband can easily hide
his assets from the court. Moreover, housing for many people is
still provided by the employer, usually the husband's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many divorce cases, the woman would be left with nothing,''
said Lu. ``No husband, no child, no house.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While many of the men with modern-day concubines are from Hong
Kong and Taiwan, plenty of mainland men are indulging as well. The
Communist Party views the issue as not only a matter of morality
but a problem that could threaten social stability, one of its
paramount concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just foreign businessmen who are taking second
wives,'' said Hu Kanghsang, an official of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee who is working on the marriage law
revision. ``It also includes domestic factory heads, executives,
private businessmen, even party cadres. This phenomenon seriously
goes against socialist morality and customs . . . and seriously
impacts social stability and family planning.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Although concubines are most common in Guangdong, they exist in
other prosperous regions also. In Shanghai it's called ``keeping a
golden canary,'' that is, a lovely, frail creature who lives in a
cage and comes out only when you take it out. In Beijing, she's
called a ``little honey.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a status symbol,'' said Liu Donghua, a lawyer at the
Center for Women's Law Studies &AMP; Legal Services of Beijing
University. ``Men think, 'Everyone else is doing it,' so they just
copy.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of cases at the non-profit law center are
for divorce. Of those, almost one-fifth involve extra-marital
relations. To be sure, cases of adulterous women are numerous also
but are vastly outnumbered by philandering husbands. Some men even
bring their mistresses home, Liu said, forcing wife and concubine
to live under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Guangdong opinion doesn't go far enough. Liu, for
example, believes that not only should the husband be made to pay
compensation, so should the other woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third party has to take responsibility for destroying a
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other legal experts in China believe that would be allowing the
law to go too far into the moral realm. Even allowing police to
help gather evidence of adultery, as the Guangdong opinion does,
opens personal lives up to dangerous abuses of police power, says
sociologist Li Yinhe, a researcher at the state-run Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Such disputes have been dividing feminists since a revision of
the marriage law was first proposed in 1995. Passage this year is
unlikely, experts say.

<P>
   TRES ESQUINAS, Colombia _ The flood-swollen Orteguaza River
slices through the Colombian lowlands, its dirty brown water
straining at banks that give way to swampy clumps of thick forest
and patches of cleared land.
</P>
<P>
   Bright green coca plants and poppy fields dot many of the
clearings, verdant cash crops in a land of hunger and war.
</P>
<P>
   This remote territory in Colombia's far south has become ground
zero in the escalating conflict against narcotics traffickers, and
Marxist rebels who have tapped the drug trade as a major source of
revenue to fuel their 36-year-old insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cocaine and heroine grown here is destined for the
United States, which recently approved a $1.3 billion aid package
to help Colombia fight its drug war. Colombian pilots will fly a
fleet of 60 U.S.-supplied helicopters, providing security and
transporting forces that will wipe out remote drug laboratories and
fumigate illicit crops from low-flying crop dusters.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the high-tech U.S. technology, the Amazonian
headwaters of southern Colombia are a primitive, hostile region.
There are few towns, fewer roads and thousands of square miles of
dense green growth perfect for hiding illegal operations _ and
enemies. The muddy brown streams are ideal for transporting
contraband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rivers are the super highways here,'' said General Mario
Montoya, head of a new Colombian anti-narcotics task force. ``They
carry everything they need for the production of cocaine on those
rivers. Ten years ago, there was very little coca here, but today
this area has the highest concentration of coca production in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear the jungle _ and Colombia's tortured landscape of
leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitary groups, drug barons, a
questionable military and rancorous domestic politics _ may swallow
up the American aid, drawing the U.S. further into a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a profound and dramatic shift in focus from
supporting a police force in a friendly country to supporting an
army engaged in a civil war,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
shortly after Congress approved the aid package. ``I wondel we read
the first news story of some of this equipment showing up in the
hands of rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insist the aid is strictly for fighting drugs,
not to help Colombia fight its civil war. But Montoya admits that
in the remote wilds, the two are often intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC, with all its guns and all its evil, is involved in
the drug trade,'' he said, referring to the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest and oldest guerrilla
group. ``If the guerrillas are involved in drug trafficking, as we
know they are, we're going to attack them.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, a nation of 39 million, supplies an estimated 80
percent of the world's cocaine. It is also a growing source of
heroin. Both drugs are worth billions on the streets of America and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There are no accurate figures on how much the country's
guerrillas gain by taking a cut from the poor farmers who grow the
crops and the traffickers who process and smuggle it, but some
Colombian newspapers have cited figures in the hundreds of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   With the guerrillas and drug lords so powerful, Colombian
President Andres Pastrana stunned the nation 18 months ago by
starting peace talks with the FARC. To show his goodwill, he
ordered Colombian troops out of a Switzerland-sized chunk of the
nation that has become de facto FARC territory.
</P>
<P>
   But the peace talks have since stumbled without much real
progress, and Pastrana's popularity has plummeted. Many Colombians
fear he has given the guerrillas too much without getting anything
in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas are terribly strong because they have so much
money from drug trafficking,'' said Eduardo Gomez, who retired from
the Colombian military and now works in Bogota, the capital. ``We
have no confidence in our institutions. The money from the U.S.
will be wasted, because our army, our police and our government are
corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates on FARC strength range from 17,000 to 22,000 soldiers
in the field, but they are only one of the warring forces in
Colombia. Another guerrilla group, the Army of National Liberation
or ELN, has some 5,000 soldiers, while right-wing paramilitary
groups, which also take tribute from drug traffickers, have an
estimated 7,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's military _ the army, air force and navy _ has about
120,000 personnel. It also has a reputation for corruption and
human-rights abuses, with many observers citing close ties between
army officers and the paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has named his bold new strategy for saving the country,
``Plan Colombia.'' The U.S. aid - which will mostly fund military
equipment, but also provides money for crop substitution and other
social programs _ will be supplemented by more than $600 million
for social programs that Pastrana recently obtained from European
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his four-year term in office, however, Pastrana
has been hamstrung by a corruption scandal and bitter relations
with the national congress. He recently appealed to Colombians to
be more positive, saying, ``I'm tired of the bad news that does not
let us see and construct a better country for all.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more than a positive attitude to vanquish
Colombia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Plan Colombia will escalate the war on both
sides,'' said Marco Alberto Romero, a political scientist at
Colombia's National University. ``If the guerrillas resist this
first campaign, the logic will be that the U.S. will increase its
aid and become more committed to the Colombian conflict. It's a
very complicated problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero believes the focus should be on providing more
opportunity for the rural peasants who grow the coca and poppy. The
peasants now have no alternatives, and wiping out their only cash
crop by fumigation could foul the environment, sicken the poor
farmers and create a new wave of internal displacement within
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have regional consequences,'' he said. ``The drug
trafficking affects the whole Andean region. This could lead to the
breakdown of the peace talks in Colombia, but also could trigger an
arms race. Already both (the FARC and the government) are building
up their forces even as they are participating in the peace
talks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the front lines, Gen. Montoya downplays the criticism and
confidently predicts victory.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent briefing for reporters complete with slides,
tapes of radio conversations among drug traffickers and maps laying
out the alignment of forces, Montoya said the new U.S. aid _
especially a fleet of about 30 sophisticated Blackhawk helicopters
_ will tip the balance in favor of his 3,000-man force in the
southern region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get the helicopters, we can really go to work,'' he
said. ``They will give us the element of surprise and mobility. We
will move in and immediately neutralize the crops.''
</P>
<P>
   Boats patrolling the rivers to intercept cocaine shipments, as
well as the supplies of gasoline, cement and chemicals needed to
convert the coca leaves into cocaine will augment the force.
</P>
<P>
   The only role for U.S. troops _ no more than a few hundred at
the time _ will be to train the Colombian pilots and soldiers, and
help operate sophisticated surveillance equipment the U.S. will
send, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   There are reports that the guerrillas may have _ or will soon
obtain _ surface-to-air missiles or other advanced weapons to shoot
down the helicopters. Critics also warn that the drug farmers and
traffickers will simply move elsewhere once the Colombian offensive
picks up steam.
</P>
<P>
   But Montoya remains upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These groups will try to defend their operations because there
is lots and lots of money involved in narco-trafficking,'' he said.
``But we're prepared militarily for this fight. We're in this for
the long haul.''

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN _ They are one of the world's few
remaining bands of Marxist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Fidel Castro's rag-tag army of Cuban peasants in the
1950s or leftist insurgents dodging around Central America in the
1980s, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are flush with
cash _ lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC, as they are known by their Spanish acronym, have
tapped a 1990s source of revenue: drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted with AK-47 rifles, black berets, new uniforms and
knee-high black rubber boots, these guerrillas have become a
battle-proven force of soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   They control huge swaths of the Colombian countryside, and buy
their guns and equipment with tribute paid by poor farmers who
raise coca and poppy, as well as drug traffickers who process and
smuggle the contraband destined for the streets of Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   They also make millions by kidnapping, holding their victims _
sometimes children _ for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   But their connections to Colombia's notorious drug industry are
what have propelled the FARC from a backwater group to powerful
military force with a sophisticated propaganda machine. Their top
negotiators now hobnob with visiting diplomats and recently toured
several European countries with a delegation aiming to bring peace
to Colombia. They even have their own Website.
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents, however, bristle at the notion that the FARC
are anything more than ruthless, ideologically driven killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't answer to anybody on this earth or in the next
life,'' said Gen. Mario Montoya, head of a new Colombian
anti-narcotics task force that will spearhead a campaign funded by
a $1.3 billion U.S. anti-drug package. ``They make huge amounts of
money from the drug trade. Coca grows like a weed here, and they
are the middle men.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bulk of their forces still hide in the mountains
and the jungles, the FARC now have their own territory where they
walk the streets free from fear of attack by government forces.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to jump-start peace talks, Colombian President Andres
Pastrana pulled his troops out of a Switzerland-sized area in
southern Colombia in January 1999, in effect creating a safe haven
for the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   But after starting amid great hopes, he peace talks have made
little progress, with the two sides barely able to agree on a rough
list of topics to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FARC have consolidated their hold on their turf,
turning San Vicente _ a town of about 15,000 _ into something of a
rebel showcase.
</P>
<P>
   Few tourists venture to the town, which can be reached by
regular commercial airline service. Guerrilla checkpoints dot all
roads leading into the enclave, with armed FARC soldiers ordering
riders out of cars for searches and questioning.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months the guerrillas have welcomed journalists,
perhaps eager to tell their side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence that we can construct a new government for
Colombia,'' said Fidel Rondon, a member of the FARC commission
holding peace talks with government negotiators in a rural village
called Los Pozos, about 40 minutes from San Vicente. ``We want a
better future for all Colombians. This nation has been ruled by a
violent political class. The people of Colombia no longer believe
in this government.''
</P>
<P>
   San Vicente is the largest of five small towns in the FARC-held
territory. A muddy farm center on the banks of the Caguan River, it
hums with activity _ from farmers buying supplies for nearby cattle
ranches, children running through the streets and residents
scooting past on small motorcycles, the favored form of local
transport.
</P>
<P>
   The town government still functions as it did before the FARC
came, collecting taxes and providing services. But the National
Police left with the army, and while there is a new municipal force
of baton-wielding local cops, the FARC guerrillas with shouldered
automatic rifles and hand grenades clipped to their belts are
clearly the real power in town.
</P>
<P>
   The local courts collapsed when the judges fled, and they've
been replaced by a FARC system of justice that includes a complaint
center where citizens bring gripes about everything from disputes
with neighbors to domestic squabbles. There are numerous reports
that a separate FARC tribunal deals sternly with those accused of
spying for the government, sometimes imposing death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   FARC billboards urge the people toward ``a new Colombia,'' and
extol the ``Bolivarian Movement,'' a campaign named after South
America's revolutionary hero, Simon Bolivar. There are also banners
decrying government torture and crop fumigation aimed at the coca
plots that support many poor farmers _ as well as the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a rebel information office just off the town
square, where an attractive young woman dressed in fatigues and a
beret takes requests from visiting journalists, holding court in a
spotless room decorated with photos of Marx, Lenin and Latin
America's modern leftist hero, Che Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople shrug when asked about their strange status, many
reluctant to talk openly about their de-facto rulers. But they
admit there is now peace in San Vicente _ which, before the FARC,
suffered attacks from all sides in the long-running civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the guerrillas came, nobody wanted them to come,'' said
Jorge Solis, a long-time resident. ``But now we have had peace, so
everybody is happier. The economy is good, people have work, and
there aren't bodies in the streets like before. Most people don't
favor one group over the other. They just want peace and to be able
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The FARC were born in the rough countryside outside San Vicente
in the 1950s, when Colombia was torn by political violence between
its dominant political parties. The group formed to advocate for
the poor peasants caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, FARC power waxed and waned. Almost written off
15 years ago, the group has transformed itself into Colombia's most
powerful insurgent force through money earned from the drug trade.
Colombian media estimate the group earns hundreds of millions each
year through ``taxes'' imposed on drug growers and smugglers, and
the FARC now boasts around 20,000 soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the guerillas rule by terror, forcing
young peasant youths into their ranks or seducing them with the
promise of a gun, comradeship and a monthly salary of 400,000 pesos
(US$200), more than double the average wage.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, international diplomats and Colombia's press
have blasted the FARC _ as well as other guerrilla bands and
right-wing paramilitary groups _ for their reliance on kidnapping.
Across Colombia, there is growing outrage that some 200 children
were among the estimated 3,000 kidnapping victims nationwide last
year.
</P>
<P>
   FARC leaders deny kidnapping children, although they admit
taking adults for ransom to raise funds. They also steadfastly deny
involvement in the growing or shipping of cocaine and heroin,
although they admit ``taxing'' those who do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We condemn narco-trafficking,'' said Andres Paris, one of the
group's top negotiators. ``It's not of the guerrillas. It's an
economic and social reality in Colombia. We charge taxes on the
biggest business in our area. It's a political tax to finance the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future holds for Colombia, it's clear the FARC have
now become a powerful, well-financed guerrilla machine that can't
be ignored and won't easily be defeated in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being chastened by the demise of many Marxist regimes
around the world, FARC leaders seem more committed and confident
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare us to Russia,'' said Rondon, who once taught
school in rural Colombia. ``We have taken the ideas of Marx but
applied them to Colombia. As the crisis between the rich and poor
in Colombia has grown, we've grown. And as the Army of Colombia has
modernized, so have we.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Take a walk in Brixton.
</P>
<P>
   Four miles from the gray postcard propriety of Westminster,
Brixton is a riot of noise and color.
</P>
<P>
   It pulsates with hefty bass riffs and reggae rhythms dancing
from knee-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD stores and
appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market, you hear
the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish _
occasionally even English.
</P>
<P>
   The market's shops and stalls offer London's best Afro-Caribbean
and African fare _ plantains, caramel-colored smoked fish,
thermo-nuclear peri-peri sauce and yams. The air smells of scorched
coffee, limes and coriander.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, bright red double-decker busses _ the symbols
of familiar London seem drab in Brixton _ pass through, a reminder
that the heart of the Anglo-Saxon universe is a 10-minute commute.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Parliament House with Big Ben and Churchill's
statue, however, Brixton now is a part of the fiber of modern
London, a city rapidly being redefined by its ethnic variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is this that is
igniting such energy, buzz and creativity,'' wrote Yasmin
Alibhair-Brown, a columnist for the Independent newspaper and
author of Who Do We Think We Are: Imagining the New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation started at the end of World War II, when
Britain began accepting a substantial number of immigrants from
countries that for the most part had been colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Most settled in London's boroughs. Today, nearly 25 percent of
Londoners are from non-white minorities. In boroughs such as
Brixton, the percentage of non-whites is 40 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Wilson, a Brixton resident, came to London in 1952 from
Spanish Town in the hills above Kingston, Jamaica. Wilson, an
electrician, has raised children and now grandchildren in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still Jamaican,'' he says, buying a pair of fresh chickens
for his wife to grill. ``But these young ones, they are Londoners _
not Englishmen, mind you, but Londoners.''
</P>
<P>
   People here insist that London is no melting pot, as immigrants
don't shed their cultural identities in the process of
manufacturing a new one. Nor is London seen as a multicultural
mosaic on the order of Toronto or Chicago, which have ancient,
separate and sheltered ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In London, things are more fluid. With notable exceptions, few
neighborhoods could be called ``Little Delhi,'' ``Little Jamaica,''
or ``Little Lagos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evening Standard perhaps said it best when it described
London as an ``ethnic kaleidoscope _ always shaking into a new
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling city of 8 million has 33 distinct ethnic
communities speaking 300 languages. One central London school
recently reported that its 800 students speak 79 languages at home.
At school they are unified in their struggle with English.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this multi-ethnic seasoning is palpable. In fact,
the favorite food in Britain no longer is fish and chips or
steak-and-kidney pie _ it's curry.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has sparked a wave of creativity matched only by
the bell-bottomed Carnaby Street revolution of the mid '60s that
introduced wide belts and frilly Edwardian suits to millions of
American closets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other place in the world like this city today,''
London musician Aki Navaz said recently in The New York Times. ``I
used to look through the windows at the white world. Now I know
that white kids are looking through mine, wanting to join in with
this energy.''
</P>
<P>
   London even has become a cultural center for other cultures. In
June, the best and brightest of ``Bollywood'' - the Indian version
of Hollywood - flocked to the Millennium Dome for the Indian
version of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   With Britons, ``Bollywood'' takes a backseat only to Hollywood.
A new 30-screen cineplex is dedicating six screens to Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Three Bollywood movies, known as extravagant productions of epic
lengths and lavish musical interludes, entered the United Kingdom's
top 10 list this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mambo Sharman, one of the Bollywood awards organizers, said he
was amazed at this trend. ``Often I go past a cinema in London and
look at the queues for Bollywood films and there are as many white
faces as Indians,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It makes me
feel guilty for not going as often as I should myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Tussaud's, the venerable British waxworks museum, soon
will add its first ever Bollywood display. And Andrew Lloyd Webber,
the superstar British musical machine with a keen sense of the
popular, is preparing to stage Bombay Dreams, a new musical set in
Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an exaggeration to say non-whites now dominate the
London entertainment scene, the ethnic variety is nevertheless
remarkable. A number of black and Asian comedians _ notably Nina
Wadia and Meera Syal _ have become household names.
</P>
<P>
   Many young Britons are plugged in to Fun-Da-Mental, a
multiracial group that plays a fusion of Persian jazz, rap and
hip-hop. The music produced by these hip, young musicians as well
as the established Jazzie B of Soul II Soul reflects a mix of
original cultures shaken but not stirred in the traditions of
London.
</P>
<P>
   The British cutting edge is layered with artists such as Steve
McQueen, the black Turner Prize winner whose haunting film The Bear
has received praise at the new Tate Modern museum.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   These changes have not come comfortably to all Britons.
</P>
<P>
   David Irving, the historical writer and accused Holocaust
denier, earlier this year said he spoke for many of his countrymen
when he expressed longing for the days when Britain was more
British.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could go to Heathrow airport, take a 747 and fly back
10 hours later to find England as it used to be,'' he said during
his libel trial against Emory University professor Deborah
Lipstadt. ``I can't say I applaud uncontrolled colored immigration.
I regret the passing of old England.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party has found political capital in attacking
what it describes as a flood of immigrants from Asia and Africa,
with the implied threat to British culture and institutions if the
torrent isn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has responded by
tightening immigration rules. It has become so difficult to enter
Britain that a thriving black market has emerged in trafficking
immigrants. Last month, 58 Chinese immigrants were found dead in
the back of a vegetable truck where they suffocated while being
smuggled into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   For all the worries about immigrants, Britain remains very white
_ 94.6 percent white, according to government statistics. Away from
London and other large cities such as Birmingham and Manchester,
non-whites are rare. About half of all the non-whites in Britain
live in London.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, blacks _ mostly from the Caribbean _ constitute 1.6
percent of the population. Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis _
generally lumped together and called Asians _ constitute about 2.7
percent. The balance includes Chinese and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because the minority population is much younger than the
white population, the government estimates that in 20 years, the
percentage of non-whites in British society will double.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the predictable tensions over change, blacks and Indians
often say they believe for the most part they have been accepted _
if not embraced _ by whites.
</P>
<P>
   When Rasshied Din started in business a few years ago, he was
warned not to use his own name because the English would think he
was a ``second-hand sari salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Din Associates is now the seventh-largest design consulting firm
in the country with a client list that features retail and fashion
heavyweights such as Tommy Hilfiger and Selfridges.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1980s, Din was a pioneer. ``People would call
up and say, 'Oh, you speak English,' as if they were surprised,''
he said. ``It seems strange looking back, but you have to remember
that this was before there were any prominent Asians in business or
in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the changes, race doesn't occupy the august station in
British society or politics that it holds in the United States. For
many Londoners, it is a topic like sex and religion, best not
discussed over the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. A strong minority vote was essential to
Ken Livingstone's election in May to become London's first elected
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone now represents the largest base of constituents in
the country, potentially elevating the agenda of London minorities
to national importance.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Hall, a respected black intellectual, believes Britain is
becoming more like the United States in its racial dynamics _ if
perhaps in a gentler, more civil fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Britain going to accept its diversity and become more
humane? We don't yet know,'' he said. ``Yes, things are better in
some ways, but a lot of people feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there's no going back in the fundamental change in the
nature of London, making the city a unique and fascinating
experience, said Trevor Philips, a black politician and social
critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hum of London's streets cannot be replicated,'' Philips
wrote recently. ``It's the sound of a hundred cultures softly
clashing, sometimes melding, occasionally grating uncomfortably.''

 &HT;    CHINESE PROVINCE CRACKS DOWN ON CHEATING HUSBANDS, AND THEIR
CONCUBINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, just
over the border from high-flying Hong Kong, there's a saying: If a
man doesn't keep a concubine, he's not successful.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are a lot of successful men in Guangdong. So
successful, in fact, some men have acquired not only a second
``wife,'' they have even a third or a fourth. It's called bao ernai
in Chinese, or taking a second wife. And like the concubines of
traditional China, she gets money, gifts and usually even a house
to live in from her married lover. She often even bears him
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Guangdong, the bao ernai phenomenon has reached the point
where we can no longer ignore it,'' Cui Shuhui, an official of the
state-run All-China Women's Federation recently told the Yangcheng
Evening News, a Guangdong newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so serious, local law enforcement could
no longer wait for China's outdated divorce laws to catch up. So
last month, four provincial law-enforcement and judicial agencies
jointly issued a legal ``opinion'' _ which they claim has the
weight of law _ that makes it easier for women to divorce husbands
who bao ernai.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion entitles the wife to half of everything her husband
has bought for his mistress, even if the item, such as a house, car
or stocks, is in the other woman's name. If the wife has no hard
evidence that her husband has been cheating, the opinion allows
police to help her obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   Local women's groups that had been demanding something be done
to protect the financial interests of wives are over-joyed. Since
the legal opinion was announced, the phones at local offices of the
All-China Women's Federation, which operates at all levels of
government, have been ringing off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   The Yangcheng Evening News called the opinion a ``huge bomb.''
One reporter wrote that in two days of interviewing women, the
phrase he heard most often was: ``I was so excited I couldn't sleep
all night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guangdong opinion comes just as the communist National
People's Congress, China's legislature, is in the midst of debating
a badly-needed revision of the marriage law. Chinese society has
seen huge changes since the law was last updated in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce rates have more than tripled; domestic violence has
increased; and marriages now are based more on individuals'
feelings rather than the old standard of political or familial
ties. The current law gives few guidelines on how to handle issues
such as support payments, splitting assets and custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to amend the law comes at a time when Chinese
society is increasingly troubled by such social problems as
proliferating concubinage and worsening family violence,'' said
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce rate was just 3 percent in 1980 but has climbed to
13 percent. In large cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, it is
well over 25 percent. A 1998 survey in Shanghai found that 36
percent of divorces were due to incompatibility and 22 percent to
extramarital affairs, according to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Lu Ying, who teaches marriage and family law at Zhongshan
University in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, said
women often lose out in divorce because the husband can easily hide
his assets from the court. Moreover, housing for many people is
still provided by the employer, usually the husband's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many divorce cases, the woman would be left with nothing,''
said Lu. ``No husband, no child, no house.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While many of the men with modern-day concubines are from Hong
Kong and Taiwan, plenty of mainland men are indulging as well. The
Communist Party views the issue as not only a matter of morality
but a problem that could threaten social stability, one of its
paramount concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just foreign businessmen who are taking second
wives,'' said Hu Kanghsang, an official of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee who is working on the marriage law
revision. ``It also includes domestic factory heads, executives,
private businessmen, even party cadres. This phenomenon seriously
goes against socialist morality and customs . . . and seriously
impacts social stability and family planning.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Although concubines are most common in Guangdong, they exist in
other prosperous regions also. In Shanghai it's called ``keeping a
golden canary,'' that is, a lovely, frail creature who lives in a
cage and comes out only when you take it out. In Beijing, into the
moral realm. Even allowing police to help gather evidence of
adultery, as the Guangdong opinion does, opens personal lives up to
dangerous abuses of police power, says sociologist Li Yinhe, a
researcher at the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

<P>
   Such disputes have been dividing feminists since a revision of
the marriage law was first proposed in 1995. Passage this year is
unlikely, experts say.

<P>
   LONDON _ Take a walk in Brixton.
</P>
<P>
   Four miles from the gray postcard propriety of Westminster,
Brixton is a riot of noise and color.
</P>
<P>
   It pulsates with hefty bass riffs and reggae rhythms dancing
from knee-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD stores and
appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market, you hear
the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish _
occasionally even English.
</P>
<P>
   The market's shops and stalls offer London's best Afro-Caribbean
and African fare _ plantains, caramel-colored smoked fish,
thermo-nuclear peri-peri sauce and yams. The air smells of scorched
coffee, limes and coriander.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, bright red double-decker busses _ the symbols
of familiar London seem drab in Brixton _ pass through, a reminder
that the heart of the Anglo-Saxon universe is a 10-minute commute.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Parliament House with Big Ben and Churchill's
statue, however, Brixton now is a part of the fiber of modern
London, a city rapidly being redefined by its ethnic variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is this that is
igniting such energy, buzz and creativity,'' wrote Yasmin
Alibhair-Brown, a columnist for the Independent newspaper and
author of Who Do We Think We Are: Imagining the New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation started at the end of World War II, when
Britain began accepting a substantial number of immigrants from
countries that for the most part had been colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Most settled in London's boroughs. Today, nearly 25 percent of
Londoners are from non-white minorities. In boroughs such as
Brixton, the percentage of non-whites is 40 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Wilson, a Brixton resident, came to London in 1952 from
Spanish Town in the hills above Kingston, Jamaica. Wilson, an
electrician, has raised children and now grandchildren in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still Jamaican,'' he says, buying a pair of fresh chickens
for his wife to grill. ``But these young ones, they are Londoners _
not Englishmen, mind you, but Londoners.''
</P>
<P>
   People here insist that London is no melting pot, as immigrants
don't shed their cultural identities in the process of
manufacturing a new one. Nor is London seen as a multicultural
mosaic on the order of Toronto or Chicago, which have ancient,
separate and sheltered ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In London, things are more fluid. With notable exceptions, few
neighborhoods could be called ``Little Delhi,'' ``Little Jamaica,''
or ``Little Lagos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evening Standard perhaps said it best when it described
London as an ``ethnic kaleidoscope _ always shaking into a new
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling city of 8 million has 33 distinct ethnic
communities speaking 300 languages. One central London school
recently reported that its 800 students speak 79 languages at home.
At school they are unified in their struggle with English.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this multi-ethnic seasoning is palpable. In fact,
the favorite food in Britain no longer is fish and chips or
steak-and-kidney pie _ it's curry.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has sparked a wave of creativity matched only by
the bell-bottomed Carnaby Street revolution of the mid '60s that
introduced wide belts and frilly Edwardian suits to millions of
American closets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other place in the world like this city today,''
London musician Aki Navaz said recently in The New York Times. ``I
used to look through the windows at the white world. Now I know
that white kids are looking through mine, wanting to join in with
this energy.''
</P>
<P>
   London even has become a cultural center for other cultures. In
June, the best and brightest of ``Bollywood'' - the Indian version
of Hollywood - flocked to the Millennium Dome for the Indian
version of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   With Britons, ``Bollywood'' takes a backseat only to Hollywood.
A new 30-screen cineplex is dedicating six screens to Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Three Bollywood movies, known as extravagant productions of epic
lengths and lavish musical interludes, entered the United Kingdom's
top 10 list this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mambo Sharman, one of the Bollywood awards organizers, said he
was amazed at this trend. ``Often I go past a cinema in London and
look at the queues for Bollywood films and there are as many white
faces as Indians,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It makes me
feel guilty for not going as often as I should myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Tussaud's, the venerable British waxworks museum, soon
will add its first ever Bollywood display. And Andrew Lloyd Webber,
the superstar British musical machine with a keen sense of the
popular, is preparing to stage Bombay Dreams, a new musical set in
Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an exaggeration to say non-whites now dominate the
London entertainment scene, the ethnic variety is nevertheless
remarkable. A number of black and Asian comedians _ notably Nina
Wadia and Meera Syal _ have become household names.
</P>
<P>
   Many young Britons are plugged in to Fun-Da-Mental, a
multiracial group that plays a fusion of Persian jazz, rap and
hip-hop. The music produced by these hip, young musicians as well
as the established Jazzie B of Soul II Soul reflects a mix of
original cultures shaken but not stirred in the traditions of
London.
</P>
<P>
   The British cutting edge is layered with artists such as Steve
McQueen, the black Turner Prize winner whose haunting film The Bear
has received praise at the new Tate Modern museum.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   These changes have not come comfortably to all Britons.
</P>
<P>
   David Irving, the historical writer and accused Holocaust
denier, earlier this year said he spoke for many of his countrymen
when he expressed longing for the days when Britain was more
British.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could go to Heathrow airport, take a 747 and fly back
10 hours later to find England as it used to be,'' he said during
his libel trial against Emory University professor Deborah
Lipstadt. ``I can't say I applaud uncontrolled colored immigration.
I regret the passing of old England.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party has found political capital in attacking
what it describes as a flood of immigrants from Asia and Africa,
with the implied threat to British culture and institutions if the
torrent isn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has responded by
tightening immigration rules. It has become so difficult to enter
Britain that a thriving black market has emerged in trafficking
immigrants. Last month, 58 Chinese immigrants were found dead in
the back of a vegetable truck where they suffocated while being
smuggled into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   For all the worries about immigrants, Britain remains very white
_ 94.6 percent white, according to government statistics. Away from
London and other large cities such as Birmingham and Manchester,
non-whites are rare. About half of all the non-whites in Britain
live in London.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, blacks _ mostly from the Caribbean _ constitute 1.6
percent of the population. Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis _
generally lumped together and called Asians _ constitute about 2.7
percent. The balance includes Chinese and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because the minority population is much younger than the
white population, the government estimates that in 20 years, the
percentage of non-whites in British society will double.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the predictable tensions over change, blacks and Indians
often say they believe for the most part they have been accepted _
if not embraced _ by whites.
</P>
<P>
   When Rasshied Din started in business a few years ago, he was
warned not to use his own name because the English would think he
was a ``second-hand sari salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Din Associates is now the seventh-largest design consulting firm
in the country with a client list that features retail and fashion
heavyweights such as Tommy Hilfiger and Selfridges.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1980s, Din was a pioneer. ``People would call
up and say, 'Oh, you speak English,' as if they were surprised,''
he said. ``It seems strange looking back, but you have to remember
that this was before there were any prominent Asians in business or
in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the changes, race doesn't occupy the august station in
British society or politics that it holds in the United States. For
many Londoners, it is a topic like sex and religion, best not
discussed over the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. A strong minority vote was essential to
Ken Livingstone's election in May to become London's first elected
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone now represents the largest base of constituents in
the country, potentially elevating the agenda of London minorities
to national importance.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Hall, a respected black intellectual, believes Britain is
becoming more like the United States in its racial dynamics _ if
perhaps in a gentler, more civil fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Britain going to accept its diversity and become more
humane? We don't yet know,'' he said. ``Yes, things are better in
some ways, but a lot of people feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there's no going back in the fundamental change in the
nature of London, making the city a unique and fascinating
experience, said Trevor Philips, a black politician and social
critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hum of London's streets cannot be replicated,'' Philips
wrote recently. ``It's the sound of a hundred cultures softly
clashing, sometimes melding, occasionally grating uncomfortably.''

 CHRON  
 MAY I TAKE YOUR ORDER: What it's like to be a waiter in
San  Francisco   By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  HELP WANTED: High-end restaurant with national 
 reputation seeks waiter/waitress. Fine dining experience 
 necessary. Excellent interpersonal skills, food and wine 
 knowledge a must. Excellent tips, flexible schedule. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; HELP WANTED: Small fast-paced mid-priced restaurant seeks &LR; 
 &LR; waiter/waitress. Serving experience a plus, but we'll train the &LR; 
 &LR; right person who's motivated and wants to learn about food and &LR; 
 &LR; wine. Great tips, flexible schedule. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; HELP WANTED: Unpretentious corporately-owned restaurant seeks &LR; 
 &LR; servers. Some experience a plus, but we're looking for hard &LR; 
 &LR; working team players. Good tips, flexible schedule, fun &LR; 
 &LR; environment. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
If you've ever considered getting a job waiting tables, there may
be no time liked the present. The roaring economy has drained the
pool of restaurant workers, leaving owners and managers struggling
to fill positions (see related story,  &UR; SERVICE &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen workers are hard to come by, but trained servers are
even more scarce. Think anyone can be a waiter? No way, say
managers and restaurant owners. They may be able to train anyone
who walks in the door on the technical side of service, but it
takes much more than that to be a top-notch server.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if technical service is perfect, that's only half the
battle,'' says Doug Washington, general manager of Jardini &LR; e &LR; re in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Diners want more from servers than just putting food on the
table. Some want to engage them in conversation; others want to be
left alone. Still others are there for a romantic evening with
their date or to close an important business deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't know what they want from service,'' says Ruth
Reichl, editor-in-chief of Gourmet magazine. Gone are the days of
formal French service as well as what Reichl calls the ``Hi, my
name is Bob'' style of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good restaurants are trying to come up with a style that is
American, but there are no rules for it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That also means that restaurateurs have to spend more time
training even experienced servers. What works at four-star Aqua,
for example, would never fly at Delfina, a more casual Mission
District spot that receives high marks for service.
</P>
<P>
   At Aqua, where many of the main courses go for $30 or more, the
rigorous training includes written tests on food, wine, service and
the computer system, in addition to days spent shadowing long-time
waiters. General manager Jean-Claude Persais likens the training _
which can take up to two weeks _ to boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, fast-paced Delfina, where such dishes as the
Niman Ranch steak and french fries is only $15, spends about three
days training new servers. The first day, trainees ``run'' the
food, delivering it to the table. The second day they follow an
experienced waiter, and on the third day they're set free in a
small section of the restaurant. Owners Anne and Craig Stoll work
with them throughout the process to make sure they know the menu
and wine list.
</P>
<P>
   All of this for a job which, in the public's eye, demands little
respect and isn't considered a legitimate career.
</P>
<P>
   Lifelong waiters are a rarity, and most who've been doing it for
years admit they didn't plan it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd have asked me when I was 20 if I'd still be doing
this, I would have said no,'' says Doug Uyeno, a waiter at
Jardini &LR; e &LR; re. But after 11 years, he's still waiting tables, and
thinks it will remain his career.
</P>
<P>
   Helen O'Byrne, who's been a server at Aqua for six years, also
plans to remain a server for as long as she can. She's a graduate
of the hospitality program at Columbia University and kept saying
that waiting tables was just temporary. Now? ``I say I'm a server
at Aqua with pride and conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   And she's rewarded for it. By no means is being a waiter easy
money, but the pay is good _ servers even at more casual places
like Pasta Pomodoro or Houston's can make $100 a shift. At
top-of-the line establishments, some waiters pull in $60,000 a
year, or more. Waiters also have the benefit of flexible schedules
and they have their days free.
</P>
<P>
   But what's it really like? We spent time at three very different
restaurants, all of which have great service. The following
vignettes tell what the restaurant looks like from the waiters'
point of view, what they see and hear, how they work with the
kitchen and how they feel at the end of the night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AQUA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the usual tsunami at 6:30, but the red flag is still
in effect,'' says Bryan Philon, a manager at Aqua's daily 5 p.m.
staff meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He's not giving a weather report. He's telling the staff to
expect a slower than normal start for the four-star restaurant that
evening. But be ready. Anything can happen. Tonight the staff
expects to serve 240 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Servers listen _ finishing their ``family meal'' of hot dogs,
mashed potatoes, toast and salad _ while the managers discuss the
night ahead.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jean-Claude Persais takes over, his gentle
French accent belying his message, which is strictly business. He
quickly lists the VIPS dining this evening and what they're like _
``very particular, spends a lot'' and ``a regular at Charles''
referring to Charles Nob Hill, another restaurant in the Aqua
group.
</P>
<P>
   Persais has already covered this information with chef-owner
Michael Mina, in the manager's meeting. Mina noted which  &LR; amuse &LR; 
 &LR; bouche &LR;  and complimentary middle course he sent to each VIP on
their last visit so he won't send the same ones tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Persais goes through menu changes, and then Mina brings out the
special for the night _ thin slices of hamachi with a sticky rice
and fermented black bean cake. He explains the dish, listing each
ingredient and the cooking process. As the servers take notes, they
also discuss the best way to describe the dish to diners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what are the components?'' Mina asks. The servers list
them, tossing around various descriptors.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about `paillard?' '' asks waiter Bob Davis. Mina doesn't
like it. ``Carpaccio?'' Good. They'll call it hamachi carpaccio.
</P>
<P>
   Aqua's staff goes through this extensive prelude every night.
Mina knows it's a lot of pressure for the staff, but Aqua is one of
the best restaurants in the Bay Area, if not in the country.
Service is key _ this year Aqua's service earned a prestigious
James Beard Foundation nomination. That kind of success brings high
expectations from customers, and Mina makes sure he gives his staff
every tool they need to meet those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aqua is the kind of place I have to gear up for all day
long,'' says Davis, who's been waiting tables here for seven years.
Before a shift, he works out and gets focused. ``The stakes are
high here. I can't cruise through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, things start well for him. He has a large party plus
smaller tables in his section in the back of the dining room. ``I
really, really like everyone I'm waiting on right now,'' says the
boisterous man with white, spiked hair. His jovial laughter and
that of his customers rings through the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Davis thinks most customers come in to enjoy themselves, and
he'll go out of his way for them. On the other hand, he says, if
they treat him like a servant, he'll act like one, leaving his
personality behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of times people don't understand how much they
participate in the process,'' Davis says. ``I have a role. They
have a role. It's best when everyone understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   Server Helen O'Byrne has a more difficult time this evening, but
says she thrives on the challenge. Her first table, a party of six,
moved to her section because they didn't like the first location.
Then, one of the diners spills his wine. The staff can see these
people aren't happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have to make sure it turns around,'' she says with a
smile and a gleam in her eye.
</P>
<P>
   She goes to work. The sole woman at the table is obviously
hosting the party. O'Byrne concentrates on her, frequently using
the phrase ``for you.'' When she asks to order the John Dory from
the tasting menu as an a la carte entree, O'Byrne goes to the
kitchen and asks Mina. ``The chef will be happy to do that for
you,'' she says when she returns.
</P>
<P>
   Servers at Aqua don't spend much time in the kitchen. That's
Mina's exclusive territory. He stands before the line, reading
orders spurting out from a small printer. The staff behind the line
waits. Like a conductor, he brings them to attention _ ``Listen
up'' _ orchestrating the meal for every table, deciding which
 &LR; amuse bouche &LR;  to send, when to send the appetizer. He works with
two expediters, one on either side, and another staff member who
walks through the dining room and reports to the kitchen which
tables have finished a course, and whether it's been cleared and
reset for the next one.
</P>
<P>
   Mina checks every plate. He also eyes the plates that come back
to see what's been eaten and what hasn't. That will be information
for tomorrow's waiters' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Managers and runners come through the kitchen, but servers come
in only on a ``two-minute warning'' _ which means the entrees will
be ready to deliver to the table in two minutes. They also visit
the kitchen if a table is moving slowly through a tasting menu, or
if a customer has a special request or a problem.
</P>
<P>
   After most of the tables have their entrees, Mina walks through
the dining room to see how the ``first turn'' is going _ the time
between when the first round of guests are leaving and the second
set is coming in. It's a crucial time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good night,'' he says. He can tell how the servers
are feeling by the table maintenance. If they're rushed or
panicked, Mina will see wine and water glasses unfilled or a napkin
left unfolded when a guest gets up for a moment. But not tonight.
It looks good.
</P>
<P>
   O'Byrne knows it's a good night, too. The unhappy guests who had
been moved to her section left her a generous tip. But she says
it's more than the money. She turned their experience around and
made them happy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; DELFINA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A night at Delfina starts with side work _ all the little
details required to set up a dining room. When the restaurant
doubled its seats from 35 to 70 a few months ago, the staff and
owners discussed whether to bring in bussers and let them do the
set up. They decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   Bithiah Rosales, who has waited tables at the restaurant for two
years, says it gives her a sense of ownership to do the work
herself. Setting up is a chatty time, with music a little louder
and servers busy with tasks such as polishing silver and glasses
and rolling the strips of cheesecloth used to wipe the edges of the
plates before they go out of the kitchen. Periodically one of the
servers will call out a time-check so everyone knows how much time
is left before opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no lollygagging,'' says Rosales, a petite dark-haired
live wire.
</P>
<P>
   Like Aqua's staff, servers at Delfina go through a nightly
pre-opening ``line-up.'' But at this smaller, less formal
restaurant, the process is much more casual. Waiters gather at the
bar with owners Anne and Craig Stoll. Craig goes through the menu,
skipping over the regular items but explaining anything new or
something he's changed.
</P>
<P>
   He'll list all of the ingredients, usually down to salt and
pepper, then explain how the dish is made. Some servers take notes;
others just nod their understanding.
</P>
<P>
   They discuss some dishes more than others. Should they put a
description of the  &LR; ribollita &LR;  on the menu? No, the waiters say;
the customers will still need an explanation. Should the menu
specify that the pastas aren't entree-size? The waiters agree to
remind the customers of that if they order pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also throws in little quizzes. ``And what's a &LR; i &LR; oli?'' he
asks in a singsong voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garlic mayonnaise,'' the staff replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why don't we call it garlic a &LR; i &LR; oli? Because that would be
redundant, right?''
</P>
<P>
   He goes through the specials. Tonight there are just six quail
appetizers. He also has a small amount of an octopus salad he's
created that he'd like to try out. Does one waiter want to try to
sell them all or should they open it up to the staff? Sometimes, if
there are just a few orders of a special, they'll give it to only
one waiter to make sure it doesn't get oversold. The staff decides
they will all sell them.
</P>
<P>
   Craig brings out an example of a cheese course plate so the
staff can taste it. He explains that it's a Cabrales, a crumbly
blue-veined cheese made by Cowgirl Creamery in Point Reyes. ``Try
to sell it with port,'' Craig suggests. The staff nods, thinking
about how well that would go with this pungent cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Nightly wine tastings are also part of the line up, so they
taste a Ridge Lytton Springs Zinfandel while Anne explains changes
to the wine list.
</P>
<P>
   It's a few minutes before the restaurant opens. The staff rushes
to put on their aprons and the women put on lipstick. Now it's
5:30, and customers are already lined up for the tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a turn-and-burn restaurant,'' says Anne. ``We don't like
to rush customers. At the same time, we have three seatings so it's
important to keep things moving along.''
</P>
<P>
   The volume created by three seatings, or ``turns,'' helps the
Stolls keep prices reasonable. It also means the staff of five
waiters and two assistants have to be on the ball from the minute
the door opens until the last diner leaves.
</P>
<P>
   While Aqua keeps all of their VIP information in a computer,
Delfina relies on its staff. If Anne spots a VIP, she writes a code
on the board at the kitchen entrance: T14-Ken &AMP; Teresa. Ken and
Teresa are at table 14.
</P>
<P>
   Servers are also responsible for pacing the meal at each table,
telling Craig when to fire an order. How do they know?
</P>
<P>
   Rosales says customers let you know in many ways. If someone
keeps looking at his watch or if groups aren't communicating at a
table, they're probably in more of a hurry. Sometimes, it's just a
feeling. ``It took me a solid six months to perfect firing,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 p.m., every seat is filled. By 7 p.m., Anne will need some
of these tables for the next turn. She has a few tricks to keep
things moving. For example, sometimes when she sees a table
finishing entrees, she turns to the kitchen and fires chocolate
cakes, even if they haven't been ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take 10 minutes to bake,'' she explains. ``I'd rather
waste the cakes than have the customers sit and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   How many cakes does she waste in a night?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one or two. Everybody loves chocolate cake,'' she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; HOUSTON'S &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Houston's _ a mid-priced Texas-based chain specializing in
steaks and burgers _ doesn't leave anything about service to
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions for servers at each of its branches, including the
one in San Francisco at The Embarcadero, specify:
</P>
<P>
   _ Appetizers and drinks must be on the table within two minutes
of ordering.
</P>
<P>
   _ Entrees must be served within 10 to 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Servers must wear cotton/polyster blend clothes as uniforms.
No 100 percent cotton. Clothes must be professionally cleaned,
preferably by the company that Houston's recommends so the look
will remain consistent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Any hair clips worn must be black or brown. No banana clips.
</P>
<P>
   Sound extreme? Consider this: While Zagat Survey ratings
generally show that service nationwide lags two points behind food,
nine of the 14 Houston's that are rated in the survey score only
one point below food or are even with food. In San Francisco, the
service rating surpasses the food _ food is 18 points; service is
19, placing it in the ``good to very good'' category.
</P>
<P>
   With 46 restaurants nationwide, the company has had time to
perfect a system that works. It starts with the hiring process. The
first step is a standardized cognitive abilities test that
determines whether the candidates fit the company's profile of a
waiter. Once hired, an extensive training process begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get people who say, `Eight days of training? Forget it!'''
says Nikki Smith, assistant manager of the San Francisco branch.
But then, she says, Houston's knows they're not right for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a six-year Houston's veteran, started work at the San
Francisco branch three months ago, after moving from Texas. She
likes the company because what it states as ``life goals'' matches
her own _ professionalism, positive mental attitudes, aim to
please, teamwork and a commitment to quality.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also talks about training servers on ``wow moments'' and
``the blanket of warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds like a cult,'' she laughs. ``We're a weird
group.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing weird about the good service they provide.
</P>
<P>
   The servers begin their shift by signing up for the daily chores
that need to be done before opening. The ones who get in earliest
get to pick their favorite jobs. The last one has to make cheese
toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why no one likes to do it,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, many of the servers help finish up the cheese toast
to be sure the restaurant is ready for lunch. Today is especially
important. Smith just got a message that George Beale, Houston's
president and principal owner, will be in. She looks panicked for a
brief moment, but quickly resumes her composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I run the place like he's always standing there,'' she says
pointing to the corner, ``everything will be fine.'' Still, she
whispers to the servers that he'll be coming.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m. she peers through the glass doors. ``Papa's here,''
she whispers under her breath. But Beale just floats through the
restaurant, talking on his cell phone. One of the servers hands him
a cappuccino. He's gone almost as quickly as he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   As at Aqua and Delfina, the staff gathers for a pre-service
meeting. Houston's, which has names for everything, calls them
``preshift huddles.'' But the meetings are perfunctory and very
brief, while at Aqua and Delfina they're longer and detailed.
</P>
<P>
   Smith looks over each of the waiters. ``Button the top button,
please,'' she says, gesturing to one of the men. ``Shoes look
good.''
</P>
<P>
   She talks briefly about the food, but since the menu changes
very little it's more like a refresher course. What sauce goes with
the artichoke? Tell me about the Hawaiian rib-eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yum-yum, right?'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The minute customers start filing in, the system that makes
service at Houston's work begins.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who walks in the door is greeted within seconds. Each
of the waiters has just three tables, whereas most restaurants have
stations of five or more. There are no bussers or runners, but
everyone backs everyone else up. Smith takes food to tables if a
server has his or her hands full. She answers the phone if one of
the hosts can't get to it.
</P>
<P>
   As orders come in to the kitchen, one manager handles the salad
station, another the grill. They call out times to the kitchen _
how long an order has been in, how much time they have left before
they're over the allotted time.
</P>
<P>
   If the food won't be done in time, the waiter will do a ``fly
by'' _ walking by the table to see if the customers seem
particularly anxious for the food _ or will do a ``table call''
where they explain that the food will be a little late.
</P>
<P>
   As lunchtime progresses, the pace picks up but the quality of
service never slows. By noon, the restaurant is filled; by 12:30,
customers are waiting for a table. Houston's doesn't take
reservations, so the staff doesn't have to be concerned with
``turns'' like at Aqua and Delfina. Besides, the system is designed
so customers are in and out in 25 to 30 minutes at lunch, and 45
minutes at dinner, based on a three-course meal.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Bettencourt, a seven-month Houston's employee, believes
in Houston's system. ``There's not a morning that the alarm goes
off that I think I don't want to go to work,'' she says.

 Wine Potpourri: Tips to Keep in Mind When Dining With Wine  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Poor wine service in a restaurant can help ruin an
evening out. The whole experience can be a minefield of strange
wine names, off-the-scale prices and service that's either too
friendly and casual or too stuffy and condescending.
<P>
   At the table, expect to be handed the wine list along with the
menu. It's smart business for the restaurant and it gives you a
chance to choose wine and food together. A quick assessment of the
list will send up any red flags that trouble with wine service
might be minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Is the wine list manageable or is it so cumbersome you feel like
you're at the gym lifting weights? Are the wines listed in an order
that makes sense and is easy to read? Is the print large enough and
clear enough so you don't have to ask for a flashlight? Does the
restaurant offer wines by the glass?
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly _ and this is a blazing red flag _ are the
wines priced in concert with the menu entrees? Or, is every wine of
interest more expensive than the most expensive entree? There
should always be a range of prices so all budgets can be
accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees on what's right or fair when it comes to
pricing wine in restaurants. In general, most wine professionals
agree that twice the retail price is fair for a bottle of wine in a
restaurant. But that formula doesn't take into consideration older
wines that are hard to find and often are priced differently.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two things you can expect from good wine service:
</P>
<P>
   _ The attention and speed of wine service will be different if
the server is doing both wine and food. It's not always the case,
but a sommelier's sole job is to help the diner select the wine,
then serve it.
</P>
<P>
   _ No matter who the server is, expect the wine you've chosen to
be displayed for verification and opened at the table. The person
hosting the meal, male or female, should receive the wine list,
order the wine and get the first sip to determine the soundness of
the wine.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; If all of your expectations are met, tip the wine server.
Sommeliers make their money based on how much wine they sell and
how well they serve the wine to diners.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reading the Numbers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the claim by many consumers that their budget rarely
exceeds $20 for a bottle of wine, MFK Research reports that
California wines priced over $25 are hot items.
</P>
<P>
   The research division of Motto Kryla &AMP; Fisher LLP, a U.S. wine
industry management and research consultant, says that wine sales
in that price range exceed 3 million cases annually, with a value
of more than $1 billion. Further, the category is growing at 25
percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers can be confusing, especially as the global wine market
constantly changes. In March, Motto Kryla &AMP; Fisher announced that
U.S. table wine exports were flat in 1999 both in volume and
dollars. Now, along comes the Wine Institute, stating that U.S.
wine exports for 1999 were up 2 percent from the previous year, to
$548 million. WI further said that California wine shipments to the
rest of the United States were up 3 percent, representing an
increase for the sixth consecutive year. The reason, according to
the Wine Institute _ is the strong U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Rabbit &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago I rambled on about Stupid Wine Tools, the kind of
gadgets that make money for someone else by providing you with a
piece of useless junk _ for example, double-winged corkscrews with
a screw that's more like a wood auger.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the Rabbit. It's a new cork-pulling machine that
looks vaguely like a rabbit, with the precision gear positive
motion that eases corks out of bottles in seconds. The Rabbit is
clamped securely to the top of the bottle, then with one downward
motion to drive the screw into the cork, followed by a second
upward motion, the cork is out of the bottle faster than you can
say Gew &LR; u &LR; rztraminer. With the smooth mechanism and the
user-friendly cushioned rubber handle, The Rabbit is a cross
between the lever Screwpull and an OXO kitchen tool.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabbit is available at Beverages &AMP; More and Sharper Image
stores and catalog. Prices range from $70 to $80.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the simplest-to-use cork removers is curiously called the
Ah-So wine opener, which sells for about $20. There are no moving
parts or gears _ just a loop handle attached to two metals prongs,
one slightly longer than the other. Simplicity, however, doesn't
mean it is easy to use for some people.
</P>
<P>
   But once you get it down, the Ah-So can out-pull just about any
cork remover. Here's how. Insert the longer of the two prongs into
the tight space between the cork and the bottle. Using a rocking
motion, while gently pushing the Ah-So downward, move the long
prong down until the shorter prong can be inserted between the cork
and the bottle. Now, using the same gentle rocking motion, work the
prongs downward until the base of the Ah-So is flush with the top
of the bottle. Then, with a slight twisting motion, pull the cork
out of the bottle. The key is rock, don't push. It takes a little
practice but the Ah-So is slick and fast.

 Food in the News: Interest in Organics Surges Around the Globe   By Kim Severson  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Like much of the rest of the world, the United
States continues to lurch toward a national standard for organic
food.
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture gathered the last of some 41,000
public comments on the proposed national organic standard in June.
By fall, a final version of the regulations should be ready for
adoption. It will take another 18 months, USDA officials estimate,
to actually put the standards into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has said that the pending
national organic program will be ``the most comprehensive and
strongest organic standard in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. organic industry continues to see
unprecedented growth. Average organic-food sales are expected to
grow by almost 25 percent a year for the next decade, according to
USDA estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not alone in the organic revolution. An
estimated 130 countries are producing significant amounts of
certified organic food, according to Organic Perspectives magazine.
Advances abroad include:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Japan.  &LR; A new organic certification and production system is
set to take effect in April. But because only a limited amount of
food meets the new standards, many producers are likely to use
alternative labels like ``reduced chemical.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Australia.  &LR; The sale of organics rose by about 30 percent
last year, driven by concerns over food safety, the environment and
a fear of genetically engineered food. But the Australian organic
market is still relatively small, with about $150 million in sales
a year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ New Zealand.  &LR; An office to certify organic products for
export is expected to be in place by March. Exports will focus on
produce, but could expand to include meat and poultry products.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ France.  &LR; The French are going wild for organic milk. In 1999,
production of organic milk in France rose 77 percent to about 25
million gallons. French officials expect that figure to rise to 40
million gallons this year.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the United States, the proposed regulations offer a
national definition of the term ``organic.'' Currently, organic
food is certified by various private and state organizations that
each use their own standards for the term.
</P>
<P>
   The national standard will establish clear labeling criteria so
consumers know exactly what they are buying. Among other rules, the
regulations will prohibit the use of genetic engineering, sewage
sludge and irradiation in the production of food products labeled
``organic.'' Antibiotics in organic livestock production and feed
will also be banned.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations, first introduced in 1997, will make it easier
for organic farmers to export their products because international
trade officials prefer to deal with one national standard rather
than multiple state and private standards.

 Working Cook: Neighborhood Restaurant Inspires a Dish Worth 
 Waiting For   By Tara Duggan  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  My neighborhood Chinese restaurant, Eric's in Noe
Valley, always has a line out the door and at least five cars
double-parked, hazard lights flashing, out front to pick up
take-out.
<TEXT>
<P>
   People don't line up for traditional things like the wonton
soup; what they want are the California-influenced dishes like beef
with portobello mushrooms and my favorite, the shrimp with mango,
which is stir-fried with a bit of hot chile pepper and sprinkled
with cilantro. The balance of spicy and sweet is just right, and
it's fresh-tasting without a heavy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Since I eat at Eric's all the time, I couldn't help being
influenced by this simple dish and came up with my own version,
Curried Prawns with Mangoes, which has the addition of curry.
</P>
<P>
   Curry powder is, of course, one of the original easy-cook
inventions. What's really important, though, is that you don't just
shake it into a sauce or you'll find yourself with a grainy, raw
flavor. It's always better to saute dried spices like curry powder
in fat before adding them to your vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The Grilled Chicken Breasts with Corn, Tomato &AMP; Mozzarella Salad
is a simple way to capture the flavors of summer in one dish. It
depends on high-quality seasonal produce and fresh mozzarella. If
you find the ripest summer tomatoes, which are acidic and full of
flavor, you might not need to add any lemon juice or vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   The Sweet Potato Empanadas with Ancho Cream have a subtle
filling of creamy potatoes, golden raisins, crunchy pumpkin seeds
and a bit of fresh goat cheese inside a flaky crust. Ancho chile
paste provides mild, smoky heat.
</P>
<P>
   If you like, prepare the filling ahead of time, which takes
about the same amount of time to prepare as it does to roast the
potatoes. This works well as a make-ahead recipe, because you can
just take one or two empanadas out of the freezer at a time.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; FAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CURRIED PRAWNS WITH MANGOES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Serve this dish with steamed jasmine rice.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons oil
</P>
<P>
   21/2 teaspoons curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1 pound peeled and deveined shrimp
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 large, medium-ripe mango
</P>
<P>
   Handful cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1/2 lime
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large saute pan or wok over low heat. Add the
curry powder and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few pinches of
pepper. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Chop the onion and mince the jalapeno. (Discard jalapeno seeds
before mincing if you prefer a mild dish; leave in the seeds for a
spicy curry flavor.) Add the onion and chile to the pan, increase
the heat to medium and saute until the onion is tender, about 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As the onion cooks, dice the mango (see note) and roughly chop
the cilantro. Increase heat to high, then add the shrimp and mango
to the pan. Stir-fry until the shrimp just turn pink. Stir in the
cilantro then add a squeeze of lime juice. Season to taste with
salt.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  An easy way to chop mango is to hold the fruit upright
on a cutting board with a narrow side facing you. Using a large
knife, cut the fruit in half about 1/2 inch from the center, just
around the seed. Repeat with the other side. Score the flesh in
each half into squares, then push each half inside-out so it looks
like a hedgehog. Then cut off each square.

<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 ears fresh yellow corn, husked
</P>
<P>
   Few basil sprigs
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ripe summer tomatoes (may substitute cherry tomatoes)
</P>
<P>
   7-ounce piece high-quality fresh mozzarella
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Fresh lemon juice or champagne vinegar, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   If using a grill, prepare coals before beginning preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Start a large pot of water boiling that will eventually hold the
corn.
</P>
<P>
   Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.
Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Have ready a large bowl of ice water that will eventually hold
the corn.
</P>
<P>
   Drop the corn into the boiling water and blanch until
crisp-tender when pierced with a knife, about 2 minutes. Drain and
immediately plunge into the ice water.
</P>
<P>
   Mince the basil. Dice the tomatoes (or cut the cherry tomatoes
in half) and dice the mozzarella; pieces should be slightly larger
than the corn kernels.
</P>
<P>
   Begin grilling the chicken breasts (or place on a seasoned grill
pan over high heat); cook about 5 minutes per side, until the
chicken is no longer pink in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   While the chicken cooks, cut the corn kernels off the cobs and
transfer to a large bowl. Add the tomatoes, basil and mozzarella.
Add the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss lightly and
taste. Add a drizzle of lemon juice or vinegar if the salad needs a
little boost of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the chicken into strips.
</P>
<P>
   Using a slotted spoon, portion the salad onto plates and arrange
chicken strips on top.

   Two 17.3-ounce packages frozen puff pastry dough, defrosted
according to package directions
</P>
<P>
   Two 51/2-ounce packages fresh goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking pan with
foil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the filling:  &LR; Pierce the sweet potatoes with the
tines of a fork, then place them in the foil-lined pan. Bake for 45
minutes to 1 hour, until tender when pierced with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   While the sweet potatoes are baking, place the ancho chiles in a
bowl and cover with the boiling water. Cover the bowl with plastic
wrap and let soak for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large skillet, then crumble in the oregano and
saute briefly. Add the onions and saute over low heat until very
tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the chiles, reserving the soaking water. Pull off stem
ends and shake to remove most of the seeds. Coarsely chop the
flesh, then place in a food processor. Add about 1 tablespoon of
the soaking water and puree. Add more soaking water as needed to
form a thick paste. Set aside. Reserve 1 cup of the chile-soaking
water; discard remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pumpkin seeds in a heavy, deep skillet over medium
heat. After a few minutes they will start popping. Allow most of
the seeds to pop, shaking the pan and stirring often so they don't
burn, about 10 minutes total.
</P>
<P>
   When the sweet potatoes are done, remove them from the oven.
Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the potatoes and cut into large dice. Add to the onions,
along with the pumpkin seeds, 2 tablespoons of the ancho paste, 1
cup chile-soaking water and the raisins. Cook over low heat to
incorporate flavors, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The topping:  &LR; Combine 2 tablespoons of the ancho paste with the
crema and lemon or lime juice; stir to blend well. Season with a
bit of salt and set aside. ( &UR; Note: &LR;  There may be a little ancho
chile paste left after making this recipe.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble: &LR;  Select a plate or lid that is about 4 inches in
diameter; this will be your guide to cutting out the dough circles.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully unfold 1 piece of the defrosted puff pastry and place
on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out the dough to about an 8
x 12-inch rectangle. Place the lid or plate on the top corner of
the dough and cut around it with a small, sharp paring knife.
Repeat, cutting out 6 circles in all.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly beat the egg in a small bowl, then stir in the milk.
Using a pastry brush, paint a thin band of egg wash around rim of
each circle. Place a few tablespoons of the filling across the
center of each circle, then about 1 tablespoon of the goat cheese.
Fold each pastry in half, then press down into a half circle (you
may need to remove some filling to close). Using a fork, crimp the
edges together.
</P>
<P>
   Place the empanadas on a parchment- or foil-lined baking sheet,
brush tops with egg wash and bake at 375 degrees for about 20
minutes, until golden. Repeat with the remaining dough.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the empanadas hot or warm, topped with a spoonful or so of
the chile-cream topping.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 24 empanadas; serves 12.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  If you can't find green pumpkin seeds (also called
pepitas), substitute sliced almonds. Ancho chiles are deep-red
dried poblano peppers with a sweet, smoky flavor. Both pumpkin
seeds and ancho chiles are available in Latino markets and in some
supermarkets.

 Secrets of Success: Chow's Tomato Toasts   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Bruschetta is all the rage these days and just
about every combination of ingredients are finding their way onto
toasted bread _ cauliflower and anchovy, peas and artichokes,
cheese and salad greens.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most popular, however, is the simple mixture of tomato,
basil and garlic. This combination is one of the draws at Chow, an
inexpensive Italian restaurant in the Castro.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for the home cook to make, too. Roma tomatoes are
marinated and allowed to soak up the flavors for several hours, so
even winter tomatoes taste great.
</P>
<P>
   Chef/owner Tony Gulisano has worked in many fancy restaurants
including Spago and Chinois on Main in Southern California, and
Monsoon and Il Fornaio in the Bay Area, but his heart is in the
simple food he cooks now at Chow, which opened in 1997. The
restaurant looks like it's been around for decades with
wainscoting, wood floors and Depression-era pendant lights hanging
from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   He also opened a second restaurant, Park Chow, just down the
street from Golden Gate Park on Ninth Avenue, featuring a similar
style _ and price _ of food.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Chow, 215 Church St. (near Market Street), San Francisco;
(415) &LR;   &LR; 552-2469. Lunch and dinner daily. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Crushing the tomatoes by hand. &LR;  The force and suction used to
squeeze the tomatoes breaks the flesh and infuses the interior with
the marinating juices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Using your fingers. &LR;  Rubbing oil on the bread with your
fingers insures a thin even coating that can't be achieved by using
a brush.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; MARINATED TOMATOES WITH GARLIC TOASTS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   8 ripe Roma tomatoes, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (or more) extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   8 fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper
</P>
<P>
   12 half-inch thick slices of chewy bread
</P>
<P>
   4 whole garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Cut the peeled tomatoes in half lengthwise and cut each half
into eighths. Transfer to a bowl. Add 1/2 cup of the olive oil, the
minced garlic, basil, salt and pepper. Adjust seasonings as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Gently squeeze the tomato mixture with your hands to distribute
the flavor and release the juices. Cover and set aside in a cool
place for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a grill (medium heat) or heat a stovetop grill pan over
medium heat.
</P>
<P>
   Dip your fingers into the remaining 1/2 cup oil and rub each
slice of bread with an even film. Grill the bread evenly on both
sides to a deep golden color.
</P>
<P>
   Remove and quickly rub the hottest surface with a garlic clove.
The garlic will rub off and leave its perfume on the toast.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the toasts on a platter. Spoon the tomato mixture onto
the grilled bread. Drizzle with a little more olive oil, if
desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.

 At the Source: Eden Garden Grows Heavenly Pluots   Karola Saekel  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 MODESTO, Calif. _  You wouldn't have found them in the Garden of
Eden, but Pluots from Eden Garden farm are sweet enough to tempt
any Adam or Eve.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This hybrid fruit was developed more than 20 years ago by Floyd
Zaiger of Zaiger Nursery in Modesto, which used to be known as
Zaiger Genetics. Purists' objections made the Zaiger family change
the name _ law suits are still swirling around the controversy _
but for lovers of sweet and juicy summer fruit, that's of little
concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Pluot _ 70 percent plum, 30 percent apricot _ is an
offspring that surpasses its parents in many respects. For one
thing, it is sturdier and has a longer shelf life than either of
its antecedents. But unlike some fruit varieties that have been
developed with an eye to durability to the detriment of flavor, the
Pluot excels in the taste department as well. It has the
chin-dripping juiciness of a fully ripe plum without the
notoriously tough skin and tart center typical of the parent fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The Pluot's complete nutrition profile is still being
established, but it is believed to be close to the apricot's, which
is a good source of vitamin C and a powerhouse of vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pluots have a lot of versatility, says Steve
Brenkwitz, a fifth-generation stone-fruit farmer who cultivates 200
acres of apricot, Plumcot (50 percent plum, 50 percent apricot) and
Pluot trees in Tracy on his Eden Garden/Brenkwitz Farm.
</P>
<P>
   The farm, originally located in Hayward, was started in the
1860s by his great-great-grandfather Frank Wrede. ``We don't know
if he was German or Polish,'' Brenkwitz says with a laugh. ``He was
from one of those areas that changed nationality with every war.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenkwitz, 45, has been working on the family farm since he was
12 years old. Even though he says Pluots are a ``challenging''
fruit to grow, he devotes between 25 and 30 percent of his orchards
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Zaiger has developed and patented many kinds of the fruit; Eden
Garden grows 25 varieties. Brenkwitz is hard put to name his
favorite, but it might well be Flavor Heart, a large fruit with
almost black skin, contrasted by luscious greenish-yellow flesh. It
is one of the sweetest fruits, registering as high as 24 on the
Brix scale that measures sugar content. Most Pluots, which range in
color from green to gold and pink, deep red and black, hover around
16 to 18 Brix, which still makes them satisfyingly sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his devotion to his crops _ he grows only apricots,
Plumcots and Pluots _ Brenkwitz is not optimistic about the future
of the family farm. ``There is no money in it anymore,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't go the farmers' market route, although he sells to
some dealers who supply farmers' markets. Mostly, his fruit is sold
at stores such as Raley's. Some is exported to Europe, and he also
has sold fruit to Taiwan. Japan is not a customer. For reasons he
says he doesn't understand, Brenkwitz says Japanese importers want
nothing to do with apricots or anything related to them.
</P>
<P>
   He has recently moved his 150-year-old farm squarely into the
21st century, selling fruit online. And he does believe that Pluots
have a future, simply because they are so delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, he says this fruit should be eaten out of hand, but
he admits to a personal favorite that requires cooking the fruit:
Take a tart variety like Flavor King, cook it down with a little
sugar and, when it's cool, spoon over ice cream. It's one way to
make the Flavor King into a royal treat, the farmer says.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Eden Garden/Brenkwitz Farm, 3711-A W. Kenner Road, Tracy.

at &LR;  www &LR; edengarden.com.

<P>
   &LR;  Pluots are currently in short supply but are available at &LR; 
 &LR; Raley's markets in Northern California and Berkeley Bowl. &LR;   &LR; Pluots
will be more widely available later this month and &LR;   &LR; through the

 SF Restaurants Face Service Crisis in Face of Dot-Com Onslaught   By Robin Davis 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; A crisis is looming at Bay Area restaurants. In a
region where eating out is a way of life, restaurateurs are
struggling to find servers and line cooks. For Northern California
diners, that struggle translates to higher tabs and poorer service.
<P>
   With unemployment at an all-time low, many businesses are in the
throes of labor woes, but perhaps none as much as the
labor-intensive restaurant industry, a linchpin of the local
economy. In San Francisco, restaurants made up 23 percent of the
city's taxable sales in 1998, the latest year for which figures are
available, according to the California Board of Equalization.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is twofold, industry experts say. Not only are more
people who once worked in restaurants being drawn into other
fields, but more restaurants are opening _ more than 400 in San
Francisco alone in 1999, according to the San Francisco Department
of Health, which licenses them.
</P>
<P>
   As with many other businesses, restaurant servers are fleeing to
dot-coms, say general managers and restaurant owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my cocktail servers left, and she joined a startup,''
says Umberto Gibin, general manager of the Grand Cafe in San
Francisco. And not to be a programmer or an executive. ``She's a
receptionist. But she makes $37,000 a year with stock options and
she works 9 to 5.'' That's a hard deal for restaurants to beat.
</P>
<P>
   For a city that's considered one of the best culinary
destinations in the country, quality is now on the line. For
diners, it's the decline in service that is the most apparent and
the most frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, The Chronicle has received more
complaints than ever from diners who think their dinners have been
ruined by poor service. Complaints range from poor pacing of the
meal _ one person's entree being brought out so late that the rest
of the party had finished eating _ to being forced to wait at the
bar long after a promised reservation time.
</P>
<P>
   Other diners simply feel neglected by servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to request menus. We had to request wine. We had to
inquire about dinner three times, and once the meal arrived, we had
to ask for silverware _ at which time the waiter went around the
table asking each person if they would like both a fork and a
knife, or just needed one or the other,'' says Tracy Skytt of San
Francisco of a recent dining experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating out is a lot more than seared foie gras or lavender
creme brulee,'' wrote one woman in her 20s who eats out frequently.
``Gracious service will always impress us more.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jackie Kleinman of San Francisco, who has dined out in the
Bay Area two to three times a week for the past 23 years, had good
service at a restaurant recently, she was so surprised that she
realized how jaded she's become about dining out. ``I've lowered my
expectations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of feeling is bad news for Bay Area restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Reichl, editor in chief of Gourmet magazine and an observer
of the national restaurant scene, says she isn't surprised. ``More
restaurants are opening, and restaurants are stealing entire staffs
from one another,'' she points out. ``It's no wonder service is a
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, complaints about service are at an all-time
high. In Zagat Survey ratings nationwide, service is the No. 1
complaint of more than half of the respondents. On average, service
lags about two points below food quality on the survey's 30-point
scale.
</P>
<P>
   An online survey conducted by Consumer Reports and published in
this month's issue shows the same degree of dissatisfaction. When
asked for their pet peeves about dining out, more than 700
respondents listed rude and bad service as the top two complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, too, note a dramatic drop in service quality. In the
more than 100 restaurants The Chronicle reviewed in 1998, the
number of restaurants earning three stars for service (considered
excellent to extraordinary) just about equalled the number of
restaurants with service below two stars (considered fair to poor).
But last year and for the first half this year, restaurants in the
fair-to-poor service category outnumbered those with excellent or
better almost 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Customers are also feeling the restaurant labor squeeze in the
form of higher menu prices as wage increases are passed on. Kathy
King, general manager at top-rated Boulevard, says labor costs have
been rising steadily since the restaurant opened in 1993. But in
the last year, it's gotten worse. In that time, she says, her labor
costs jumped 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Galle, director of operations for LuLu Inc., which runs
LuLu and Azie in San Francisco and Zibibbo in Palo Alto, says the
three restaurants are paying as much as 30 percent more now for
labor than they did just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All this translates into higher menu prices. According to the
Zagat Survey, which rates hundreds of restaurants throughout the
country, the Bay Area last year became the second city in the
nation, after New York City, to top the $30 mark for an ``average
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although restaurateurs are aware of the problem, many are
overwhelmed by just trying to fill empty positions. Kirk Webber,
co-owner of Cafe Kati in San Francisco, says the floor staff he
initially hired when he opened almost 10 years ago stayed for six
years. In the past three years, he's gone through three complete
staff changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our servers can make $50,000 to $60,000 a year,'' he says.
``But for the first time, it's hard to find a server.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. A glance at the Help Wanted ads from recent
Sunday newspapers shows many restaurants hiring for line cooks and
sous chefs, but just as many looking for managers, servers and
bussers.
</P>
<P>
   Aqua, for example, runs an ad in the Sunday Examiner-Chronicle
almost every week for managers, servers, greeters, bussers and
bartenders. The House of Prime Rib, Stars and many others also have
been advertising for wait staff.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurants are discouraged not only by the low number of
applicants, but also by the quality of the applicants. Galle of
LuLu Inc. received several applications when she advertised for a
general manager for high-end Azie, but most weren't qualified for
high-end restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``One had managed a fast-food franchise. Another was a security
guard,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants resort to poaching staffs from other
restaurants. In itself that's nothing new, but restaurant workers
say it's more prevalent than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all go out to dinner and if we find someone phenomenal,
we'll leave a business card,'' says Gibin at Grand Cafe.
``Everybody is looking for servers, bartenders, bussers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the highest-end restaurants have a revolving door of
servers. At Aqua, one of the Bay Area's five four-star restaurants,
waiters can make $60,000 a year or more, according to Stewart
Halstead, who handles hiring for Aqua and Charles Nob Hill in San
Francisco and Pisces in Burlingame. But even though they may make
more than the kitchen staff, they have a higher rate of turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Many servers say the reasons are the physical demands of the job
and the little respect it offers in the eyes of the public.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Hearne, who has waited tables at Jardini &LR; e &LR; re in San
Francisco since it opened three years ago, doesn't mind waiting
tables, but says he'd rather have a writing job. ``There's no
future in waiting tables. The money is good, but if I don't set up
my own retirement, I'll end up being a 60-year-old waiter who can't
do it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite working at two Bay Area restaurants that are highly
regarded for service and being paid well for it, Bob Davis of Aqua
and Bithiah Rosales of Delfina says they believe that others don't
respect them for being servers. It's the idea of being treated as a
servant.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, servers traditionally have little power and no
career path. That leaves most servers waiting tables until they
find their ``true calling''; until they finish school and put their
degree to work; or until they're discovered as the next great
artist, writer or actor.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mina, chef-owner of Aqua and Charles Nob Hill, Pisces
and Aqua in Las Vegas, explains that his kitchen staff is easier to
hire because he can offer them prestige and a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask if they want to be chefs of their own restaurants, and I
only hire people who want to be chefs,'' he says. Line cooks at
Mina's restaurants immediately command respect from their
colleagues. ``When they're ready to go, I help them find a job,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   But he can't do that for servers. ``Saying you work at Station
Two at Aqua doesn't carry the same respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sheinfield of the Zagat Survey notes that television
celebrity chefs like Emeril Lagasse and Bobby Flay went a long way
toward validating working in a kitchen. But there's no such thing
as a celebrity waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A parent might say, `My son cooks at a restaurant,' but no one
says, `My son's a waiter,' '' says Sheinfield. ``It's a prestige
thing.''

   Pork and sage are natural partners and before we had ever heard
of pork tenderloin our mothers and grandmothers were using sage in
stuffing for pork roasts.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out pork and prosciutto are natural partners, too,
though the idea of making little pork ``sandwiches'' stuffed with
prosciutto and sage comes from the famous Italian dish saltimbocca,
which is made with veal. It is not an old traditional Italian dish
but one that may have been invented in more recent years in Italy
that became very popular over here.
</P>
<P>
   Today's pork, like veal, has a mild (some might say bland) taste
and the strong flavors of the sage and of the prosciutto, which
also adds salt, turn pork tenderloin into something so delicious I
would happily serve it to company. It is certainly appropriately
named: saltimbocca means jump into the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year you have to take advantage of the great
tomatoes and the basil, which is much more pungent than the basil
that is available from hothouses in the winter. The vegetables are
simply prepared because when they are fresh they don't need a lot
of fussing.

&HT;     COUNTRY, ROCK OR JUST PURE DOUG SAHM? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM BEAL Jr.  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ He went by several names, depending on his mood
and whether he was up to wearing a wrestling mask.
</P>
<P>
   At one time he was Little Doug. Then he was Sir Douglas, Doug
Saldana, Wayne Douglas, Samm Dogg the masked musician and, in some
circles, just Doug. He might even have had a few more aliases.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was always Doug Sahm, the hyper-kinetic Texan from
San Antonio who, according to his longtime Sir Douglas Quintet
partner Augie Meyers, ``could get on a mental horse and ride off in
seven different directions at once.''
</P>
<P>
   That line also describes Sahm's musical pursuits. He started his
career as a kid country phenomenon and went on to play rock 'n'
roll, blues, Tex-Mex, more country and combinations thereof.
</P>
<P>
   When the man died in November, he left a country album in the
can. The 12-cut disc, ``The Return of Wayne Douglas,'' has been on
and off of release lists for months. The Tornado-label collection
was supposed to hit the streets this week.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Sahm was fond of revisiting his own songs
while he paid tribute to the people who influenced him. He did just
that on ``Wayne Douglas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahm-book chestnuts such as ``Beautiful Texas Sunshine,''
``Cowboy Peyton Place,'' ``Yesterday Got in the Way,'' ``Dallas
Alice'' and ``Texas Me'' are reprised here, alongside Leon Payne's
``They'll Never Take Her Love From Me'' and Bob Dylan's ``Love
Minus Zero/No Limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahm weighed in with a few new tunes, ``Oh No! Not Another
One,'' ``You Was for Real,'' ``Huggin' Thin Air,'' ``I Can't Go
Back to Austin'' and ``I Don't Trust No One When It Comes to My
Heart,'' co-written with Clay Blaker.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for pure country through and through, it is
not here. To be sure, Sahm could honky-tonk with the best, and he
does so on the Payne cut and ``Huggin' Thin Air,'' but, just as he
was never content staying in one musical bag, old Wayne Douglas,
even when he was playing country, let his freak flag fly.
``Yesterday Got in the Way'' rocks, while ``Cowboy Peyton Place''
conjures up the ghosts of Austin's glory days.
</P>
<P>
   A Doug Sahm country album is not your daddy's country album nor
is it your alt-country album. What Sahm did best, and what he did
on ``The Return of Wayne Douglas,'' is gather a bunch of
like-minded, top-flight players together in a comfortable recording
studio, set a mood and let things rip.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded at Cherry Ridge Studios in Floresville, Texas, which is
owned by Tommy Detamore, the steel guitar ace who works with Blaker
in the Texas Honky Tonk Band, the disc features an interesting
array of musicians: Meyers and Ronnie Huckaby playing keyboards,
Detamore, fiddler Bobby Flores, guitar wizard Bill Kirchen, drummer
Dan Dreeben, David Carroll thumping the upright bass, Blaker on
guitar, Sahm's son Shawn contributing background vocals and Sahm
playing guitar, singing and telling stories.
</P>
<P>
   The result is near-patented Doug Sahm musical feast, a South
Texas hippie country album that twangs without mercy while
two-stepping in tie-dye without apology. And it ends with Doug's
outgoing answering machine message. You can't dance to that, but
you will play it more than once.

&HT;     A SUPREME PREFERS TO TALK ABOUT THE GROUP'S OLD DAYS

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Singer Mary Wilson, the only other original
Supreme on the planet besides Diana Ross, isn't an I-told-you-so
sort of person.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, her comments could be juicy right about now as Ross'
ill-fated, faux Supremes ``Return to Love'' tour is being called
the biggest flop of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 56, is mum on the subject _ to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name wasn't on it, and I just want it clear that it wasn't
my fault for the tour not happening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the only member of the Supremes from beginning to end, Wilson
is not shedding any tears (or gloating) over the cancellation of
Ross' so-called reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are that it was not a Supremes reunion,'' she said.
``Once Cindy (Birdsong) and myself are not there, it cannot be a
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we were asked to be a part of it, but it seemed that we
were only asked, but really not wanted. They did not even try to
meet us halfway in terms of having us on the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, Ross was guaranteed $20 million. Wilson and Birdsong
were offered a comparative pittance, and when they finally agreed
to accept $3 million each, Ross allegedly pulled the plug on the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   So Wilson doesn't want to talk about those Supremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem talking about the (real) Supremes,'' joked
the author of the 1986 best seller, ``Dream Girl: My Life As a
Supreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the old days, Wilson said, ``Florence (Ballard),
Diane and I knew we were good.'' She rankles at being called a bit
player or background singer and reminded that the late Ballard
actually had the best voice of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson kept the group going until 1977 and the hits continued,
albeit less often. Singer Jean Terrell took over Ross' spot. ``Up
the Ladder to the Roof,'' ``Stoned Love'' and ``Floy Joy'' were
late-period Top 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Motown is preparing a 40th anniversary Supremes box set, but
like the reunion tour ``it could have been done better,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that happened in the studio, that
without me telling them, they won't have,'' she said. ``Just like
an awards show, the audience will see what's presented but the real
show was behind the scenes _ what was going on before we went out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson called Berry Gordy's liner notes for the upcoming project
``very one-sided.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very funny to me because he mentioned Diane throughout
the entire piece, but everyone else is just `The Supremes.' He
never mentioned our names. To me, that's so funny. How can you talk
about the Supremes and not mention us?''
</P>
<P>
   The music will stand on its own apart from the politics, she
said, and include unreleased tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly speaking, I don't think there was anything in the
vault that could have been a hit, but there are some wonderful
songs there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, everyone recorded together, the band and the
singers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to go down right, otherwise you'd stay there all day
doing one song,'' Wilson recalled. There was little science to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. We went in there and we just sang,'' she said
with a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   The Supremes evolved from the Primettes (``sister group'' to the
Primes, that became the Temptations) and included pals Barbara
Martin and Betty McGlown. Stardom wasn't MTV-instant.
</P>
<P>
   From 1959 to 1963, the Supremes toured and recorded but didn't
hit big. ``We did a lot of work and a lot of shows. We prepared a
lot before we became famous. By 1964 (when `Where Did Our Love Go'
hit No. 1), we were well seasoned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, people will have an instant hit, do a video and they've
never even worked on a stage.''
</P>
<P>
   She describes her early days at Motown as ``major fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the fun was, before it became a big business. Big
business does take away the fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you start making money and the minute other people
start telling you you're great is when it breaks down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said she survived with a foundation of home, faith, love
and friendship. ``I had good values and I was able to weather the
storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had a not-so-subtle message for pop divas _ get real.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that you're not so hungry for all this love and adulation
that people give you, that you start believing it. When you start
believing your own press, that's it. We used to call it, back at
Motown, getting a big head.''
</P>
<P>
   She jokes that she would ``kill for a voice like Aretha Franklin
or Gladys Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a great voice. I'm a great performer. I've always
been a great performer. Even when I didn't know what I was doing
because I enjoyed being up there,'' she said of her role in the
Supremes.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson doesn't close the door on a real Supremes reunion.
``Obviously, Florence could never be there for a real reunion, but
there's a chance that it could happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Where did the love go? It's still there, Wilson believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know. I feel because there was so much accomplished,
so much love, that it was not just an ordinary thing. I think this
was something that was made in heaven, honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can only happen when that comes back together. Once that's
realized _ and if we're still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it have to be a high-dollar, mega-hyped tour? No, Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be for Diane and I to get together and say, `Girl,
let's forget all this business and what folks think. Let's just do
it for us.' And it could be done any kind of way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once that happens, it can be done. I leave the door open for
that, and that's really all I can say. It would be that simple. It
is that simple.''

BOSTON FIRM AT CENTER OF PLAN TO BRING NET SPEED TO TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ When a Hong Kong investment manager buys stock from a
broker in Tokyo, chances are the deal passes through an old brick
mill on Boston's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, about half the world's stock trades are processed right
at Fort Point Channel, at Thomson ESG, a unit of Thomson Financial
Corp. It is an arcane, behind-the-scenes business that handles the
tangle of communications among brokers, big investors, and banks
every time a trade is placed. And it's at the center of a push to
complete trades faster _ in one day instead of three _ by 2002. As
recently as 1995, trades settled, with money and securities
officially changing hands, in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Draper, a spokeswoman for the Securities Industry
Association in New York, which is working on the so-called T(plus)1
guidelines, observed that ``this is going to require a major
overhaul.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Internet is part of the answer.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Thomson ESG is hammering out final details of a
plan to merge with its rival, a branch of New York's Depository
Trust &AMP; Clearing Corp., an institution set up and owned by
financial services firms to settle their trades. ``We each wanted
to get into each other's marketplace,'' Thomson ESG chief Howard
Edelstein said. Instead, they're aiming to develop a new system
together.
</P>
<P>
   ESG stands for electronic settlements group, a misnomer because
the company does everything but the actual ``settling.'' Call it
what you will, it claims $100 million in annual revenue and has
been growing 40 percent annually for the past five years, as global
trading volumes have mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   The group embraced this unsexy but lucrative niche of
post-trade, presettlement services after the market crash of 1987.
Big investors suddenly saw the costly potential for errors and
dishonest maneuverings during three days of limbo in an environment
where most trade confirmations were done with phone calls,
scribbled faxes, or telexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were still primitive,'' Edelstein said. After Thomson
created a kind of electronic-message clearinghouse, he said, ``You
couldn't walk away from a trade'' by pretending the confirmation
hadn't arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson first marketed its system as a money-saver for
institutional investors. The dozens of faxes and calls required for
every trade could cost $10 to $12, Edelstein said. Thomson charges
brokerage firms 20 cents to $1 per trade; investment managers
essentially get the service for free.
</P>
<P>
   But the system did more than save the fees. It cut out some of
the grinding monotony of processing trades and saved employees
time. And it saved vast amounts of money by reducing human errors.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments said in 1993 that, in two years, the system
had cut its internal trading error rate 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Thomson's system has become the industry standard.
Being neutral helped: Thomson manages no money and has no trading
desk. The group handles 1.5 billion shares a day, roughly half of
US trading volume, plus a quarter of trades overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 10 years after changing the way the industry worked, and
gaining a virtual monopoly, Thomson needs to change to stay at the
forefront. T(plus)1 is looming on the horizon. And a competitor is
emerging, called the Global Straight-Through Processing
Association. It is being backed by many of the same institutions
that are members of the Depository Trust &AMP; Clearing Corp., who are
hoping to create some competition for the business.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the DTCC. Together, Thomson and the New York group will
have 15,000 clients, including top Wall Street brokers, money
managers, and custodian banks. The new system, to be rolled out in
2002, will even further reduce the back-and-forth among investors,
brokers, and bankers, Edelstein said. The communications between
the parties will become even more automated, ending the need for
them to tack message after message onto a cumbersome file.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is likely to be rife with culture shock, however. The
DTCC literally houses most of the nation's stock and bond
certificates, the pieces of paper behind shares of Microsoft Corp.,
for instance, that most investors never see or hold in their hands.
Many employees have been there 20 or 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson ESG, though, has a dot-com culture, complete with brainy
engineers, chic, open offices, and yes, a foosball game room.
Edelstein is a zealot of the Myers-Briggs personality test and
cares immensely about management skills. The group he runs was
launched with venture capital from parent Thomson Financial, which
owns many data and service providers.
</P>
<P>
   ESG's merger partner has been updating its sleepy image. But its
environment is still one of bad cafeteria sandwiches and ugly
conference rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein, deep into the seventh year of the longest stint on
his resume, is brimming with energy to tackle the challenge. He'll
be chief executive of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the arch-competitor of most of these people,'' he said.
``I have a whole lot of fence-mending to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He's already started. In May, he flew about 20 top managers from
ESG and DTCC to Paris. From there, they boarded a train to
Amsterdam. They took up the entire car next to the bar car for five
hours of meetings and casual conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to go slow,'' Edelstein said. He's not making
light of the need to bridge the culture gap to make the deal work:
``If we do it wrong, we'll have our heads handed to us.''

CDS-TO-CAPITAL PRESERVATION SWAP MAY HIKE YIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife retired in May. We feel we have too many funds and
need to get our act together. Our combined Social Security amounts
to $21,000 and we feel we need another $25,000 to $30,000
additional income per year, as we intend to travel and enjoy life.
What would you recommend to safely return 8 percent to 10 percent
on our investments _ or are we dreaming?
</P>
<P>
   V.B., Newport Beach, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems to me that one end of that 8 percent to 10 percent
range of returns is probably attainable, while the other end may be
a bit in the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Returns of 10 percent are what a reasonable person can expect
from a long-term investment in an all-stock portfolio, and stocks
are anything but safe, particularly at or toward the end of a bull
market of unprecedented duration and strength.
</P>
<P>
   Second, while you do not break out percentages of many of your
investments, it seems likely that if your wife has more than 91
percent of her 401(k) money (and more than 70 percent of your
combined savings) in a capital preservation fund, then your
appetite for risk is limited.
</P>
<P>
   The fund you cited is not a retail fund, so I can only guess
that it's either a money market or a conservative bond fund,
probably yielding in the 5 percent to 6 percent range. Your
expectations for total portfolio returns as it is now constituted
should probably be in the 7.5 percent range. That would represent
an annual return of nearly $41,000 from the portfolio, which
certainly would support the rate of withdrawals you contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   But if you suspect your withdrawals are likely to be at the
$30,000 end of your estimate, that would leave you with only
$11,000 a year being shoveled back into the principal account, one
of whose primary purposes is capital growth to offset the inflation
of the later years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   So I suggest this: Examine the capital preservation fund,
checking to see how its investments are made and what the actual
yield is. If your total returns are smaller than the 7.81 percent
currently available from CDs (discussed in more detail in the next
letter) I would swap that investment for CDs, which would deliver
the desired $30,000 income stream and leave the returns of all of
your other holdings to be reinvested for capital appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   The move to the CDs could be done with a rollover to a
traditional IRA. The money from your wife's lump-sum distribution
could be added to the fund accounts _ preferably at the stock end
of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of those moves is that you can then view
everything but the CDs as long-term investments. With that in mind,
I'd rather see you replacing fixed-income funds such as the
Oppenheimer Limited-Term Government and Strategic Income funds and
the Van Kampen Limited-Maturity Government fund with either
balanced or stock funds. (But if you feel you have as much stock
market exposure as you can enjoy, I don't want to urge you into
heavier exposure; I am confident in the likely long-term returns
from stocks, but am less sanguine when it comes to short- and
intermediate-term prospects.)
</P>
<P>
   As for simplification of your portfolio, you are to some extent
limited by investments in funds with sales charges, either in class
B shares where you will pay a fee upon sale, or class A shares in
which you already have paid fees to enter the fund family.
</P>
<P>
   The investment in which your moves should be most limited is
your wife's IRA. Since all of the Oppenheimer funds she holds are
class B shares, you would owe a redemption fee if you transferred
to any investment outside the Oppenheimer fund family. But what you
could do to simplify that part of the portfolio and maintain
roughly the same asset allocation you now have is to tally what
percentage of your Oppenheimer holdings are invested in stock and
what percentage are on the fixed-income side. You could then swap
all of the stock shares for Oppenheimer Total Return and all of the
Fixed-Income shares for Oppenheimer Strategic Income shares. That
move would cut out three of the funds. If you feel that by drawing
your income stream from CDs or your capital preservation holding
allows you to be comfortable with more stock, you could give the
Total Return position a heavier percentage than you currently have.
</P>
<P>
   You would not have the same penalty within your own IRA, since
you have class A shares, which carry up-front loads. But since you
have already paid an up-front price to get into these fund
families, I suggest that you consider looking at options within the
same fund families for consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My CD is bringing me minimal returns and I don't know what
investment to make without risk. I got stung badly in the stock
market about 20 years ago and since have been fearful of investing.
I don't care if I deplete my money before I pass on, but I am in
fairly good health.
</P>
<P>
   J.C., Swampscott, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You need to move from your ``minimal-return'' CDs to
``maximum-return'' CDs. Shopping around for CDs is critical. For
example, the average yield for a five-year CD of $100,000 or more
was 6.45 percent entering this week; the best rate, offered by
Capital One FSB of Virginia (1-800-564-7426) was 7.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, your savings would bring you an annual income
stream of $23,430, and you would need only $14,614 of it to
supplement your other income. This would mean you could plow nearly
$9,000 a year back into your savings, which is a good thing, since
you will need to keep the balance growing to protect against future
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to become daunted when seeking out the nation's best
CD rates. The main source I use is the data bank page of the Sunday
New York Times Business section, which lists the three institutions
with the highest rates for various kinds of CDs and their telephone
numbers. Now, before you call the banks, remember the difference
between the best rate and the average rate works out to $4,080 a
year for you, so the patience you need will be rewarded. In my
experience, the busiest telephone lines in the nation on a Monday
morning must be those of the institutions that show up at the top
of the lists. Be patient. If the entire process of moving your
savings to a top-yielding CD takes you half a day, you would be
getting about $1,000 an hour for your time.
</P>
<P>
   The second caution I would take is to put little more than
$100,000 in any single institution. Putting in $100,000 gets you
the ``jumbo'' rate, which is usually a few hundredths of 1 percent
higher than the rate for CDs under $100,000, and will give you
$100,000 worth of FDIC insurance on your savings.
</P>
<P>
   And many sites online list CD rates. The one I have bookmarked
is at www.bankrate.com/brm/rate/
</P>
<P>
   dep_home.asp, and it provides much the same information found in
the newspapers _ and a great deal more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read your article on the use of the ``step-up'' rule when
inheriting stock. Does the same rule apply to stock in my 401(k)
account?
</P>
<P>
   J.H., Anaheim, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Alas, it does not. You have to remember the money that went
into your 401(k) was only tax-deferred, and the tax bill will
eventually come due _ even in the event of the death of the owner
of the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   The rate at which the money must be withdrawn form a 401(k)
involves not only some fairly complicated IRS rules, but also the
provisions within the particular 401(k) plan in which you are
enrolled. For that reason, rather than provide you with
generalities, I suggest you speak with the administrator of your
401(k) plan, who can tell you what the options would be for the
person inheriting your account.

FOR SCHERER, JOURNALISM MATTERED, NOT STAR POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Scherer, who died this month, was a lanky, amiable reporter
for NBC News. At the White House for decades, one of his favorite
assignments was in 1953, covering Harry Truman's return from the
White House to Missouri and the family house in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   What's the first thing you plan to do, Scherer asked the former
president. ``Carry the grips to the attic,'' Truman replied. Ray
chuckled and noted: ``Life was a lot simpler then.''
</P>
<P>
   Former White House occupants were on their own with no Secret
Service protection; the imperial ex-presidency did not exist. Also
simpler was the role of reporters. When ``the media'' meant ``the
press,'' ink-stained wretches were on the sidelines, not in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters have historically been unpopular, mostly because of
their reporting zeal. But a bigger media problem of late is not
reporting, but the lack of reporting experience. David S. Broder,
who has reported a story or two, has commented on the need for
American institutions to draw clear, bright lines between each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to recognize that sticking to your own business makes
for a healthy society,'' Broder wrote. ``My own field of journalism
would benefit from remembering that. The career lines of journalism
_ the honorable tradition of working up from a night police beat to
more important assignments _ have been blurred by the increasing
tendency to import `stars' from the political and entertainment
worlds and give them high-profile media jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equally insidious is the tendency to make journalists behave
as if they were politicians, putting them onto TV panels where the
premium is not on reporting and analysis but on argumentation and
put-downs. We have plenty of politicians who are skilled at
soundbites; journalists are poor substitutes for candidates and
officeholders on these staged debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But more important, when we abandon our real work of gathering
news and helping make sense of it, we leave a void.''
</P>
<P>
   The night police beat? Talking to cops? Writing obituaries?
Making sure that facts are organized and accurate? These efforts do
not demand the IQ of a neurosurgeon or an astrophysicist. But many
talking heads are too fastidious for such grubby tasks. They might
choke and blanch at the reality of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Television changed the seating arrangements of press and
politics; cable television has made it a nonstop circus. As the
media begin to gather in Philadelphia for the Republican National
Convention, numbers prove that ``media'' is a plural noun.
Convention arrangers expect 2,066 delegates. Their guess for the
size of the delegation from every medium: 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the media mob invading Philly will be schedulers,
footmen, valets, hairdessers, haberdashers, cosmeticians, and
taxidermists ministering to that peculiar pygmy tribe known as
``talking heads.''
</P>
<P>
   I know whereof I speak. In several well-paid turns as a talking
head at conventions, I was astonished at the daily muster of a
producer, a chauffeur, a researcher, and someone to carry my grips.
A researcher for an occasional two-minute gabfest? It seemed
superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-cable era, televised sages actually shared their
reporting notes with viewers. Many talking heads today have never
reported, have never interviewed someone who didn't want to be
interviewed, never felt the fresh air of rejection. Their
perspective is that of a propagandist for cause or candidate, not
someone with a skeptical attitude toward power.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, professors, and those with specialized knowledge
infuse panels with actual facts. But political handlers and spin
doctors are easier to find, happy to advertise themselves and their
past or future clients, and eager to fill a programming void with
propaganda. Pundit smackdowns are unappetizing, uninformative, and
alas, omnipresent. Without them, cable television would be a test
pattern and a buzzing sound.

&HT;     THE BLANKETY-BLANK CONSPIRACY AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Let's see, what kind of names was I calling
people in 1974? It's hard to recall, but I'm sure I was saying
something to the effect of ``blankety-blank Nixon.'' And yes,
``Nixon'' was a cuss word, a very powerful one in years gone by.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton stands accused of having called the
manager of her husband's losing 1974 campaign for Congress a
``blankety-blank Jew blankety-blank.''
</P>
<P>
   The blankety-blank in question happens to be a Baptist, but
still it's a powerful accusation against someone running for Senate
in New York, and it comes at a time when her husband the president
is negotiating with Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because Republicans who should know better, like Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, repeated the charge, Hillary Clinton
took time to strongly deny that she used anti-Semitic language. In
the past, she has freely admitted she has a bad temper and there's
plenty of testimony she has used obscene language, but who the
blankety-blank hasn't?
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a different matter to use the word ``Jew'' as an
adjective in a compound blankety-blank construction. Then it's
almost always a slur. I don't know Hillary Clinton personally, but
some of my best friends (pardon the expression) are Jewish friends
of hers. I can't imagine she'd say such a thing, especially about a
Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary may swear like a Marine gunnery sergeant on occasion,
but she's notoriously precise.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fray, the Baptist and former campaign manager who accused
the first lady of making the anti-Semitism slur, claimed at one
point that his father was Jewish, and later that he had one
great-grandmother who was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   This guy can't even choose which of his forebears was a member
of the chosen people, and we're supposed to believe his charge
against Hillary?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I'm half-Catholic, yet no one has ever called me a
papist or even a half-papist, or whatever slurs are made against
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   All people may be created equal, but ethnic slurs aren't, and
their power changes with time, place and social circumstance. The
word ``Nixon'' has lost most of its power, and I believe I can get
away with printing the word ``papist'' in a non-derogatory way,
although we'll see when the letters arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Some ethnic slurs, or slurs associated with sexuality, can even
(or only) be used as terms of solidarity among members of that
ethnic group, as we're all aware.
</P>
<P>
   Other words, like ``Jew,'' can be uttered with hate, as it all
too often has been and still is. But the word is also spoken with
pride by Jews, and frequently with admiration by non-Jews. But I
doubt if you can get away with it in a phrase with cuss words, even
if you are Jewish. Like a lot of non-Jews nervous about the
volatility of language, I've always been more comfortable with the
word ``Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   In American working-class contexts, some ethnic slurs are often
traded between members of various groups as jokes and ritual
insults, and given and taken only partly hurtfully. Archie Bunker,
a guy who could never get on TV in this age of PC, comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s I worked in a meatpacking plant in New Haven,
Conn., not far from where Hillary Clinton attended law school. Even
in those times of racial tension, the black guys and Italian guys
regularly insulted each other's heritage, but gingerly because of
the presence of large, sharp knives.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some ethnic slurs can be used anywhere or any time
with no fear, words like ``WASP,'' ``white guy'' and even
``honky,'' a pretty odd word. Maybe it's because it's widely
perceived that white guys, particularly WASPS, are in charge, even
though there are more WASPs in Appalachia than there ever were in
the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   We just have to grin and bear it, and if anyone calls me a
``blankety-blank WASP blankety-blank,'' he won't be invited over
for Bloody Marys again.
</P>
<P>
   As with all language, the meaning of potentially hurtful words
is a product of context, intent and language users' knowledge of
each other, as much as anything found in a dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   We have some knowledge of those making the charges against
Hillary Clinton. The words ``blankety-blank Jew blankety blank''
ascribed to her by Fray and his wife Mary were printed in a new
book by a former National Enquirer reporter named Jerry
Oppenheimer. Fray himself has previously spread rumors that Hillary
is a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   You can't tell me the words in that book weren't intended to be
hurtful in the context of a campaign in New York, where a good many
voters are Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Most New York voters, even those who aren't fans of Hillary,
probably don't believe she has ever uttered that anti-Semitic slur.
She probably does have the capacity, and the reason, to call Fray a
``blankety-blank blankety-blank.''
</P>
<P>
   The real blankety-blanks in this are the Republican politicians,
like Trent Lott and Hillary's opponent, Rick Lazio, who are playing
the anti-Semitic canard as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   I'd call them ``blankety-blank Republican blankety-blanks,''
except I'm still registered as one.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Stonyfield Farm executives haven't increased their wholesale
price for a cup of yogurt, though they have good reason to.
</P>
<P>
   The milk and yogurt maker is facing much higher costs that can
be traced directly to soaring prices for OPEC oil: Stonyfield's
trucking expenses have surged 8 percent since January, making it
more costly to ship its yogurts, including Yo Squeeze, a new yogurt
in a tube for kids, to markets as far away as California and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is popping up in the Londonderry, N.H., firm's costs in
other ways. For example, Stonyfield pays more for energy to
pasteurize milk. ``Energy is hidden in everything,'' said Nancy
Hirshberg, director of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   While sensational headlines have focused on drivers paying $50
to fill up the Ford Excursion and on $2.50-a-gallon gasoline in the
Midwest, American business is silently absorbing the shock of
soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Oil flows through the economy in myriad ways, often invisibly.
Sharply higher prices for gasoline and crude are slowly raising the
costs of everything, from making automobile parts to delivering the
734-page ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   For Americans who were old enough to drive in 1973, spiking oil
prices may stir memories of a quadrupling of prices by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which unleashed
double-digit inflation by the end of the 1970s. Today, a barrel of
oil costs $31.37 on the spot market, nearly double last year's
price. Economists fear current steep increases in oil prices may
also cause a pickup in inflation _ beyond the higher gas prices
everyone pays at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slow seep'' into the US inflation rate, said Don
Ratajczak, an Atlanta consultant who recently retired as director
of forecasting at Georgia State University. ``It's not the kind of
(inflation) pressures you saw in the '73 and '82 period.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics released by the federal government Friday confirmed
Ratajczak's analysis. Producer prices for finished goods rose 0.6
percent in June, after showing no change in May. Prices for
products excluding food and energy _ cars, for example, and paper
products _ fell, while producer energy prices rose 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still seeing little inflation pressure outside of
energy,'' said Cary Leahey, economist at Deutsche Bank Securities
in New York. But while there is scant evidence of oil-price
increases, so far, in the inflation data, there is plenty of
anecdotal evidence that business is reeling from oil-price shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation charges were first to go up. Early this year,
Federal Express Corp. and US Airways slapped fuel surcharges on
package deliveries and passenger tickets, respectively, passing
rising airline fuel costs on to customers. In the past two weeks,
American Airlines and Northwest Airlines have announced oil-related
surcharges would be added to freight charges for air cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the nation's goods move across the nation's
highways by truck. Warren Hoemann, vice president of the California
Trucking Association, the largest state trucking organization, said
many truckers at first had to absorb higher diesel fuel costs when
prices started going up last year.
</P>
<P>
   But as contracts have been renewed, and as oil price increases
have persisted, they are increasingly pushing these costs through
to customers, such as retailers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically everything we touch or eat or wear moves by
truck,'' Hoemann said. ``Gradually trucking companies are passing
on the prices, and that gets passed on to the consumers
gradually.''
</P>
<P>
   The service industry is less prone, though not immune, to
oil-price spikes. Financial institutions, law firms, and ad
agencies that are customers of City Express Messenger Services may
pay more for deliveries, due to the higher cost of fueling the
Boston firm's fleet of automobiles. Owner Aaron Driben said he
began factoring the higher gas prices _ up 25 percent between April
and May _ into his bids on new contracts. Existing contracts are
not affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the new (contract) proposals, we are taking into
consideration the additional cost of gas, just as if insurance
rates went up _ we'd do the same thing,'' said Driben, whose
clients include financial institutions, ad agencies, and law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices don't immediately pass through the economy's chain of
suppliers and buyers. Boom times have encouraged manufacturers to
build new plants and expand capacity, causing supply gluts for many
products. But a US economic boom and rebound in global markets have
also made it easier for businesses to pass on higher oil costs by
raising their prices.
</P>
<P>
   With demand for plastic soaring, plastics manufacturers paying
more for petroleum- and natural gas-based raw materials are able to
raise their prices. For example, there has been a 20 percent
increase this year for polyethylene and polystyrene, pervasive in
US manufactured goods, according to Plastics News, an industry
magazine published by Crain Communications in Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rising plastics prices can cause powerful inflationary
pressures, economists said. Think about it: Plastics go into making
automobiles, bottle caps, cell phones, personal computers, medical
equipment _ the list is endless. And acres of plastic packaging and
shrink wrap cover toys, groceries, and other products sold to US
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Stonyfield Farm's costs for plastic packaging for its yogurt
haven't gone up _ not yet. But as raw materials prices go up, the
oil-price squeeze only tightens for the consumer-goods company. For
example, there is no relief in site for dairy farmers supplying
Stonyfield with milk. Eric Sideman, director of technical services
for the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, said
higher oil prices ``are having a big impact'' on dairy farmers who
are heavy users of tractors. ``I've already been told by the person
I buy hay from to expect a huge jump'' in prices, said Sideman, who
is a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Stonyfield's prices for 6- and 8-ounce cups, and quarts, of
yogurt have not been raised for more than a year, and the company
has no plans to do so, Hirshberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we've been able to hold the line pretty well. But all
of a sudden you reach a point in the economy where a few suppliers
are forced to raise their prices and a domino effect comes into
play, which forces you to have to increase your selling prices.''
</P>
<P>
   What puzzles economists is why oil's impact on inflation hasn't
been greater.
</P>
<P>
   David Wyss, chief economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in
Lexington, said one explanation is that oil is a smaller component
of the gross domestic product than it was in the gas-guzzling
1970s, due to conservation efforts by manufacturers and energy
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And oil prices, historically, haven't actually gone up very
much, when adjusted for inflation, said Wyss, who recalled paying
31.9 cents a gallon in 1965 to fill up his Chevrolet Impala. He
calculated that if gas prices had risen in tandem with inflation,
that same gallon would now cost $1.65 _ close to prices being
charged by Boston-area gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, oil shocks can be temporary and their impact on
inflation virtually nil. A yearlong acceleration in oil prices
seems to be abating as Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer,
proceeds with plans to boost production of crude oil. Forecasts of
the future price of oil are based on the complex interaction of
OPEC politics and production, as well as world oil reserves and
demand. Prices in recent days have softened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we get some slackening off in oil prices, some of this
is already beginning to feed into'' the inflation rate, said
Nicholas Perna, an economic consultant in Richfield, Conn. ``That's
what the Fed is worried about.'' The Federal Reserve at its June
meeting voted against another hike in the federal funds rate,
currently at 6.5 percent. The Fed has raised interest rates several
times in the past year to slow down the economy and forestall
inflation. Central bankers said economic growth may be
``moderating.''
</P>
<P>
   To gauge oil's impact on inflation, economists look at the
``core'' inflation rate. Because it excludes prices of food and
energy, the core consumer price index is considered a better
measure of indirect inflationary pressures. The core CPI rose a
moderate 2.4 percent during 12 months ending May 2000. (The broader
CPI, which does reflect higher pump and home heating oil prices,
increased 3.1 percent for the year, a percentage point above
year-ago levels.)
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1990s, as oil prices fell to abnormally low
levels, many Americans did not fully appreciate the benefits of a
plunge in demand on world oil markets as economies in Japan and
southeast Asia slumped. Americans _ and the US economy _ benefited
from a surplus of oil on world markets. Low oil prices also reined
in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Asia's back, and its demand for oil is back,'' Wyss said.
``That was a free gift, and you can't expect that to continue.''

CRITICS BITE TO THE CORE OF APPLEBEE'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is Applebee's and why are people saying those nasty things
about it?
</P>
<P>
   Applebee's, as you may know, is a chain restaurant whose slogan
is ``America's Favorite Neighbor.'' It is the uncrowned king of
what is called the ``casual-dining concept.'' It is the largest
such chain, with $2.3 billion worth of sales at 1,198 locations.
The management estimates that the United States could accommodate
1,800 Applebee's before reaching some kind of saturation point, so
all I can say is: brace yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Who has been trashing Applebee's? For starters, the satirical
magazine The Onion cruelly mocks the Hartford Applebee's in the
current issue, with its tongue-in-cheek expose ``Area Applebee's a
Hotbed of Machiavellian Political Maneuvering.'' There is no
Hartford Applebee's just as there is no Boston Applebee's; the
``neighborhood'' in the trademarked name ``Applebee's Neighborhood
Grill &AMP; Bar'' inevitably refers to a mall-like Shopper's World or
the scenic Cranston (R.I) Garden City Shopping Center, two
locations where I recently ate.
</P>
<P>
   Applebee's has likewise been fricasseed in a recent collection
of food essays by Sallie Tisdale called ``The Best Thing I Ever
Tasted.'' Tisdale, a contributing editor for Harper's, is an
Intellectual, so naturally she disdains Applebee's. And yet her
vicious, drive-by firebombing of the Overland Park (Kansas)-based
chain has more than a grain of truth to it.
</P>
<P>
   The interior decoration is indeed quite cloying. The
agglomeration of Life magazine covers, old license plates and
'40s-era movie studio glossy photos that festoon the Applewalls is
known in the restaurant business as ``non-chain decor.'' But the
decor is uniform across all the sites. ``Applebee's decor is
history written by people who have never studied history,'' Tisdale
writes. ``But they know a lot about marketing.'' Inter alia, she
takes a pot shot at Applebee's chief executive, Lloyd Hill, who
``isn't really a restaurateur'' but . . . ``a businessman.''
Imagine that! In terms of offhand slander, I might have mentioned
that the chain was once part of W.R. Grace, famed for bringing good
things to many neighborhoods, or that the company's stock price is
lower today than it was five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What about the food? It's the Model UN on quaaludes: Oriental
Chicken Salad; Tijuana ``Philly'' Steak Sandwich; Aztec Chicken
Salad; Jambalaya Pasta and so on. ``World food principles gone
mad,'' Tisdale writes. ``The food is not good, but not bad . . .
Applebee's purpose is inoffensiveness.'' In this, it succeeds
magnificently. On Sunday night, I ordered Applebee's new specialty,
``Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken.'' My solicitous and, yes, friendly
waitress kept asking me if it tasted ``too spicy.'' I didn't have
the heart to say it tasted like something NASA might feed the
astronauts on Cinquo de Mayo from festively decorated tubes.
</P>
<P>
   By way of establishing my credentials, I should say that in
addition to Cranston and Framingham, I can recall eating at
Applebee's in Newton and Manchester, N.H., within the past year.
I'd like to say something (itals)nice(unitals) about Applebee's,
because my family and I used to enjoy eating there. That was before
my children crossed the threshold of gastronomic innocence and
realized that deep-fried chicken fingers and french fries for $2.79
are no bargain, nutrition-wise nor pocketbook-wise. And before I
realized that heaping plates of onion rings and ``supreme'' nachos,
seductive as they are, might not be Dad's best friends, either.
</P>
<P>
   So here is the sum total of nice things I can say about
Applebee's: They serve liquor, which is a medically approved muscle
relaxant/depressant that can be safely imbibed in times of stress.
The portions are generous. I paranoiacally poured their 16-ounce
beer into a laboratory beaker, and it measured 17 ounces. The staff
is quite chipper _ and who doesn't like chipper? And their food is
better than Bickford's or Denny's, which is faint praise indeed.
But the International House of Pancakes they will never be.

secretary C.J. Cregg of ``The West Wing,'' was ``briefing'' TV
critics Tuesday about NBC when Megan Mullally of ``Will &AMP; Grace''
popped up in the back of the room with a pressing question.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the banshee-on-helium voice that makes her socialite
character, Karen, so indelible, Mullally explained that her NBC
sitcom could really use one of those hot ``reality'' programs as a
lead-in.
</P>
<P>
   So how about scheduling ``Survivor'' just before ``Will &AMP;
Grace''? No can do, she was told, ``Survivor'' isn't on NBC.
Mullally persisted: ``Big Brother,'' then? Nope. ``How about that
`Millionaire' show?'' Uh-uh. ``Making the Band?'' Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on hips, Mullally demanded: ``Is there any reality
programming on this network at all?'' Told there was not, she
declared: ``Well, somebody's going to get their ass fired!''
</P>
<P>
   Never let it be said NBC doesn't have a sense of humor about the
quandary in which it suddenly finds itself. The craze of this
summer is ``reality TV,'' and the Peacock Network has been caught
flat-footed while its rivals bask in high ratings, media attention,
and bushels of advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality programming is definitely here to stay,'' conceded
NBC's top programming executive, Scott Sassa. ``It's not just a
fad: It's a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't as aggressive as we should have been in this area.
It's an area we definitely have to pursue . . . The public has
spoken, and they want some of these shows.''
</P>
<P>
   How far is NBC willing to go in search of a blockbuster? This
far: The network is in serious negotiations for an American version
of a Dutch reality show called ``Chains of Love,'' in which a woman
is chained to four men, then chooses one each day to be cut loose
until she is left with the one to whom she is most attracted.
</P>
<P>
   With a straight face, NBC Entertainment president Garth Ancier
called it ``a relationship show.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just NBC: Whatever restraints there once were on
network television seem to be coming loose. As the Globe reported
Tuesday, ABC has proudly announced a new marketing campaign for its
sitcom, ``Norm,'' that will verbally accost viewers in public
restrooms. Via an audio device affixed near urinals in New York and
Los Angeles, the voice of actor Norm McDonald will be heard making
such wisecracks as ``Hey, watch your shoes!'' and ``Oh, my God,
look at the size of that thing!'' ABC also plans to leave messages
on viewers' home answering machines, urging them to watch a new
sitcom, ``Madigan Men.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks' willingness to go to such extremes suggests two
things: that bottom-line pressures have made them desperate, and
that they believe there is more promotional and ratings upside from
such stunts than there is public-relations downside.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa, who said after being named president of NBC West Coast
last year that his priorities were more family programs and less
sex on NBC, said Tuesday that he believes the public has changed
its view of what is acceptable on television. ``This is just a
thing you have to adapt to,'' he said. ``It's the way the world has
changed.'' He insisted that the image of NBC _ a network identified
with such smart, Emmy-winning shows like ``Frasier,'' ``ER,'' ``Law
&AMP; Order,'' and ``Friends'' _ will not suffer from a move toward
reality programs like ``Chains of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not diminish the level of quality'' of NBC's sitcoms
and dramas, he said. ``But we cannot ignore the level of interest
in these kinds of (reality) shows.''
</P>
<P>
   That extends to advertisers, who once turned up their noses at
programs like Fox's ``Cops,'' according to Ancier, a former Fox
executive, but now are willing to pay premium rates for spots on
``Survivor'' or ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of NBC's interest in getting on the scoreboard, dozens of
producers have made pitches for new reality programs, including
knockoffs of ``Survivor'' that are set on buses or trains, and even
one that featured people eating sheep's eyeballs, according to
Sassa.
</P>
<P>
   As he sifts through prospective programs, Sassa is apparently
feeling heat from his bosses, Jack Welch, chairman of NBC's
corporate parent, General Electric, and NBC president Robert
Wright. Both have reportedly complained about the network being
left behind in the reality-TV stampede. In a lighthearted reference
to the situation, Janney opened the mock press conference Tuesday
by saying: ``Today is Tuesday, July 18, making this the 23rd day in
a row that Scott Sassa has not been fired.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sassa and Ancier play catch-up in the reality race, even one
of their top stars admits she's hooked on a CBS show. ``I'm
obsessed with `Survivor,' '' said ``Will &AMP; Grace'' star Debra
Messing Tuesday. ``The house thing (``Big Brother'') is weird, but
`Survivor' rocks.''

 &HT;    RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT DEALS POLITICAL WIN TO PUTIN
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Vladmir Putin's promise to strengthen
federal government moved one step closer to reality Wednesday, when
the lower house of parliament approved key laws curbing the power
of regional governors.
</P>
<P>
   Putin introduced the legislation to change the structure of the
country's political system, saying the bills were necessary to
establish the rule of law in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The measures will strip governors of the right to sit in the
upper house of parliament, called the Federation Council, and take
away their right of immunity if they are charged with breaking
federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors of the laws described the vote as another step
towards authoritarianism in the country, and warned it would put
still more power in the hands of an already-strong president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an attempt of a constitutional coup,'' said Andrei
Piontkovsky, director of the Center for Strategic Studies, a think
tank. ``It's a well thought-out plan being carried out in tandem
with a fight against the oligarchs, to remove powerful
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma's 363-35 vote _ which overcame a Federation
Council veto _ comes after the government instigated a series of
high-profile tax evasion cases against the small group of powerful
Russian businessmen known as ``the oligarchs,'' who are seen as the
most influential politicians in the country besides the governors.
</P>
<P>
   Duma legislators who voted for the package of bills Wednesday
said it was a step in the right direction to make Russia's
parliament a more professional body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the president has separated regional leaders
from the Federation Council and wants to make it a professional
body is very important. The governors are too strong and too
dangerous,'' said Yelena Mazulina, deputy from the liberal Yabloko
Party, which sits in opposition to Putin's parliamentary bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's predecessor Boris Yeltsin created the country's
post-Soviet Constitution, which outlined a distribution of federal
powers between the president and the two-chamber parliament. The
Duma, the lower house, is comprised of nationally elected
officials, while the upper house, the Federation Council, is made
up of governors, who are elected locally.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long characterized Russia's regional leaders as
bureaucrats who run their territory like medieval fiefdoms, due to
a lack of federal oversight and a strong legislative branch of the
federal government. The governors control how federal funds
allocated to their region are spent, they give tax breaks or
declare a company bankrupt at whim, and they can give _ or deny _
permits for media outlets to work locally.
</P>
<P>
   This autonomy has led to the passage of regional laws that often
conflict with federal laws, a situation Putin has declared many
times, must come to an end so that the country ``would remain
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duma's passage of the compromise law means governors will
give up their seats in the Federation Council by February 2001. The
governors will hand-pick their replacements, who will be subject to
dismissal by a vote in their regional parliament. Mazulina said she
hopes this situation will be replaced by direct elections for
council deputies within the next two years.

CRAZY-MAKING HOLLYWOOD; TITO THE GREAT; GRAFFITI HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Hollywood really crazy? Well, of course, Hollywood is crazy _
Kevin Costner, with his no-acting, can't-buy-a-hit self, is still
making movies, isn't he? That, however, is not one of the 100
reasons Movieline supplies as proof positive that Hollywood types
are as wacky as a bag o' cats. Basically, the feature is just an
excuse for its writers to make snarky comments about stars, and to
show that their magazine isn't really becoming just another
sycophantic celebrity rag. There are obvious potshots such as
Whitney Houston's ongoing marriage to Bobby Brown (No. 85), and
Woody Allen dumping Mia Farrow to marry her adopted daughter,
Soon-Yi Previn (No. 51). And there's more information than anyone
needs about the things stars do to stay pretty, such as Shania
Twain's use of something called Bag Balm, intended to numb cow's
udders during milking, as a face moisturizer (No. 40). Some of the
items aren't so outlandish _ who can blame Jennifer Lopez for
bringing her own sheets during hotel stays because she refuses to
sleep on anything with a thread count of less than 250? But the
list really cranks up with such gems as Mira Sorvino's absurd
portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in a cable movie (No. 77) and Jennifer
Love Hewitt's ill-advised turn as Audrey Hepburn in a recent TV
movie (No. 78), and the frightening revelation that Cindy Crawford
intends to make more films (No. 90.) Wow, can you imagine what
would happen if she and Costner ever teamed up? Oh, the horror!
</P>

   When you get right down to it, there isn't much to distinguish
Latina from numerous other magazines out there targeting young
women. Yes, it's geared for Hispanic women, but really, it's just
the same parade of fashion, beauty, health and relationship tips.
But if you have the patience to wade through such airy features
about whether a summer romance will still burn hot come autumn, and
the unappreciated elegance of the ponytail, there's one piece worth
checking out in the August issue _ a tribute to Tito Puente. Before
Santana, before Ricky Martin, before Marc Anthony, there was
Puente, the great, Grammy-winning musician and composer, who died
in May at 77. It was Puente introduced the joy and magic of Latin
music to the masses a half-century ago. Instead of a straight
appreciation essay about the man they call ``the earliest
gatekeeper of the Latin-music garden of earthy delicias,'' they
allow their readers to reminisce about Puente, and their letters
speak volumes about how his music touched their lives. Says one
reader, ``When my four older brothers would get ready to go to the
Hollywood Palladium to see Tito and (fellow Latin music icon) Celia
Cruz, his music would be playing, and the family would somehow
start dancing, and the house would be the happiest place on earth.
Thank you, Tito, for the music of your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the current Latin stars for whom Puente paved the way,
India, is featured in the same issue. She discusses how she became
successful in an industry which once believed women couldn't sell
salsa music, and also criticized her ample curves as a turn-off.
(She has since lost weight, although she says she did it for
herself, not record sales.) She also speaks frankly about an
abusive relationship, and how surviving it strengthened her and
influenced her music. ``People think I hate men because of my
lyrics, and it's just not true,'' she tells writer Juan M. Mendez.
``I don't hate men. I love men! What I hate is discrimination of
any kind. What I hate is domestic violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Stress bills itself as ``hip-hop's only story telling magazine
for, by, and about its readers,'' which is another way of saying
it's not The Source or XXL. While it isn't as well known as those
magazines, it's steadily making a name for itself as an alternative
for news and views among hip-hop heads. There's a great piece by
Supriya Pillai about WERISE, an acronym for Women Empowered through
Revolutionary Ideas Supporting Enterprise.'' Formed last year in
New York, WERISE is an organization, collective, and production
company formed to support the creative efforts of women artists.
What's refreshing about the organization is its open to all women
regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, age or ideology.
``We are only as strong as we are represented,'' says co-founder
Rozz Nash. A hip-magazine writting about a womanist/feminist
collective _ imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, there's the story of Fuzz One, one of New
York's best known ``subway bombers,'' or graffiti writer, written
by Fuzz One himself. He's been using New York's subway cars as his
personal canvas since the 1970s, which was the height of the
hardcore graffiti movement. The story is written in a loose,
non-linear style, and Fuzz has some interesting stories as one of
the few white graffiti writers to get respect among the hardest of
the hard. But what makes the piece are the photographs of his work,
some of which are stunning. Is graffiti vandalism? No doubt. But it
was such a part of the subways, and made them so distinctive, that
those graffiti-proof cars now rattling through NYC just don't look
right without the aerosol inspiration of such spray-paint gods as
TAKI 183, TURK 62, and FUZZ One.

   If you're old enough and from the Bible Belt, you may recall the
days when an unholy alliance of Baptists and bootleggers would team
up on the same side in wet-dry elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptists certainly didn't want Demon Rum being purveyed, and
the bootleggers certainly didn't want anyone but their illicit
selves purveying it.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of thing is happening again in Washington even as we
speak.
</P>
<P>
   The ``godly'' and the great big gambling interests are ganging
up to try to ban most forms of wagering on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of cyber-casinos seems to be cutting in on the
gaming gravy train, and the folks in Las Vegas and Atlantic City,
as well as other fixed-site palaces of chance that have sprung up
around the country, want to put an end to the cheeky competition.
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. Inc. reported recently that Internet
gambling generated $1.2 billion in revenues last year and would
grow to $3 billion by 2002. An exponential boom is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet gambling industry is amenable to many of the same
strictures that govern casinos, including regulation, even
taxation, but those offers were not good enough for proponents of
an outright ban.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to outlaw Internet gambling has given rise to one of
the more amusing and expensive lobbying fandangos of the current
congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner are most evangelical Christian groups and the
casino lobby, as well as others who stand to be hurt financially by
Internet gambling, such as liquor stores that do a big business in
government-run lottery tickets. On the other side are the Internet
industry, the gambling sites, libertarians and, in some cases, the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some improbable legislative contortions have ensued.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the influential and well-heeled pari-mutuel
interests won an exemption in the main House version of the bill.
They're worried about declining attendance at the track and are
happy to parlay their action into the ether. By some accounts, the
exemption actually expands the Internet gambling opportunities for
these folks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, governors wanted an exemption to explicitly
allow Internet sales of lottery tickets, but they failed to get
one.
</P>
<P>
   Is this sinking in? The folks who run horses and dogs got their
way. The governors did not. What is wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   A general ban on Internet gambling passed the Senate on a voice
vote last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Monday night, the House voted 245-159 for a ban,
including the pari-mutuel exception. But the measure was being
considered under a procedure that required a two-thirds vote,
meaning the proponents were 25 votes short.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote pointed to the scramble of party allegiances and
ideologies the issue has produced.
</P>
<P>
   In favor of the ban were the unlikely duo of Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee, the hopelessly knee-jerk Democrat from Houston, and Rep. Dick
Armey, the neo-Neanderthal Republican from the Dallas area. Voting
``no'' were such arresting combos as Reps. Bill Archer, R-Houston,
and Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the strong House support, advocates of the ban
vowed to press on and seek another vote when only a simple majority
would be required. But problems of legislative scheduling,
including the need for what could be a protracted House-Senate
conference on a final measure, make prospects for the proposed ban
uncertain at best.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a lot easier discussion if governments had never
succumbed to the allure of gambling. Then lawmakers might be able
to make some morally defensible argument that gambling is a
deleterious activity that should be strictly regulated and taxed,
if not outlawed outright.
</P>
<P>
   But that horse is way out of the gate. States now count on huge
rakes from gambling enterprises that they regulate (horses, dogs,
casinos) or run themselves &QL; 
(lotteries).
</P>
<P>
   Further, enforcement of a ban would be nightmarish. Most
gambling sites are, not surprisingly, run from off-shore _ Antigua,
St. Martin, Latin America _ meaning that policing of a U.S. ban
would be problematic at best.
</P>
<P>
   If the Justice Department were really interested in cracking
down on the gambling sites, it could move under the Wire
Communications Act of 1961, which was passed to ban sports betting
over the telephone. But the government lawyers, unlike the
antigambling zealots on Capitol Hill (and their greedy casino
friends), remember Prohibition.

   Oh wow. Bulletin. Bulletin. This just in:
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of how riveting the major political parties'
national presidential nominating conventions are expected to be,
ABC News has gotten the National Football League to agree to change
the starting times of two Monday night preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   This, we are told, means the network will be able to devote an
hour _ a whole hour _ of primetime coverage to each of the opening
nights of the Republican and Democratic conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, ABC planned only to provide prime-time coverage of
the GOPers on July 31 and the Dems on Aug. 14 during the halftimes
of the NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   Then, ta da, ABC learned some folk of news value were expected
to speak on the opening nights of these incredibly choreographed
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Golly, of course the network could have had no idea speakers
such as Colin Powell and Laura Bush and President Clinton and
Hillary Clinton were tapped to speak on the opening nights of their
particular conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Wanta bet?
</P>
<P>
   The only real thing at question in ABC's sort-of-last-minute
scheduling finagling is: What, at the near last minute, made the
network honchos decide Americans actually might like a glimpse of
the national political conventions' opening nights?
</P>
<P>
   This is not a particular gig at ABC. Its rescheduling just
presented itself as an especially bright example of the public's
general perception of modern political conventions and their trend
to long-winded dreariness. Certainly, CBS and NBC hardly are going
to fill their airwaves with hours of convention coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, were it not for PBS' plan to provide virtual
gavel-to-gavel coverage, non-cable television subscribers across
the country would have no chance to see anything but awfully edited
presentations of the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's really quite nice to learn PBS now can be seen by
non-cable subscribers almost everywhere in the United States,
neither is this a particular gig at all those Americans who won't
watch much of the conventions even without the excuse of not having
the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, for that matter, is this a special gig at the parties for
finding themselves spreading what has become, at best, a one-night
show into a four-night speakathon.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some of us will like hearing all sorts of political types
speak to halls filled with usually tackily outfitted delegates who
often like to talk and visit with one another far more than they
like to listen to those on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   But, that's politics and that's fair _ especially when you
realize those rude roars are heard only by the poor speakers, not
those hearing the word on sheltered television microphones.
</P>
<P>
   The one speech that really counts and that most are interested
in hearing at any political convention is the acceptance speech by
the nominee. That's pretty much as it ever has been and ever shall
be.
</P>
<P>
   In the talk about the conventions that came before most of us,
the one thing that dominates is the nominating process. For
example, there are those who can describe with vivid recall the
votes at conventions in the 1950s. Ask them about any speeches _
including the acceptance ones _ and, usually, your answer is heavy
silence and blank faces.
</P>
<P>
   It's not television's fault _ the major networks who carry too
little and the cable networks who try to fill too much air time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the political parties' fault. Their leaders would be
fools to pass up such golden opportunities for party pep rallies
and any exposure to the general public they can get for their
candidates, their campaigns and, hey, even their kind-of basic
political philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the fault of newspapers, which have the luxury of
filling their pages with reports and observations of events and
intrigues that television _ even most delegates _ never could find.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even the fault of political columnists _ ragtag and
otherwise _ who analyze and pontificate, lecture and share, find
merit in and scorn the worth of today's political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   It's no one special's fault, but maybe we all ought to work
together to change from the kind of national nominating conventions
that served the purpose of their names to the post-primary
conventions of today which, in truth, are not nominating but
acceptance conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, even political junkies recognize some things political
are nothing but awfully ho hum. &QL;

TABLE-HOPPING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND NAPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco and Boston: often compared, but
really a continent apart. A recent visit, in the chilly month of
June, provided a few more comparisons and some notable differences.
The city by the bay is a food town extraordinaire and has been for
ages, fueled by the ever-ready supply of California's bounty; its
restaurants are filled with a combination of fervent local diners,
tourists, and convention goers. And then there's Napa, where the
ribbon of Route 29 that snakes from the town of Napa through St.
Helena and on past Calistoga can only be compared to Route 6 on the
Cape. Once on, there's no escape as the traffic crawls ever so
slowly north.
</P>
<P>
   Some notes from the far side of the country:
</P>
<P>
   We arrive at Gary Danko's at 5:30 on a Friday evening, the only
reservation my sister-in-law could wangle by calling weeks ahead of
time. One of the hottest high-toned spots in town, this place has a
dining room that looks like a supper club _ cool, shuttered, and
mirrored, in subdued colors. It's definitely not in the mold of the
big, dramatic palaces now in vogue; not a fish tank or water wall
in evidence. It's named for the chef, a moniker that sounds a
little like an auto parts store.
</P>
<P>
   The room starts to fill up, though, so the slight twinge of
paranoia one feels at being so unfashionably early dissipates
quickly. And the staff, beautifully outfitted in dark suits, is
gracious and chatty. Anyway, by that time we're deep into
deciphering the prix fixe menu, which takes some concentration. A
diner can order three, four, or five courses for prices ranging
from $51 to $70; each portion is adjusted depending on how many
courses are ordered. It's fun to mix and match this way, we decide,
choosing several appetizers, adding an entree, pondering the cheese
course versus dessert. But it sounds chaotic for the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Maitre d' and co-owner Nick Peyton explains later in a phone
interview that the flexible prix fixe came from his frustration. At
many restaurants, he thinks, the ``choices are few and the rules
many.'' This method, he and Danko decided, is more
``user-friendly.'' And, he insists, careful handling means that
dishes don't go astray. No, no one has ever ordered four courses of
desserts, either _ ``although they could if they wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Danko's cuisine reminds me a little of Michael Schlow's at
Radius: the same voluptuousness, the same intensity of flavorings,
all with a classical underpinning in sauces and combinations.
Glazed oysters with a thin, creamy stew of leeks and salsify slide
down the throat luxuriously. A terrine of foie gras boasts crunchy
brioche toast points and a bright lemon chutney. Snapper fillet is
hard-seared at the edges, a brilliant contrast with the creamy
flesh. Danko is superb at game birds, preserving the fine delicacy
of tiny quail and making a masterpiece of a fat squab permeated
with allspice, cinnamon, coriander, and other Moroccan spices. The
bird is stuffed with couscous and, when cut into fat slices,
resembles an intricate sculpture of rosy skin against pale yellow
grain, over a bed of cumin-scented carrots.
</P>
<P>
   We graze through our varied courses, liking everything we taste.
We stop short for the impressive cheese cart and slow only slightly
at desserts, the better to appreciate the richness of chocolate
souffle with a chocolate sauce and one of vanilla, enchanting the
child in all of us, and to savor the warm apricot tart. The meal is
delightful, and I'd have to say the philosophy of varying the
portion sizes works _ you leave happy but not stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Napa Valley draws hordes of visitors these days, and we
meander up for two days over a holiday weekend. Big mistake,
trafficwise. So we stick to the back roads and smaller wineries.
</P>
<P>
   Napa restaurants are almost always packed _ wine tasting can
make one hungry. Bistro Jeanty, lively, boisterous, and very in
right now, squeezes my husband and me into a table wedged against
the back wall. The women next to us are drinking pink cosmopolitans
through the meal, an odd sight in a French bistro in the heart of
wine country. We eat terrine de lapin (rabbit pate), beet and mache
salad, cassoulet. All the food is great, very authentically French
bistro, as though we've been transported to Lyons. Another bistro,
Bouchon, owned by French Laundry star Thomas Keller and his
brother, has also opened in the valley. This seems odd too: robust
French frites and pieds de cochon (pigs' feet) in the heart of
Cal-Ital.
</P>
<P>
   We all have our favorites, though, and mine in Napa is Terra, a
St. Helena restaurant owned by husband and wife Hiro Sone and Lissa
Doumani. Sone, the chef, and Doumani, who oversees desserts, met at
Spago, where they both worked, and 12 years ago opened this 90-seat
place in an old stone building. Perusing the menu reveals no
prevailing style or cuisine. Some dishes sound Italian, some
French, many appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's food that we like to eat,'' says Doumani in a later phone
interview. The couple matches ingredients to the climate of the
valley, she says, eschewing any particular style, the benefit of
having one's one restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The individuality is certainly part of the appeal. Cauliflower
soup is so simple _ cauliflower, cream, peekytoe crab, and a little
American caviar _ that chef Sone is amazed when people order one,
finish it, and order another. Pure and elemental in flavor, cool
and smooth, the soup is fantastic; we don't order a second, but we
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   The grilled quail is fine but can't match the beauty of a plate
of spaghettini with tripe, tomatoes, and white beans. Although I've
always pretended to like tripe, some versions of it feature too
much tomato sauce and tough strands of tripe; the Chinese style is
almost always too chewy. This is pared-down tripe gently handled,
the strips tender, discreetly tossed among the beans and bits of
roasted tomatoes. The dish is comforting rather than spectacular,
sustaining rather than overwhelming. It cements my admiration for
Sone's cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As we get ready to leave Terra, the manager, Tim Mosher, asks if
we'd like to take the rest of our bottle of pinot noir with us.
It's a pleasant surprise, as the two of us rarely finish a whole
bottle and have gotten used to squandering the last third or so,
rather than drinking more than safety allows.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, alcohol laws and restaurant practices differ greatly
from state to state; Terra's practice would be verboten in
Massachusetts, where having an open bottle in the car could get you
hauled in. Mosher's view is that it's much safer to take the wine,
rather than feeling obliged to drink it all.
</P>
<P>
   Wine is a big deal, of course, in Napa and all over California.
Although most restaurants have impressive wine selections, it's
fairly common for diners to bring bottles along with them. Not an
eyebrow is raised when one of our party brings a French burgundy to
Gary Danko's, though a $25 corkage fee is charged.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Liquor Licensing Board spokesman explains that the
practice isn't allowed here because the city issues licenses on a
``public need'' basis. If bottles were brought in, the city would
lose its control over alcohol consumed. Not to mention upsetting
the earning potential of those getting a liquor license.

JEWS SEE US AS SECULAR, SURVEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite what appears to be a growing inclination among many
religious groups, politicians, and judges to chip away at the wall
that separates church and state, American Jews remain staunchly
opposed to any mixing of religion and public life.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey of the Jewish community finds that, although some
factors that have historically contributed to Jewish support of
strict separation between church and state have waned, Jews are far
more reluctant than non-Jews to accept references to religion in
the public schools or other public arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews are more secure when society is more overtly secular,''
said Alan Mittleman, director of the ``Jews and the Public Square''
project, one of seven surveys funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts
examining the contemporary role of religious groups in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that Jews are much more liberal than other
Americans on a variety of issues involving sexual morality that
have roiled other religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews take a less critical view of homosexuality, abortion,
birth control and pornography than do Gentiles,'' the study found.
``In each case, Jewish leaders are even more tolerant than the
Jewish public.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, 48 percent of non-Jews say homosexuality is wrong,
compared to 23 percent of Jews and 7 percent of Jewish leaders. And
while 56 percent of non-Jews support abortion rights, 88 percent of
Jews and 96 percent of Jewish leaders do.
</P>
<P>
   The findings on church-state separation could have important
bearing on the Jewish role in the debate over school vouchers. As
the number of children in Jewish day schools has skyrocketed, some
Jewish policy makers have suggested that the community supports the
use of vouchers, but the survey suggests that Jewish reluctance to
support such a step runs deep.
</P>
<P>
   (Orthodox Jews have been more sympathetic to the use of public
funds to assist children attending religious schools and to the
display of religious symbols on public property.)
</P>
<P>
   Jewish support for church-state separation traces back to the
1940s, and is driven by concerns that a greater presence of
religion in the public sphere means a greater presence of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent the protections afforded by church-state separation,
many Jews feared that Christian church leaders, in the context of a
large Christian majority in the American population, would promote
an explicitly Christian character to the American state and its
institutions,'' the study declared. ``Jews, in particular, were
concerned that the schools not be used to indoctrinate their
children in the culture and tenets of Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish attitudes were intensified by the community's fear of
anti-Semitism associated with some Christian groups, and by the
community's liberalism and secularity, the study said. In recent
years, the study said, Jews have become more accepted in the United
States, Jews have become less liberal, and a significant fraction
of the community has become less secular, but the attitudes have
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Only 38 percent of Jews support allowing the Ten Commandments to
be displayed in public schools, compared to 65 percent of non-Jews;
39 percent of Jews would allow the teaching of creationism,
compared with 63 percent of non-Jews; and 22 percent of Jews would
support vouchers that could be used at reiligious schools, compared
with 43 percent of non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The data come from a survey of a 1,002 Jews around the U.S.
Because of the relatively small number of Jews in the United
States, the pollsters used a somewhat unorthodox method for
assembling a sample -- they queried a sample of 600,000 Americans
who have agreed to be surveyed by mail on various matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Charitable Trusts is also funding studies of
African-American, Catholic, evangelical, Hispanic, mainline
Protestant and Muslim religious populations in the United States.
Each study will include a poll, scholarly papers, and conferences
over a three year period.

&HT;     LOFTY GOALS BEHIND `LAUGHABLE' LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stephen Barnett, a law professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, says Julia Hill ``ought to be
laughed out of court.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Barnett argues: ``The idea of living in a tree
doesn't belong to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. How naive of Hill in this day and age to sue a big
Internet service provider and its even bigger ad agency for
allegedly imitating her likeness and profaning every personal and
public thing for which she stands.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, such idealistic sensitivity should be expected from
a person who re-adopted her childhood nickname of ``Butterfly'' and
spent two years living all alone on a fragile wooden platform atop
a 200-feet-tall, old-growth California redwood.
</P>
<P>
   This is a person who named the tree ``Luna.''
</P>
<P>
   And swears she still feels the 1,300-year-old giant's spirit
deep within her own heart.
</P>
<P>
   We are not exactly talking about the most normal, practical
human being on Earth here, now are we?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Hill climbed down from her tree in Humboldt County on
Dec. 18, packs of people _ for and against the movement to save
old-growth redwoods in Northern California _ have been waiting for
her to make another kind of descent.
</P>
<P>
   Into the realm of the co-opted and the sell-outs.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and handsome like Luna, and the daughter of an Arkansas
preacher, Hill is only 26 years old. But already she is a
bigger-than-life symbol to thousands.
</P>
<P>
   To some, she's a born-again mystic, a young woman who climbed a
threatened tree for what she thought would be a few weeks of
protest, and ended up learning some eternal truths about life and
the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   To others, she is an environmental hero, whose dangerous,
self-sacrificing effort to spare one old tree from clear-cutting
raised awareness of the entire movement.
</P>
<P>
   To still others, Hill is an airy-fairy activist wannabe, a
woman, according to columnist Alexander Cockburn, whose ``fiery
anti-corporate rhetoric'' has been ``replaced by banal spiritual
homilies and indifferent poesy.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, as Hill told the Associated Press earlier this
year:
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has an opinion, a demand, a request, a feeling, a
thought, you name it, about me and what I'm doing with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although people are waiting (eagerly or fearfully) for her moral
descent, Hill has so far stayed her course. In a society that
constantly whipsaws between its desire for hope and its incurable
cynicism, she has managed to walk an excruciatingly narrow
tightrope of do-gooder celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   She has done this, it seems, by holding sacrosanct the integrity
of her name and the benevolent wisdom she believes Luna imparted
during their 738-day cohabitation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when Hill saw a print ad for OmniSky, a Palo Alto-based
Internet and e-mail service provider, she felt violated.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ad does not use her name, it shows a young woman
with long dark hair like Hill's, sitting on a small wooden platform
high up in a redwood tree. Using OmniSky, she's asking a man at the
base of the tree to come up and give her - a sponge bath.
</P>
<P>
   In her lawsuit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Hill
alleges that OmniSky, its parent carrier, AT&AMP;T, and the company's
ad agency, TBWA Chiat/Day have ``severely and irreparably harmed
Ms. Hill and the movement she has come to symbolize.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the suit says the ad is ``completely antithetical to
Ms. Hill's values, and (is) profoundly injurious and destructive of
the sanctity of her peace, happiness, and feelings, as well as her
privacy, identity and her life's work.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of Hill's suit is to force OmniSky and the other
companies to stop running the ad, turn it over to her and destroy
all copies. She is also asking for unspecified damages that,
according to a spokesman, would be used _ as are profits from her
recent book _ for Hill's environmental activities, not for her
personal gain.
</P>
<P>
   Since news of the suit broke last week, legal experts like
Stephen Barnett have weighed in. Most share the Berkeley
professor's dim view, if not of the suit itself as ``laughable,''
at least of Hill's chances of winning.
</P>
<P>
   As one entertainment industry attorney, Harley Williams of Los
Angeles, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Does a picture of a woman sitting in a tree have a secondary
meaning that says, `That's Julia'? It seems unlikely to me, but
she'll get significant publicity for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, so far, is the same thing as saying Hill will get a
significant amount of public attention for her cause: Luna and
everything that giant old redwood represents.

LIVING' LA VIDA LOONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGAWAM, Mass. _ It's another sunny summer day deep inside Looney
Tunes Movie Town at Six Flags New England. Way off to one side of
the amusement park, between the Speed Trap kiddie ride and the
Subway food stand, about 125 squinting patrons have gathered in
front of a small stage. They're sporting tank tops, T-shirts,
halter tops, shorts, sandals, sneakers,
</P>
<P>
   and various degrees of sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole DiDomenico is ready for them. Indeed, the 19-year-old
college student must be ready for them five times a day, five or
six days a week, from Memorial Day through Labor Day. That's nearly
400 times that she'll portray either Sylvester the cat or Foghorn
Leghorn the rooster, dancing and prancing her way (a soundtrack
provides the characters' voices) in a heavy, oversize costume
through a 25-minute performance of the Chevy Venture Looney Tunes
Rockin' Road Show. Before waving good-bye to the small crowd, she
always lumbers to the front of the stage to silently touch and
cuddle many of the kids who've been watching, some of whom warily
pose beside her while their parents capture the Kodak moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I've (itals)already(unitals) been in 400
shows,'' DiDomenico declares wearily after a recent performance.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's complaining. As summer jobs go, this one beats
working down at the Meriden Square Shopping Center, nearer to her
home in Berlin, Conn., where she labored last summer. (It pays
more, too: $7 an hour vs. $6.75.) ``I'm dancing, I'm sweating, and
I'm losing weight,'' DiDomenico says. ``This isn't sitting indoors
behind a counter and saying, `Can I help you?' over and over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it's a job that DiDomenico can't admit to, at least not
publicly. In order to reinforce the illusion that a 6-foot cat or a
7-foot rooster is real, she can never be seen by outsiders (or
photographed) while getting into or out of her costume. She must
always refer to Sylvester and Foghorn in the third person, as in
``Sylvester is a very unlucky cat'' or ``Foghorn is very much into
himself.'' In fact, she can't even say she ``plays'' a role, but
must instead insist that she ``helps'' her characters perform in
the same way that, say, 16-year-old Sean Hatcher ``helps'' Bugs
Bunny and 20-year-old Christina Fletcher ``helps'' Daffy Duck on
the Looney Tunes stage. So if you ask her if it's hot inside a
rooster suit, she'll reply earnestly, ``Don't worry. Foghorn is
very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even ``helping'' makes a nice addition to a resume,
especially for a dance performance major at Hartford Conservatory
who began taking lessons at age 3 and is now being paid to be
onstage for the first time. ``It could be valuable if I ever wanted
to work at, like, Disney,'' points out DiDomenico, who drives about
80 miles round-trip to work each day. And just maybe, she reasons,
it could eventually help her to land her dream job: a role in the
musical ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have to be on Broadway,'' she adds hastily. ``It
could just be a tour of America. Even if it just toured
(itals)Connecticut,(unitals) I wouldn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Six Flags New England will do. The 235-acre
park, an impressive and continuing makeover of the former and
frumpy Riverside Amusement Park, employs over 3,000 seasonal
employees, according to a spokesperson. About 600 of these are
recruited overseas, but most of the rest, like DiDomenico, come
from the Connecticut River valley. They're ride operators,
maintenance workers, games overseers, food servers, parking
attendants, security guards, sales and marketing interns, ticket
takers, performers, and EMTs. So important are young seasonal
workers to the park that it has been granted a temporary waiver
permitting 16- and 17-year-olds to remain on the job until 11 p.m.,
rather than until the 10 p.m. deadline mandated by Massachusetts
child-labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that stage performers have a certain status
among park workers, DiDomenico, who works an 11 a.m.-to-7 p.m.
shift, hardly has a star painted on her dressing room door. She and
the four other cast members of the Looney Tunes show, the eldest of
whom is 21, reach their small shared quarters via a corridor that
also provides access to a public men's room. Their major amenities
are a small freezer, a tiny sofa, a boombox, and a single shower.
``Anyone who comes to visit us sits on the floor,'' says
DiDomenico, who got her job here after two auditions. (``I cried.
My father cried.'')
</P>
<P>
   Her duties, meanwhile, don't end with her performance. Cast
members must frequently wash down the stage and pick up trash
around the low red benches on which the audience hunkers down.
Between performances _ always wearing their bright blue park
shirts, name tags, khaki shorts or pants, and white shoes and socks
_ they are encouraged to attend other park shows and to provide
exaggerated enthusiasm. For DiDomenico and her co-performers, that
often means hooting at the five-piece Dixieland Express (``They're
the (itals)ooooonly(unitals) live music in the park,'' she
laments), after which the two groups of young performers try to
figure out how to kill time until their next shows:
</P>
<P>
   ``You wanna hang in our dressing room?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah. You wanna hang in our dressing room?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The major alternative is the Caf, a.k.a. Wabbits, a well-hidden
and Spartan employee cafteria that features decidedly non-park food
prices ($1.25 hamburgers! 75-cent french fries!) and where the
major decoration is a sign telling workers what to do if they
encounter a lost child. Employees are not allowed to partake of the
park's rides during working hours, although they do receive a free
admission pass once a week. And shopping within the park, even with
a 35 percent employee discount, isn't a particularly attractive
option when you're making $7 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sure you don't wanna hang in our dressing room?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. You sure you don't wanna hang out in (itals)our(unitals)
dressing room?''
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, only 185 shows until Labor Day, right? Meanwhile,
DiDomenico's summer job will help pay for a new Hyundai, a cell
phone, and clothes down at the mall. ``It's been a fun summer and
I've met a lot of new people,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``But next year,'' adds the former high school swim-team
captain, referring to Six Flags' water park here, ``I think I want
to be a lifeguard.''

 COX &HT;    Adding a bathroom exhaust fan good way to lower humidity in the
house
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Around the Miami Valley we have fairly mild
summers temperature-wise, but it gets seriously uncomfortable when
the humidity is high. If you can lower the humidity inside your
house during the cooling season, you can raise the thermostat on
your air conditioner and still feel cool.
</P>
<P>
   That's why adding a bathroom exhaust fan or a range hood that
exhausts outdoors is a good investment for saving energy. Today
we'll concentrate on bathroom fans, but installing a range hood is
not much different.
</P>
<P>
   The two most important issues in deciding between two bathroom
exhaust fans are capacity and noise levels, and both are easy to
compare.
</P>
<P>
   When you visit a store to shop for exhaust fans, you'll find
most of them are marked with a CFM number such as 80 CFM or 120
CFM. This represents the number of cubic feet of air the unit moves
per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The larger the bathroom, the larger the CFM number required. A
100 CFM fan can handle a bathroom of about 90 square feet (9 by 10
feet), for example.
</P>
<P>
   The fan package will also be marked with a sones number
indicating how loud or quiet the unit is. A fan rated 1 sone makes
about as much noise as a whisper, and some fans are rated as low as
0.5 sone.
</P>
<P>
   Most moderately priced fans fall in the 2.5 to 5 sones range. A
fan above about 6 sones is likely to produce a drone that will
become very unpleasant after a while.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've decided how much capacity you need and how much
noise you're willing to tolerate, you can start shopping for other
features such as lights, heaters and automatic controls.
</P>
<P>
   Several local home-improvement stores carry plain,
ceiling-mounted fans delivering about 130 CFM and producing about
2.5 sones for about $75 to $100, not including installation
hardware. Such units have a plastic cover and no lights.
</P>
<P>
   Add a light and a night light and the price increases about $30
for the same power. Replace the plastic with wood and brass for
another $10 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Some exhaust-fan units come with built-in heaters to help warm
the bathroom. The heater units readily available at local stores
have electric heaters using about 1,200 to 1,600 watts, which means
they'll need to be placed on a hefty circuit (about 20 amps) or
they might trip breakers or blow fuses.
</P>
<P>
   The fans with heaters also tend to devote less power to moving
air, so their ratings drop toward the 70 CFM to 90 CFM range. They
sell for about $100 to $200, with the wood and brass models at the
high end.
</P>
<P>
   A check of local stores found no fans with automatic controls .
Automatic fans come equipped with motion detectors to turn on when
someone enters the bathroom or humidity detectors to turn on when
the humidity in the bathroom rises.
</P>
<P>
   Stores can order such models for about $215 to $350. But even
without automatic controls, it's a simple matter to turn a fan on
and off with a wall switch.
</P>
<P>
   Putting in an exhaust fan requires what I call second-tier
do-it-yourself skills; it's harder than entry-level jobs like
replacing a light switch but easier than building a room addition.
</P>
<P>
   Fan installation requires some carpentry and wiring skill, plus
the use of a reciprocating saw, a tool most people don't have lying
around. You'll also probably need to climb on the roof and remove
some shingles.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to install an exhaust fan is on the ceiling of
the bathroom, but that is only practical for the do-it-yourselfer
if the area above the bathroom is accessible, as in the floor of an
attic.
</P>
<P>
   Start the installation by opening the package the fan comes in,
reading the instructions carefully and doing an inventory of parts
and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans don't come with exhaust pipes, roof vents and wall
switches, so you'll need to determine what materials you'll need to
finish the job. Kits are available that promise to include all
you'll need to vent the fan through the roof or through a wall, but
you probably can buy the parts for less by shopping for individual
components in the vent-pipe aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Take the main housing of the fan into the attic and lay it next
to an attic floor joist over the position you want the grille in
the bathroom below. Mark the outline on the ceiling and cut along
the lines. The best way to make a clean cut is to drill holes at
the corners of the outline and cut along the lines with a hand
jigsaw or wallboard saw.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the fan housing in place over the opening and have an
assistant in the bathroom below attach the grille facing to the fan
housing. Attach the housing to the joist in a position that lets
the grille sit flush against the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   If your fan has a light or heater, you'll have to install boards
on either side of it to hold back the attic insulation. Insulation
resting against a hot fan housing is a fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is wiring. You'll have to run an appropriate
electrical cable into the box and attach it to the house's power
supply at a wall switch. If you're not sure how to do that, it's
probably a job best left to a professional electrician.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase is providing a path for the moisture-laden air to
be pushed outside. Allowing the fan to simply blow its air into the
attic can cause moisture problems there, and failing to vent a fan
outside violates most community building codes.
</P>
<P>
   From the underside of the roof, select a spot near the fan
housing for the exhaust pipe to poke through the roof. Pick a spot
next to a rafter so you'll have something to anchor the vent to.
</P>
<P>
   Mark a circle large enough to accept the vent tailpiece next to
the rafter. Cut it out with a reciprocating saw. Attach a clamp to
the rafter just inside the hole to hold the tailpiece in place.
</P>
<P>
   While on the roof, remove shingles but not the roof paper from
the area where the vent cover flange (a protective metal plate)
around the vent will go. Stick the tailpiece through the hole and
clamp it in place. Attach the vent cover to the tailpiece and apply
roofing cement to the bottom of the flange before nailing it in
place with roofing nails.
</P>
<P>
   Run a length of flexible exhaust hose from the outlet on the fan
housing to the tailpiece of the vent. Wrap the hose with pipe
insulation to reduce condensation that could drip and damage the
fan motor.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, take the electric line you ran into the fan housing
earlier and attach it to the motor, making sure first that the line
is not live.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get at the fan from above, you can follow a similar
series of steps and mount a fan high on a wall and vent it through
the wall directly to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   As mentioned earlier, installing an exhaust fan is a fairly
complicated project, and the instructions that come with your fan
may not be clear enough for you to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   The best source I've found for extra advice on this job is the
book ``Home Improvement 1-2-3: Expert Advice From the Home Depot.''
You can find it at the public library.

FUNDS ANSWER THE FERVOR FOR TECH STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putnam Investments launched a brand-new technology mutual fund
this week. MFS Investment Management recently introduced a
technology fund and a global telecom fund. In September, Fidelity
Investments will roll out two new select funds, one for the
wireless industry, one for the networking business.
</P>
<P>
   Raise your hand if you spot a trend here.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is not just a sector anymore. It is an asset class,
and people can't get enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   In the first five months of the year, more than one out of every
three dollars that went into mutual funds found its way into
technology funds, according to FRC, a Boston company that tracks
mutual-fund flows. A big chunk of that money went to Janus, the
Denver mutual fund company, which boasts a family of tech funds.
</P>
<P>
   The other fund companies are suffering from Janus envy, and
their response has been a predictable one. Practically every major
fund group, including some that have never sold anything but fully
diversified funds, has hopped on the technology bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Among those that have created or filed to create new tech funds
are Pioneer, Neuberger &AMP; Berman, Oppenheimer, Franklin, and Charles
Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of feedback from the people who sell our funds,
asking for a technology offering,'' said David Oliveri, a spokesman
for MFS, explaining his firm's decision to get into the technology
fund business. Putnam heard the same thing from its brokers.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to blame investors for their single-minded pursuit of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want performance,'' said David O'Leary, president of
Alpha Equity Research. Technology has had performance in spades.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The Nasdaq Composite index, which is technology-heavy,
last year was up 86 percent. Even with the big sell-off this
spring, many tech stocks are hitting new highs.
</P>
<P>
   When Lipper Inc. recently ranked the top mutual funds of the
past 10 years, the first four funds on the list were Fidelity
select funds that invest in technology: Select Electronics, Select
Technology, Select Computer, and Select Developing Communications.
All were up at least 1,400 percent over the 10-year period. The
best funds over the past one year, three years, or five years are
also technology names.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks account for 34 percent of the total value of
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, up from 7 percent in 1989. Said
O'Leary: ``Who is to say that in five years, the number won't be up
to 50 percent?''
</P>
<P>
   Given their mad dash to technology, you might guess that
investors don't own much technology in their regular mutual funds.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   At Putnam, for instance, popular growth funds like Voyager,
Vista, and New Opportunities have anywhere from 45 percent to 60
percent of their money in tech stocks, according to the company's
Web site. At Fidelity, both Retirement Growth and Aggressive Growth
have 65 percent of their money in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Asking for more technology on top of that is a bit like asking
for french fries with your french fries.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Greenwald worries that investors may wind up with
indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry was built on the tenet that you should diversify
your risks,'' said Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant in
Philadelphia. ``The thinner you slice the baloney _ to high tech,
to telecom, to wireless _ the more you are increasing the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Benz, a senior analyst with Morningstar Inc., which
tracks the mutual fund business, makes a similar point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most investors would be better off with a regular growth
fund,'' she said. ``They will have plenty of exposure to
technology, plus the manager has the flexibility to go elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Benz makes one more point: With a big-name growth fund,
investors are likely to get experienced money managers. On the new
pure-tech funds, the managers are more likely to be no-name
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? No one cares. Technology has become a religion,
with a large group of faithful followers. Those disciples believe
in technology _ and they don't want to hear about risk and
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   So far, their faith has been handsomely rewarded, and sticking
with technology, even during difficult times like this spring, has
proved to be a wise course.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies have little choice but to give investors
more technology funds. The alternative is to watch the money flow
out the door.

VERMONT ADOPTION SAGA MAY HAVE A WIDE IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Michael Stamatis spent his formative years
being tormented in one of the world's cruelest institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, everything changed: He was removed from an
orphanage in Romania, adopted by a couple in Vermont, and began to
recover from the psychic wounds any child would incur if subjected
to sustained emotional and sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But the 17-year-old boy's journey from nightmare to dream didn't
last long. The people who took Michael in have dissolved the
adoption, relinquished their erstwhile son into state custody, and
accused him of sexual assault _ a felony charge for which the state
plans to prosecute him as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's saga is about to spark an international incident.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged Romanian Embassy officials in Washington already have
drafted a letter to legal and social-service authorities in Vermont
warning their treatment of Michael could determine the future of
all adoptions by Americans from his country.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some adoption specialists worry this case could have
even wider repercussions, inducing more governments to reconsider
their policies on placing children with US families.
</P>
<P>
   ``When other countries see Americans adopting their children,
then dissolving the adoptions and prosecuting the children, they
wonder whether to get involved with us at all,'' said Maureen
Hogan, who as president of Adopt America has been working to
improve conditions in Romanian orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont officials say they understand that Michael went through
hell in Romania, but insist that they are doing everything possible
to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our recommendations have to be based on the standard of `best
interests of the child' . . . and not on international relations,
on any effect on adoptions generally . . . or on any other
political considerations,'' said William Young, the state's
commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, as Michael was named in his native country, spent
his first 15 years at the Siret Neuropsychiatric Institution in the
northeast corner of Romania. The facility is widely known as one of
the worst legacies of Nicholae Ceausescu,the longtime dictator who
was deposed in late 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 200,000 boys and girls were institutionalized during
Ceausescu's regime, the majority because their parents were too
poor to care for them. Most were abused and deprived of the
affection or personal contact necessary to develop normally.
</P>
<P>
   While the current Romanian government has markedly improved
conditions, and has begun deinstitutionalization programs, its
orphanages generally remain damaging places for children to grow
up. The one in Siret, where about 500 children now live, by all
accounts is among the most horrific.
</P>
<P>
   Before children from Siret are deemed ready for adoption by
Americans, they undergo years of therapy and behavioral training by
a team of US physicians and mental-health professionals who travel
to Romania. The team is led by Ron Federici, a Virginia
psychiatrist who is an authority on institutionalization and has
adopted four children from Siret himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Constantine and two Romania girls adopted with
him, Federici also intensively screened the parental applicants to
assess whether they could cope with the difficulties inherent in
raising such challenging children. He approved Lisa and Tim
Stamatis of Burlington, who had received high marks for their
rearing of five special-needs children they had already adopted.
</P>
<P>
   For the first year, by all accounts, the three Romanian children
made substantial progress and everyone seemed happy with the new
family arrangement. But then, for reasons that haven't been
explained publicly, something changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, the name the Stamatises gave their son, began to slip.
The boy had a less-than-normal intelligence level and spoke no
English, so he'd always had a hard time communicating. Now he was
growing unresponsive to educational efforts and the sexual acting
out that he had done initially _ a frequent behavior for sexually
abused children who haven't learned other ways of making physical
connections _ began to recur, according to a detective's report
filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Stamatises' willingness or ability to deal
with their children's problems changed, too. In the last several
months, they have moved to legally dissolve their adoptions of
Michael, one of his Romanian sisters, and a severely disabled child
they had adopted years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, whose lawyer did not respond to requests for
interviews, also filed a complaint alleging Michael had
inappropriately fondled the genitalia of both Romanian girls
adopted with him. Federici and others familiar with the case
described the parents' decision to initiate criminal proceedings,
rather than to seek treatment, as unusual.
</P>
<P>
   They claim it might have been at least partly a financial move
by the Stamatises, who would have been responsible for some
child-support payments since they voluntarily relinquished their
son into state custody. When the minor involved is the object of
criminal charges, such costs are absorbed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Michael is currently being treated at a facility in southern
Vermont, and no court dates have been set for him. Vermont
officials declined to discuss why they decided to prosecute him as
an adult as well as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Federici, Hogan, and the Romanian government insist the boy's
language, cultural, and institutional problems are not being taken
sufficiently into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how lonely he feels, whatever they are trying to do
for him; he doesn't speak the language and he knows nobody around
him,'' said Federici, who is fluent in Romanian and has tried to
become a party to the court cases involving Michael. He has been
rebuffed both by the judge and other state officials.
</P>
<P>
   They have not said why they have excluded the psychiatrist's
participation as an expert witness or as a therapist, though he has
volunteered to play either role at his own expense.
</P>
<P>
   Federici said he is so concerned about Michael's welfare he has
offered take the boy and his adoptive sisters off of Vermont's
hands altogether, again at his own expense. He wants to find other
homes for the girls and to place Michael in a specialized treatment
facility in Baltimore, where there are other onetime Romanian
orphans with whom Michael is friends and with whom he has seen
during reunions arranged by Federici.
</P>
<P>
   The press and science attache at the Romanian Embassy, Stefan
Maier, has drafted a letter, which the ambassador is now reviewing,
praising Federici's efforts and asking Vermont officials to
reconsider the psychiatrist's participation.
</P>
<P>
   This episode, writes Maier, could ``trigger a mechanism with the
potential of bringing damage to international adoption by US
citizens from Romania.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael's prosecution, Maier added in a telephone interview,
could hurt future adoptions from Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way of dealing with this boy doesn't serve anyone,''
Maier said. ``Not the children who need families . . . or the
Americans who want children. This way, there are only losers.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   This has been a summer of symbols for women of the cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was the African Methodist Episcopal church, which
elected the Rev. Vashi McKenzie of Baltimore to be the first woman
bishop of a black Protestant denomination.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks earlier, the nation's largest Protestant
denomination moved in the opposite direction, declaring that women
should not serve as pastors in Southern Baptist churches.
</P>
<P>
   And just last Thursday, the Episcopal Church started
disciplinary action against three dioceses that have refused to
ordain women even though the denomination has allowed women priests
for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the women's movement propelled the first major wave of
women into Protestant seminaries 30 years ago, women ministers have
made some remarkable advances, including ascending in Massachusetts
to the top posts of three denominations.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to scholars and clergy, women still face
obstacles that have come to be known as a stained-glass ceiling.
Women in ministry, on average, earn less money and have less
prestigious assignments than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appointment of one person to high liturgical office does
not mean the barrier is down at all,'' said Edward C. Lehman, an
emeritus professor of sociology at the State University of New York
at Brockport. ``Even though denominational executives try to to say
the system is equal for men and women, in practice it doesn't work
out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Women now make up an estimated 11 percent of clergy nationwide,
and 31 percent of students preparing for ordination at graduate
schools of theology. The Unitarian Universalist Association is the
first denomination in which women make up more than 50 percent of
ministers; at the historic Andover Newton Theological School in
Newton, Mass., women make up 60 percent of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   And women in New England have achieved some lofty positions. The
United Methodist Church's top regional administrator is a woman,
Bishop Susan W. Hassinger; so is the top official of Massachusetts'
American Baptist Churches, the Rev. Linda Spoolstra. And the Rev.
Margaret G. Payne of Shelburne, Mass. will be installed as bishop
of the New England synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Rt. Rev. Barbara C. Harris, the No. 2 official in the
Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, was the first woman to become
an Anglican bishop, and Virginia S. Harris is the top official of
the lay-led Christian Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But at the level of churches, differences persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really trying hard in many more liberal denominations .
. . and we need to celebrate that, but the problem is there is
still an inner, unnamed desire to have men lead,'' said the Rev.
Jan Powers, pastor of North Congregational Church in North Amherst,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Research studies over the last several decades, conducted by
universities and within denominations, confirm that impression.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 79 percent of United Church of Christ pastors are
men, but the majority of associate pastors are women, and women are
more likely than men to fill positions overseeing religious
education, music, and youth programs. And women in the UCC earn
less money than men in the same positions.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics from the Presbyterian Church (USA) show a similar
pattern _ a higher percentage of men as senior pastors, and a
higher percentage of women in junior positions.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the American Baptist Churches believes women are
losing ground. The American Baptists have been ordaining women for
130 years, but the official said some churches are now hiring males
pastors ordained in other denominations rather than female American
Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am seeing increasingly large numbers of women entering
seminary, and many of them are graduating with honors, but they are
not getting placed,'' said the Rev. Valentine B. Royal, director of
American Baptist Women in Ministry. ``I would say that we have lost
ground. It's reverting to the old boys club. People don't even feel
compelled to interview women anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That pattern was confirmed by Paula D. Nesbitt, a sociologist at
the University of Denver and author of ``Feminization of the Clergy
in America,'' who researched the Episcopal Church and the Unitarian
Universalist Assocation and concluded that the more women entered
the ministry, the fewer prestigious opportunities were available to
them. Instead, Nesbitt says, women clergy wind up in in part-time,
low-paying, or junior jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 30 to 40 years, there has been a proportional
diminishment of opportunities to get into high-level leadership
positions,'' Nesbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The picture for women is bleaker outside mainline Protestant
churches. Roman Catholics, Greek Orthodox, and Orthodox Jews do not
ordain women; women also do not lead Muslims in worship.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical churches have a mixed history; the Southern Baptists
recently made clear their reluctance to see women as pastors, but
just last week a prominent Pentecostal official responded by urging
churches to allow women in leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Reform and Conservative Jewish semiaries are ordaining
increasing numbers of women rabbis, but most preside over small
congregations. The most prominent exception is Rabbi Emily Lipoff
of Temple Ohabei Shalom in Brookline, Mass., one of only two rabbis
in the country heading a large congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Women ministers say they must combat a number of stereotypes:
that they will have more trouble balancing work and family than a
man, that they will be less adept at handling financial and
administrative decisions, and that many people, when visualizing a
pastor, see a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a reluctance to seeing that women have the
intellectual capacity to make hard decisions on employment
practices and property issues,'' said the Rev. Carol M. Flett,
rector of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Weston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Judith L. Rhodes of Emmanuel Church in Boston's West
Roxbury neighborhood said women must prove their abilities in
managerial areas where men are assumed to be strong. Rhodes calls
the Diocese of Massachusetts ``extremely welcoming'' to women, but
says ``I do think there are not as many opportunities in larger,
wealthier parishes for women as rectors as I'd like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the historically black Protestant denominations, progress has
been particularly slow. The handful of women who head black
churches in Massachusetts have small congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always known that women maintain and sustain our
churches, but this has been one place where our leadership has been
firmly men,'' said the Rev. Gloria White-Hammond, co-pastor of
Bethel AME Church in Boston. ``Smart white men went a lot of
different places, but this was a place where a smart black male,
when he couldn't go to law school or medical school, went.''
</P>
<P>
   Every woman minister interviewed for this story said women have
made more progress in Massachusetts than elsewhere, and each
praised her own church hierarchy for trying to ensure fairness. But
each woman also had stories of ways in which they were treated
differently based on gender _ usually by having the work-family
balance or their administrative faculties questioned, but sometimes
by outright discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several jobs I didn't get far in because the
churches were looking for men,'' said the Rev. Rebecca Brown, an
interim minister at Second Congregational Church in Winchester,
Mass. But Brown said she found other congregations that were happy
to employ a woman, and that in general, ``we're doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Women in ministry can't turn to the courts _ a tactic used by
women in other professions _ because churches are exempt from
antidiscrimination laws. And in many denominations, ministers are
hired by congregations, not assigned, limiting the ability of
leadership to force change.
</P>
<P>
   The American Baptists are testing one strategy: asking
congregations to accept resumes that do not reveal gender.
</P>
<P>
   Other denominations appoint female interim ministers to
congregations wary of women leaders, hoping their fears will be
assuaged. This strategy worked for Flett, who became rector of a
Burlington, Mass. church that wanted a man but changed its mind
after working with a woman on a temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's often a powerful indigenous reluctance to accept women
in ministry, but often if the first woman minister is an interim,
and they start to like her, then things start to change,'' said the
Rev. Paula J. Fletcher of United Church in Clinton, Mass.

<P>
   STRATHAM, N.H. _ On a recent morning, a blond woman in
camouflage picked her way through ripe-smelling farmland toward a
trap she had set the night before, its nylon now shuddering with
the weightless bodies of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Tricked by a stream of carbon dioxide they had mistaken for a
mammal's breath, they had been sucked by the tiniest of fans into a
cone-shaped net where they trembled together, whining.
</P>
<P>
   Some mornings, Sarah MacGregor has found as many as 8,000
mosquitoes crowded inside the bag, in a pile so dense that they
give off the distinct scent one of her staff describes as
``meaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, their corpses would be packed in dry ice, mailed to
Boston and painstakingly analyzed, on the infinitesimal,
needle-in-a-haystack chance that the mosquitoes of Stratham are
carrying the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   James Stuart's dairy farm is 300 miles from New York City, where
seven people died last summer after the mosquito-borne virus
mysteriously surfaced for the first time on this continent. Crows
and hawks have not fallen out of the sky in New Hampshire,
supplying clues about where the virus is dwelling, as they have in
New York and New Jersey this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But as late summer approaches, and mosquitoes rise by the
millions out of salt marshes, scientists all along the East Coast
are racing to find the virus in insects or animals before human
cases show up.
</P>
<P>
   (Officials are already scrambling to spray parts of New York
City, Long Island and Westchester County after announcing Monday
(July 17) that the virus had been found in mosquitoes, Associated
Press reported this week.)
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict infected mosquitoes will already have scattered,
making them more difficult to kill. There is no cure for West Nile
encephalitis, which is fatal in 3 to 15 percent of human cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah MacGregor and her corps of women in hip boots are a
distant outpost in the search for the virus, and her anxiety about
it is mixed with the eagerness of the mobilized volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first mosquito bite I got this year, I looked at it and
thought, `Could this be the one?' '' said MacGregor, who began
working in mosquito control 21 years ago, fresh from the University
of New Hampshire's entomology program. ``I've worked my whole
career to help battle a public health emergency. So it's
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for the West Nile virus, sustained at a low boil all
winter, has lurched back to life as the height of mosquito season
approaches. After 20 years in the business, MacGregor knew enough
to give a shudder at noon last Sunday, when _ based on the
staggering number of larva she had found in water samples around
Stratham _ millions of them pulled their stalky, black-and-white
legs out of the marsh and balanced themselves precariously on the
water's surface. For an hour, they sat on the marsh hardening their
exoskeletons in the sun, then embarked on a life spent blindly
seeking moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Around noon, a craving for protein came over the fertilized
females, who took to the air in search of a stream of warm breath
and what scientists refer to as a ``blood meal.''
</P>
<P>
   The project of controlling mosquitoes has met with skepticism
from the public ever since 1912, when John B. Smith, New Jersey's
state entomologist, tried to convince state lawmakers to require
local programs _ and was roundly ridiculed for it, as if he had
proposed abolishing bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was regarded as exceptionally radical,'' said Wayne Crans,
director of mosquito research at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
``One of the comments (from lawmakers) was, `Why not a law to
exterminate potato bugs?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But that skepticism was not in evidence last year, after 63
nonfatal and seven fatal cases of West Nile encephalitis were
reported in the New York City area. Humans can contract the virus
only through the bite of a mosquito, which in turn contracts the
disease from a ``reservoir'' such as wild birds or livestock. Last
year's human victims described initial symptons as mild and
flu-like, and most were not seriously ill. But a few developed
encephalitis, a sometimes fatal swelling in the brain or spinal
column.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this summer has provided only a trickle of information
about where the virus is living, despite a $7.7 million program for
surveillance of wild birds, chickens, livestock and mosquitoes in
the 17 states and two cities targeted by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In February, an infected red-tailed hawk fell dead from a tree
in Westchester County. In March, officials at the CDC announced
that the virus had been found in mosquito larva that had survived
underground through the winter, so the outbreak would not _ as had
been hoped _ die out with the end of mosquito season. Three crows
were found infected in New Jersey and New York in June. And by last
week, the number of infected birds found had climbed to 13,
scattered among New York's Suffolk, Weschester and Rockland
counties, as well as Bergen County in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Although mosquitoes are the only creatures known to transmit the
virus, not one infected mosquito has been found yet this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have found it,'' said Crans. ``The crows are trying
to tell us something. They're saying, `You're looking in the wrong
place.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's outbreak was confined to New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, but public health officials say it is possible that by
August, infected birds may migrate from New York City to the south
coast of Massachusetts. Rhode Island and Connecticut were also
singled out by the CDC as potential danger spots. The three
northern New England states were not designated danger spots, but _
like states as far away as Washington State _ are all applying for
federal funds to test their mosquitoes for disease. MacGregor,
whose company, Dragon Mosquito Control, has a contract with the
state, hopes to see the present surveillance program increased
tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be healthy on Saturday and by the next Friday on
life support in the hospital,'' she said. ``It's not just a pest.
It could kill your parents. That's very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The testing process itself is labor-intensive. Once mosquitoes
have been collected, they are sorted by species and grouped in
pools of as many as 50 mosquitoes, said John Anderson, director of
the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, which this summer
will double the 65,000 insects it tested last year.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen in glass tubes at a temperature of minus 80 degrees, the
mosquitoes are suspended in liquid along with tiny glass beads and
sand-like grinding material, then spun at high speed using a
machine called a vortexer, so the mosquitoes' individual cells have
been broken down. Finally, the lab injects the mosquito parts into
host cells, which are incubated in the hope that any viruses living
within it show themselves, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Once scientists find infected mosquitoes, they can urge
residents to take special precautions against insect bites, and
state officials can decide whether to use pesticide, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   In a field whose experts still sometimes estimate mosquito
populations by counting human complaints, the probability of
finding small numbers of infected mosquitoes, especially in states
with small programs, remains daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with orders of magnitude that are well beyond
public health's ability to sample in a way that would make you feel
that we are doing an exact job,'' said Christopher Mores,
supervisor of arthropod-born virus supervision for the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health, which has screened
mosquitoes for diseases like Eastern Equine Encephalitis for 40
years. But ``if someone can come up with a better'' method of
tracking the disease, ``good luck,'' he added. ``We can't just wait
for humans to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   What people have to remember in the face of these odds is that
``there are no antiviral agents,'' Anderson said. ``There is no
cure.''

&HT;     ALL BETS ON BUSH BOOKENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DARREN RICHARDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Las Vegas doesn't accept wagering on
presidential elections, but if it did, the pre-convention favorite
would be George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothetical betting line would change throughout the
campaign, of course, but at this point the Texas governor and
presumptive Republican presidential nominee is well on his way to
capturing the 270 electoral votes needed to bookend Bill Clinton's
presidency with a couple of Bushes.
</P>
<P>
   The hard truth is that Al Gore, shrewd campaigner and wily
tactician that he is, has a daunting task ahead of him: He must win
big states where Democrats struggled prior to Clinton's successes.
Gore needs Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio. It's a tall
order.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whom the candidates pick as their running mates,
some things are embedded in stone. Bush won't carry Massachusetts,
for example, and Gore can forget about Wyoming and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Other states are very much in play now, but won't be by
November. A Florida poll issued in early July, for example, shows
Gore and Bush in a statistical dead heat. And Bush actually leads
Gore in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   By November, things will shake out and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush
will deliver 25 Sunshine State electoral votes for his brother
(though if Gore taps Florida Sen. Bob Graham for vice president,
Florida will be the most interesting state to watch as the race
unfolds).
</P>
<P>
   Bush should be able to count on the following states (electoral
votes in parenthesis) as a base: Alabama (9), Alaska (3), Arizona
(8), Florida (25), Georgia (13), Idaho (4), Indiana (12), Iowa (7),
Kansas (6), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (9), Mississippi (7), Montana
(3), Nebraska (5), North Carolina (14), North Dakota (3), Oklahoma
(8), South Carolina (8), South Dakota (3) Texas (32), Utah (5),
Virginia (13) and Wyoming (3). Current estimate: 208. Needed to
win: 62 more.
</P>
<P>
   Gore should win California (54). If he doesn't, his loss will be
along the lines of the thrashing Michael Dukakis took from George
Bush in 1988. Gore should also prevail in Connecticut (8), Delaware
(3), District of Columbia (3), Hawaii (4), Maine (4), Maryland
(10), Massachusetts (12), Minnesota (10), New York (33), Oregon
(7), Rhode Island (4), Tennessee (11), Vermont (3), Washington
(11), West Virginia (5) and Wisconsin (11). Current estimate: 193.
Needed to win: 77 more.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the states most observers consider ``in
play.'' They are Arkansas (6), Colorado (8), Illinois (22),
Michigan (18), Missouri (11), New Hampshire (4), New Jersey (15),
New Mexico (5), Nevada (4), Ohio (21) and Pennsylvania (23).
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bush leading or competitive in all these states, but
that won't be the case come November. Bush will maintain his lead
in and carry Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio and
Pennsylvania, but Gore will prevail in Arkansas, Colorado, Nevada,
New Mexico and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   That puts the final numbers at 318 electoral votes for Bush and
220 for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, I hope I'm wrong: I've voted in presidential
elections since 1984 _ for Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Clinton
and Clinton. And even though I registered as a Republican to
support Sen. John McCain in the California primary (re-registering
as a Democrat in late March) and am leaning toward Ralph Nader now,
I may well come around for Gore by November.
</P>
<P>
   The problem Gore faces, however, isn't so much with Democrats
who voted for the likes of Mondale and Dukakis as it is with those
who voted for Ronald Reagan. Polls from states like Missouri,
Michigan and Ohio indicate most Reagan Democrats are leaning toward
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Bush does something so incredibly stupid that the public
comes to see him as a lightweight far out of his league _ and such
a gaffe is not out of the realm of possibility _ look for the
Republicans to reclaim the White House by at least the 98 electoral
votes forecast here.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bush at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. won't be pretty, but
right now, it seems highly probable.

&HT;     INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SHANNON BUGGS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Vicente Fox won the Mexican presidency, citizens who voted
for him knew the place to celebrate was at the feet of nation's
capital's most famous landmark, the Angel of Independence on
Reforma Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Investors knew better.
</P>
<P>
   The real place to party in Mexico City was in the financial
district, at the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, the country's stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the election the bolsa jumped more than 6 percent.
But since then, the index has been in a holding pattern. Although
there is good reason to be excited about the potential impact the
election will have on the economy, investors realize significant
changes are a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   The historic election ended 71 years of rule by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which is known by its
Spanish-language initials PRI, and revived international interest
in Mexico's markets.
</P>
<P>
   But before individual investors rush to chase that rally, they
must consider the risks that shape the Mexican economy.
</P>
<P>
   Elections in Mexico typically are followed by major crashes in
the Mexican financial markets. So far, it appears Mexico will avoid
that curse this year. But even if the economy remains stable
through the presidential transition, investors can't count on big
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot forget about the fact that embedded in the
investment decision is the possibility there could be a
devaluation,'' says Rafael Bello, a Latin American analyst with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``A country like Mexico is not going to
guarantee stellar performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is still considered an emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of reasons for that, not the least of which is
debilitating poverty that engulfs large chunks of the population
and prevents the government from collecting enough in taxes to
sustain social programs that could raise literacy rates and income
levels.
</P>
<P>
   This economy still depends on state-run companies that
monopolize the nation's electric, petroleum and other top
industries. On the campaign trail, Fox promised to bring more
competition and foreign investment to Mexico, stopping short of
committing to privatization. But it may take him his entire
six-year term to make good on that.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind Mexico's recent prosperity is exports.
More than 80 percent of Mexico's goods and services are sold to the
United States, with Canada and European nations trailing far
behind. So, if the U.S. economy slows, the Mexican economy will
also pull back.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that can be seen now. At the end of the first
quarter, Mexico's economy grew 7.9 percent, and it's on track to
end the year at 5.2 percent, says Joyce Chang, head of global
fixed-income research at Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's emerging status is also a reflection of the high
volatility in its markets.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Mexico's bonds were listed as junk bonds by the
nation's top rating companies. Now its bonds are considered
investment grade by one of the rating companies, and the other is
expected to up its rating of Mexico to investment-grade by year's
end.
</P>
<P>
   The improved ratings can be attributed, in part, to the free
market reforms started by outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo, whose
six-year term ends on Dec. 1. Fox has the difficult job of
maintaining Zedillo's fiscal discipline while shepherding reforms
in the tax system, courts and schools through political land mines.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this will happen overnight, so if you choose to
invest in Mexico at all, consider it to be a long-term proposition
rather than a short-term one.
</P>
<P>
   So, how can investors take advantage of the political changes,
the credit upgrade and the improved economy?
</P>
<P>
   One of a handful of possibilities is stock in Mexican companies
or U.S. companies with Mexican operations, but the risks and
returns cover a wide range.
</P>
<P>
   The most efficient way to bet on all of Mexico is to buy either
closed-end country funds or international index funds.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end country funds are mutual fund investment companies
with a fixed number of shares that can be bought and sold on stock
exchanges at a discount or for a premium.
</P>
<P>
   There are two for Mexico _ Mexico Fund, on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker MXF, and Mexico Equity and Income Fund,
which trades as MXE on the same exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But closed-end funds have fallen out of favor with many
investors, mainly because their prices have been stagnant or
falling. Their one-year returns range from 54 percent on the Mexico
Equity and Income to 2 percent on the other.
</P>
<P>
   What is in vogue, however, are international index funds _ stock
portfolios that mimic performance benchmarks and are traded like
stock on the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   These funds are also called WEBS, an acronym for World Equity
Benchmark Share. They are designed to trade in line with their net
asset values, so discounting is not as much of a problem. Also,
there is not as much active managing with WEBS than with closed-end
funds, which may produce more stable results and fewer expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ishares' MSCI Mexico Index tracks Morgan Stanley Capital
International Mexico index and trades under the symbol EWW.
</P>
<P>
   But with so few choices, it is still a big risk to invest solely
in Mexico. You may want to hedge your bets by buying Latin America
funds, such as the Merrill Lynch Latin America or the T. Rowe Price
Latin America funds.
</P>
<P>
   But before you shift any of your money into a Mexico or Latin
American fund, make sure you are not getting caught up in a wave of
hype.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully assess if such an investment matches your risk
profile, asset allocation and financial goals. If you don't, the
next downturn in the Mexican economy could sink your portfolio.

   AUSTIN, Texas - Yes, the world of those under 20 can be
inscrutable to those over 30. But if you're looking for a peek
inside the inner sanctum, you might get a clue on the big screen
starting Friday, when director Amy Heckerling's latest film,
``Loser,'' opens. Heckerling (who happens to be 46) seems to have a
knack for capturing the trappings of teen-dom. Check out her
filmography:
</P>
<P>
   First, there was ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' (1982), which
showcased Southern California proto-slacker hip _ remember
Spicoli's checkerboard Vans? The skinny ties and cabbie's cap of
Mark ``Rat'' Ratner, who also shoved his sport jacket sleeves up to
the elbow? Dude! (Let's not forget ``Aloha, Mr. Hand.'')
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``Clueless'' (1995), a fluffy ``Emma''-inspired
confection with short pleated cheerleader skirt suits, omnipresent
cell phones, throwaway references to Christian Lacroix and Calvin
Klein, and a high-school argot that quickly was absorbed into the
mainstream _ ``As if!'' and ``That is so five years ago!''
</P>
<P>
   What does ``Loser'' have in store? The movie reteams ``American
Pie'' co-stars Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari (here, looking
suspiciously like a Meg Ryan Mini-Me circa ``Addicted to Love'') as
young college students in New York. Looks like sooty eye makeup and
bed head are on the ``In!'' list for fall. Potential additions to
teen-speak: ``Skotch'' (pronounced ``scootch''), meaning ``a little
bit,'' as in, ``Turn it down a skotch''; saying, ``Dust!'' instead
of ``Bye!''

&HT;     CELEBRATING AMERICA'S DIVERSE BEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN GRIFFIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Institute of Brewing Studies, along with brewers' guilds
across the country, has declared July to be the first American Beer
Month.
</P>
<P>
   I laughed when I first heard that because when I was growing up,
America arguably produced the worst beer in the world. When I was
9, my beer-fancying uncle visited us from Germany, and after too
many failed experiments, he finally refused to drink anything but
Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed with the explosion of microbreweries and the
growth of independent brewers, who take extraordinary care with
their product.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in terms of both experimentation and mimicry of established
international styles, American beers are largely among the best in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   To help you celebrate the rest of American Beer Month, here are
a few U.S. brews of all varieties and styles worth a mug or two.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Steam Beer has been around for ages, and had we known of
its existence back in the early '70s, my uncle's vacation might not
have been so sobering. This fresh hop brew contains no additives,
which may explain its unique flavor and champagne-like fizz.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder Amber Ale comes from the Rockies, as the name implies,
and has the expected roasted caramel aroma with a crisp hop finish.
Maybe it's the mountain spring water that elevates above the norm
(but, then again, Coors boasts the same thing).
</P>
<P>
   Celis White, out of Austin, Texas, is a great wheat beer with
touches of citrus and coriander in a true Belgian style.
</P>
<P>
   Stoney Creek Vanilla Porter offers bittersweet flavors of
roasted coffee and chocolate, both typical of porters. Then it adds
the boldness of vanilla to create a multilayered treat that could
serve as a dessert substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Redhook ESB is a personal favorite just to kick back with after
a hard day at work. It started life as a winter ale, but its
dryness is welcome any season of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Pete's Wicked Ales may have become victims of their own success,
and their attempts at diversifying the lineup don't always work
(can anyone say Strawberry Blonde?). But the tart citrus tone to
the Summer Brew makes it always welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Star Brewery, of San Antonio, produces a fine array of
beers, each as rich as its Texas-themed name and the legend it
bears on the side of the bottle. Start with a Wildcatter's Stout or
a Vigilante Porter.

   NAGO, Okinawa _ Sitting on a tatami mat in a ramshackle building
that opens up to the clear, blue ocean just a few dozen yards away,
Yuji Kinjo, a retired bus driver, talks about his plans to stop the
United States from building an offshore heliport.
</P>
<P>
   As a few workers answer phones and organize stacks of petitions,
Kinjo waves a two-page letter he plans to present to President
Clinton when he arrives in this seaside resort town in Okinawa
Friday for the summit of the so-called Group of Eight democratic
powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear the United States is a country where people's will is
respected,'' said Kinjo, president of the Society for the
Protection of Life, an organization formed four years ago to oppose
new U.S. bases.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rundown office, with its rusty desks and sagging
sofa, is not impressive, more than 20,000 people have visited since
it opened. Hundreds of business cards and photos line the ceilings
and walls, and more than 12,000 people have signed the petition
Kinjo hopes to give Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military presence in Okinawa _ about 26,000 personnel
and 39 facilities, including Kadena Airbase, the largest American
airbase in Asia _ has long been an uneasy one. Many Okinawans feel
they bear a disproportionate share of the burden, being home to 75
percent of the land used by U.S. military bases in Japan but making
up less than 1 percent of Japan itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 referendum in Nago, 54 percent of voters were against
the new offshore base. An Okinawa-wide referendum the year before
found 89 percent of voters in favor of a reduction in U.S. bases.
</P>
<P>
   After three American soldiers raped an Okinawan schoolgirl in
1995, long-brewing local opposition galvanized. Massive street
protests led to an agreement between Clinton and then-Prime
Minister Hashimoto Ryutaro in 1996 to return 20 percent of base
land to Okinawa and relocate certain facilities, on the condition
new locations could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Japan chose the Henoko district of Nago, a former
fishing village, for an offshore base and heliport to replace some
functions of Futenma Airbase, which was slated to be relocated.
Henoko is a sparsely populated area with U.S. military facilities
to the north and west.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our life is surrounded by U.S. bases,'' Kinjo said. ``Where
can we escape to? For us, it's a human rights problem. We have the
right to live in a peaceful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinjo, and other Okinawans say there have been thousands of
crimes, including murders, rapes, injuries and thefts, have
occurred on Okinawa at the hands of U.S. servicemen since World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, local newspapers have had headlines blaring the
latest uproar, a hit-and-run accident involving a U.S. serviceman.
Although the pedestrian wasn't seriously injured and the serviceman
later returned to the scene, the accident caused a stir, coming
just before the summit and on the heels of another incident that
garnered big headlines here: a Marine, reportedly drunk, allegedly
entering an unlocked house and crawling into bed with a 14-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa's bloody history has made the people especially opposed
to any military presence. The island was ravaged in the Battle of
Okinawa in 1945, a three-month long siege which killed about 14,000
Americans and more than 240,000 Japanese, almost half of them
Okinawan civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawans say they were sacrificed in the war, then made to
endure 27 years of U.S. occupation, which ended in 1972. Clinton
will be the first American president to visit Okinawa since handing
it back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   From the official Washington and Tokyo point of view, the bases
are a strategic necessity, not only for the defense of Japan but
for regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   Some point out that opposition to military installations is
universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States could not stay on Okinawa without the
acquiescence of the Okinawan people,'' said Nicholas Sarantakes, a
history professor at Texas A&AMP;M University and author of a book on
the American occupation of Okinawa. Local communities in the U.S.
have had a love-hate relationship with U.S. Army bases as have
those in the United Kingdom with the British Army.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the dugong, a slow, gentle sea mammal similar
to the Florida manatee. With its five-fingered flippers, it is the
mermaid in Japanese myths and feeds on the sea grass in the warm
waters off the east coast of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Now this creature _ numbering less than 50 near Okinawa and
about 100,000 near Australia and further south _ has been adopted
by anti-base activists as a symbol of their environmental worries.
The coral reef and other wildlife will become endangered if the
heliport is built, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a big mammal like the dugong living here is a good
sign,'' Kinjo said. ``It's evidence that this ocean is clean and
environmentally unpolluted.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While the American presence is the target of Okinawans'
protests, their anger is directed primarily at Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 miles south of the mainland, Okinawa has long felt
distant from Japan, not only geographically, but culturally and
politically as well. The archipelago was ruled for centuries by the
Ryukyu Kingdom, which had strong trade ties with China and
southeast Asia. After Japan annexed it in 1879, it suppressed the
teaching of Okinawan language and history.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's decision to hold the G8 summit Okinawa is seen by many
locals as pure politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``To deal with mounting criticisms from citizens, the summit was
the carrot for the Okinawan people,'' said Moriteru Arasaki, a
history professor at the University of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   While some Okinawans support the bases for economic reasons,
such as the jobs and construction projects they provide, many find
the subsidies and projects handed out by Tokyo as a cynical attempt
to buy their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's humiliating,'' said Etsuko Urashima, a member of a
women's group in Nago opposing new bases. ``It's discrimination.
Because we're poor, they think we'll accept anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the world's eyes focused on the G8 summit, Okinawans
recognize a good media opportunity when they see one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our voices don't even reach the Japanese people,'' on the
mainland, Urashima said. ``But I hope our voices reach the American
people so they know the situation and start taking their bases
back.''

CHINESE BANKS TO EVENTUALLY CONTROL INTEREST RATES, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's chief central banker said Wednesday that
Chinese banks would be empowered to set their own lending and
deposit rates within the next three years, an important step toward
opening the country's tightly controlled financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Most interest rates in China are currently set by the central
bank, one of many mechanisms used by the government to keep a firm
grip on the currency and keep foreign investors out of domestic
stock and bond markets. That policy has served the country well:
while currencies collapsed around the region during the Asian
financial crisis that began three years ago, China's currency, the
yuan, remained steady, and its economy chugged along largely
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   But China has long said it is committed to liberalizing its
financial system as part of a transition to a market-based economy.
A convertible currency, or one that can be freely bought and sold
for other currencies, would make it easier for foreign investors to
do business here and allow Chinese companies to raise money abroad.
It would also increase China's influence in the global economy,
where the country wants to be a major power.
</P>
<P>
   Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, said
there is still no timetable for making the currency fully
convertible. But he told reporters at a news conference here that
loosening restrictions on interest rates, allowing them to move up
and down based on market forces, would take place over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first step is to liberalize interest rates on foreign
currency deposits and lending,'' Dai said. ``The next step will be
to liberalize rates on rural credit, and then in urban areas we
will start by expanding the floating band of lending rates,'' he
said. Interest rates on bank deposits would be allowed to float
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step forward in improving the efficiency of
the economy,'' said Dong Tao, an economist with CS First Boston in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that China must first clean up its banking
system, which is riddled with bad debts, before allowing the kind
of competition that floating interest rates would bring. With
non-performing loans estimated to exceed 40 percent of the
portfolios of some banks, unleashing market forces too early could
quickly lead to costly bank failures or even trigger the kind of
financial crisis that China's strict financial controls are
designed to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank now sets lending and deposit rates, and all
banks are state owned, so there is little true competition between
them. The interest rate controls also allow the central bank to
manage demand for the currency, which it has kept artificially
pegged for years at around 8.28 yuan to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The country has recently begun a partial recapitalization of its
major banks through the creation of asset management companies that
are supposed to take some of the bad loans off those banks' books.
But the program is making slow progress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dai said the central bank would also support the restructuring
of the country's banks into shareholding corporations that can
later go public, something that would increase their capital and
force them to adopt more efficient and transparent management.
</P>
<P>
   Further steps to open the country's financial markets remain
more distant, he said. For example, he said no decision had been
made to allow foreign investors to buy Chinese stocks, which are
denominated in local currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rationale for these constraints is that some enterprises
are not sufficiently self-disciplined, the depth of the Chinese
capital market is not sufficient, and we are not sufficiently
capable of supervising the securities market,'' Dai said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners are currently restricted to a small number of shares
denominated in foreign currency that are not available to domestic
investors. The segregated market keeps foreigners from acquiring
control of China's listed companies.
</P>
<P>
   And it insulates China's stock markets from the sudden outflow
of capital that has triggered crises in other developing economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be happy if I could convert the yuan into U.S. dollars
when I go to New York to attend meetings, but now I think there is
a long way to go,'' said Dai.

 &HT;    Politics goes hi-tech By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Democratic party's 4,368 delegates arrive
here for their convention beginning Aug. 14, they'll plan meetings
with each other online using an Internet scheduling system.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Staples Center, where the convention will be held,
they'll chat by Internet phones and by e-mail from computer kiosks
throughout the building.
</P>
<P>
   And back home, folks can keep in touch with them and watch every
second of the gathering live with Web cameras linked to the
convention's extensive Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to politics, Y2K style.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to show that they're in tune with today's dot-com world _
and along the way possibly reach potential voters who typically get
their information online instead of CNN _ organizers of this year's
political conventions are touting and tapping into technology like
never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be the most technologically advanced,
Internet-savvy political gathering in history,'' said Terry
McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Convention
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country in Philadelphia, organizers of the Republican
National Convention are no neophytes either.
</P>
<P>
   When the Republican convention starts July 31, staffers will
send regular e-mail updates to ``Dot- Com Delegates'' who register
with the GOP Web site. Visitors to the site can also take virtual
tours of the convention or order coffee cups and T-shirts
emblazoned with the convention's logos.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the first political conventions in the
1830s, when a few hundred delegates gathered in smoky saloons in
Baltimore and Harrisburg, Pa., to draft party platforms and elect
nominees who sometimes didn't even attend.
</P>
<P>
   Today's party organizers say they're using technology _
specifically the Internet _ to reach more people, to get more
opinions and increase involvement in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   But it's about much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   With television networks devoting less time to covering
conventions, party organizers are turning to the Internet to get
their message out 24-hours a day, seven days a week. And _ perhaps
most importantly to them _ they can do it without any media
scrutiny or public comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outreach possibility much, much better than they've
ever had,'' said Michael Margolis, a professor of political science
at the University of Cincinnati who co-authored the book ``Politics
as Usual: The Cyberspace 'Revolution' '' earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they're all interactive and everything _ but most
people don't realize that anything they see and any of the choices
they make (on a Web site) can be controlled by the Webmaster
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason why the political conventions are so
into technology: Because so is much of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to show that you're dot-com literate,'' Margolis
said. ``You want to show the world that you know this is where
you're supposed to be _ or else it would look like you're out of
step or out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Democrats are leaving no
doubt that they know technology.
</P>
<P>
   After chatting with each other on Internet phones and by e-mail,
delegates will cast their votes at interactive kiosks throughout
the convention floor. While doing so, they can watch video feeds on
computers featuring behind-the-podium interviews or the latest
analysis by C-SPAN. Election.com, the private company that managed
the Arizona Democratic presidential primary earlier this year _ the
first legally binding political election held over the Internet _
will tally the votes. Results will be sent to the Democratic
convention's Web site and around the world immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Naz Nageer is the computer whiz who is in charge of making sure
it all goes smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Nageer, who formally was director of technology
at US Web in Los Angeles and before that worked as a computer
programmer at Time Warner Inc., is the convention's director of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several months, he has overseen redesign of the
group's Web site (dumping the red-white-and-blue _ ``too stale,''
he said) rounded up the equipment and supervised wiring of
everything to the Staples Center to make sure it all works.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got quite a bit of fiber (optic line) in there, and
we're using just about all of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Nageer has been busy preparing the technology, other
Democratic Convention officials have been busy getting the word
out. Advertisements and other paraphernalia urge Web surfers to
``Participate in America's Democratic eConvention.'' Tuesday, the
group is planning what it claims is the first-ever Internet press
conference for a political convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really all about access,'' said convention Chief
Executive Lydia Camarillo. ``Technology is one of the key ways of
reaching people today.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the Internet and other technology really prompt more
people to get involved with politics and vote?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, says Margolis, the political science professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are ordinary people who aren't interested in politics in
the real world, who aren't interested in watching this on
television _ why are they suddenly now going to go the Democrats or
the Republican's Web sites and start getting involved?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain skeptical.''

&HT;     E-FOOD IS BEING SERVED, AT THE CLICK OF A MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EMILY SPICER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet-savvy food lovers know that just about any
diet-breaking, high-calorie delight you can imagine is only a
mouse-click away.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Web also offers foods to help you stay on your diet
and lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the traditional diet-plan foods. These sites claim their
nuke-'em-and-eat-'em fare is just as convenient as the little boxes
stacked in supermarket freezers _ and better-tasting. That means no
temptation in the candy aisle, and all that pesky thinking is done
for you: They count the calories, design the meal plans, prepare
your food and restrict the portions.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the total answer to everybody's weight loss
problem,'' said Hilton Davis, owner of Diet-to-Go, one of the
companies selling on the Web. ``We provide a healthy meal plan, and
if you stick to it, and don't eat too much else, you should lose
weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis started Diet-to-Go in the mid-1980s with fresh entrees
sold in Washington, D.C.-area supermarkets. After a few more
incarnations, the company went on line in October 1999
(www.diettogo.com). Since then, Diet-to-Go has been preparing about
10,000 meals a week for about 800 customers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The food is shipped in a large, two-compartment (frozen and
fresh) box. Everything is insulated in Styrofoam and chilled on
packs of dry ice.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can choose several meal plans of 1,000 or 1,600
calories a day, from one to three meals a day, for three to seven
days a week. Prices range from $8.50 to $99.95 per week. Prices do
not include shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Another such company, Healthy Meal Express, www.healthymeal.com,
got its start with a health scare. In 1996, 39-year-old pharmacist
Joe Martinez learned he had diabetes. He tried modifying his diet
to control the disease, but became frustrated with the options
available in packaged foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was low in fat, it was high in sugar,'' Martinez said.
``If it was low in sugar, it was high in fat.''
</P>
<P>
   So Martinez started preparing his own healthful foods to go,
giving them to his pharmacy clients. He started selling on the Web
in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the foods were developed for diabetics, Martinez says they
are appropriate for anyone. His company has started offering a high
protein/low carbohydrate meal plan. Meal plans offer 1,000 or 1,800
calories a day, from one to three meals, five or seven days a week.
The food is shipped chilled, not frozen. Prices range from $49.95
to $159.95 a week, not including shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Another Web site, www.zoneperfect.com, caters to Zone dieters
who don't have time to prepare the carefully calibrated meals the
diet requires. Through the Web site, customers can order six meals
for $26.50, 12 for $59.95.
</P>
<P>
   The ZonePerfect meals became available about two and a half
years ago, and the company now ships about 7,000 meals per week.
</P>
<P>
   While each company says the food tastes better than the frozen
variety sold at supermarkets, customers care more about convenience
and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Delgado, a 40-year-old teacher from El Paso, Texas, said
she has lost nine pounds in the five weeks she has been eating
Diet-to-Go meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not small portions,'' she said. ``I am so satisfied.
I don't believe I'm eating only 1,000 calories a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Ellis, a two-year customer of Healthy Meal Express, says the
Web meals helped keep his overeating and diabetes under control. In
his first year, Ellis lost 120 pounds and his diabetes went into
remission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It played into my own personal weaknesses,'' said the
51-year-old Wisconsin business consultant. ``It was like, `This is
it, dude. This is all you get to eat for the week.' I was
determined I would stay inside the box. And then a couple of times
I wanted to eat the box,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I learned to eat in healthy portions and got past the
mental hunger, I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Farr, a dietitian in San Antonio, said these types of
eating plans are ideal for people such as Ellis and Delgado, who
are too busy to cook and need help in learning to eat smaller
portions.
</P>
<P>
   But she cautions that there are other diet-related problems not
solved by prepared food.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bigger issue is where we eat, fast food vs. home, and why we
eat. Because we don't always eat from hunger,'' she explained,
adding that counseling is sometimes needed and a package on the
Internet doesn't deal with these issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quick and fast. That's good. But it's not that
satisfying, so you will probably get other foods already in the
home to supplement it.''

 &HT;    AME Bishop McKenzie delivering keynote speech at Wilberforce
 &HT;    By Khalid Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILBERFORCE, Ohio - Scarcely two weeks after she shattered the
``stained-glass ceiling'' that kept women out of the Episcopacy of
the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Bishop Vashti Murphy
McKenzie returns to Ohio on Tuesday to deliver the keynote speech
at the Third Episcopal District Christian Education Congress 2000
at Wilberforce University.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day retreat is sponsored by the Dayton District of the
AME church and is designed to cultivate the lives of Christian
youth through Bible study, training sessions, worship services and
recreational activities. The education congress runs from Tuesday
through next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The last time McKenzie visited the Miami Valley, she was being
heralded as one of the brightest lights in the AME constellation.
</P>
<P>
   When she returns, the 53-year-old cleric will be recognized as a
pivotal figure in church history after becoming the first woman to
assume the position of bishop in the 213-year legacy of the AME
church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Fredrick Wright, pastor of Dayton's Wayman Chapel AME
Church, said McKenzie's speech was arranged on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the conclusion of our General Conference in Cincinnati
our (Dayton District) bishop had to be reassigned.'' Wright said.
``Our new bishop, Robert Vaughn Webster, was able to persuade
Vashti to come and preach before the congress after she was elected
bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who served as a delegate at the Cincinnati conference,
says the election of McKenzie, who sits on the Wilberforce
University board of trustees, was a good choice for the future of
the AME church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bishop McKenzie is a very skilled and focused individual. She
is very energetic and determined to accomplish a lot of things.
She's a gifted preacher but she's also a gifted administrator who
raises the level of people around her,'' he said. ``I think she's
going to add a tremendous touch to the church and do some
magnificent things.''
</P>
<P>
   Educational Congress 2000 expects to attract more than 300
participants, many of whom will be housed on the Wilberforce
campus. Registration fees are $100 for registrants living
off-campus and a $145 on-campus fee. Admission to McKenzie's
keynote speech is free.

   DISABILITIES-SURVEY (Washington) _ Nearly 10 years after the
signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a survey shows that
the disabled continue to lag behind the rest of society in
employment, income and access to health care. The act, signed July
26, 1990, by former President George Bush, banned discrimination
against such people. By MARK HELM.

   HISPANIC-IMMIGRANTS (Washington) _ Major Hispanic groups voice
frustration with Congress' focus on legislation to bring more
high-tech foreign workers into the country. Unless Republican
leaders do more for immigrants already here, the GOP will be
targeted at the polls this year by Latino voters, the Hispanic
organizations warn. By JUDY HOLLAND.

   GOP-CHOICE (Washington) _ Republican pro-choice advocates secure

Thompson that he will consider allowing open discussion as

Pro-choice Republicans say they will fight to change the party's
plank opposing any abortion, but conservatives say their chances
are nil. By DAN FREEDMAN.

   HELEN-THOMAS (Washington) _ President Clinton, unlike some of
his predecessors, is savoring his last months in office. The
president doesn't rage against the dying light. Instead, he's ever
more nostalgic about his waning tenure in the White House. He has
often said that ``even the bad days are good'' in the presidency _
and he quips that he has had his share of bad days. By HELEN
THOMAS.

   PRIVACY-ADVISER (Washington) _ The trail that led Peter Swire to
the White House as President Clinton's chief adviser on privacy
matters began in the 1970s when he worked the computers at his
family's furniture stores in Albany, N.Y. There amid the La-Z-Boy
recliners and living room sets, he was inspired when his father,
Bill Swire, charged headlong into the computer era. By DAN

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ Now that Supreme Court
appointments are an issue in the campaign, we should recall a
lesson from history: It is not unusual for a president to become
disenchanted with a Supreme Court justice he has nominated for the
high bench. With independence and life tenure, justices are free to
move in any direction they choose. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

   GARDENING-LIFE _ Ken Medernach is on to something. With killer
heat and drought, gardening isn't much fun. Meanwhile, Ken has
found a way to enhance just about any growing space: those still
looking good, as well as the many that are dying and dragging and
flagging. He goes to his basement workshop and creates all sorts of

``Pondering,'' as the hobbyists call it, reels in most converts by

<P>
   HOUSE-FANS _ If you can lower the humidity inside your house
during the cooling season, you can raise the thermostat on your air
conditioner and still feel cool. That's why adding a bathroom
exhaust fan or a range hood that exhausts outdoors is a good
investment for saving energy. Today we'll concentrate on bathroom
fans, but installing a range hood is not much different. (Cummings,

&HT;     SAVOR AN UNUSUAL WINE? CHECK THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I wanted to serve an Alsatian champagne at a
party we were hosting during the December holidays. There was a
problem, though. None of the wine stores I went to carried
sparkling wine from that region of France, which produces some of
my favorite white wines.
</P>
<P>
   I had no trouble finding numerous Alsatian sparkling wines when
I started shopping with my computer, however. When I entered one
Web site, wine.com, there were a half-dozen of the wines priced
under $15 with thorough descriptions of each one.
</P>
<P>
   This led to a new, far more appealing problem: Which ones did I
want? I resolved that dilemma by selecting a couple of bottles of
three different styles, plus another half-dozen different sauvignon
blancs from the Loire Valley that I had never seen in area wine
stores. A week or so later, my shipment arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Buying wine has never been easier, I decided. Wine.com offers up
to 20 percent discounts on case purchases, similar to most stores,
and the fast-growing company periodically offers free shipping.
Point, click and sip.
</P>
<P>
   There is a catch, however. The New York Liquor Authority has not
approved wine.com's method of operation, meaning either I or the
company may have violated the law with our transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to buying wine on line, a world where politics is at
play and the rules and regulations can trace their roots to the
bygone era of Prohibition. A world where dot.com quickly leads to
dot.why?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, each state sets its own laws for buying wine via
the Internet. In New York, it is illegal to buy wine directly from
an out-of-state winery. However, if you want to purchase wine from
a New York winery with a Web site, that's perfectly all right.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? You have every right to be.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McKeon, counsel to the state Liquor Authority, says the
state has approved some Internet wine merchants such as
wineshopper.com and evineyard.com, which use the traditional
three-tier (sale, distribution and delivery) method for wine
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   New York also gives its blessing to Windsor Vineyards, a
California winery that sells its product only by direct mail (its
wines are not available in stores). Why? Because Windsor has
established a sister winery in the Hudson Valley, which acts
primarily as a recipient for sales from California to New Yorkers.
Since the shipper has a New York address, the transactions are
legal.
</P>
<P>
   As for wine.com, which first sent my shipment to a liquor store
in Rochester, which then sent the order on to me, McKeon is less
clear. ``We're talking to wine.com right now. I'm not saying
they're not approved,'' he said. ``We've been talking with them for
a few months. I'm not prepared to comment on if a resident who buys
wine from them is breaking the law.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think New York state's 151 wineries are opposed to direct
sales from wineries in California and other locales, as well as
direct sales from Internet sites, think again.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Randy Kuhl, a Republican from Hammondsport, deep in
the heart of Finger Lakes wine country, believes that allowing
direct interstate sales from wineries would be a boon to New York
wineries. Countless sales go unfilled when tourists visit wineries
in New York but can't have the wines shipped to their homes in
other parts of the country, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhl was the leading proponent of a 1995 bill that would have
liberated interstate shipments from wineries in New York and from
out-of-state wineries to New Yorkers. The bill was approved by both
the Senate and Assembly, but was vetoed by Gov. George Pataki, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   One of those lobbying hard for Pataki to veto the bill was
Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party, which supported
Pataki in both of his successful races for governor. Long, it so
happens, owns a liquor store on Long Island, according to Kuhl.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers call direct shippers ``bootleggers.'' Wineries and
e-commerce sites call wholesalers ``state-sanctioned monopolies.''
They both want a piece of the $1 billion direct wine business.
</P>
<P>
   Direct sales are an economic concern to wholesalers,
acknowledged David Dickerson, a spokesman for the Wine and Spirits
Wholesalers of America. But he said it's really a local tax and
policy issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want a free and open marketplace for alcohol,''
Dickerson said. ``They want licensed operators and to be able to
crack down on illegal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The wholesalers group has given its support to wineshopper.com,
an Internet site funded by Amazon.com and others that allows
consumers to order wines that go through the wholesale system and
often end up at a retailer where buyers have to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal activities the wholesalers decry include the
potential of minors with credit cards ordering wine or liquor
direct. The wine industry thinks that argument lacks credibility.
Minors, they counter, have easier, cheaper ways to buy alcohol than
to order it by phone or computer, wait a week to get it and pay
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later this three-tier structure is going to come
down. The consumers aren't going to allow it,'' Kuhl says. ``The
liquor distributors have a monopoly and they want to control the
whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   James Tresize, president of the New York State Wine &AMP; Grape
Foundation, describes Internet wine sales as a ``complicated and
evolving'' issue. ``It takes a lot more time to change things in
the wine industry because there are so many restrictions and
regulations,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as California and Washington, have reciprocal
agreements allowing the direct shipment from wineries to consumers.
New York, however, has never made a similar pact with other states.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for wine on the Internet will probably never replace
the pleasure of browsing in a well-stocked store and discussing
selection with a knowledgeable merchant.
</P>
<P>
   Your local liquor store also enjoys other advantages over the
Internet: There are no shipping charges (which usually amount to
about $20 per case), and there is the immediacy of having the wine
in your hand the moment you have paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even some neighborhood stores realize that the need to be
accessible on the Internet, too. Craig Allen, president of All Star
Wine &AMP; Spirits in Latham, N.Y., is redesigning his store's Web site
and working on ways to ship wines out of state. He predicts that
All Star's sales from the Internet, which currently account for
just 1 to 2 percent of the store's business, will mushroom to 15
percent within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Buying wine on line is similar to catalog shopping: you don't
leave your house. Also, the selection at wine.com, the site I'm
most familiar with, is impressive, better than most wine stores.
</P>
<P>
   It's an alternative I'm glad to have.

&HT;     CLINTON HATES TO LEAVE HIS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, unlike some of his predecessors,
is savoring his last months in office. The president doesn't rage
against the dying light. Instead, he's ever more nostalgic about
his waning tenure in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some presidents chafed and resented the goldfish-bowl living
they endured in the White House, though they actually had a lot of
privacy and protection.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson referred to the presidency as ``the splendid
misery.'' Harry Truman called the White House ``the crown jewel in
the penal system,'' and he likened himself to a prisoner. He called
the White House ``the loneliest place in the world.'' Lyndon
Johnson dubbed it ``lonely acres.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is loath to leave. He has often said that ``even the
bad days are good'' in the presidency _ and he quips that he has
had his share of bad days. In fact, Clinton has hardly known a day
in the White House when he was not being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray, successor to Kenneth Starr, is
trying to pick up on the unfinished Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky
business. Still hanging over Clinton's head is the Little Rock
panel studying his possible disbarment based on his deposition in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   If the impeachment left any scars, it did not mar his joy of
holding the highest office in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Last May when he was presented a crystal apple by a teachers'
organization and named honorary ``Teacher of the Year,'' Clinton
said: ``I generally believe presidents should not receive awards
because the job is award enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Diane Rehm of radio station WAMU, an
affiliate of National Public Radio, Clinton said: ``I love this
job. I'd do it forever if I could.'' He added that while in the
job, he was trying ``to squeeze every last drop out of every minute
I've got to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   While others moan and groan about the ``awesome burden,'' as
Johnson did, Clinton seems to wallow in it. He also told Rehm he
will miss the position ``terribly,'' and added: ``I love this work.
I just love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's yearnings were also shared by a recent Republican
predecessor _ Ronald Reagan, who often indicated in his last year
in office that he would have loved a crack at a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Reagan was barred from his dream by the 22nd
Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. This
constitutional ceiling was pushed through by Republicans in the
aftermath of Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Johnson renounced reelection in 1968 as a result of
the bitter divisions in the country over the Vietnam War, he waited
in the wings, hoping for a draft at the Democratic National
Convention in Chicago. But that political gathering turned into a
debacle that made a Johnson comeback impossible.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Clinton hates to turn over the presidential reins, he
is dedicated to keeping his hand in the party's business. He is
starring in almost weekly fundraisers to build up the coffers for
Vice President Al Gore and other Democratic hopefuls. That is more
than can be said for Johnson, who did not go all out for Vice
President Hubert Humphrey until the last few weeks of the
presidential race in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower was lukewarm in his support of
Vice President Richard Nixon in the 1960 contest when Nixon ran
against John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The icing on the cake for Clinton is the satisfaction of knowing
that at least one pollster, John Zogby, thinks if Clinton did run
again, he would win.

&HT;     WINE IS EVERYWHERE, AND GETTING BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRED LeBRUN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ More than ever in viticultural history, better
wines come to us from unlikely places.
</P>
<P>
   A growing phenomenon we better get used to, because shiraz from
kangaroo country is only the beginning. Americans are going berserk
making wines in funny places, too.
</P>
<P>
   Which underscores the frustration in buying wines directly from
other states, particularly the produce of smaller boutique
wineries, given the roadblocks, penalties and ridiculous mishmash
of prohibitive state laws.
</P>
<P>
   The reason wines are available from the oddest places these days
is simple enough: we are in the exuberant age of grape-growing
experimentation worldwide, and there's plenty of money around to
fuel the sons and daughters of Bacchus.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Steve DeFrancesco, winemaker at Glenora Vineyards of New
York's Finger Lakes put it recently, ``every square inch of the
traditional places to grow great wines in Europe and Asia were
planted years and years ago. But to suggest those are the only
places grapes can grow or that great wines can be made only from
them is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and I were on a panel of 25 judges for the 24th annual
International Eastern Wine Competition held over three days in June
amid the breathtaking splendor of the Corning Museum of Glass, just
south of the Finger Lakes wine growing region. This competition,
which is absolutely blind and truly international in its
representation is one of the largest and oldest in the country, is
produced by Vineyard and Winery Services, a trade service
organization for the wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   There were 1,639 entries, 41 percent won a medal, although only
22 double gold medals were awarded in three days of judging. A
double gold was awarded when all five judges in the five break-out
panels voted the highest rating independently and blindly. Blind as
in no labels, no clues as to manufacture or origin.
</P>
<P>
   The final evening of judging for the highest honors was an
arresting setting at a banquet table situated right in the museum.
A single table set with 528 glasses ought to make anybody nervous,
in my view.
</P>
<P>
   Best of choices, though, surprised judges as much as they are
likely to surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   The best red wine was the traditional cabernet sauvignon. But
even with many of Europe and California's well-known estates
entered, the clear top choice was from New South Wales. A Barwang
``Hilltop'' 1997 that was rich in tannins and as deep and complex
as some of France's First Growths.
</P>
<P>
   Top white was a spicy gewurztraminer from California, not
usually thought of as a gewurz sort of place. But not from Napa,
from Sonoma County, produced by Chateau St. Jean in Kenwood.
Wonderful, intense fruit had several of us guessing that this one
was from the Finger Lakes, not the last time we'd be proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Two wines from the Finger Lakes and one from Long Island did
make the prestigious final cut of 22 wines, although none made it
to the highest honors. A Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards Cabernet Franc
1998, Dr. Konstantin Frank Vinifera Vineyards Johannisberg Riesling
Dry, 1999, and Gristina Vineyards Rose of Cabernet Sauvignon, North
Fork of Long Island, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As to how random the origin of other top wines have become as
well as grapes moving easily from place to place, consider: coming
in a close second and third in the red wine category were Valhalla
Vineyards for the cab franc/merlot blend called Gotterdammerungfrom
the North Fork of Roanoke, Va., and Callaway Vineyards of Temecula,
Calif., with a 1997 Dolcetto, an American-grown Italian varietal.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the fastest growing wine regions are in
the South, especially the Carolinas and Virginia. Tennessee has
more than a dozen wineries, Kentucky, Florida are in the
sweepstakes as well. Missouri is settling in as a superb wine
state.
</P>
<P>
   And watch out for British Columbia, the up-and-comer in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest shocker in this competition had to be the first
runner-up in the white-wine category. A superb, bone dry but
intensely fruity riesling that I was convinced was from one of the
Seneca Lake Vineyards in New York. Not so, but rather the product
of Wollersheim Winery, Prairie Du Sac, Wis., from grapes grown in
Washington State's Columbia Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, you say, that's not really a Wisconsin wine, that's a
Washington wine. Not so. Two winemakers using the identical grapes
will come up with a vastly different product. Consider the grapes
like fine wood entering a master cabinetmaker's shop. What comes
out is the artisan's work, and a wine is comparable.

VERMONT ADOPTION SAGA MAY HAVE A WIDE IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Michael Stamatis spent his formative years
being tormented in one of the world's cruelest institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, everything changed: He was removed from an
orphanage in Romania, adopted by a couple in Vermont, and began to
recover from the psychic wounds any child would incur if subjected
to sustained emotional and sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But the 17-year-old boy's journey from nightmare to dream didn't
last long. The people who took Michael in have dissolved the
adoption, relinquished their erstwhile son into state custody, and
accused him of sexual assault _ a felony charge for which the state
plans to prosecute him as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's saga is about to spark an international incident.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged Romanian Embassy officials in Washington already have
drafted a letter to legal and social-service authorities in Vermont
warning their treatment of Michael could determine the future of
all adoptions by Americans from his country.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some adoption specialists worry this case could have
even wider repercussions, inducing more governments to reconsider
their policies on placing children with US families.
</P>
<P>
   ``When other countries see Americans adopting their children,
then dissolving the adoptions and prosecuting the children, they
wonder whether to get involved with us at all,'' said Maureen
Hogan, who as president of Adopt America has been working to
improve conditions in Romanian orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont officials say they understand that Michael went through
hell in Romania, but insist that they are doing everything possible
to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our recommendations have to be based on the standard of `best
interests of the child' . . . and not on international relations,
on any effect on adoptions generally . . . or on any other
political considerations,'' said William Young, the state's
commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, as Michael was named in his native country, spent
his first 15 years at the Siret Neuropsychiatric Institution in the
northeast corner of Romania. The facility is widely known as one of
the worst legacies of Nicholae Ceausescu,the longtime dictator who
was deposed in late 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 200,000 boys and girls were institutionalized during
Ceausescu's regime, the majority because their parents were too
poor to care for them. Most were abused and deprived of the
affection or personal contact necessary to develop normally.
</P>
<P>
   While the current Romanian government has markedly improved
conditions, and has begun deinstitutionalization programs, its
orphanages generally remain damaging places for children to grow
up. The one in Siret, where about 500 children now live, by all
accounts is among the most horrific.
</P>
<P>
   Before children from Siret are deemed ready for adoption by
Americans, they undergo years of therapy and behavioral training by
a team of US physicians and mental-health professionals who travel
to Romania. The team is led by Ron Federici, a Virginia
psychiatrist who is an authority on institutionalization and has
adopted four children from Siret himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Constantine and two Romania girls adopted with
him, Federici also intensively screened the parental applicants to
assess whether they could cope with the difficulties inherent in
raising such challenging children. He approved Lisa and Tim
Stamatis of Burlington, who had received high marks for their
rearing of five special-needs children they had already adopted.
</P>
<P>
   For the first year, by all accounts, the three Romanian children
made substantial progress and everyone seemed happy with the new
family arrangement. But then, for reasons that haven't been
explained publicly, something changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, the name the Stamatises gave their son, began to slip.
The boy had a less-than-normal intelligence level and spoke no
English, so he'd always had a hard time communicating. Now he was
growing unresponsive to educational efforts and the sexual acting
out that he had done initially _ a frequent behavior for sexually
abused children who haven't learned other ways of making physical
connections _ began to recur, according to a detective's report
filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Stamatises' willingness or ability to deal
with their children's problems changed, too. In the last several
months, they have moved to legally dissolve their adoptions of
Michael, one of his Romanian sisters, and a severely disabled child
they had adopted years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, whose lawyer did not respond to requests for
interviews, also filed a complaint alleging Michael had
inappropriately fondled the genitalia of both Romanian girls
adopted with him. Federici and others familiar with the case
described the parents' decision to initiate criminal proceedings,
rather than to seek treatment, as unusual.
</P>
<P>
   They claim it might have been at least partly a financial move
by the Stamatises, who would have been responsible for some
child-support payments since they voluntarily relinquished their
son into state custody. When the minor involved is the object of
criminal charges, such costs are absorbed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Michael is currently being treated at a facility in southern
Vermont, and no court dates have been set for him. Vermont
officials declined to discuss why they decided to prosecute him as
an adult as well as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Federici, Hogan, and the Romanian government insist the boy's
language, cultural, and institutional problems are not being taken
sufficiently into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how lonely he feels, whatever they are trying to do
for him; he doesn't speak the language and he knows nobody around
him,'' said Federici, who is fluent in Romanian and has tried to
become a party to the court cases involving Michael. He has been
rebuffed both by the judge and other state officials.
</P>
<P>
   They have not said why they have excluded the psychiatrist's
participation as an expert witness or as a therapist, though he has
volunteered to play either role at his own expense.
</P>
<P>
   Federici said he is so concerned about Michael's welfare he has
offered take the boy and his adoptive sisters off of Vermont's
hands altogether, again at his own expense. He wants to find other
homes for the girls and to place Michael in a specialized treatment
facility in Baltimore, where there are other onetime Romanian
orphans with whom Michael is friends and with whom he has seen
during reunions arranged by Federici.
</P>
<P>
   The press and science attache at the Romanian Embassy, Stefan
Maier, has drafted a letter, which the ambassador is now reviewing,
praising Federici's efforts and asking Vermont officials to
reconsider the psychiatrist's participation.
</P>
<P>
   This episode, writes Maier, could ``trigger a mechanism with the
potential of bringing damage to international adoption by US
citizens from Romania.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael's prosecution, Maier added in a telephone interview,
could hurt future adoptions from Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way of dealing with this boy doesn't serve anyone,''
Maier said. ``Not the children who need families . . . or the
Americans who want children. This way, there are only losers.''

 &HT;    Four years later, globe-trotting Atlantans still wear Olympic
rings
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ It's Friday night, and the musky aroma of
Australian manhood saturates the Oaks, a pub on the north side of
Sydney Harbour that's as big as a Wal-Mart. Mobs of men are
standing around talking rugby over schooners of beer. Some are
furiously working the slot machines everyone calls ``pokies.''
Others are charring slabs of meat on a barbecue pit out in the
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   There's something odd about the round table by the door. Not
only does it include several women _ eating pizza, no less _ but
some of their accents sound rather alien in this setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I left Atlanta,'' one of them says, ``my mover
asked, `What's the deal with Sydney? It seems like we've been
moving everyone to Sydney.'''
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Sydney, of course, is the Olympics. Four years ago
tonight, Muhammad Ali lit the caldron that signaled Atlanta's star
turn on the world stage. For some Atlantans, it wasn't enough. At
least 200 veterans of the 1996 Games have moved on to Australia to
be part of the first Olympics of the 2000s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a pretty tight group,'' says Carol Isbister, one of
several Atlanta alums around the table at the Oaks. She's working
in Olympic hospitality, as she did in '96, and has been here long
enough to get used to the Australian fondness for cute nicknames.
Carol has become ``Kazzar.'' Her fiance, Michael Rolnick, an
Atlanta native who manages Olympic communications for Ansett
Australia airlines, has become Mick.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the first time in almost a century that the
Games have gone from one English-speaking nation to another. The
Sydney organizers have taken advantage of the coincidence, hiring
some 50 people who worked with the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Former ACOGers are running Sydney's broadcasting operation and
several of its venues, including the largest one, Stadium
Australia, the 110,000-seat arena where the five-ring circus will
begin Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Isbister, have gravitated to Sydney to work for
private companies or Olympic sponsors or as independent
consultants. Her employer alone, Carlson Marketing Group, is
sending 100 former Atlanta Olympic workers to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the Atlanta veterans are enjoying the beautiful
setting, the welcoming warmth of their Australian colleagues and
the excitement of staging another Olympics, there have been
complications.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Australians are every bit as proud as Americans
and don't always take kindly to outside criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Sydney Morning Herald ran a story about the
Atlantans headlined ``The U.S. Cavalry.'' One of them _ a Canadian,
as it turned out _ said she found local waiters and cabbies to be
rude. The paper ran letters for days telling the Yanks to go home
if they didn't like it. The story created such a fuss that the
Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) canceled
a Fourth of July party planned for its hired hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-mails were flying,'' says Milton Cockburn, SOCOG's media
relations manager. ``But that's the only problem we've had because
of the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers have had to make many cultural adjustments, from
sticker shock at the price of an apartment to not being able to
find baseball box scores or good Tex-Mex food.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney looks and feels deceptively like a U.S. city _ Seattle or
San Diego comes to mind _ but it most certainly isn't. Some have
found, for instance, that Australians move to the hum of a
different didgeridoo when it comes to conducting business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are slower,'' says Ann Michele Worrall of Game Plan
International, a company that brokers Olympic housing. ``There's an
almost Latin mentality of `manana, manana.' Except here, it's `no
worries.'''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been her biggest frustration, though. Worrall, who
also handled housing during the '96 Games and the 1998 soccer World
Cup in Paris, had trouble following the Australian accent when she
moved here 18 months ago. Meetings between her French clients and
Australians looking to rent to them could get embarrassing. ``I'd
understand the French just fine,'' she says, ``but I'd have to ask
the Australians to repeat themselves four or five times.''
</P>
<P>
   The sometimes condescending attitude toward women is another
irritation. ``Women definitely have a more secondary role here,''
says Sherry Spurlin, who worked at the Atlanta whitewater course
and manages a similar venue outside Sydney. ``These guys call me
`mate,' and I'm like, `Come on, I'm not your mate.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Spurlin's closest friends in Sydney are Australians.
When one of them, a kayaker, barely missed qualifying for the Games
this spring, she hurried to his weeping wife and daughter and
hugged them like they were family.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the Atlantans have become a bit Aussie in their
months here. Ed Hula, who made a name for himself as a radio
reporter covering the '96 Games, sold his house in Georgia and
rented a three-room flat overlooking the Sydney Harbour Bridge. He
and his wife, Sheila, edit an Olympic newsletter, Around the Rings,
riding ferries around the harbor like Sydneysiders and
enthusiastically partaking of the native seafood. Much to their
amusement, their 14-year-old son, Ed, has developed an embryonic
Australian accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I luuuuv rugby,'' he says, tossing a fat, oblong ball at his
father and then rushing him. ``He makes a good tackling dummy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad remains loyal to American football. A Florida State grad, he
ran up a huge phone bill listening to his Seminoles win the
national title on the Internet. ``I was probably the only person in
Sydney who cared,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After the Games, many of the Atlantans plan to return home. A
few want to move on to the next Olympics in Salt Lake City or
Athens. Some plan to hang around Australia and see more of the
country they've been too busy of late to explore.
</P>
<P>
   One local enthusiasm the Olympic workers have managed to find
time for is surfing. Quite a few of them have ventured onto nearby
Bondi Beach to take lessons. Reed Draper, a Sandy Springs, Ga.,
native who is special events manager at the athletes village,
admitted to his instructor that he was concerned about sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, mate,'' the teacher assured him, ``I've been out here 17
years, and I've seen only two of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day brought news that a 9-foot man-eater had been
caught at Bondi. Draper quietly retired his surfboard and resumed
his landlubber duties at the village. After all, he has an even
bigger adventure coming up: His wife, Laurie, is due to give birth
to their first child during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Draper says, ``should add a little challenge to our
Olympics.''

<P>
   TRES ESQUINAS, Colombia _ The flood-swollen Orteguaza River
slices through the Colombian lowlands, its dirty brown water
straining at banks that give way to swampy clumps of thick forest
and patches of cleared land.
</P>
<P>
   Bright green coca plants and poppy fields dot many of the
clearings, verdant cash crops in a land of hunger and war.
</P>
<P>
   This remote territory in Colombia's far south has become ground
zero in the escalating conflict against narcotics traffickers, and
Marxist rebels who have tapped the drug trade as a major source of
revenue to fuel their 36-year-old insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cocaine and heroine grown here is destined for the
United States, which recently approved a $1.3 billion aid package
to help Colombia fight its drug war. Colombian pilots will fly a
fleet of 60 U.S.-supplied helicopters, providing security and
transporting forces that will wipe out remote drug laboratories and
fumigate illicit crops from low-flying crop dusters.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the high-tech U.S. technology, the Amazonian
headwaters of southern Colombia are a primitive, hostile region.
There are few towns, fewer roads and thousands of square miles of
dense green growth perfect for hiding illegal operations _ and
enemies. The muddy brown streams are ideal for transporting
contraband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rivers are the super highways here,'' said General Mario
Montoya, head of a new Colombian anti-narcotics task force. ``They
carry everything they need for the production of cocaine on those
rivers. Ten years ago, there was very little coca here, but today
this area has the highest concentration of coca production in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear the jungle _ and Colombia's tortured landscape of
leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitary groups, drug barons, a
questionable military and rancorous domestic politics _ may swallow
up the American aid, drawing the U.S. further into a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a profound and dramatic shift in focus from
supporting a police force in a friendly country to supporting an
army engaged in a civil war,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
shortly after Congress approved the aid package. ``I wonder how
long it will be until we read the first news story of some of this
equipment showing up in the hands of rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insist the aid is strictly for fighting drugs,
not to help Colombia fight its civil war. But Montoya admits that
in the remote wilds, the two are often intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC, with all its guns and all its evil, is involved in
the drug trade,'' he said, referring to the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest and oldest guerrilla
group. ``If the guerrillas are involved in drug trafficking, as we
know they are, we're going to attack them.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, a nation of 39 million, supplies an estimated 80
percent of the world's cocaine. It is also a growing source of
heroin. Both drugs are worth billions on the streets of America and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There are no accurate figures on how much the country's
guerrillas gain by taking a cut from the poor farmers who grow the
crops and the traffickers who process and smuggle it, but some
Colombian newspapers have cited figures in the hundreds of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   With the guerrillas and drug lords so powerful, Colombian
President Andres Pastrana stunned the nation 18 months ago by
starting peace talks with the FARC. To show his goodwill, he
ordered Colombian troops out of a Switzerland-sized chunk of the
nation that has become de facto FARC territory.
</P>
<P>
   But the peace talks have since stumbled without much real
progress, and Pastrana's popularity has plummeted. Many Colombians
fear he has given the guerrillas too much without getting anything
in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas are terribly strong because they have so much
money from drug trafficking,'' said Eduardo Gomez, who retired from
the Colombian military and now works in Bogota, the capital. ``We
have no confidence in our institutions. The money from the U.S.
will be wasted, because our army, our police and our government are
corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates on FARC strength range from 17,000 to 22,000 soldiers
in the field, but they are only one of the warring forces in
Colombia. Another guerrilla group, the Army of National Liberation
or ELN, has some 5,000 soldiers, while right-wing paramilitary
groups, which also take tribute from drug traffickers, have an
estimated 7,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's military _ the army, air force and navy _ has about
120,000 personnel. It also has a reputation for corruption and
human-rights abuses, with many observers citing close ties between
army officers and the paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has named his bold new strategy for saving the country,
``Plan Colombia.'' The U.S. aid - which will mostly fund military
equipment, but also provides money for crop substitution and other
social programs _ will be supplemented by more than $600 million
for social programs that Pastrana recently obtained from European
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his four-year term in office, however, Pastrana
has been hamstrung by a corruption scandal and bitter relations
with the national congress. He recently appealed to Colombians to
be more positive, saying, ``I'm tired of the bad news that does not
let us see and construct a better country for all.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more than a positive attitude to vanquish
Colombia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Plan Colombia will escalate the war on both
sides,'' said Marco Alberto Romero, a political scientist at
Colombia's National University. ``If the guerrillas resist this
first campaign, the logic will be that the U.S. will increase its
aid and become more committed to the Colombian conflict. It's a
very complicated problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero believes the focus should be on providing more
opportunity for the rural peasants who grow the coca and poppy. The
peasants now have no alternatives, and wiping out their only cash
crop by fumigation could foul the environment, sicken the poor
farmers and create a new wave of internal displacement within
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have regional consequences,'' he said. ``The drug
trafficking affects the whole Andean region. This could lead to the
breakdown of the peace talks in Colombia, but also could trigger an
arms race. Already both (the FARC and the government) are building
up their forces even as they are participating in the peace
talks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the front lines, Gen. Montoya downplays the criticism and
confidently predicts victory.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent briefing for reporters complete with slides,
tapes of radio conversations among drug traffickers and maps laying
out the alignment of forces, Montoya said the new U.S. aid _
especially a fleet of about 30 sophisticated Blackhawk helicopters
_ will tip the balance in favor of his 3,000-man force in the
southern region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get the helicopters, we can really go to work,'' he
said. ``They will give us the element of surprise and mobility. We
will move in and immediately neutralize the crops.''
</P>
<P>
   Boats patrolling the rivers to intercept cocaine shipments, as
well as the supplies of gasoline, cement and chemicals needed to
convert the coca leaves into cocaine will augment the force.
</P>
<P>
   The only role for U.S. troops _ no more than a few hundred at
the time _ will be to train the Colombian pilots and soldiers, and
help operate sophisticated surveillance equipment the U.S. will
send, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   There are reports that the guerrillas may have _ or will soon
obtain _ surface-to-air missiles or other advanced weapons to shoot
down the helicopters. Critics also warn that the drug farmers and
traffickers will simply move elsewhere once the Colombian offensive
picks up steam.
</P>
<P>
   But Montoya remains upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These groups will try to defend their operations because there
is lots and lots of money involved in narco-trafficking,'' he said.
``But we're prepared militarily for this fight. We're in this for
the long haul.''

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN _ They are one of the world's few
remaining bands of Marxist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Fidel Castro's rag-tag army of Cuban peasants in the
1950s or leftist insurgents dodging around Central America in the
1980s, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are flush with
cash _ lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC, as they are known by their Spanish acronym, have
tapped a 1990s source of revenue: drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted with AK-47 rifles, black berets, new uniforms and
knee-high black rubber boots, these guerrillas have become a
battle-proven force of soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   They control huge swaths of the Colombian countryside, and buy
their guns and equipment with tribute paid by poor farmers who
raise coca and poppy, as well as drug traffickers who process and
smuggle the contraband destined for the streets of Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   They also make millions by kidnapping, holding their victims _
sometimes children _ for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   But their connections to Colombia's notorious drug industry are
what have propelled the FARC from a backwater group to powerful
military force with a sophisticated propaganda machine. Their top
negotiators now hobnob with visiting diplomats and recently toured
several European countries with a delegation aiming to bring peace
to Colombia. They even have their own Website.
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents, however, bristle at the notion that the FARC
are anything more than ruthless, ideologically driven killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't answer to anybody on this earth or in the next
life,'' said Gen. Mario Montoya, head of a new Colombian
anti-narcotics task force that will spearhead a campaign funded by
a $1.3 billion U.S. anti-drug package. ``They make huge amounts of
money from the drug trade. Coca grows like a weed here, and they
are the middle men.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bulk of their forces still hide in the mountains
and the jungles, the FARC now have their own territory where they
walk the streets free from fear of attack by government forces.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to jump-start peace talks, Colombian President Andres
Pastrana pulled his troops out of a Switzerland-sized area in
southern Colombia in January 1999, in effect creating a safe haven
for the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   But after starting amid great hopes, he peace talks have made
little progress, with the two sides barely able to agree on a rough
list of topics to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FARC have consolidated their hold on their turf,
turning San Vicente _ a town of about 15,000 _ into something of a
rebel showcase.
</P>
<P>
   Few tourists venture to the town, which can be reached by
regular commercial airline service. Guerrilla checkpoints dot all
roads leading into the enclave, with armed FARC soldiers ordering
riders out of cars for searches and questioning.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months the guerrillas have welcomed journalists,
perhaps eager to tell their side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence that we can construct a new government for
Colombia,'' said Fidel Rondon, a member of the FARC commission
holding peace talks with government negotiators in a rural village
called Los Pozos, about 40 minutes from San Vicente. ``We want a
better future for all Colombians. This nation has been ruled by a
violent political class. The people of Colombia no longer believe
in this government.''
</P>
<P>
   San Vicente is the largest of five small towns in the FARC-held
territory. A muddy farm center on the banks of the Caguan River, it
hums with activity _ from farmers buying supplies for nearby cattle
ranches, children running through the streets and residents
scooting past on small motorcycles, the favored form of local
transport.
</P>
<P>
   The town government still functions as it did before the FARC
came, collecting taxes and providing services. But the National
Police left with the army, and while there is a new municipal force
of baton-wielding local cops, the FARC guerrillas with shouldered
automatic rifles and hand grenades clipped to their belts are
clearly the real power in town.
</P>
<P>
   The local courts collapsed when the judges fled, and they've
been replaced by a FARC system of justice that includes a complaint
center where citizens bring gripes about everything from disputes
with neighbors to domestic squabbles. There are numerous reports
that a separate FARC tribunal deals sternly with those accused of
spying for the government, sometimes imposing death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   FARC billboards urge the people toward ``a new Colombia,'' and
extol the ``Bolivarian Movement,'' a campaign named after South
America's revolutionary hero, Simon Bolivar. There are also banners
decrying government torture and crop fumigation aimed at the coca
plots that support many poor farmers _ as well as the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a rebel information office just off the town
square, where an attractive young woman dressed in fatigues and a
beret takes requests from visiting journalists, holding court in a
spotless room decorated with photos of Marx, Lenin and Latin
America's modern leftist hero, Che Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople shrug when asked about their strange status, many
reluctant to talk openly about their de-facto rulers. But they
admit there is now peace in San Vicente _ which, before the FARC,
suffered attacks from all sides in the long-running civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the guerrillas came, nobody wanted them to come,'' said
Jorge Solis, a long-time resident. ``But now we have had peace, so
everybody is happier. The economy is good, people have work, and
there aren't bodies in the streets like before. Most people don't
favor one group over the other. They just want peace and to be able
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The FARC were born in the rough countryside outside San Vicente
in the 1950s, when Colombia was torn by political violence between
its dominant political parties. The group formed to advocate for
the poor peasants caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, FARC power waxed and waned. Almost written off
15 years ago, the group has transformed itself into Colombia's most
powerful insurgent force through money earned from the drug trade.
Colombian media estimate the group earns hundreds of millions each
year through ``taxes'' imposed on drug growers and smugglers, and
the FARC now boasts around 20,000 soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the guerillas rule by terror, forcing
young peasant youths into their ranks or seducing them with the
promise of a gun, comradeship and a monthly salary of 400,000 pesos
(US$200), more than double the average wage.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, international diplomats and Colombia's press
have blasted the FARC _ as well as other guerrilla bands and
right-wing paramilitary groups _ for their reliance on kidnapping.
Across Colombia, there is growing outrage that some 200 children
were among the estimated 3,000 kidnapping victims nationwide last
year.
</P>
<P>
   FARC leaders deny kidnapping children, although they admit
taking adults for ransom to raise funds. They also steadfastly deny
involvement in the growing or shipping of cocaine and heroin,
although they admit ``taxing'' those who do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We condemn narco-trafficking,'' said Andres Paris, one of the
group's top negotiators. ``It's not of the guerrillas. It's an
economic and social reality in Colombia. We charge taxes on the
biggest business in our area. It's a political tax to finance the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future holds for Colombia, it's clear the FARC have
now become a powerful, well-financed guerrilla machine that can't
be ignored and won't easily be defeated in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being chastened by the demise of many Marxist regimes
around the world, FARC leaders seem more committed and confident
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare us to Russia,'' said Rondon, who once taught
school in rural Colombia. ``We have taken the ideas of Marx but
applied them to Colombia. As the crisis between the rich and poor
in Colombia has grown, we've grown. And as the Army of Colombia has
modernized, so have we.''

DISCUSSIONS ON ERASING DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN RICH AND POOR

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A group of high-technology executives urged the
wealthiest nations Wednesday to take action to erase a growing
digital divide resulting from the economic chasm separating the
developed and developing worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The perception that the world is increasingly being divided into
information technology haves and have-nots is among the topics that
the seven leading industrial nations and Russia will take up at
their annual summit meeting, which begins Friday in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   A task force established by the World Economic Forum, a policy
organization made up of many of the world's largest corporations
that meets annually in Davos, Switzerland, presented on Wednesday a
series of policy proposals on the issue to Japan's prime minister,
Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, including the chief executives of Sony Corp. and
Toshiba Corp., Japan's two largest consumer electronics firms,
proposed a set of principles including telecommunications and
Internet deregulations, universal access to education and
technology training, as well as support and financing for small
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, prepared at the request of the Japanese government
at the Davos meeting, also includes ideas like the creation of a
Peace Corps-style volunteer group, the Global Digital Opportunity
Corps; the establishment of local technology community centers; and
the establishment of e-chambers of commerce to support
technology-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese high-technology executives said Wednesday evening that
Mori planned to announce at the summit meeting that Japan would
commit $12 billion in loans and $3 billion in Overseas Development
Assistance funds over five years to information-technology
initiatives in the developing world. The move is intended to prompt
similar commitments from other countries to integrate developing
nations into the world's expanding digital infrastructure, a
Japanese executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who acknowledged this week that he is a computer novice
and has only recently learned how to use a mouse, appeared
Wednesday afternoon with an international group of high-technology
executives to underscore his nation's commitment to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to make this an information technology discussion,
mainly focusing on the developing nations,'' Mori said. ``This
digital divide issue is a crucial matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a global digital divide has been seized on in the
past year by corporate executives eager to prove they are socially
responsible. But there is disagreement over what the divide
represents and how permanent it is.
</P>
<P>
   A number of economists and technologists believe the world
income gap created by the industrial revolution may still be the
fundamental dividing line between rich and poor nations rather than
the question of access to technology.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the task force said that the digital divide should
not overshadow the traditional issues that define rich and poor
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a digital divide, said Richard Li, chairman
and chief executive of the Pacific Century Group. ``It is an
education divide, and information technology is only a conduit to
promote education.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sony's chairman, Nobuyuki Idei, acknowledged that his company
had struggled with its own internal digital divide and had been
slow to deploy information technology among its workers. ``This is
a good indication of the problems that will confront us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Schwab, the founder and chairman of the World Economic
Forum, said in an interview this week that he believed that
inexpensive digital wireless technology systems would increasingly
spread in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally feel that a breakthrough is coming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said on Monday that information technology holds
promise for creating economic opportunity as well as improving
access to health care and education. But they noted that while
there are now an estimated 332 million people connected via the
Internet around the world, only 1 percent live in Africa. And less
then 5 percent of the computers connected to the Internet are in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The officials would not offer any U.S. commitment or pledge of a
specific dollar amount to help bridge the digital divide. But they
said they would welcome such proposals from other nations at the
summit meeting and from the U.S. private sector.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference here Wednesday afternoon, members of the
World Economic Forum task force appeared sensitive to the issue of
self-interest on the part of the large corporations backing
significant financial investment in high-technology spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about self-interest,'' said Vernon J. Ellis,
international chairman of Andersen Consulting. ``There is nothing
wrong with self-interest, as long as it is enlightened long-term
self-interest.''

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARBLE FALLS, Texas _ Three years ago, during one of the bull
market's brief but sharp downturns, Edward Jones stockbroker Hugh
D. Reed took a call from one of his clients, an elderly widow. She
was making sure he had not suffered too many losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her I was fine,'' Reed said. ``She wasn't asking if she
was OK, she was asking if I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed's grin widened. ``The next day, she brought me a plate of
cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   How many investors bake cookies to console brokers during market
drops? Not too many. But if they do, they probably bake them for
Edward Jones brokers, whose 5,700 offices are sprinkled throughout
America's small towns, suburbs and neighborhoods. Another 1,000
brokerages have sprouted in Canadian and British towns.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing company _ it has added 15 percent more brokers
every year since the early 1980s _ has never wanted high-rise
boiler rooms in urban areas. Instead, they're in neighborhood
shopping centers or professional buildings, close in proximity and
spirit to their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Where Edward Jones has been supremely successful, though, is in
the countryside. Its philosophy of catering exclusively to
individual investors and small businesses led Fortune magazine to
dub it ``the Wal-Mart of Wall Street.'' Edward Jones goes, to put
it simply, where the clients are.
</P>
<P>
   Reed is a perfect example. He has been a broker in Marble Falls,
a small but prosperous Texas town 90 miles north of San Antonio,
for eight years. He believes, with a fervency approaching religion,
that by being in his clients' community, he can serve them better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly a relationship business,'' he said from behind
his small but ornate blond-wood desk. ``You become a member of the
family. We have educated a lot of kids and grandkids, and
transferred a lot of businesses from the original founders to the
next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, sets Edward Jones apart from other brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything the company's St. Louis-based executives
want you to know about Edward Jones, it is the differences.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the offices. Not only are they spread
throughout rural areas _ Texas alone has 700, up from 100 a decade
ago _ all of them are staffed by one broker and one support person.
</P>
<P>
   When an area has enough business to support another broker,
Edward Jones doesn't add one to the office. Instead, a separate
branch is opened. There are no supervisors or branch managers; each
broker is responsible for business development.
</P>
<P>
   This gives Edward Jones brokers much greater freedom, and helps
the company attract entrepreneurs. ``We get people who really want
their own office and command of their own ship,'' said Edward Jones
managing partner John Bachmann.
</P>
<P>
   The company also distinguishes itself from others through its
conservative investment philosophy. ``Everyone says that,'' Reed
said. ``No one says, `We're wild and crazy.' But I have found
through the years that I do not take on every client or potential
client who comes to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the story of a man who came into his office one day,
plopped a $100,000 check on the desk and said, ``Let's play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally had to tell him, `I'm not the right broker for
you,''' Reed said. ``You need someone who will trade four times
today and three times tomorrow, and that's not who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed has a tactic for instances when he can't talk a client out
of something risky. He produces a letter documenting his
disapproval, and asks the client to sign it. It's a seldom-used
strategy, but it almost always works.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Jones discourages customers from dabbling in penny stocks
by not compensating brokers for trading stocks under $5 per share.
It shies away from the lucrative investment-banking business. And
most different of all, it pushes no proprietary investments on
clients because it doesn't have any.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is so different, Edward Jones can't grow simply by
buying another brokerage. The pieces would not fit together. So
Bachmann, who has been in charge since 1980, masterminded a
growth-through-expansion strategy that will give the company 10,000
brokerages by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The big numbers aren't just about stoking partners' egos. ``If
you take a market like San Antonio, we may or may not be
(advertising) on TV or in the newspaper, because we may or may not
be on a scale where we can afford that,'' Bachmann said. ``We need
that scale or we run the risk of being irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is starting to wake up to just how relevant Edward
Jones is. Merrill Lynch has experimented in opening branches in
small towns; one is less than a mile up the street from Reed's
Marble Falls office.
</P>
<P>
   Bachmann shrugged this off. He compares Edward Jones to
Southwest Airlines, another business that found a successful niche
and has held off imitations from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do one thing well, we're not going to do other things,'' he
said. ``We're not going to serve institutions. We don't have house
brands, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people have tried to emulate our model, but unless
they're willing to do those tradeoffs, they won't have the success
we have.''

BRIAN WILSON SAYS HIS SONGS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the annals of pop music, the Beach Boys' ``Pet Sounds'' rates
on many Top Ten lists of all time. It was the precursor to the
Beatles' ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'' The masterwork
of Beach Boys genius Brian Wilson, it set studio standards for
years to come. And it is now being performed on tour, complete with
a 55-piece orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my wife and managers asked if I'd like to do it, I said
sure,'' says Wilson. ``And when they told me if I'd be happy using
a symphonic orchestra to do it, I also said sure. So we got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kick. I love that album anyway, and in front of an
orchestra, it's even better. The songs speak for themselves,''
Wilson says in a recent phone interview from the road. He is
playing some other Beach Boys hits too, so the show is not all
drawn from one album.
</P>
<P>
   Released in 1966, ``Pet Sounds'' was almost a Brian Wilson solo
record in that he used studio musicians and only brought the rest
of the Beach Boys in on it later. The album includes ``God Only
Knows,'' ``Wouldn't It Be Nice,'' ``Caroline, No,'' and ``Sloop
John B.'' Wilson wrote the music and co-wrote the lyrics with Tony
Asher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was smoking dope back then _ and believe it or not, it
helped me to write. It did,'' says Wilson. ``The songs came pretty
quickly _ they took about two hours each. We just poured them out
of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   What took more time _ and is the reason ``Pet Sounds'' is hailed
as groundbreaking _ is the care that Wilson took in stacking the
vocal parts to achieve a lush sound, as well as including
experimental sounds made by such objects as bicycle bells, teacups,
and Coca-Cola cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album was made very cautiously and carefully,'' says
Wilson. ``But it turned out fantastic. We took each song one at a
time, then we finally got it all mixed and were flipped out by it.
We really flipped. We thought it was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the motivating factor behind the music, he says,
``We wanted to make a special love album for people. The voices
were the love, and the instrumentation, I guess, was the
excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the exotic sounds on it, Wilson recalls, ``My drummer had
a kit called Soundmakers. And we looked through his kit and we
found a bicycle thing and teacups and stuff. It was just a
fantastic trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a ``Pet Sounds'' boxed set came out, featuring
a new stereo remix of the album. Wilson says, ``I got a chance to
hear it, but I'm deaf in my right ear, so I can't appreciate
stereo.'' (He blames his hearing loss on touring in the early
years.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the boxed set, he says, ``I wasn't involved in it. It was
all done by Capitol Records.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Wilson has forsaken major record companies to form
his own indie label, Brimel, chosen by combining the first three
letters of his name and the first three of his wife, Melinda, with
whom he has had two children in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The label's first release is the new Wilson concert CD, ``Live
at the Roxy Theatre,'' recorded in Los Angeles last year and
available only on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Internet, does Wilson like to surf it?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he admits, ``my wife handles that end of it.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Situated on the jagged coast of Finland nearly 400 miles north
of Helsinki, Oulu must rank as one of the world's most improbable
technology boom towns.
</P>
<P>
   There is no daylight from December through mid-February. Parking
lots provide electric warmers to keep car engines from freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Except for forests and lakes, there isn't much within 100 miles
of Oulu. The most notable town to the north is Rovaniemi, which has
built its economy on the assertion that it is the true home of
Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to come to Oulu,'' wrote Ilpo Okkonen, the author
of a picture book about the city. ``All you have to do is set out
from somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as unlikely as it may seem, this town of 100,000 people is
home to hundreds of electronics companies. Driven in part by Nokia,
the Helsinki company that is the world's biggest manufacturer of
mobile telephones, Oulu thrives as a center for research on
wireless data communications.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia employs nearly 5,000 people here, most of them working on
third-generation mobile services that offer high-speed electronic
commerce and even full-color video communications.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has also become a hotbed for start-ups. There are
companies here that make wireless networks for underground mines,
wireless tickets for buses and ski lifts, wireless automation
systems for factories and wireless encryption systems to protect
data sent over the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure how all this ``mobile commerce'' will
develop, but the phenomenal success of ordinary mobile phones has
attracted a flood of venture capital. Finnair now makes 15 daily
round-trip flights between Oulu and Helsinki, and most are packed
with business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The city's half-dozen hotels are routinely booked solid, but
rarely with tourists. A handful of American technology companies,
like Tellabs and Mentor Graphics, have offices here as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all of us venture funds are loaded with money,''
says Juha Mikkola, a partner in Eqvitec Partners, a venture-capital
firm in Helsinki that has invested in several Oulu companies. ``All
we need is more good entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Until about 10 years ago, Oulu was best known as a former
trading center for black tar. Those days are long gone: The demand
for tar, used in waterproofing, collapsed with the demise of big
wooden ships in the 19th century. Local shops still honor the
heritage by selling tar liquor and tar candy, however, which taste
about as good as they sound.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the city's rebirth stems from its large pool of skilled
technical people. The University of Oulu, financed mainly by the
Finnish government, draws 13,000 students and has programs in
electronics, engineering and information technology. Most of the
students come from northern Finland, and about two-thirds stay in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The government also set up the Technical Research Center, which
now employs about 2,900 researchers who work on advanced wireless
technologies and optical electronics. About half of the center's
revenue comes from work for private companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, long before the boom in cellular telephones,
Nokia set up a small branch here. Then Nokia was a conglomerate
that dabbled in a variety of electronics as it searched for new
opportunities. Researchers in Oulu provided some of the company's
early work in wireless military equipment for the Finnish
government, which gave it a base for jumping into mobile telephones
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Oulu's abundant technical talent has also made it a haven for
local entrepreneurs. One was Lauri Kuokkanen, who was posted here
by Nokia and then quit in 1976 to start LK Products, a company that
made radio-frequency filters.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``serial entrepreneur,'' Kuokkanen went on to
start at least three other companies, including a company called
Solitra. The man he recruited to run Solitra, Juha Sipila, recently
sold it to an American company called ADC, reaping tens of millions
of dollars. Today he is an investor in at least 15 other local
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask how Oulu suddenly became such a big success,'' says
Kuokkanen, who is 68. ``We just did our daily work, and it
gradually grew bigger and bigger. It's been happening for the last
25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that work happens at Technopolis, an industrial park
that is home to about 130 companies. Researchers and ideas shuttle
between business and academia, much as Stanford University fueled
the growth of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is quite a strong internal network of people there who
all studied in the same area about 20 years ago,'' says Vesa
Sadeharju, a partner at SFK Finance, a venture-capital firm in
Helsinki that has invested in about 10 Oulu start-ups. Last month
SFK was bought for an undisclosed amount by one of Europe's biggest
venture-capital firms, the London-based 3i Group.
</P>
<P>
   Companies based at Technopolis employ more than 10,000 people,
but thousands more work off-campus at companies such as Sonera,
Finland's biggest telephone company, and Polar Electro Oy, which
makes electronic heart-measurement products.
</P>
<P>
   Many are start-ups that rent as little as a single room but
obtain access to high-speed phone lines, administrative services
and expertise at the university and the Technical Research Center.
CCC Oy, for example, a small company started in 1985, developed
software under contract for Nokia and then developed its own
products. Today it has about $20 million a year in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are digging into more exotic areas as well. At the
Wireless Internet Laboratory, part of the Technical Research
Center, Petri Mahonen is experimenting with virtual-reality glasses
that would allow mobile-phone users to browse the Internet in
color.
</P>
<P>
   His team has also installed miniature wireless-computer servers
into devices such as coffeepots and toy race cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main idea is not that people want to run their coffeepots
over the Internet,'' Mahonen says. ``The point here is to think
about using the Internet for unusual new purposes and to see how
small and how cheap you can produce a wireless Internet server. It
turns out they can be quite small and cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Silicon Valley, Oulu remains a rustic outpost.
There are few shopping malls or movie complexes, and the streets
are filled with creaky old cars. The city's main attractions are
bicycle paths and footbridges, which crisscross the waterways and
lakes.
</P>
<P>
   When spring arrives in mid-May, nights gradually disappear into
a two-month-long stretch of daylight, and the region becomes a
haven for outdoor sports and recreation. One evening early last
month, in-line skaters and bicyclists stayed out until 11 while
salmon fishermen drifted in the golden rays of the late-night sun.
By July, people are playing midnight golf and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day I left work at 3 p.m. and drove about 150
kilometers to go fishing,'' says Pertti Huuskanen, the president of
Technopolis. ``I fished for several hours, and I used my mobile
telephone to read and answer my e-mail. I got back by about 11:30,
before it was completely dark.''

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Situated on the jagged coast of Finland nearly 400 miles north
of Helsinki, Oulu must rank as one of the world's most improbable
technology boom towns.
</P>
<P>
   There is no daylight from December through mid-February. Parking
lots provide electric warmers to keep car engines from freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Except for forests and lakes, there isn't much within 100 miles
of Oulu. The most notable town to the north is Rovaniemi, which has
built its economy on the assertion that it is the true home of
Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to come to Oulu,'' wrote Ilpo Okkonen, the author
of a picture book about the city. ``All you have to do is set out
from somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as unlikely as it may seem, this town of 100,000 people is
home to hundreds of electronics companies. Driven in part by Nokia,
the Helsinki company that is the world's biggest manufacturer of
mobile telephones, Oulu thrives as a center for research on
wireless data communications.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia employs nearly 5,000 people here, most of them working on
third-generation mobile services that offer high-speed electronic
commerce and even full-color video communications.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has also become a hotbed for start-ups. There are
companies here that make wireless networks for underground mines,
wireless tickets for buses and ski lifts, wireless automation
systems for factories and wireless encryption systems to protect
data sent over the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure how all this ``mobile commerce'' will
develop, but the phenomenal success of ordinary mobile phones has
attracted a flood of venture capital. Finnair now makes 15 daily
round-trip flights between Oulu and Helsinki, and most are packed
with business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The city's half-dozen hotels are routinely booked solid, but
rarely with tourists. A handful of American technology companies,
like Tellabs and Mentor Graphics, have offices here as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all of us venture funds are loaded with money,''
says Juha Mikkola, a partner in Eqvitec Partners, a venture-capital
firm in Helsinki that has invested in several Oulu companies. ``All
we need is more good entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Until about 10 years ago, Oulu was best known as a former
trading center for black tar. Those days are long gone: The demand
for tar, used in waterproofing, collapsed with the demise of big
wooden ships in the 19th century. Local shops still honor the
heritage by selling tar liquor and tar candy, however, which taste
about as good as they sound.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the city's rebirth stems from its large pool of skilled
technical people. The University of Oulu, financed mainly by the
Finnish government, draws 13,000 students and has programs in
electronics, engineering and information technology. Most of the
students come from northern Finland, and about two-thirds stay in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The government also set up the Technical Research Center, which
now employs about 2,900 researchers who work on advanced wireless
technologies and optical electronics. About half of the center's
revenue comes from work for private companies.

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the beginning, as it were, the Web was made possible by a
simple innovation known as Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML.
Through this language, which arranged text, images and buttons in a
World Wide Web browser, information could be read by computer users
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its power, HTML has flaws, the most obvious being an
inability to make distinctions between the presentation of computer
data and the data itself. HTML, in other words, deals only with the
``appearance'' of information. This is why the Web is sometimes
called a ``fancy fax machine'' _ great at doling out documents on
request but poorly designed for direct information exchanges
between computers on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Now, inevitably, the next generation of Web language, called XML
(for Extensible Markup Language), is emerging, and many software
designers can barely contain their excitement over its potential to
establish a real Internet lingua franca.
</P>
<P>
   By not only transmitting information but also interpreting what
that information means, XML, the brainchild of a Sun Microsystems
engineer, will greatly enhance a wide range of Internet companies
and applications, from automated industry supply chains to a new
class of Internet programs that users can gain access to at the
office, at home or on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like there's been this collective `Aha!' experience in
the community over the simplicity of this technology,'' said Howard
Katz, an XML software developer in Vancouver, British Columbia.
``It just feels right.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the difference between HTML and XML, consider a
document containing, say, baseball statistics, like those printed
in newspapers. As it travels through cyberspace, the document
contains separate bracketed ``tags'' embedded in the text, which
offer instructions to a browser, like Microsoft Explorer or
Netscape Navigator, on either the display of the information (HTML)
or its meaning (XML).
</P>
<P>
   The HTML tags display the information in neat columns and
boldface the names of the players and their teams. The XML tags, by
contrast, describe what each category of information is: player,
team, batting average, home runs, runs batted in. The genius of XML
is that each information category can have its own ``vocabulary,''
making it possible to easily identify and exchange information.
</P>
<P>
   XML designers are starting to use the language like a data glue
to hook together entire industries. For example, a computermaker or
a group of PC companies might automate their supply chains, using
the Web to link parts suppliers directly to their factories.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, XML may become the most crucial component underlying
the next big leap on the Internet. Microsoft has already moved
rapidly to build e-commerce tools based on its version of XML,
known as Biztalk.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is apparently preparing for an even more
significant committment to XML. In late June, Microsoft introduced
its new software strategy based on what its co-founder, William H.
Gates, is calling Next Generation Windows Services.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to create a new Internet operating system that will
shift an array of applications from the hard disks of personal
computers onto the Net. A range of software and services, from word
processing and spreadsheet programs to data storage and other
peripherals, will be on powerful network computers accessible
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users will thus be able to gain access to the power of
their computers whether they are in their office, at home or
traveling with a wireless connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Microsoft's new Internet strategy is XML, which
the company will use to rapidly connect its applications and make
them work across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a bitter pill for Sun Microsystems, one of
Microsoft's chief rivals. XML was first envisioned by Jon Bosak, a
Microsystems software engineer, who saw that HTML would not be
useful for turning the World Wide Web into what he calls an
``industrial strength infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   One of a small group of professionals who understood the true
power of an arcane publishing language known as Standard
Generalized Markup Language, or SGML, Bosak began pestering the
World Wide Web Consortium, the MIT-based group that designs
standards for the Web, with his notions in 1996. He came away with
the consortium's blessing to explore a way to bring the power of
SGML to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   He had become a believer in SGML after using the language to
single-handedly transfer the 150,000 pages of Novell's Netware
documentation from print to an online system.
</P>
<P>
   Between August and November 1996, Bosak, with the help of two
other SGML experts, Tim Bray and C.M. Sperberg-McQueen, created XML
as a scaled-down version of SGML, intended for use on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Their solution was, in principle, very simple. They used HTML's
tags (which are offset by brackets within the code), to describe
what a particular piece of information is, rather than what it
looks like.
</P>
<P>
   In an article written last year for Scientific American, Bray
and Bosak described the difference between the two languages with a
simple example: shirts. XML, they wrote, would ``label the parts of
an order for a shirt not as boldface, paragraph, row and column _
what HTML offers _ but as price, size, quantity and color.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach has been quickly grasped by everyone _ software
developers, Internet start-ups, corporate giants such as Microsoft
and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We unleashed it on the world at the end of 1996, and it was
like hurling ourselves at a door that was unlatched,'' Bray said.
</P>
<P>
   Will the resulting technology offer a level playing field based
on a set of standards that all companies can use? It's not clear.
Sun, which created the Java programming language, has been slow in
popularizing the XML standard even though Bosak conceived it.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of Microsoft's intense antitrust battle and the
conflicting industry views over whether the company is an imitator
or an innovator, it will be quite a twist if Microsoft becomes the
biggest beneficiary of the technology.

Gates, is calling Next Generation Windows Services.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to create a new Internet operating system that will
shift an array of applications from the hard disks of personal
computers onto the Net. A range of software and services, from word
processing and spreadsheet programs to data storage and other
peripherals, will be on powerful network computers accessible
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users will thus be able to gain access to the power of
their computers whether they are in their office, at home or
traveling with a wireless connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Microsoft's new Internet strategy is XML, which
the company will use to rapidly connect its applications and make
them work across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a bitter pill for Sun Microsystems, one of
Microsoft's chief rivals. XML was first envisioned by Jon Bosak, a
Microsystems software engineer, who saw that HTML would not be
useful for turning the World Wide Web into what he calls an
``industrial strength infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   One of a small group of professionals who understood the true
power of an arcane publishing language known as Standard
Generalized Markup Language, or SGML, Bosak began pestering the
World Wide Web Consortium, the MIT-based group that designs
standards for the Web, with his notions in 1996. He came away with
the consortium's blessing to explore a way to bring the power of
SGML to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   He had become a believer in SGML after using the language to
single-handedly transfer the 150,000 pages of Novell's Netware
documentation from print to an online system.
</P>
<P>
   Between August and November 1996, Bosak, with the help of two
other SGML experts, Tim Bray and C.M. Sperberg-McQueen, created XML
as a scaled-down version of SGML, intended for use on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Their solution was, in principle, very simple. They used HTML's
tags (which are offset by brackets within the code), to describe
what a particular piece of information is, rather than what it
looks like.
</P>
<P>
   In an article written last year for Scientific American, Bray
and Bosak described the difference between the two languages with a
simple example: shirts. XML, they wrote, would ``label the parts of
an order for a shirt not as boldface, paragraph, row and column _
what HTML offers _ but as price, size, quantity and color.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach has been quickly grasped by everyone _ software
developers, Internet start-ups, corporate giants such as Microsoft
and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We unleashed it on the world at the end of 1996, and it was
like hurling ourselves at a door that was unlatched,'' Bray said.
</P>
<P>
   Will the resulting technology offer a level playing field based
on a set of standards that all companies can use? It's not clear.
Sun, which created the Java programming language, has been slow in
popularizing the XML standard even though Bosak conceived it.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of Microsoft's intense antitrust battle and the
conflicting industry views over whether the company is an imitator
or an innovator, it will be quite a twist if Microsoft becomes the
biggest beneficiary of the technology.

CLINTON'S GAMBLE ON EDUCATION POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Calif., Ohio, Fla., Wis., N.Y., N.J.)   By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush talk a lot about education in the
presidential campaign. Yet the federal role in education seems
minor, just 7 percent of school budgets. Are the candidates
misleading the voters?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. In his two terms, President Clinton has shown that a
shrewd chief executive can have a big impact on schools. But it is
still unclear if his policy has been farsighted or reckless.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Clinton wanted higher standards but knew that
resources to achieve them, like good facilities and qualified
teachers, were expensive and distributed unequally. Raising
standards without added dollars could cause soaring failure rates
for disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   With huge deficits, the president initially had no hope of
getting much new spending. So he chose a high-risk approach,
focusing first on standards and figuring states would be forced to
add their own money later, perhaps through lawsuits. This is now
happening, but the process is not over.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strategy took shape prior to the 1992 election. As
governor of Arkansas, he tried to influence President Bush's
education policy. As president, Clinton expanded reforms he had
prodded his predecessor to begin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, representing the National Governors' Association,
Clinton negotiated with Bush's domestic policy aides to establish
``Goals 2000,'' a call for higher standards.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton adviser then was Dr. Marshall Smith, dean of Stanford
University's School of Education. Smith urged ``systemic reform,''
an idea that more money by itself could not improve schools.
Rather, reform must combine higher standards, testing whether
students reach them, and holding schools accountable.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, higher standards could spur inequality if states
did not give all students an ``opportunity to learn'' advanced
content, because poor children are often less prepared at home and
have teachers who are not trained to impart more sophisticated
thinking skills.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this, Smith said, systemic reform must also ensure that
all teachers are well prepared and that facilities and materials
for poor children are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations with President Bush's staff, Gov. Clinton
fruitlessly sought financing to get poor children more ready to
learn. In a joint news conference, Bush and the governors agreed
that added money was desirable but said, ``We understand the limits
imposed on new spending by the federal deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Smith became undersecretary of education in the Clinton
administration, and systemic reform became policy. But it became
embroiled in disputes over ``opportunity to learn'' programs that
cost money.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic congressional leaders wanted no students held to
higher standards without the resources to achieve them, but
congressional Republicans and governors from both parties were
ready to abandon reform if new expenditures were required. So
Clinton decided not to support spending programs tied to the
standards.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jack Jennings, then an aide to House Democrats, the
president and his allies were gambling. They recognized that new
spending proposals would scuttle reform, but also thought that once
higher standards were in place, states would be forced, perhaps by
lawsuits, to finance help for poor children to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, now back at Stanford, recalled that he and other
administration officials thought states would have to provide
better trained teachers and resources for disadvantaged pupils,
``forced by the clarity of the outcome requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform has proceeded much as the administration urged. States
adopted new standards. Failing pupils are held back. But those who
fail are more often poor and minority students.
</P>
<P>
   Raising dollars to remedy this is mostly a state function, but
unexpected federal surpluses also help. Clinton's later budgets,
unlike earlier ones, focus not on standards but on money for
smaller classes, better trained teachers, and school construction
and refurbishing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, conflict between higher standards and inadequate
resources occurs mostly at the state level. There, litigation has
intensified, just as the administration expected. A New York state
judge is weighing a claim that higher standards require more funds
for New York City schools. New Jersey's Supreme Court says that the
state must offer preschool to disadvantaged children and ensure
that poor districts receive more state money than suburban ones.
</P>
<P>
   In California, a new lawsuit demands equal access to advanced
courses for poor children. An Ohio court recently ruled that
standards were adopted without ensuring disadvantaged students the
resources to meet them. But similar suits in Florida and Wisconsin
have failed for now.
</P>
<P>
   If states eventually provide enough new money, Clinton will have
been a visionary who maneuvered states into equalizing education
after embracing high standards.
</P>
<P>
   But if states continue to raise standards without resources to
reach them, his impact will be more negative, leading to wider
academic gaps between rich and poor.

DENNIS MILLER BLOCKS CRITICISM AS HE TACKLES `MONDAY NIGHT' ROLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MIKI TURNER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ With his small frame and scruffy appearance,
he doesn't look the part. Plus, there's nothing on his extensive
resume to suggest that he's even qualified for the job. Yet when
comedian, talk show host and pitchman Dennis Miller faced a
skeptical group of TV critics at the group's annual media tour
Sunday at the Ritz Carlton Hotel &AMP; Spa, America's most irreverent
funny man didn't fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who was hired by producer Don Ohlmeyer last month to
join ABC's Monday Night Football broadcasting team, was as steady
as any armchair quarterback as he fielded questions about his
``odd'' hiring, his qualifications and the role he'll play when he
joins longtime MNF announcer Al Michaels, analyst Dan Fouts and
on-field reporters Eric Dickerson and Melissa Stark.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider the pedigree of his MNF colleagues, all of
whom are either ex-jocks or longtime sports broadcasting pros,
Miller's hiring seems pretty risky. After all, even though Miller,
46, has earned five Emmys for HBO's ``Dennis Miller Live,'' he has
never called any kind of sporting event and has never played the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, however, is hopeful that the Saturday Night Live alum's
acerbic ``common-man'' appeal will add just the right touch to its
storied Monday-night franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we've tried to assemble is a group of people who
have different skills and different life experiences,'' Ohlmeyer
said. ``We've got two Hall of Famers and the best play-by-play
announcer in the business. I think people will be surprised at
(Miller's) knowledgeability in terms of football. Also, what Dennis
brings is that he looks at life a little bit askew and he looks at
football a little bit askew.''
</P>
<P>
   With his MNF debut two weeks away, Miller concedes that he still
has a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not ready to go right now,'' Miller said. ``I've got
two weeks and I'm going to use every second of it. I'm trying to
lay in as much information as I can. I'm just reading a bunch of
statistics and player biographies. I'm just trying to pull it all
in on a deeper level. And then when I get to the game, I'll just,
you know, try to comment on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ohlmeyer explained it, Fouts will pick apart the x's and o's,
Dickerson and Stark will get up close and personal with the
players, Michaels will call the plays and Miller will. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, it's football,'' Miller said with a hint of
condescension. ``I've never played the game, but it's not like I'm
on the medical channel with Denton Cooley. I can comment on a
football game. If somebody at home goes, `He never played,' well,
you know, a lot of people didn't play the game. I'm not going to
try and comment on, you know, the inner stuff (it takes) to go
across the middle with a defensive back careening at your spine.
But I watch football as much as anybody. I can comment on a team
and tell (people) what I think are their strengths and
weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And he won't, repeat won't, be in the booth for comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to convey that I'm going to be the court
jester out there because, indeed, football is a different arena,''
Miller says. ``These people don't want me to be some manic
jokesmith out there. I'm going to talk football. If I see a chance
for a humorous shot, I'm going to take it here and there, but my
prime directive is to be an integral member of a three-man group
talking about a football game. And I think I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As do, for that matter, his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we brought Dennis in (for an audition), not only did we
get Dennis Miller as Dennis Miller (the comedian), we got from him
some of the most perceptive analysis of the game itself that I've
ever heard,'' Michaels said. ``He came in from a different angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Dickerson: ``I think it's a good thing, and I think all the
players that play now even think it's a good thing because it adds
a comedic side. The NFL is not all about being comedic, but some
funny things can happen in the National Football League.''
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, Miller demonstrated his football
knowledge by offering a prognosis of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno, I don't think it's their year, quite frankly,''
Miller said. ``I think Michael Irvin is a loss. He was a bit of an
iconoclast and a weird guy, but certainly a gamer and it can't help
to lose him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind Jerry Jones. I like the way he makes money. I
like his approach to the game. People always go, `He just wants to
buy a championship,' like that's a bad thing. I've always thought
that's a good thing. I think he makes a mistake when he goes into
the draft room and commandeers that situation. I don't think his
picks over the years have proven that he's as an astute judge of
talent as he is a judge of finances. I'm picking the Rams.''
</P>
<P>
   And with his HBO show _ now in its seventh season _ going on
hiatus next month until January, Miller will have plenty of time to
hone his broadcast skills. Although not one typically for
self-doubts, Miller admitted he does have some apprehensions about
his new gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have show-business apprehensions, but they're not real-life
apprehensions'' he said. ``It's just show-business pressure. I
don't feel that much pressure. If I do well they'll rehire me and
if I do it poorly they'll fire me. I'm at peace with that.''

SAKS MAKEOVER: SALES SPACE UP, AS IS CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (EDS: Hyphen in `Saks-Fifth' in 2nd graf is cq) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``To our friends up the avenue, who have done things
decidedly new, we extend a cordial greeting, a bravo of approval, a
sincere salutation and a hearty hand-clasp.''
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1924. The avenue was Fifth. The welcoming
advertisement was placed by Russeks, ``An Institution of Paris
Fashion,'' at 36th Street. And the newcomer was Saks-Fifth Avenue,
between 49th and 50th streets.
</P>
<P>
   Russeks is long gone. So are most of the big Fifth Avenue
retailers: B. Altman, Arnold Constable, Best &AMP; Co., Bonwit Teller
and De Pinna. That leaves Saks with the task of restoring the
character of its landmark building without freezing the store in
time, especially a time that is 76 years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many stores that have the wonderful bones this
building does architecturally,'' said Christina Johnson, the
president and chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue. ``We have the
challenge of marrying this company's incredible legacy to the
relevancy needs of the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost halfway through a five-year, $100 million renovation,
from the top floor to the basement (sorry, ``concourse level''),
Saks has already picked up an extra 40,000 square feet of selling
space by moving the alterations, wrap and pack, receiving and fur
storage departments out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Saks executives are turning their attention to the main
floor. Its good bones have been lost to an accumulation of visual
clutter and physical obstructions like sales islands pushed into
the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have a clear shot when you're in the store,'' said
Stephen B. Joseph, vice president for corporate store planning and
design, who is working with the architectural firm Tucci, Segrete &AMP;
Rosen Consultants. ``Clear sight lines and clear circulation are
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the renovation of the main floor, scheduled for 2002,
sales islands will be pulled back four or five feet to the line of
the columns along the main aisles. ``When you walk into Saks Fifth
Avenue, you'll see this grand boulevard,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The men's department at the rear of the floor will be moved
upstairs, freeing space for cosmetics, jewelry, handbags and
accessories. A ring of smaller, almost self-contained selling areas
will be created around the perimeter, framed by pilasters with
acanthus-leaf capitals that complement the existing columns.
</P>
<P>
   New chandeliers and sconces will be added, as will some kind
molding, perhaps trompe l'oeil, to give the ceiling an added sense
of depth.
</P>
<P>
   The men's department will be consolidated on the sixth floor and
the seventh floor, which is under renovation. The third floor, home
of high-end design, will be renovated next year, with a shallow
barrel-vaulted ceiling along the main axis, leading to windows
overlooking the Channel Gardens of Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   As unlikely as it seems, the top two floors at this prime
location were once occupied by workrooms. These were supervised in
the 1930s by Joseph T. Cukor, a cousin of the movie director George
Cukor, and were described by Fortune magazine as ``bursting with
girls stitching diligently over long tables spread with rippling,
exotic fabrics, with wacky designers, grave-faced fitters, blinking
tailors and mannequins lolling about waiting for fittings.''
</P>
<P>
   Saks was designed by Starrett &AMP; Van Vleck in Renaissance Revival
style. The 10-story limestone and brick building has chamfered
corners, two-story-high pilasters and setbacks above the seventh
floor. The architects virtually replicated this design at the
Garfinckel store in downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The hyphen in Saks-Fifth Avenue distinguished it from an older
Saks &AMP; Co. store on Herald Square. The Saks-34th Street building
still stands, altered beyond recognition and now known as Herald
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Saks merged his business with Gimbel Brothers in 1923,
permitting him to finance construction on Fifth Avenue. More
recently, Saks was owned by Batus Inc., a unit of BAT Industries of
Britain, and then Investcorp, a Bahrain-based investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Saks was acquired two years ago for $2.1 billion by Proffitt's
Inc., which changed its name to Saks Inc. The company, based in
Birmingham, Ala., operates 357 stores.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of the Saks Fifth Avenue division, which has 61
stores, occupy 16 floors of the Tower 49 skyscraper at 12 East 49th
St. The store has 650,000 square feet, but executives will not
disclose how much of that is given over to sales.
</P>
<P>
   Edward M. Calabrese, senior vice president and creative director
of Tucci, Segrete &AMP; Rosen, contrasted the renovation of Saks with
the general transformation of Fifth Avenue into a ``mall-like,
homogenized'' environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has been obliterated,'' he said. ``Putting things back
and giving a building back its sense of architecture will be very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bottom line is that they're also looking at the
size of the investment. It's one of the last luxury department
stores in the United States. It's them and Neiman Marcus. They
don't want to make any mistakes.''

<P>
   Dale McClelland e-mailed looking for a recipe for snowdrop
cookies that ``ran a number of years ago. They are rolled in
powdered sugar while hot and have nuts and spices in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Our electronic library database goes back about 10 years. I
could find nothing there on snowdrop cookies. However, through the
magic of the Internet, which has a worldwide base of recipes, I
found what I think is the recipe Dale wants at www.cookierecipe.com
_ a fabulous site that is part of www.allrecipes.com. And for
chocolate lovers (if it's not chocolate, it's not worth eating),
here's a similar recipe from the same Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia W. Snowden saw our request for fire-and-ice pickles and
sent along her recipe. Duh. I had no idea that these were the same
pickles that we run the recipe for every holiday season and call
Christmas pickles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SNOWBALLS
</P>
<P>
   Yields 4 dozen
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter

<P>
   Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Cream butter and white sugar. Add nuts and vanilla. Blend in
flour and salt and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Form dough into small balls and bake on ungreased cookie sheet
for 8 to 10 minutes until barely brown. Coat in powdered sugar
while still hot.

<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable oil

<P>
   2 cups white granulated sugar

</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   Combine chocolate squares and oil in saucepan and place over low
heat until chocolate is melted.
</P>
<P>
   Cool and pour into mixing bowl. Add sugar, eggs and vanilla,
mixing until well blended.
</P>
<P>
   Sift dry ingredients together and gradually add to chocolate/egg
mixture, stirring well.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in nuts, cover and place dough in refrigerator overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees and grease cookie sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Shape dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Roll in
powdered sugar and place about 2 inches apart on cookie sheet.

<P>
   FIRE-AND-ICE PICKLES
</P>
<P>
   Yields 1 gallon
</P>
<P>
   2-ounce bottle Tabasco sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 gallon dill pickles (not kosher)
</P>
<P>
   5 pounds sugar
</P>
<P>
   8-10 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons whole mustard seed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Drain pickles in colander. Slice pickles in 1/4-inch-thick
slices and layer them in original jar along with the sugar: dills,
sugar, dills, sugar. When the jar is about half full, add Tabasco
sauce, garlic, mustard seeds and red pepper slices. Layer remainder
of pickles and sugar. Let jar sit unrefrigerated for 7 days,
turning container from top to bottom every day.
</P>
<P>
   Note: You may not be able to fit all the pickles and sugar in
the jar. Save the ingredients; by the next day, the sugar will be
dissolved, making room for the rest of the pickles and sugar. Put
in smaller jars for gifts to friends. Also makes a great relish for
salads.

   Request:
</P>
<P>
   Sue Simnacher Tood of Haltom City, Texas, would love some of the
recipes for dishes that were served at the now-closed St. Joseph
Hospital cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was an RN there (Bee Simnacher) and I worked briefly
in the business office circa 1968-70. Employees would line up to
wait in line to get in, and the glorious smells would drive you
crazy. Then, sadly, they decided to have food purchased outside for
the cafeteria. I remember the Ritz cracker pie, the carrot salad,
and oh, the Mexican food!''
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone help?  &QL;

as the Democratic and Republican parties hold their national
conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, shadow conventions
will convene nearby, providing a running commentary and critique.
Conceived of by Huffington and the Internet impresario Peter
Hirshberg, the conventions' goal is to expose the ``empty
rhetoric'' of the two major parties and ``give voice to millions of

I'll be able to tap into my e-mail. After all, this column has to
be edited.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I have a tradition of working while playing. It
began on our Hawaiian honeymoon, when Bruce spent the plane ride
reading medical journals and I was awakened at an ungodly hour by
The New York Times' magazine section so I could answer questions
from a fact checker.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the memorable summer on Block Island, off Rhode
Island, when I had to finish the final draft of a book and Bruce
had a grant application due. We were sharing a rental house with
Bruce's sister and her husband, and, between the four of us, we'd
brought four cell phones, three laptops and a fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   This does, I admit, seem to go against the basic meaning of the
word ``vacation,'' and I realize that other couples handle things
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Seibel, for instance, is an assistant U.S. attorney who
refuses to even think about work while on vacation. Her staff, she
says, knows that she wants to be called only ``if the safety of the
republic is in question,'' and, thankfully, that hasn't happened
yet. But Seibel's husband, Dr. Barron Lerner, is a self-diagnosed
work addict. A physician and medical historian at New York
Presbyterian Hospital, he feels that time spent away from work is
time spent worrying about work piling up _ in other words, only by
working can he relax.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before laptops, Seibel and Lerner would venture to
Cape Cod, Mass., for just a week at a time because she grew
agitated if he worked and he grew agitated if he didn't. Then, with
the coming of the e-mail era, they agreed to be daring and try a
two-week vacation, but first they established some carefully
crafted ground rules. He was allowed to work. But only during one
of the two weeks. And only at night after their two children were
asleep. ``You have to do what fits each person's desires and
neuroses,'' Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   It is an evolving compromise. There is some question, for
instance, about whether e-mails fall under the
no-work-during-daylight clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regard that as work, absolutely, but he regards it as an
activity of daily living,'' Seibel said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are varying interpretations of what counts as vacation
literature, too. Lerner is hoping that the new 581-page biography
of the legendary physician Sir William Osler ``could qualify as a
beach book.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Wiggin, founder of aabalone((red)), a consulting and
marketing communications firm in Darien, Conn., sees vacation as a
badly timed interruption of work. In the old days, she says, she
would spin herself into a frenzy in the hours before V-Day, trying
to tie up all the loose ends at work and at home. Now she takes
what she calls the dot-com.mom vacation, which means scheduling her
family's departure 24 hours ahead of her own, then spending that
full day ``at warp speed,'' working virtually nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to cook, eat, answer the telephone or be
sociable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that ``every tiny bit of work is done'' means she can
put that work aside for a while, and on her most recent trip, a
family reunion in New Hampshire, she ``decided not to even plug in
the brand new rocket ship PowerBook from which I had hitherto been
inseparable.'' The dot-com.mom approach is effective, she cautions,
only if you apply it on the other end, too _ leaving vacation a day
before everyone else and spending 24 hours excavating your desk.
</P>
<P>
   I can't see that either of these solutions will work for us.
Wiggin's plan, for instance, requires a marriage in which only one
spouse has an over-enmeshed relationship with work.
</P>
<P>
   At our house we would spend so much time jockeying to be the one
who stayed home that I don't think we'd ever actually leave on our
trip. Because the disturbing fact is, neither of us really minds
taking some work along. The laptop doesn't mar our vacation so much
as it permits us to take one. If I could not have finished my book
on Block Island, I couldn't have gone to Block Island. How lovely,
then, that technology allows me to work in a hammock.

   HUFFINGTON-POLITICS (Los Angeles) _ Political insiders may
debate the motivations behind the latest evolutionary twist in the
remarkable life of Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington. This summer,
as the Democratic and Republican parties hold their national
conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, shadow conventions
will convene nearby, providing a running commentary and critique.
Conceived of by Huffington and the Internet impresario Peter
Hirshberg, the conventions' goal is to expose the ``empty
rhetoric'' of the two major parties and ``give voice to millions of
Americans currently shut out of the national debate.'' By Russ

&HT;     HOT-SELLING AUTHOR FROM THE RESERVATION NOT AT ALL RESERVED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At age 33, with two novels, two short-story
collections, nine books of poetry and a screenplay to his credit,
Sherman Alexie is not only one of America's hottest authors, he is
unique among Indian writers in having attained pop-culture fame.
There is a Sherman Alexie fan club. He has a Web site. Strangers
recognize him everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a peculiar thing,'' Alexie said. ``I think it's a
combination of being a writer and the movie (the 1998 independent
film 'Smoke Signals'), but being Indian has made me original and
eccentric enough to give me a level of recognition that's beyond
the actual number of books I sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, ``this is a camera-conscious culture, and I'm
good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie is wrapping up a 32-city national tour promoting ``The
Toughest Indian in the World'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, $24, 283
pages), his new, best-selling short-story collection.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie is a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene Indian, reared on the Spokane
Reservation, a handsome, robust athlete _ a shooting guard _ and
not afflicted with false modesty. ``I'm one of those players I used
to make fun of, but I'm still better than 90 percent of the players
on most (basketball) courts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indian-ness, in all its facets, is his subject. He goes at it
with energy, imagination, originality, irreverence and wit,
although _ and he admits it _ his efforts sometimes flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Toughest Indian in the World'' is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strongest stories are sure bets for ``Best of . .
.'' anthologies.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Saint Junior,'' an over-the-hill, overweight Indian
basketball player and his wife celebrate their unlikely but abiding
love story even as he tosses up air balls on a snow-packed outdoor
court.
</P>
<P>
   In the title story, an assimilated journalist surprises and
mystifies himself by having a sexual encounter with a bare-knuckled
Indian boxer who makes his living fighting the toughest fighters on
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   In ``One Good Man,'' which Alexie calls the best story he has
ever written, a young Indian man cares for his dying diabetic
father, whose feet have just been amputated.
</P>
<P>
   The two drive to Mexico, aiming to fulfill the father's dream of
removing himself from colonial America, but their car and the old
man's wheelchair break down just north of Tecate, and they can't
hitch a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ```Do you believe in God?' I asked my father.
</P>
<P>
   ```God has lots of potential,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ```When you pray,' I asked him, 'what do you pray about?'
</P>
<P>
   ```That's none of your business,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed. We waited for hours for somebody to help us. What
is an Indian? I lifted my father and carried him across every
border.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stories in the collection reach for profundity and fall
short (``The Sin Eaters'') or border on the juvenile (``Dear John
Wayne'').
</P>
<P>
   But all crackle with humor and irreverence, and they have bite.
Alexie does not romanticize ``the rez,'' nor Indian-ness per se.
(``It was Indian scouts who had helped white people kill Sitting
Bull, Geronimo, and every other Indian warrior in the world.'')
</P>
<P>
   He tells Indian secrets. In ``Class,'' he writes: ``Velma, my
dark-skinned mother, was overjoyed by my choice of mate. She'd
always wanted me to marry a white woman and beget half-breed
children who would beget quarter-bloods, and so on and so on, until
simple mathematics killed the Indian in us.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``One Good Man,'' the father offers this advice: ``Son, if
you're going to marry a white woman, then marry a rich one, because
those white-trash women are just Indians with bad haircuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie says he had a drinking problem from ages 18 to 23, and
alcohol is a significant factor in several of his stories. Summing
up the life histories of his siblings, the narrator of ``One Good
Man'' says ``we were teacher, truck driver, logger, accountant,
preacher and guitar player. Our biggest success: We were all alive.
Our biggest claim to fame: We were all sober.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no alcoholism in this book. All the Indians are sober
or never drink,'' he said. ``Most of the characters in my books
never drink or are recovering. Most people don't notice that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the critical acclaim for ``Smoke Signals,'' Alexie said
that the film is regarded as a business failure by the film
industry. It was made for $1 million and earned $8 million, but
despite the terrific profit margin, the numbers were too small to
impress the industry's major players, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So now ``I'm working on studio screenplays, getting lots of
money for movies I know they'll never make. . . . It provides me
with security,'' he said. As a practical matter, ``all the success
of 'Smoke Signals' has done is it's guaranteed me that I can get
meetings with people. That's not a small thing, but it hasn't
guaranteed me money to make another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie, who describes himself as ``a binge writer _ I work 12
and 14 hour days for weeks at a time, and then I don't work for
weeks at a time'' _ is at work on what he calls ``an urban novel''
about politics.
</P>
<P>
   He is hitting his stride. ``My vocation and my avocation is
writing. It's what I prefer to do above all else,'' he said.
``Publishing is nice, and I love the life, but if they stopped
publishing me tomorrow, I'd still be doing it. If I was bad at it,
I'd still do it.''

   NEW YORK _ Behind the landmark Judson Memorial Church, which
frames the sky south of Washington Square Park through its ornate
campanile, there is a quaint, if somewhat dilapidated, block of
mustard and red brick houses.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists say two historic treasures reside on this
unassuming Greenwich Village swath: a house where Edgar Allan Poe
once lived and a town house renovated by McKim, Mead &AMP; White.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the summer, the stretch of four-story to six-story
buildings on West Third Street between Thompson and Sullivan
Streets will most likely be gone.
</P>
<P>
   And, to the dismay of city preservationists and neighborhood
groups, it may be replaced by a 13-story building for the New York
University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Village and preservationists have long
criticized university construction projects that they considered to
be insensitive to the scale and historic character of the area, and
a handful of NYU projects under way this year had already added
fuel to residents' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But the law school's plan to erect a 13-story multipurpose
building on West Third Street, which preservationists argue will
eviscerate a part of the Village's heritage and replace it with a
tower that will obscure views of the Judson Church, has inflamed
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're transforming Washington Square and changing the
neighborhood's character by constructing buildings that are huge
and really unattractive,'' said Aubrey Lees, a member of the
Committee to Save Washington Square, a neighborhood group.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the city's leading preservation groups, like the
Municipal Arts Society and the Landmarks Conservancy, as well as
the Mystery Writers of America, have written to the law school,
pleading with administrators to reconsider their plans. And the
groups have tried to protect the buildings by seeking landmark
designations. But residents of the buildings have been told to be
out by July 31, and university officials said demolition could
begin posthaste.
</P>
<P>
   University administrators argue that the new buildings are
critical to the school's survival. ``These decisions we are making
are not window dressing,'' said John H. Beckman, a spokesman for
the university. ``They are part and parcel of a plan that began 30
years ago when NYU took a good hard look at itself and realized it
couldn't survive as a commuter school. What you're seeing now is a
latter part of that process.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sexton, dean of the law school, said the new building on
West Third Street will include needed faculty offices, classrooms
and student lounges. He said the school is reaching out to
neighbors to come up with a mutually acceptable plan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build a building that belongs in the neighborhood,
that looks good in the Village, and we will do so in consultation
with the community,'' Sexton said. ``But we do not accept the views
of preservationists who say nothing can ever change.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   NYU told its neighbors at community board meetings in December
that it would build on West Third Street, shortly after the law
school purchased the Judson House, a Greek Revival town house on
the corner of West Third and Thompson, from the Judson Church for
$3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Peter Laarman, senior minister of the church, said the house had
become a financial burden, costing about $17,000 a year to
maintain. The church sold the house to the university because the
law school promised to give the church space in the new building,
and to consult with congregants on the building's design. ``The
proposed structure maintains the open sky behind the church
itself,'' Laarman said, ``and it won't be a disaster by any
means.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In February, the university began meeting with neighborhood
groups and preservation advocates to discuss the project and
present design sketches. But many of the people who attended the
meetings said that the discussions began too late because officials
had already decided to tear down the historic structures.
</P>
<P>
   One of the buildings to be razed is the little red brick house
at 85 W. Third St., where Poe lived in 1844 and 1845.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1844, Poe moved into two rooms at the back of 85
Amity St., now West Third.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay there the American Review published his poem
``The Raven,'' to international acclaim. He also helped to start
and edit the Broadway Journal, a New Yorker of its day. And he
began writing one of his most noted short stories, ``The Cask of
Amontillado.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Poe lived close by several literary salons, like the Waverly
Place home of Anne Charlotte Lynch, who held soirees with guests
like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Herman Melville.
</P>
<P>
   Poe, who sometimes gave readings of his new works at such
gatherings, alienated himself from the Village literary crowd when
his unflattering portrayal of its members in ``The Literati of New
York'' was published in 1846. But by then he was ensconced in the
country, in the Bronx in a small cottage that would become a city
landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Some Poe scholars argue that the house on West Third Street is a
more important site. ``Scholars across this country have been
enormously anguished about losing this house,'' said Burton R.
Pollin, a professor emeritus of City University who has written 12
books on Poe.
</P>
<P>
   But New York University's resident Poe scholar, Kenneth
Silverman, who wrote ``Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-Ending
Remembrance'' (Harper Collins, 1991), said the house had been
significantly altered in the 154 years since Poe lived there.
</P>
<P>
   The lower exterior of the building, he said, only vaguely
resembles its 19th century counterpart, as the stoop was removed
and the entrance shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to have anyone go by there today and say, `Now, I
have an idea of how Edgar Allan Poe lived,''' Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said he ``finds it hard to take seriously any claims that
this building is special.'' He said he suspects preservationists
are using the Poe house as an excuse to halt construction.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other preservation groups, like the Society for the Architecture
of the City and the Landmarks Conservancy, have focused their
energies on saving the Judson House. Originally three separate
Greek Revival houses, the buildings were merged and redesigned in
the 1890s by McKim, Mead &AMP; White, which also designed the Judson
Church.
</P>
<P>
   David Garrard Lowe, an architectural historian who wrote
``Stanford White's New York'' (Watson-Guptill, 1992), said the
house is a perfect example of colonial revival, the architectural
style that the novelist Edith Wharton admired in her writings about
the Village.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Poe scholars asked the city's Landmarks
Preservation Commission to designate the Poe house as a landmark to
protect it from demolition, but after considering the
documentation, the agency declined to hold a hearing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, the New York state Office of Historic Preservation
announced that it had determined that the Judson House was eligible
for listing in the state and national registers of historic places.
But such a designation would not necessarily protect the house from
demolition.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said the architects of the new building, Kohn Pedersen
Fox, are still considering preservationists' concerns. ``But,'' he
added, ``the fact of the matter is that it is literally impossible
to maintain those buildings and go along with our program.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Third Street project is the second NYU building plan
that has chafed some university neighbors this year.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the school completed demolition of the modernist
Loeb Student Center, built in the 1950s on Washington Square South,
to make way for the Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for University
Life, designed by Kevin Roche, who has designed several recent
additions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The old student center, Beckman said, was an embarrassment
because it could not even accommodate half the students' requests
for club meeting spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighborhood groups fought Kimmel, which will be wider at
its base and at its top than its predecessor, but the same height.
One group, the Committee to Save Washington Square, filed suit in
New York Supreme Court to try to halt construction until the
university studied the impact it might have on the Village. The
case was dismissed and is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime neighborhood residents say the planning for the student
center has been reminiscent of that of a building across the street
_ the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, a red sandstone hulk on
Washington Square South. The library was built in the 1960s despite
widespread neighborhood protest.

<P>
   Construction has also irked some neighbors at Union Square,
where the university built a 14-story dormitory last year, and
where another 18-story dormitory is going up now.
</P>
<P>
   The chief complaint with all these projects has been that the
school does not adequately solicit neighborhood participation in
the planning process.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call us in after the process has gone beyond where they
can make substantial changes,'' said F. Anthony Zunino, president
of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.
Referring to West Third Street, he said: ``That whole street has
become institutionalized all the way from Broadway to the end of
the park, except this one block. They are destroying the scale of
the neighborhood every time they tear down part of the Village.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Washington Square neighborhood was first developed in
the 1830s it became fashionable for its Federal and Greek Revival
homes, most of them just a few stories high. The district had ``a
kind of established repose which is not of frequent occurrence in
the other quarters of the long, shrill city,'' wrote Henry James,
who grew up there, in his 1881 novel, ``Washington Square.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckman said that although the university has met with
neighborhood groups and preservation advocates, it is not required
to consult with its neighbors on the developments because the
construction is within legal zoning limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we had a desperate need for space, we did not seek
any variances so we could build higher,'' he said. ``We completely
understand that we live in a neighborhood which has an interest and
a stake in the architecture.''

   Q:.MDNM/ How many people attended the first Academy Awards show,
and was it broadcast? _ A.A., Stephenville, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ An audience of 250 attended the first awards
presentation for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on
May 26, 1929.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, which was brief and received little fanfare, was
held at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no big deal in 1929, even for the motion picture
community,'' UPI Hollywood reporter Vernon Scott writes. ``At that
time, the winners were known in advance of the banquets.''
</P>
<P>
   The event, which was not broadcast on radio until a year later,
was hosted by Douglas Fairbanks and director William C. de Mille.
The Best Picture award went to ``Wings,'' Best Actor to Emil
Jannings and Best Actress to Janet Gaynor.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can we get a tape of the song ``Barefoot Boy?'' _
J.H., Mineral Wells, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ That song is included on folk singer John McCutcheon's
1980 album, ``Barefoot Boy With Boots On,'' which was rereleased in
1998 and is currently in print.
</P>
<P>
   You can order it on CD directly from McCutcheon by calling (804)
977-6321 or visiting the Web site www.folkmusic.com.

   ``A Place for God: A Guide to Spiritual Retreats and Retreat
Centers'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Timothy Jones &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Image Books/Doubleday, $14.95'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are you looking for a place where you can have some down time,
away from cellphones, e-mails, work ... even friends and relatives?
Is your spirit weary? Then maybe what you need is a ``spiritual
vacation,'' as author Timothy Jones so aptly describes a sojourn in
a retreat center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Place for God'' is a useful guide to retreat centers across
the United States and Canada. More than 250 locations _ convents,
hermitages and spiritual guest houses _ are cataloged.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the book is devoted to an exploration of
retreat-taking, providing useful insights based on the author's
experiences. Is it right for me? How can I make it a meaningful
experience? How much will it cost?
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the book consists of listings of various centers,
divided by state. Each comes with pertinent information such as
e-mail addresses, religious affiliation, location, accommodation
and points of interest (some retreat houses offer gyms and gift
shops).
</P>
<P>
   Jones provides an excellent map and guide. Although many
listings indicate that people of all faiths are accepted, it's a
pity that he does not include a single non-Christian center _ and
there are dozens he could have selected. &QL;

   ``God of the Possible &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Gregory A. Boyd &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Baker, $12.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does God really know ``everything?'' Gregory A. Boyd's answer is
``no.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the stake ready yet. The Minnesota
minister-theologian makes an interesting _ and, most important,
Bible-based _ case for his views in ``God of the Possible.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the nature of the future? Is it settled and therefore
completely known by God? Or is it partly settled and partly open to
change (because it hasn't happened yet), and therefore not fully
knowable by anyone _ in the same way that a square circle is
intrinsically impossible?
</P>
<P>
   Boyd argues that the latter view _ the ``open view of God'' _
better fits a Bible that frequently speaks of the deity as changing
his mind, regretting a situation or being disappointed. The book
critiques the classical view, outlines the open view and considers
its practical effects, and works to answer objections and
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd has set himself a difficult task. But at the very least,
``God of the Possible'' competently sets forth his side and proves
that this theory is not biblically out of court from the
beginning. &QL;

&HT;     JUSTICES OFTEN AT ODDS WITH PRESIDENTS WHO APPOINT THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 23)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that Supreme Court appointments are an issue in
the presidential campaign, it is challenging to try to match recent
justices with the presidents who selected them.
</P>
<P>
   The results will prove surprising. When presidents and
presidential candidates vow that they will not subject prospective
justices to a ``litmus test'' on a highly volatile issue such as
abortion, they are perverting the truth.
</P>
<P>
   They know that when they begin considering Supreme Court
candidates, they will face tremendous pressure from liberal
feminists on one side and staunch conservatives on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 9 television interview, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson,
who is chairman of this year's Republican platform committee, said
that George W. Bush need not be bound by the platform declaration
that only anti-abortionists will be named to the federal judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a Catholic opponent of abortion, also pointed out that
a president is not committed to a position by the platform and
could select a pro-choice running mate. The field includes
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, New York Gov. George Pataki and New
Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush knows that he would incur the wrath of the right wing
if he were to pick a pro-choice individual as a running mate or a
nominee to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Democrats. Al Gore would bring the wrath of
pro-choice liberals down on his head if he were to nominate an
anti-abortion person to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years we have heard a great deal about the kinds of
individuals who should be named to the nation's highest tribunal.
We, therefore, have anticipated that a resolutely conservative
president, like Ronald Reagan, would appoint only those who shared
his ideology while a more liberal president, such as Bill Clinton,
would pluck justices from the ranks of his philosophical allies.
</P>
<P>
   Let us look at the current crop of justices and some from the
past to see if we can match them with the presidents who nominated
them.
</P>
<P>
   The three most consistently conservative members of the current
court are Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice William
Rehnquist. It would seem logical to believe that all three were
elevated to the high court by Reagan, the most consistently
conservative president of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But that judgment would be incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Scalia was nominated by Reagan. Thomas, however,
was named by a moderate conservative, George Bush, father of the
current GOP presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist was appointed by Richard Nixon and promoted to chief
justice by Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Who then nominated David Souter and John Paul Stevens, both of
whom are considered to be liberal justices? Was it Lyndon Johnson,
John Kennedy or Jimmy Carter?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: None of the above. Souter was chosen by the same
George Bush who selected Thomas. Stevens was named not by a liberal
Democrat but by a moderately conservative Republican, Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor, who are regarded as
``swing votes,'' joining the conservatives on some issues and the
liberals on others, were named to the Supreme Court by Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, key members of the
court's liberal bloc, are more easily identified with the president
who chose them: Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A president may vow to appoint only individuals with whom he is
philosophically compatible. But a president may not know the basic
ideology or the degree of independence of a judicial candidate he
nominates for confirmation by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Senate has approved the president's choice and the
justice has begun a lifetime tenure on the court, there is nothing
the president can do to control the way that justice votes on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three justices appointed by Theodore Roosevelt, the
president expressed repeated exasperation with Oliver Wendell
Holmes Jr., one of the truly great justices of all time. The reason
was that Holmes sometimes voted against Roosevelt's position on
critical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson, a visionary progressive, named three justices,
two of whom were at opposite ends of the political spectrum. One
was the brilliant Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish member of the
court and a giant among justices. Another was James C. McReynolds,
a vehement anti-Semite and political reactionary.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Justices and Presidents,'' Henry J. Abraham wrote
that ``McReynolds, continuing to manifest his violent temper and
abrasive nature on the bench, not only became a member of the
anti-New-Deal Four Horsemen; he turned into their loudest, most
cantankerous, sarcastic, aggressive, intemperate and reactionary
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the memorable lines of Dwight D. Eisenhower was that he
had made two mistakes as president and ``both are on the Supreme
Court.'' His reference was to Chief Justice Earl Warren and
Associate Justice William Brennan, who in the eyes of other court
observers, are among the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Constitution became the law of the land in 1789,
successive justices have sought to adjust its dictates to new
generations of Americans. Sometimes they succeed, and sometimes
they fail.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for a president to become disenchanted with a
justice he has nominated. With independence and life tenure,
justices are free to move in any direction they choose.

 &HT;    Career as a Las Vegas blackjack dealer hard way to make an easy
living
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ She's standing at a blackjack table at The Mirage
Hotel, expertly dealing the cards and chatting with patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Her name tag reads ``Nancy'' and ``Dayton, Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want customers to know where we're from because it's an
icebreaker,'' explains Nancy Potasky Stein, who's been a Las Vegas
dealer 16 years. ``It gives them a chance to say they're also from
Dayton or Columbus or Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in tuxedo shirt and bow tie, short black skirt and
teal-and-black vest decorated with a palm-tree design, Stein has
worked her way up to the top of a profession she calls fun and
exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard way to make an easy living,'' Stein says. ``I like
it because it's a people job.''
</P>
<P>
   That's obvious on this particular morning as a patron steers her
wheelchair up to Stein's table.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know my mother passed away,'' the woman confides as Stein
begins to deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a local who always came in with her mother,'' says Stein
later. ``I knew right away when I didn't see her mother that
something was wrong. I have a lot of repeat customers; you get to
know their whole life stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Her clients come from around the world and speak a variety of
languages. Her workplace is one of the strip's most elaborate
hotels, housing novelties ranging from Siegfried and Roy's gorgeous
snow-white leopards and white tigers to a ``live volcano'' that
erupts every half hour.
</P>
<P>
   On her way to work, she passes live dolphins and sharks, a
tropical rain forest, palm trees and loads of orchids.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as glamorous as it might appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stand on your feet all day and sometimes you have to put
up with obnoxious people,'' Stein says. ``But, overall, people are
basically nice _they're out having a good time, they're on
vacation, they're relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   So how did a local girl end up cutting the chips in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   It all started when her dad opened an auto painting shop in Las
Vegas and his daughter began accompanying him to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I might want to be a dealer,'' said Stein, then 24,
who had attended the University of Tampa and always worshipped the
sun. ``I had never picked up a deck of cards in my life!
</P>
<P>
   ``My father had a friend who had a dealers' school and he said
you could earn a good living,'' she remembers. Today, according to
Stein, dealers earn between $20,000 and $80,000, primarily in tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually paid just minimum wage,'' Stein explains,
adding that dealers prefer the type of tip in which the player
makes a bet for the dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dealer might average between $120-$160 a day in tips plus
their salary,'' says Stein, who deals in two areas _ a low limit
$5,000 pit and a high limit ($5,000-$10,000) pit on weekends. Stein
works six hours a day, with 20 -minute breaks each hour.
</P>
<P>
   Employee cafeterias provide another perk: Casino employees eat
whatever they like free of charge when they're on duty. There are
also complimentary tickets to shows to be had.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, who has always dealt blackjack_ the nation's most popular
casino game _ says dealing isn't as easy as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You practice by pitching cards into a hat for hours,'' she
says. ``You learn to deal out of a shoe, how to cut the chips, what
the payoffs are.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dealing had traditionally been a man's profession, by the
time Stein attended dealers' school, women were dealing as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all by myself, scared but excited,'' she recalls.
``Everyone said I'd be back in Dayton in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   After completing the course, neophyte dealers get their feet wet
by working at downtown casinos as apprentices, then move to the
strip.
</P>
<P>
   Stein practiced at El Cortez, then went to the Horseshoe .
</P>
<P>
   ``Every casino has a different costume,'' says Stein. ``At the
Horseshoe, we wore jeans and a bolero and cowboy boots.'' She
worked her way up to the Golden Nugget, the old MGM, then moved to
the prestigious Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you're interviewed by the casino manager, other
times you are auditioned _ they watch you deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein suffered a temporary setback at the age of 30 when she was
diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a fighter,'' she says. ``I kept my apartment here but
went back to Dayton for the chemo and radiation.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits her dad with encouraging her to become a dealer when
she expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll earn a good living and meet a nice Jewish boy,'' he
assured her.
</P>
<P>
   Both predictions have come true. At 43, Stein met and married
Howard Stein, a pit boss at the Bellagio hotel. It was a first
marriage for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to get married but I was very picky,'' says
Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Stein says his wife is an excellent dealer who's lots of
fun, always upbeat and brings out the best in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of dealers out here who are stone-faced and
don't talk, and you might as well go to a machine!'' he says.
``When you gamble most people lose money because that's what Las
Vegas is built on. People aren't exactly happy when they lose but
the hurt isn't so bad when you're with Nancy because you're having
fun. She gets everybody involved _ the people at the table are all
interacting with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein says Las Vegas has changed dramatically since she arrived
20 years ago. Then, she says, the town was known for cheap
all-you-can-eat buffets; today, gourmet restaurants abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all the concerts come here now,'' Stein says. ``Las Vegas
is a good value for a vacation and now people bring their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite Las Vegas acts currently include ``O,'' a Cirque du
Soleil show performed on a stage of water at the Bellagio;
impersonator Danny Gans, who performs at The Mirage, and
``Mystere,'' another Cirque show at Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   Any gambling advice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Come knowing that gambling is for entertainment only,'' she
advises. ``Come to have a good time. Pick up a strategy card if
you're a novice ... it will tell you when to split, when to double
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't spend more than you can afford to lose.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Running late at rush hour, the actor Vincent Pastore
can't resist regressing to a part he played in real life _ limo
driver _ before landing his Hamlet, the plum role of Sal ``Big
Pussy'' Bompensiero. You know, the cuddly cat burglar/hit man/mob
informer who came to a briny end this season, sent to sleep with
the fishes by his best friend, Tony, on the HBO cult hit ``The
Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunched behind the wheel of his new Saturn (``I don't drive no
Mercedes-Benz,'' he protests later), Pastore takes a sure-fire
short cut that according to his sidekick, Charlie Sammarco _ along
as a security blanket _ lands them north when they want to go south
and costs them 20 minutes in motionless Ninth Avenue traffic. Good
thing you quit your day job, Mr. Pastore.
</P>
<P>
   To make a late actor even later, next come a half-dozen
interruptions between the parking lot and Pastore's hangout, the
West Bank Cafe, as pedestrians recognize the chunky guy behind the
shades and pay their respects: ``Hey, Puss!''
</P>
<P>
   Sammarco, who grew up with Pastore in New Rochelle, N.Y. (where,
they say, their fathers longed for the Mafiosi lifestyle but were
nailed to the norm by their mothers) and like him saluted a midlife
crisis by quitting the daily grind to be an actor, divulges the
tale of their tardiness while Pastore exchanges bear hugs in the
restaurant doorway.
</P>
<P>
   That performance a wrap, he sails past his usual corner spot:
``It's Danny Aiello's table, but they seat me there now, too,'' he
announces. His great mission was becoming ``the next Danny
Aiello,'' and with table treatment like this, he must be making
headway. Or was, until Tony and company tossed him overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Right until he hit his mark for his death scene, Pastore was in
denial about the decision by the creator of ``The Sopranos,'' David
Chase, to revoke Big Pussy's family privileges and Pastore's weekly
paycheck, his best and biggest since he gave up running a nightclub
to become an actor at 42.
</P>
<P>
   Settling into the remote corner he's deemed appropriate for a
post-death interview, he orders iced tea and a trio of shrimp
cocktails, bolts down his carbo-blockers (he's trying to shrink
back to 220 from 250), rattles off a list of his future films (in
one he diversifies and plays a priest!), then turns vulnerable. For
the moment, he's unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous about your future?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're my psychologist, I'm probably telling you I'm
thinking I'm off the show because my work wasn't good enough,'' he
confesses. He learned his days were numbered in a
good-news-bad-news call from Chase. The good news? Big Pussy would
have a banner season. The bad news? It would be his last. Once Big
Pussy became a rat, Pastore, an observer of gangster etiquette,
knew what came next: extermination.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the wishful thinker (and occasional playwright)
from inventing alternative story lines, most ``a little General
Hospital-ish,'' but take it from Pastore, it's no fun being dead at
53-ish.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, HBO still provides invitations to premieres, like one for
the drama ``Oz'' (``It's not my premiere, so I can be late to it,''
he says, glumly, over steak and steamed broccoli). But there's no
getting around that orphaned feeling: ``Everyone knows me as Pussy,
but the fact is, I'm not a Soprano anymore. Thank God for
unemployment and residuals. `The Sopranos' was my lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   As a kid in working-class New Rochelle, Pastore lived above an
Italian social club (but not Mafia, he says), where his father was
not just a member, but the custodian. After school, Pastore helped
clean the bar and the card room, and after getting out of the Navy
and dropping out of Pace University (major: dramatic arts), he
parlayed his experience tending bar into club ownership in New
Rochelle. He also honed his theater experience _ at the Blessed
Sacrament Community Theater. Lots of musicals. The gangster roles
came later.
</P>
<P>
   From 1980 to 1985, he ran the Crazy Horse Cafe there, but the
late hours and the liquor took a toll. With his marriage and his
business in meltdown, Pastore opted out of both and moved to
Brooklyn to start acting. ``I felt like a failure, but we all hit
walls.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept hitting them for the next six years. First Pastore drove
trucks, then limousines. He was delivering an advertising handout
when he fell for City Island, and eventually moved there, thanks to
his ``Sopranos'' income. (Lately he has gone bicoastal, the better
to find acting jobs; this week, he is in Los Angeles for the
primetime Emmy nominations Thursday, just in case.)
</P>
<P>
   Hired as an extra on films, he became known as ``the upgrade
king'' because, starting with ``Carlito's Way,'' he ad-libbed
himself into bit parts. The parts got bigger. So did he: He
ballooned 30 pounds to play Angelo Ruggerio in ``Gotti.'' Now he's
losing the pounds and maybe the mobster tag.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the Mafia, it's hedge time: He doesn't recommend the
lifestyle, but since it's an indirect provider of his lifestyle,
don't ask him to take potshots. Besides, he's kind of connected,
says he can't go anyplace _ not even backstage at Springsteen _
without bumping into somebody from the five families. ``They, uh,
always want to meet you if you've played somebody they know.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the acting career ``folds up,'' as he puts it? Pastore,
whose 90-year-old father still lives in New Rochelle, believes that
you can go home again. ``I can always go back into the club
business. Maybe we'll call it Big Pussy's.''

   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)

<P>
   PEACE-TALKS (Thurmont, Md.) _ President Clinton, delaying his
departure for an economic summit in Japan, meets with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in an effort to salvage the Middle East peace
talks. But There are indications that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has decided to stop the talks and return home. By GREG
McDONALD.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JAPAN (Washington) _ President Clinton`s decision to cut
short a planned Trip to Japan and stay on at the Camp David peace
talks will bolster impressions that the administration does not
take its Asian ally seriously, Japan watchers say. And by shuffling
his schedule, Clinton is doing little to help the political
fortunes of his Japanese host, embattled Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori. By DAVID IVANOVICH.
</P>
<P>
   DISABILITIES-SURVEY (Washington) _ Nearly 10 years after the
signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a survey shows that
the disabled continue to lag behind the rest of society in
employment, income and access to health care. The act, signed July
26, 1990, by former President George Bush, banned discrimination
against such people. By MARK HELM.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-IMMIGRANTS (Washington) _ Major Hispanic groups voice
frustration with Congress' focus on legislation to bring more
high-tech foreign workers into the country. Unless Republican
leaders do more for immigrants already here, the GOP will be
targeted at the polls this year by Latino voters, the Hispanic
organizations warn. By JUDY HOLLAND.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS (``p'' category)
</P>
<P>
   GOP-CHOICE (Washington) _ Republican pro-choice advocates secure
a promise from Republican Platform Committee Chairman Tommy
Thompson that he will consider allowing open discussion as
committee members write the abortion plank at the GOP convention.
Pro-choice Republicans say they will fight to change the party's
plank opposing any abortion, but conservatives say their chances
are nil. By DAN FREEDMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   HELEN-THOMAS (Washington) _ President Clinton, unlike some of
his predecessors, is savoring his last months in office. The
president doesn't rage against the dying light. Instead, he's ever
more nostalgic about his waning tenure in the White House. He has
often said that ``even the bad days are good'' in the presidency _
and he quips that he has had his share of bad days. By HELEN
THOMAS. (Already filed.)
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)
</P>
<P>
   PRIVACY-ADVISER (Washington) _ The trail that led Peter Swire to
the White House as President Clinton's chief adviser on privacy
matters began in the 1970s when he worked the computers at his
family's furniture stores in Albany, N.Y. There amid the La-Z-Boy
recliners and living room sets, he was inspired when his father,
Bill Swire, charged headlong into the computer era. By DAN
FREEDMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ Now that Supreme Court
appointments are an issue in the campaign, we should recall a
lesson from history: It is not unusual for a president to become
disenchanted with a Supreme Court justice he has nominated for the
high bench. With independence and life tenure, justices are free to
move in any direction they choose. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Already
filed.)

   Fred Mouawad is chief executive of Mondera.com, an Internet company

 By FRED MOUAWAD   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An hourglass sits on my desk. It symbolizes my extreme
sensitivity to time. I like to pit myself against the clock to see
how fast I can complete a task or project. I've been called a speed
fiend. I own a Ferrari and a Porsche back in Geneva where the speed
limits are higher.
</P>
<P>
   I enjoy outdoor sports like trial biking, a kind of motocross. I
also jet ski and scuba dive. My mother disapproves of my choices in
sports. She always worries whether I'll return in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, my family spent three weeks every summer on a
yacht sailing the Mediterranean. Once, I finished reading all the
books I brought on board in one week. I did not want to play
Monopoly with my brothers. I found it boring. I made my father
redirect the yacht to the nearest island so I could stock up on
more books. I have been reading self-improvement and business books
since I was 13. I suppose I'm not much fun to be with on vacations.
</P>
<P>
   I was born in Lebanon but constantly traveled because of my
parents. At the age of 6, I started attending boarding school in
Geneva. My brothers soon joined me. Our mother called us every
other day, more so than anyone else's parents. It was embarrassing.
One day she would be in Paris, then Riyadh, then Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   I studied business administration at Pepperdine University, but
I couldn't wait to own my own business. In my sophomore year I
bought a local travel agency and tried to produce a low-budget
movie. The agency took off, but the writer never finished the
script for the movie. I knew I had to improve my success rate.
</P>
<P>
   After school I sold off the agency and went to work for my
father. I come from four generations of jewelers. My first
assignment was to manage our Thailand operations where we
manufactured jewelry. I enjoyed the autonomy of managing 215 people
until my father came into town.
</P>
<P>
   Family businesses are a real challenge. I made changes to the
organization that my father vetoed. I had to learn to manage my
emotions around him. I also knew then that I would break away from
the family business.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Harvard Business School but left after a year to start
a venture capital firm. I went back to trading gems, this time over
the Web. I still have more than 120 Web designers working for me in
Bangkok. Soon afterward, I also opened a pizza chain in India and a
coffee chain in Thailand. My venture capital fund also invested in
pharmacy chains in Argentina and in other e-commerce ventures in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   My brother Paschal and I founded Mondera in Manhattan. We
thought: Where better to locate it than in the diamond district of
the world's fastest city? Being on the Internet is a never-ending
race against time. I work 16-hour days and sleep six hours a night.
I sleep in on weekends. My friends constantly remind me to slow
down.
</P>
<P>
   During a charity auction at Cannes last May, I had bid on a
massage by Heidi Klum, the model. I was up against James Caan and
Kenneth Branagh. I was the last remaining bidder at $31,000. I
intend to redeem my prize. I simply need to make the time.

GENS X AND WHY COLLECT FOR FUN AND PROFIT

 By JANE RINZLER BUCKINGHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Generations of kids have collected baseball cards and comic
books. Today's Gen Xers and Whyers have branched out.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people take collecting very seriously. They're not
just in it for fun.
</P>
<P>
   As an avid 16-year-old Swatch collector told an interviewer for
my company, Youth Intelligence, ``I don't even wear the watches,
but I know they'll be worth money some day, and that's why I buy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, collecting supports the need to be viewed as an
individual that pervades so many of this generation's activities.
Young people love things that make them feel special and unique. As
a 14-year-old collector of vintage bowling shirts explained, ``All
my friends look the same and dress the same For me, my shirts are
totally special and no one else can buy one like it. It says a lot
about me.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are these savvy collectors saving? Here are some of the
things that are hot.
</P>
<P>
   BEANIE BABIES
</P>
<P>
   What started as a cuddly toy has become a hot commodity. Today,
Beanies can be bought at auction on eBay and ``collecting'' them
has turned childhood fun into a serious preoccupation. As one savvy
12-year-old New York collector told Youth Intelligence, ``I think
if I just had all these stuffed animals it would seem kind of
babyish, but I'm getting them so I have a complete collection. I
don't play with them, but I know all their names and how much each
one is worth.''
</P>
<P>
   CONCERT TEES
</P>
<P>
   Think Bay City Rollers rather than Backstreet Boys. Young people
are enthralled by 1970s music. But unlike other hoarding hobbyists,
those who are grabbing the T-shirts are actually wearing them. As
one 21-year-old from Los Angeles explained, ``I think music in the
past was more real, more legit. When you wear an old shirt from a
concert you're really connecting with the past and rejecting some
of the commercial music of today.''
</P>
<P>
   HALSTON/PUCCI/GUCCI/VALENTINO
</P>
<P>
   Designers _ and designs _ of the 1970s are also all the rage,
from handbags to halter tops. Young people want anything that seems
to have a history. A 26-year-old from Los Angeles commented, ``I
think collecting clothes is cool. There's so much disposable
fashion these days but you know that designers like Halston or
Gucci are still so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   WATCHES
</P>
<P>
   These days, time is more precious than ever, so it should be no
surprise that watches are treasured. From vintage Hamiltons and Tag
Heures to more modern Swatches and even Casio G shocks, watches are
ones to watch. Some trendsetters are even donning multiple watches
_ partly because they like to collect them and partly as a fashion
statement.
</P>
<P>
   LUNCH BOXES

   With pictures of everything from the Dukes of Hazard to Smurfs,
lunch boxes are the hottest portables to stockpile. As one
18-year-old devotee from Chicago explained, ``I suppose part of it
is I wish I had the days of having my mom pack a lunch I mean that
never happened but it just seems like a part of childhood I totally
missed out on.'' More practical collectors suggest otherwise. As
one said, ``Lunch boxes are super durable and really reflect our
culture.''

   The kitty character just won't disappear. Her more serious
sisters (Princess Mononoko and countless others) may be bought as
kitsch now but may be keepers for later. As one 19-year-old Kitty
collector from Austin, Texas explained, ``Anime is the future of
animation, and I think it will change a lot over the next 20 years.
In the future people will be really interested to see how it all
started, so I find comic books or things on the Internet that I can
buy and keep.''

   These high-priced high heels seem to be selling like they were
already in limited supply. Women gush about how gorgeous they are
and will look for any excuse to buy just one more pair. But whether
you consider them overpriced or even gaudy, their craftsmanship is
undeniable, and 20 years from now, our bet is that teenaged girls
will scrounge in their grandmas' closets hoping to find a pair of
these shoes, even if they don't fit.

GOVERNING LABOR PARTY AGAIN TARGET OF INFORMATION LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For the second time this week, a damaging memo from
Prime Minister Tony Blair's inner circle has been leaked to major
newspapers and caused acute embarrassment to his government as it
struggles to keep its once-high popular appeal from continuing its
present swoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current situation is serious,'' said the confidential
message published Wednesday and written by Philip Gould, the
government's pollster. ``The New Labor brand has been badly
contaminated. It is the object of constant criticism and, even
worse, ridicule.''
</P>
<P>
   The note echoed many of the concerns raised in a secret memo
written by Blair that found its way into newspapers Monday. That
message, composed on the prime minister's own computer, reflected
his anxiety that New Labor, as he calls the party he recast from
its old socialist model, was losing touch with ordinary voters and
was failing to persuade them that it shared their worries over
crime, the family, defense and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   The first leak caused distress at 10 Downing St. because it
portrayed Blair as a politician consumed with short-term popularity
gains rather than as a reformer with a long-range vision, the image
he and his handlers like to put forward.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's disclosure upset Labor strategists because of its
timing, coming right after Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the
exchequer, announced a $65 billion cash injection into public
services intended to put the Conservatives on the defensive as
attention focuses on the national election expected next year.
Newspapers changed their front pages late Tuesday night to
accommodate the leaked story and subordinated the coverage of the
new investments, Labor's first good news in months.
</P>
<P>
   In his own leaked message, dated April 29, Blair complained that
the government was perceived as weak on crime, asylum seekers,
defense and family issues. ``It is bizarre that any government I
head should be seen as anti-family,'' said the prime minister,
whose wife, Cherie, was eight months pregnant at the time with the
couple's fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government _ and this even applies to me _ are somehow out
of touch with gut British instincts,''he wrote. He called for a
series of tough ``eye-catching initiatives,'' concluding, ``I
should be personally associated with as much of this as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould's memo, written in May, said: ``The government has been
drifting and growing almost monthly weaker and more diffuse. Above
all else, I have a sense of a government which started with great
strength but has seen that strength ebb away and erode as the
months and years have passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair has asked Sir Richard Wilson, the Cabinet secretary, to
try to find the source of the leaks. Scotland Yard detectives can
be called in if a serious suspect emerges, but past investigations
of this kind have proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the memos were given to the chief political
correspondents of The Times of London, a major broadsheet, and The
Sun, the best-selling daily tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Blair government has been dogged by six other leaks in the
past three months. They ranged from an internal note from Britain's
ambassador to Japan to Foreign Secretary Robin Cook about Britain
and European monetary union to a request from Blair to his staff
researchers for ``killer facts'' he could use to defeat the
Conservative leader, William Hague, in the weekly Prime Minister's
Questions debate in parliament. They also included two other Philip
Gould strategy warnings about Labor's losing ground to the Tories
on populist issues like law and order and the handling of asylum
seekers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All the leaks have benefited the Conservatives, and Labor
officials accused the party of being behind the disclosures. But
the Conservatives' chairman, Michael Ancram, said he believed they
were being orchestrated by dissidents within the government. ``This
latest leak is a further indication of the bitter internal war that
is raging in the heart of the Labor government,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the past months, Blair has seen the 20-point lead his
government steadily held over the Conservatives since coming to
power in 1997 fade to single digits. The most recent canvas, an ICM
poll published in The Guardian newspaper on Tuesday, showed Labor
only seven points ahead of the Tories, and Gould's memo predicted
it could soon go down to five.
</P>
<P>
   While those figures are worrisome to the government in light of
how recently they had been much more favorable, they still reflect
a higher popularity rating for the Blair government than any
British government has ever recorded after three years in office.
Labor gained a majority of 179 seats in parliament in the May 1997
election, and its current poll numbers would still translate into a
comfortable majority of 127.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, 50, is one member of the five-man group associated with
the creation of New Labor that also includes Blair; Brown; Peter
Mandelson, now the Northern Ireland secretary; and Alastair
Campbell, the prime minister's chief spokesman. He is a former
advertising man who was brought into the party in 1985 by
Mandelson, then the communications director, to equip it with
modern marketing and media techniques and give it a brand
identification that would be acceptable to the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly tracks attitudes through his focus groups that aim
to find out what people think in greater depth than opinion polls
do. He distills their comments into the phrases used to guide
strategists in coming up with policies that respond to public mood.
Critics of New Labor have complained that this approach favors
image over substance, and that the public has consequently lost
faith in the party as one without any convictions of its own.

&HT;     WEAPONS INSPECTOR BECOMES A CRUSADER FOR ENDING IRAQ
SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN WECHSLER  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELMAR, N.Y. _ It has been more than two years since Scott
Ritter walked away from his job as chief of a U.N. weapons
inspection team in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left, he spent a good part of a decade in that
country, sometimes standing toe-to-toe with angry high-ranking
Iraqi army officers refusing to show him what he wanted to see,
sometimes with automatic rifles pointed at him, held by a shaky
Iraqi soldier with his finger on the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 39-year-old former Marine is worlds away from that
life. Now actively campaigning against sanctions because he
believes Iraq is no longer a threat, Ritter recently moved his
family from Hastings-on-Hudson in suburban New York to a two-story
colonial in the Albany suburb of Delmar. There, he hopes to put
down roots for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest decision he's recently faced was what color to paint
the living-room wall (they settled on ``ripe-corn yellow,'' which
reminded his Georgian wife Marina of her East European home). On
Saturday, he spent the evening with friends to celebrate his
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But two years after he left Iraq, Ritter is poised to go back.
This time, it will be with the blessing of the Iraqi government.
Though Ritter was once accused by Iraq of spying _ ``falsifying
facts'' and ``inventing lies,'' the Iraqis said _ he is now welcome
there, as his mission has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking for hidden weapons, Ritter wants to show the
world (and the United States in particular) that the United Nations
sanctions against Iraq are doing much harm and little good.
</P>
<P>
   The trade blockade, he says, has caused the death of 1.5 million
Iraqi citizens and done nothing to bring an end to Saddam Hussein's
reign. Ritter hopes to film a documentary in Iraq showing that,
from a military perspective, the country no longer has the
technology to make weapons of mass destruction and, therefor, is no
longer a threat to anyone but its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think sanctions are a horrible tool,'' said
Ritter, author of ``Endgame: Solving the Iraq Problem Once and For
All,'' and a frequent speaker on college campuses and on National
Public Radio. ``I don't think my country should be carrying out a
policy that kills 500,000 children (from malnutrition and lack of
medical care). And that's what we're doing today.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his background, Ritter seems like the last person who
would be pushing for an end to the sanctions that have crippled
this Middle Eastern country.
</P>
<P>
   The product of a military family, he spent his childhood moving
from Michigan to Hawaii to Turkey to Germany. After graduating from
Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., he joined the
Marines and eventually became a weapons inspector in the Soviet
Union, where he also met his wife.
</P>
<P>
   When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, Ritter went to Saudi Arabia to
help determine where Iraq was hiding its SCUD missiles. His team of
Marines had no luck finding the elusive weapons, but that didn't
keep the U.N. from hiring Ritter, at war's end, to lead a weapons
inspection team specializing in concealment.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be an easy job. One time, when Ritter and his team
drove through a checkpoint to inspect a Baghdad facility, a jittery
Iraqi soldier panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jumped out, cocked his weapon and pointed it at me,''
Ritter recalled. ``The only thing that saved me was an Iraqi
colonel who jumped out and stood in front of me. I owe my life to
that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But spending up to 220 days in Iraq each year gave Ritter a
perspective he could not get from his U.N. office in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize they're human beings,'' he said. ``Iraqis are
wonderful people. They have a great culture and a lot of history.
Unfortunately, they're ruled by a brutal dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Ritter says his inspections revealed evidence
that Iraq had made both chemical and biological weapons before the
Gulf War. But the weapons themselves were ruined, destroyed either
during the war or by the Iraqis themselves when it was clear they
were losing.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, Ritter said he has found no viable weapons, which is
not to say the Iraqis haven't tried to get some. It was also clear,
Ritter said, that weapons inspectors were being used by the CIA and
the military to get information about Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter left his job Aug. 26, 1998. In December, Iraq threw all
arms inspectors out of the country.

GOVERNING LABOR PARTY AGAIN TARGET OF INFORMATION LEAKS

how recently they had been much more favorable, they still reflect
a higher popularity rating for the Blair government than any
British government has ever recorded after three years in office.
Labor gained a majority of 179 seats in parliament in the May 1997
election, and its current poll numbers would still translate into a
comfortable majority of 127.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, 50, is one member of the five-man group associated with
the creation of New Labor that also includes Blair; Brown; Peter
Mandelson, now the Northern Ireland secretary; and Alastair
Campbell, the prime minister's chief spokesman. He is a former
advertising man who was brought into the party in 1985 by
Mandelson, then the communications director, to equip it with
modern marketing and media techniques and give it a brand
identification that would be acceptable to the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly tracks attitudes through his focus groups that aim
to find out what people think in greater depth than opinion polls
do. He distills their comments into the phrases used to guide
strategists in coming up with policies that respond to public mood.
Critics of New Labor have complained that this approach favors
image over substance, and that the public has consequently lost
faith in the party as one without any convictions of its own.

KNUCKLING DOWN IN THE WORLD OF MARBLES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Md., N.J.)  (Circuits)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marvin George plays for fair.
</P>
<P>
   George, a soft-spoken postal worker from Bridgeport, W.Va.,
reasons that the youth of West Virginia would be well served if
they played more marbles and if their parents and teachers held
more marble tournaments. A dozen years ago, when his daughter won a
local tournament, he began to talk teachers and principals into
sponsoring local events. As executive director of the West Virginia
Marble Shooters Association, he now runs two statewide tournaments,
one for children 14 and under and one for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't play for keeps in our tournament,'' George said. ``We
provide the marbles to our kids and we play for points.'' The
winners get scholarships up to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   George's marble site, www.marbles.net, gives the rules of
Ringer, the most popular tournament marbles game, and leads to his
two tournaments and a third one in Maryland. The Mountaineer
Marbles Tournament, for children only, was held last week in
Beckley, W.Va. George has sponsored eventual champions in the
National Marbles Tournament (www.blocksite.com/wildwood), a
77-year-old event held in Wildwood, N.J., each Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia was the center of U.S. marble making during this
country's golden age of marbles, roughly 1920 to 1960. Those days
are gone. Next door to George's town, in Clarksburg, the police
routinely shoo away or arrest entrepreneurs and collectors who try
to sneak onto the torn-up former factory floor of the Akro Agate
Co., looking in old drainpipes and digging around the grounds for
corkscrews and Popeyes and sparklers and fluorescents (from uranium
salts) and other rare marble varieties. Akro Agate closed in 1951
and the building was razed three years ago. Asia and Mexico have
taken over machine-made marbles, and today there are only a handful
of U.S. marble companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer children play marbles today, even in West Virginia, than
during the golden age, George acknowledged. ``The experts say it's
because of television and Little League and different organized
sports,'' he said. ``It's my belief it's because adults don't want
to organize tournaments anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But marbles have had a curious resurgence caused in part by the
Internet. Colorful Web sites have spurred interest in marble
collecting, and the Internet is full of advertisements. The
collecting interest, in turn, has led to specialty marble making
and to a pickup in organized marble tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The two worlds of marbles, playing and collecting, are both
represented at MarbleCollecting.com (www.blocksite.com), whose
operator, Robert Block, writes about marbles and holds online
marble auctions. Its reference section includes lists and links to
rules for different games, major tournaments, a Frequently Asked
Questions page with the history of marbles, a bibliography and an
archive of articles from the Marble Mania newsletter. There are
sections on marble auctions, shows, local clubs, bulletin boards
and membership information for the Marble Collectors Society of
America.
</P>
<P>
   On the site, you learn that marbles have been found in Egyptian
tombs and North American Indian mounds, and that William Blake
painted three boys playing marbles for his poem ``The Schoolboy.''
You can also learn how to make a marble by hand, which, the site
says, is now being done by 50 U.S. artisans.
</P>
<P>
   The sites reveal marbles' fascinating contributions to the
American language. Steelies. Cat's eyes. Aggies. No histing. No
hunching, either. Playing for keeps and playing for fair. Slipses.
And remember to knuckle down. Besides Akro Agate's varieties, there
are the classics made by Marble King of Peyden City, W.Va. _
Bumblebees and Wasps and Rainbows and Spider-Men and Tigers and
Green Hornets. Not to mention Swirls, Peerless Patches, Christmas
Trees and Golden Rebels by Peltier Glass Co. of Ottawa, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   George isn't particularly interested in promoting marble dealers
or marble shows at his tournaments, although he is grateful to them
for promoting interest in the game. ``The two worlds don't really
mix,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids, especially the elementary school kids, they need to know
about winning and losing and what it's like to lose, and what it's
like to practice.''

&HT;     JUDGE CRITICIZES BONUS PROGRAM FOR CUSTOMS AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge has knocked more than two years
off a drug smuggler's sentence and sent him home to Australia
because U.S. customs agents who worked on his case in San Francisco
got cash bonuses from the government for drug seizures.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker first denounced the bonus
program in a 1998 ruling, saying it created ``perverse law
enforcement incentives'' for unreasonable searches and detentions.
</P>
<P>
   In the new ruling, made public Tuesday, Walker was particularly
concerned that the program had not been disclosed to Michael Wayne
Sanderson's attorney until after his trial and conviction in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That information ``would have been another arrow in (the
defense's) quiver during plea negotiations'' and for trying to
discredit the agents' testimony, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which still exists, offers small cash awards, in
the neighborhood of $100 to $200, to customs inspectors for
``superior achievement'' in enforcement activity, including drug
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service had no immediate comment on Walker's ruling,
but has previously described its program as performance incentives,
not bounty-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The program received a vote of confidence last week from the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied a new trial to two
men convicted in another San Francisco smuggling case. The court
said the Customs Service incentive program, which was not disclosed
to the defense until after trial, was ``a system of rewards for
legitimate and diversified job performance and not a payment for
testimony,'' although some of the awards appeared to be based on
prosecutions that ended in convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson, described by Walker as a low-level participant with
no previous criminal record, faced a sentence of 6 1/2 to eight
years under federal guidelines. Instead, the judge sentenced him to
four years and three months, the time he had already spent behind
bars, and freed him to return to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 12 customs employees who testified for the prosecution,
Walker said, eight had received bonuses for drug interception,
including two who were rewarded for their work on Sanderson's case.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he wasn't determining that disclosure of their role
would have led the jury to acquit Sanderson, only that concealment
had subverted the defense position.

WEB PRODUCT IMAGES CAN LIE LIKE A RUG 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ours is a family besotted with catalogs. But don't get me wrong.
We welcome the dozens of catalogs _ J.Jill, Pottery Barn Kids,
French Country Living, House and Home, you name it _ that land in
our mailbox every day. In fact, one of us, who shall remain
unnamed, takes so much pleasure in browsing catalogs that he makes
a point of rummaging through the recycling bins at the post office
for discarded catalogs that the direct marketers failed to send us
for some reason.
</P>
<P>
   But we seldom actually order from catalogs because we know that
pictures can, if not lie exactly, then pleasantly distort. On the
rare occasions that I break down and buy something from a catalog
that is not a tried and true piece of clothing or cookware, I am
invariably disappointed, usually by its quality.
</P>
<P>
   So more often than not, we simply covet.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I share a special longing for rugs. We own very
few because we know a good rug when we see it, which invariably
means we can't afford it. But this past spring we decided to break
down and buy an area rug to cover a large section of our living
room floor.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs we found in the pages of our catalogs were certainly
enticing.
</P>
<P>
   But our distrust of the pictures and prices sent us into actual
rug stores. We grew depressed as we made our way through the racks
of hanging rugs because we couldn't afford the lovely hand-hooked
ones and we didn't want the ones made of synthetic fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Then one evening, inspiration struck. ``You know, I've seen some
beautiful rugs up on the Web,'' my husband said in a casual, steady
tone.
</P>
<P>
   Eureka!
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, I went straight to the computer. Rug
merchants, it turns out _ perhaps to no one's surprise but my own _
have taken their wares to the Web with a vengeance. I spent an hour
clicking my way from area rug to area rug, Web site to Web site. I
found every imaginable size, material, pattern and motif for sale
at sites like Area Rugs Unlimited (www.arearugsltd.com) and Area
Rugs For Less.com (arearugsforless.com).
</P>
<P>
   By that evening, I had collected bookmarks for about a dozen
rugs, and I showed them to my husband. One of them, the Retro-Gold
rug from the Vintage collection at AreaFloorRugs.com
(areafloorrugs.com), caught his eye. Its squares of muted old-world
golds, rusts and blues would be a perfect complement to our newly
upholstered couch. The size was perfect. The site told us that we
were getting a $675 rug for $385. I ordered it.
</P>
<P>
   I was thrilled with my smart purchase. I struck up a friendly
e-mail exchange with Paul, a customer service agent at
AreaFloorRugs.com. Every time I sent him an e-mail message, Paul
responded at once. We were headed for vacation and needed to time
the shipping of the rug so it didn't arrive while we were away, and
Paul went out of his way to accommodate the request. If he was a
robot, he was one of the more impressive feats to come out of
automated customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Paul's diligence, the rug arrived according to plan a
few weeks later. We hauled it up the stairs, ripped through the
heavy plastic wrapping and unrolled it onto the waiting floor.
</P>
<P>
   What we experienced next is best described as consumer shock.
Instead of the subtle hues we anticipated, the colors were closer
to neon. A clown lying on our floor would call less attention to
himself . The loud colors were only accentuated by the rug's
glossy, plasticine look and feel, which was not unlike Astroturf.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Kmart special,'' my husband said, crestfallen.
</P>
<P>
   I was angry, but not with AreaFloorRugs.com. After all, the site
had faithfully described the rug as being of ``super heavy weight,
high pile, 100% Continuous-filament, Delustered, Velvet-Set
polypropylene to provide years of durable splendor.'' If I had seen
the word ``polypropylene'' buried in the description, I was too
seduced by the other words to take much notice. And blame lay with
no one but myself for failing to decode the phrases ``natural
luster'' and ``quaint antique charm.'' AreaFloorRugs.com should
give that wordsmith a raise.
</P>
<P>
   I was angry with myself. I castigated myself for thinking that a
digital photograph reproduced on my old computer monitor would be
true to the real thing. As anyone who has been around computers for
a few years can tell you, colors vary from one computer to the
next, as monitors are not calibrated to the same schemes. I knew
this. My husband knew this. Why had the healthy skepticism we held
for the catalogs failed to kick in when we turned to the Web?
</P>
<P>
   I am not alone when it comes to getting something slightly (or
very) different from what I think I have purchased online. One
friend recently used an online agency to rent a villa in France,
only to arrive and find that the house lacked such basics as a
telephone line. And the husband of a colleague told me his story of
ordering what he thought was a side table for his office. Instead,
he ended up with a miniature version of what he thought he had
bought. Still, he kept it. (``It's a designer table, very nice,''
he explained, ``but only 10 inches tall.'')
</P>
<P>
   But that rug had to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, in the meantime, was sending me solicitous e-mail notes.
Had the rug arrived? Was I happy with it?
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of days, I was too mortified to respond. I wanted
to spare his feelings. After all he had done to shepherd my order
along, the rug seemed as much his as mine. When I finally
responded, I chose my words carefully: ``The rug arrived. It is a
bit disappointing, not what we had envisioned from the photo we saw
online.'' I refrained from asking him if he had any idea how
hideous this object was. Instead, I inquired politely about the
return policy.
</P>
<P>
   Paul wrote back immediately, of course. He was disappointed by
our disappointment. But he minced no words about the return policy.
Yes, we could return it, but we would have to pack it up ourselves
and pay for the shipping. We would also be charged a restocking fee
of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The work that would be required to send back the rug was
daunting. I let it slip and grew distracted by other things. We
decided to live with the rug, partly because we knew we'd never
find the time to return it, partly because we knew it was an object
lesson for us about the perils of purchasing items sight unseen on
the Net, where it is easy to be completely deceived about scale,
color and texture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, every time we open our front door we are greeted by the
sight of our Internet purchase.
</P>
<P>
   But we've grown used to it. I'm even beginning to like it, to
appreciate its finer qualities. When our elderly cat loses her
lunch on the rug, for instance, it's like cleaning Teflon. And
we've learned our lesson, a lesson that has blurred some
distinctions. When I told my husband the other day that I planned
to write about the rug, he responded, ``Didn't we buy that from a
catalog?''

<P>
   When I have to get myself up and going in the morning, I might
listen to Roxy Music, Django Reinhardt, the Tractors, Graham
Parker, Monster Magnet or any number of others.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the upsides to being single: There's nobody to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   So the other morning I'm in an Eminem mood; don't know why, just
am. I take out his first CD, pop it in, and it suddenly hits me:
Should I be listening to this?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Detroit rapper is catching a lot of flak
(justified, in my mind) for his new CD, ``The Marshall Mathers
LP,'' which contains numerous derogatory references to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   With my hair still wet from the shower and a lunch to be packed,
7:30 a.m. is probably not the best time to be debating my
foreseeable future with young Mr. Eminem. Heck, I can hardly
remember my name for the first hour I'm awake.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: At what point are a performer's lyrics
so opposite to what a fan believes that the fan decides to quit
listening? How about what a performer says in interviews or does in
private life?
</P>
<P>
   It's a quandary. After all, buying musicianss CDs and/or going
to see them in concert is, in a sense, endorsing what they say and
subsidizing their lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   I'm helping, in small ways, to help Bono pay for that mansion,
to enable Art Alexakis enjoy his hobbies and plan for retirement,
and to maintain the upkeep of the Supersuckers' equipment. And so
on. And so are you, if you buy CDs by U2 or Everclear or the
'suckers or pay to see them in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's a real easy call. I don't, for example, buy CDs
by white-supremacist bands.
</P>
<P>
   But far more often, the line is fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Clapton, Elvis Costello and Motorhead leader Lemmy have all
made dumb remarks in the past: Clapton about immigrants coming to
England, Costello about Ray Charles, and Lemmy about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   You might assume that Clapton and Costello are racist and that
Lemmy was in denial about the true scope of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean I throw out my CDs by these guys? Clapton and
Costello have both apologized for their remarks, and both said they
were drunk when they made them.
</P>
<P>
   And Lemmy sounded more poorly educated and naive than
anti-Semitic in his recent interview with ``Q'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Are remarks by well-known artists just blips on the radar screen
or revealing insights into what they really believe? Does it cast a
negative light on all their music?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not defending any of the dumb things these guys said, but am
I, on a certain level, an apologist? I still enjoy the music these
guys make. I can't say that their actions and words make their
music irrelevant to me.
</P>
<P>
   And consider this: What if, tomorrow, Eminem met with gay
leaders, realized how horrible some of his lyrics are, and then
apologized profusely and promised never to perform the offending
songs again? And kept his word.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long shot, but stranger things have happened.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder about this a lot these days _ not as a journalist, but
as a fan. To me, Eminem is very, very good at what he does: His
delivery and lyrics are among the best in hip-hop, immediately
identifiable and among the most popular. He's not handling stardom
well in some ways, and he's got some growing up to do, but he is
talented.
</P>
<P>
   Does that matter, given some of the hateful things he says?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure. And I wonder what other people say about this,
where they draw the line. At what point do people stop buying an
artist's music because it is offensive?
</P>
<P>
   That recent morning I changed my mind and listened to Django
instead of Eminem. For whatever reason, standing there in my living
room, hair still wet, lunch still unpacked, I wanted to hear
something else. Maybe it just had to do with a desire to hear some
great, swinging jazz guitar playing instead of some hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it didn't. I don't know.

</P>
<P>
   And maybe it didn't. I don't know.

   ``American Rhapsody'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Joe Eszterhas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Squalid fiction/nonfiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $25.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``American Rhapsody'' makes literary history. Since the first
prehistoric man or woman scratched graffiti on cave walls, nobody
anywhere has written a worse, more disgusting book than this
prurient garbage by screenwriter/novelist Joe Eszterhas.
</P>
<P>
   It's not actually that bad. It's worse. But my vocabulary fails
me.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, ``American Rhapsody'' is Eszterhas' take on Bill
Clinton, Monica Lewinsky, Sharon Stone, Richard Nixon and other
high-profile representatives of an era that, to put it charitably,
probably will not be looked upon with great admiration by our
descendants. In a whiny ``Author's Note'' before the book's assault
begins, Eszterhas explains that he wrote ``American Rhapsody'' as a
reflection ``about a generation, my generation, which, in some
ways, even though it was entrenched in power, creeping up on sixty,
was still struggling to find itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas says his own fame, earned by writing scripts for
``Showgirls,'' ``Jade'' and ``Basic Instinct'' _ the last of which
included the erotically charged scene in which Sharon Stone crossed
her legs and instantly became a media sensation _ frazzled him to
the point where he simply had to take time off to rediscover
himself. His vacation coincided with the Lewinsky scandal. Watching
it all on TV and reading the books about it, Eszterhas decided that
he and Bill Clinton probably had a lot in common, including
overactive libidos and fond memories of drugs. So Eszterhas wanted
to write a book that told the whole sordid story _ about Bill
Clinton, about Monica Lewinsky and about who we modern-day
Americans have become.
</P>
<P>
   But how to do it? Well, Eszterhas' solution is this: Ninety-five
percent of ``American Rhapsody's'' 432 pages are in a normal
typeface. This signals, he says, writing that is ``sometimes
interpretive, but based on well-researched facts.'' Which
translates as, ``I'm making most of it up, but within the bounds of
libel laws.'' Occasionally, there are chapters in bold type, which
offer Bill Clinton or Lewinsky or Bob Dole or Al Gore or Hillary
Clinton scatalogically ruminating on their lives. These, Eszterhas
claims, are written by a nasty imp inside the author: ``The writing
is fictional and his,'' he writes, ``starting with well-researched
facts but blasted through and transformed by his hallucinatory
dreams.'' Translation: really obscene made-up stuff that, presented
even marginally as fact, could get Eszterhas sued.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a little fact, lots of projections on who did and
said what and why, and occasional scenes and ruminations that are
so disgusting and far-fetched that only the mindlessly sex-obsessed
will read them completely (i.e., the same folks who think
``Showgirls'' was quality entertainment).
</P>
<P>
   The last chapter of ``American Rhapsody'' is the pornographic
nadir of the book: a happy soliloquy from Bill Clinton's, well,
you-know-what. I wish I were making this up.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the ``what'' of ``American Rhapsody.'' You've been
warned, so read it at your own peril.
</P>
<P>
   But now for the ``why,'' which is harder to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred A. Knopf is a reputable publisher, much admired in
literary circles. But it is also an imprint of Random House, which
is part of a megamedia conglomerate, and profit-seeking naturally
dictates what it prints and distributes. ``American Rhapsody'' is
trash, but why it is published trash is sadly simple: The publisher
believes that lots of people will buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they will. But ``American Rhapsody'' isn't just trash
fiction, it is a gruesome assault on common sense. It takes
voyeurism to an extreme level in the name of ``understanding'' who
we are. Yeah, and Larry Flynt publishes ``Hustler'' magazine to
protect Americans' First Amendment rights. .MDBU/.MDNM/ (Visit the

RETREATS USE SILENCE TO EMPHASIZE THAT STILL, SMALL VOICE FROM
WITHIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JAIME JORDAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a high-tech, high-volume world, finding
quiet time away from the hustle and bustle can be a chore.
</P>
<P>
   But more and more spiritual leaders are urging their
parishioners to seek out silence, whether in spiritual retreats or
simply in a quiet place in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Jesus) said, `Come away with me to a quiet place,' I
think that's one of the key invitations to silence,'' said the Rev.
Mark Cannaday, rector at St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Arlington,
Texas. ``Jesus frequently went away to pray, and that's motive for
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of speaking to God through silence may seem
contradictory at first, Cannaday said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Silence speaks.' It seems almost nonsense, but of course it
isn't, because silence has a different voice. It's still and it's
small,'' he said. ``It refers back to that experience that Elijah
had in the Old Testament, that God doesn't speak in the whirlwind
or in the storm. Mostly God speaks in that still, small voice that
comes in silence, that comes while I, or we as a group, are
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the power of silence.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as the pace of the world picks up, more clergy are
urging parishioners to seek God not only in churches, but also to
participate in retreats during which they seek to empty themselves
in the presence of God and wait in silence for a word from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our society, it's just so important to stop,'' said Vicky
Caudell, who schedules silent retreats at the Mount Carmel Center
for Spirituality in Dallas. ``As long as we're standing around and
we're doing the talking to God, he can't get through. We have to
slow down and get silent so he can talk to our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the premise for silent spiritual retreats, said Sister
Dorothy Powers, director of children's catechesis at the Catholic
Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The basic format, although it varies depending on the retreat
center, is set up so that lay people meet with a retreat leader for
30 minutes to an hour a day to help them reflect on their life and
where God is in their life. The retreat leader gives the lay people
Scripture to reflect upon as the day is continued in silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, people who go on a silent retreat are at a point in
their lives where they're ready to do some interior spiritual
journeying to deepen their relationship with the Lord to make sense
of their lives,'' Powers said. ``The variety of reasons are as
great as the variety of people who go.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowing down, quieting one's self can be an abrupt change for
many who aren't used to silence, Cannaday said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like being detoxified, I would guess. The truth
is that you have to kind of physically let yourself calm down. It
would be like having a hectic day. Everything has been chaos, so
when you sit down, you're still sort of moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Carmel Center for Spirituality facilitates that
slowing down as much as possible, Caudell said. Although located in
the southwest corner of Oak Cliff, a Dallas neighborhood, the
monastery occupies 45 secluded acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an oasis of quiet in the midst of Dallas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Retreats can last from one day to eight or more days, Powers
said. They range in price from a free-will offering for a day visit
to a couple of hundred dollars for a week's stay, retreat leaders
say.
</P>
<P>
   And they are becoming more sought out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hectic pace of life is probably making people more
aware of the need for periods of quiet reflection, just to get your
sanity back,'' Powers said. ``I think there's a spiritual hunger or
thirst in everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many North Texas worshippers travel as far as Houston, San
Angelo, Mississippi or Louisiana to retreat centers, Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are opportunities close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Arlington has been putting
the power-of-silence concept into practice for 21/2 years, senior
pastor Tom Schleuter said.
</P>
<P>
   The church started having Friday-evening watch services, which
last from 9 p.m. to 9 the next morning. Some people stay a few
hours; others stay the whole 12. In essence, it is the practice of
being silent and seeking to be in God's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Schleuter said prayer and watching are interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prayer to me is just a time of just everyday, all-the-time
communication with the Lord,'' he said. ``Some people think I have
to be on my knees, folding my hands, closing my eyes.'' But sitting
quietly in God's presence is also a form of prayer, Schleuter said.
</P>
<P>
   Schleuter said he would recommend silence to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people find is ... how extremely and
extravagantly loved they are by God, because they are focused on
him and they find that he is ultimately focused on them. He loves
you. That brings everything else in your life into perspective,''
Schleuter said. ``You begin to see your life from God's perspective
instead of, `I can't get control of my life, I'm so busy.' '' &QL;

SIREN CALL OF THE WIRELESS NET 
</HEADLINE>
   By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asking whether you need wireless Internet service for your
handheld computer is like asking about the sound of one hand
clapping. Just trying it out and seeing whether you like it is more
practical. But then, when it comes to shiny new gadgets, I've
always followed the path of buy first, ask questions later.
</P>
<P>
   After testing wireless modems and Internet services for Palm
organizers from both OmniSky and GoAmerica.net, I can see what all
the fuss is about. (Those opting for Microsoft's PocketPC platform
aren't out of the wireless loop either: Cell-phone connectors and
the recently announced wireless service packages from GoAmerica and
Aether Systems provide similar freewheeling possibilities.) I've
used the wireless Web connection for only a couple months, but I am
seriously hooked. I may not need it, but I like it.
</P>
<P>
   Although I live in New York, a major coverage area, I don't work
in sales, and I haven't yet had to buy plane tickets when I was in
a cab on the way to the airport, firing off e-mail messages as I
went. But when I was out and about on a recent Friday night with
the OmniSky modem in tow, I was able to check on the flight of a
friend flying in, keep tabs on the score of the New York Liberty
game, reply to e-mail that had just arrived and check bids on Ebay
auctions. It may seem rather frivolous, but the fact that I didn't
have to go home to my computer but could work these tasks into the
dead spots of my evening saved me time that I could use later for
other nefarious purposes, like reading a book or watching ``Wallace
&AMP; Gromit: The Wrong Trousers'' on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless service also saved my sanity and let me keep in
touch with my editors when I was cooling my heels in June in the
Manhattan Criminal Court building's jury assembly room, doing my
civic duty. Incorporating the OmniSky product into my daily routine
was similar to working my first Pilot 5000 into my daily life back
in 1996. Once I remembered that I had the darned thing, it became,
for better or worse, an appendage.
</P>
<P>
   Adding an external modem to the Palm is not the only option for
wireless connectivity. Web-enabled cell phones have been around for
months, and Palm Inc. recently announced plans for a software
product called the Palm Mobile Internet Kit. It is supposed to let
Palm users worldwide (with III's or later versions) connect
wirelessly to the Internet using mobile phones or Palm-compatible
modems. The company says the kit should be available later this
year for less than $50.
</P>
<P>
   There is also, of course, the company's Palm VII, which offers
built-in wireless access and streamlined Web content from its own
service plan; users of the Palm mobile kits can enjoy the same
service. For those who already own a Palm organizer or who don't
want to buy a Palm VII, there are a couple of other enticing
options.
</P>
<P>
   OmniSky began offering its wireless modem and Internet service
package to Palm V and Vx owners in May, and its customized modem
module for Handspring Visor devotees is due this fall. GoAmerica
recently revamped its service and offers its own modem and access
package for many types of Palm organizers, including the Palm
Professional, the Palm III series and the Palm V series.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account the monthly cost and the coverage and
content offered, OmniSky comes out ahead in my book. OmniSky's
Minstrel V modem (made by Novatell) clips neatly to the back of the
slim Palm V organizer. Even though the modem doubles the thickness
of the Palm, the service more than makes up for the added weight of
the modem and antenna with a wealth of wireless features. Users can
check their e-mail on as many as six accounts. They can also browse
more than 1,000 Web sites streamlined for wireless surfing, and
they can explore other sites around the Net as well.
</P>
<P>
   OmniSky, which mainly uses AT&AMP;T's wireless network, is not
available nationwide. It is concentrated around major metropolitan
areas, particularly on the East and West Coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The company suggests that you have 1.4 megabytes of RAM free on
your palmtop before using the OmniSky package, and the Palm V comes
with a total of 2 megabytes. Two megabytes is probably enough for
most people, who probably use only the organizer's standard
functions, even with the OmniSky programs installed. I am one of
those users, though, who insist on toting around a ton of
space-eating Palm shareware programs, along with electronic copies
of documents like the New York City subway map and the Tao Te
Ching. (I like to think of those two as somehow complementing each
other in the realm of daily urban life.)
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy my shareware cravings and need for space, I have been
using a Palm Vx, with its beefy 8 megabytes of RAM. After I
installed OmniSky, I also got a Palm Telnet program from the
PalmGear H.Q. Web site (www.palmgear.com) so I could log in and
read postings from my favorite online community, New York's
technologically old-fashioned but always entertaining Echo bulletin
board
</P>
<P>
   When you sign up for the OmniSky service, the company ships you
the modem and a CD-ROM with all the software you'll need to set
everything up, including the modem driver for the Palm. While you
run the installer program, you'll be asked to configure your POP3
e-mail accounts, including the omnisky.net address that is made
available for you.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The installer program on the CD also provides the Palm with a
huge amount of useful links in stripped-down ``Web clipping'' form,
with the links organized under category headings. These groupings
include Finance (Etrade, Fidelity and others), Travel (Travelocity,
BizTravel, MapBlast and more), News and Sports ( ABCNews, Yahoo,
MSNBC and others), Shopping, Living and Local Events. Once
installed, the software works with your Palm's address book _ it
will pop your e-mail address right into place when you are
composing a message.
</P>
<P>
   GoAmerica's latest product and plan for Palm devices, while not
as versatile as OmniSky's, has many of the same basic features and
links, and it offers owners of older Palm models the same addictive
wireless options. The addition of the modem to a Palm III makes it
a little unwieldy, but navigating the service itself is easy. And
the on-screen graphics displaying the modem's connection progress
are more informative than OmniSky's are.
</P>
<P>
   After you install the software and tap the GoAmerica icon on the
Palm screen, a new screen will pop up with two self-explanatory
icons: Go.Web and Go.Mail. You can also configure existing POP3
mail accounts for the Go.America service.
</P>
<P>
   The modem usually costs $299, but the company is offering $100
off the price if the user will sign a one-year contract. The
service costs $49.95 a month for unlimited use or $9.95 a month for
the first 25 kilobytes of data. Details can be found at
www.goamerica.net.
</P>
<P>
   A GoAmerica module for the Handspring Visor is under
development, and the company also offers a variety of wireless
options for pagers, smart phones and laptops.
</P>
<P>
   The OmniSky modem usually costs $299 as well, but the company is
holding a half-price sale on the device through the end of August
for people who sign six-month contracts for the monthly service.
Unlimited usage is $39.95 per month. OmniSky's unlimited use plan
is cheaper than the unlimited plan offered by Palm for the Palm
VII, which costs $44.99. More information is available at
www.omnisky.com.
</P>
<P>
   The OmniSky installer software is designed for use with Windows
95, 98, 2000 and NT, but I was also able to coax the files onto the
Palm with a Macintosh G3 running Virtual PC 3.0. GoAmerica's
installer CD is also for Windows only.
</P>
<P>
   One quibble I have with the clip-on modems from OmniSky and
GoAmerica is that there's no pass-through port incorporated into
the modem design. That means you can't attach an external keyboard
or other additional hardware device at the same time because the
modem is camped out in the HotSync port. For users who need to
enter a lot of text while maintaining the wireless connection, the
Palm VII has the edge here.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the modem and the monthly service plan from either
company is a bit of an investment, but if you need constant access
to your e-mail or a constant flow of data into your hand, wireless
service is well worth a look, especially if you already own a Palm
device. I found it worth the price for the convenience and
flexibility it offers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know it's a guilty pleasure, but I think my Internal
Rationalization Module will keep those feelings at bay until the
early adopter's Next Big Thing becomes everyone else's Thing to
Have.

 &HT;    HISPANIC, BUSINESS LEADERS IN TUG-OF-WAR OVER VISAS BILL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX and MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hispanic leaders and high-tech employers both
called on Congress Wednesday to pass stalled legislation to create
more visas for highly skilled foreign workers. But that's where the
agreement ended.
</P>
<P>
   Technology executives, saying they are desperate for workers,
want a ``clean'' bill that does just one thing: expand the H-1B
visa program to allow more computer-savvy workers into this country
for up to six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``An enormous number of jobs are going begging in the United
States,'' said William Archey, president of the American
Electronics Association, a trade group. ``There is an extraordinary
need for the high-tech industry to have an increase in the H-1B
visa program.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a separate press conference on Capitol Hill, a coalition
of groups involved with Latin American immigration issues said
Congress should approve H-1B legislation only if it:
</P>
<P>
   _ Allows as many as 2 million undocumented immigrants who have
lived in the U.S. since 1986 to apply for legal residency.
</P>
<P>
   _ Permits immigrants who qualify for visas to remain in this
country while awaiting resolution of their cases.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gives immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and
Haiti treatment equal to that given to Cubans and Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unconscionable that U.S. senators and representatives
would fast-track the H-1B visas without considering other
immigration policies that have been pending for years,'' said
Marisa J. Demeo, regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But tech executives said Latin American immigration issues
should be considered separately because the need to hire skilled
workers, such as computer programmers and engineers, is so urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Congress temporarily expanded the H-1B program's
annual cap from 65,000 to 115,000 visas per year. The cap falls to
107,500 in fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1, and to 65,000 a year
later. This year, employers used up the entire year's quota in six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a genuine urgency to the passage of H-1B
legislation,'' said Rhett Dawson, president of the Information
Technology Industry Council. ``The lifeblood of the (technology
industry) is human capital.''
</P>
<P>
   To help industry, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has been pushing a
bill to boost the annual limit to 200,000. Though passed out of
committee months ago, the Hatch bill still has not been put to a
full Senate vote because of disagreements over amendments.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, a similar bill, sponsored by Rep. David Dreier,
R-Calif., also is languishing amid partisan wrangling over
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insist that fairness demands that the immigration
amendments be attached to the H-1B legislation. But critics say
Democrats are trying to force Republicans to vote against Latin
American immigration provisions in order to get political
ammunition for this November's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the issue has become politicized,'' said Harris
Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America. ``And we all know it's a political year. We're here to
urge the House and Senate leadership to take the politics out of
this process.''

of groups involved with Latin American immigration issues said
Congress should approve H-1B legislation only if it:
</P>
<P>
   _ Allows as many as 2 million undocumented immigrants who have
lived in the U.S. since 1986 to apply for legal residency.
</P>
<P>
   _ Permits immigrants who qualify for visas to remain in this
country while awaiting resolution of their cases.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gives immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and
Haiti treatment equal to that given to Cubans and Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unconscionable that U.S. senators and representatives
would fast-track the H-1B visas without considering other
immigration policies that have been pending for years,'' said
Marisa J. Demeo, regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But tech executives said Latin American immigration issues
should be considered separately because the need to hire skilled
workers, such as computer programmers and engineers, is so urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Congress temporarily expanded the H-1B program's
annual cap from 65,000 to 115,000 visas per year. The cap falls to
107,500 in fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1, and to 65,000 a year
later. This year, employers used up the entire year's quota in six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a genuine urgency to the passage of H-1B
legislation,'' said Rhett Dawson, president of the Information
Technology Industry Council. ``The lifeblood of the (technology
industry) is human capital.''
</P>
<P>
   To help industry, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has been pushing a
bill to boost the annual limit to 200,000. Though passed out of
committee months ago, the Hatch bill still has not been put to a
full Senate vote because of disagreements over amendments.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, a similar bill, sponsored by Rep. David Dreier,
R-Calif., also is languishing amid partisan wrangling over
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insist that fairness demands that the immigration
amendments be attached to the H-1B legislation. But critics say
Democrats are trying to force Republicans to vote against Latin
American immigration provisions in order to get political
ammunition for this November's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the issue has become politicized,'' said Harris
Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America. ``And we all know it's a political year. We're here to
urge the House and Senate leadership to take the politics out of
this process.''

NOT PERFECT, BUT ALMOST REEL ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Pam and Robin, who used to fish
off Bodega Bay, Calif., appreciated the character of Linda, the
other boat captain in ``The Perfect Storm.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``She wasn't Hollywood blonde with a lot of cleavage,'' says
Pam.
</P>
<P>
   Robin nods. ``She even had chapped lips, like someone who spent
real time out on the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   The two friends, who used to be captain and crew when they
fished for salmon, sat watching the summer's big movie adventure
and grabbing for each other's hand and squeezing hard. In that,
they were no different from much of the audience. But their
appreciation was more real than imagined.
</P>
<P>
   They were horrified, delighted and not just a little bit
nostalgic for a life that was so thrilling Pam says she's never
found a job to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I ever heard any fisherman talk poetically like
Billy (George Clooney) in the movie,'' says Pam, ``but I remember
once going down past Point Reyes, staring at that beautiful
shoreline from the flying bridge and feeling so lucky and thinking
there was no better feeling in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I watched the movie it made me sad that there can't be
more things in life that get a person's adrenaline up like that.''
</P>
<P>
   I think that's why no matter what the critics think of the film,
it hooked so many of us computer-dependent zero-tolerance
dress-down-on-Friday people. This is what some real life people do
when they go to work. They put on worn flannel shirts and get fish
guts under their fingernails and are lucky if they suffer only
chapped lips. Some also die on the job, but there's an edge to the
life that is tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being out there in the ocean is reality,'' says Robin. ``It's
like childbirth. It's very humbling. You are in an environment
where something bigger is in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin and Pam talk about a stomach-wrenching storm that hit them
one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly things just change,'' says Pam. ``The sea can be flat
calm and then turn into total chaos.'' She thinks the waves that
day might have gotten to 15 to 20 feet. Robin says they were big,
though nothing like the Sierra-sized mountains of water in the
movie. Still, she adds, ``When you're in a little boat and out in a
storm, every big wave looks like one of those waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam, who was steering, says, ``I actually thought about putting
on my survival gear and yelling to Robin to get her's on, but we
couldn't take a second to stop. It was like a big washing machine
of giant waves, one on top of the other. In a storm like that the
water gets frothy and green, almost luminous.''
</P>
<P>
   They, too, had trouble with the flopper out in rough seas. In
the movie the flopper is that big hunk of metal that looks like an
anchor flailing against the wheel house and which Billy, in a
superhuman move, cuts off with a blow torch while being pitched
around like a bucking bronco.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened with us,'' says Pam, ``is the chain broke that
holds the outrigger pole down which allowed the flopper to swing
loose. It's what you normally count on to give the boat balance,
but in this case it turned into a weapon and could have cut a huge
gouge in the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin had to go out by herself and pull the flopper in.
Normally it took the two of us in a standing still boat in good
weather to maneuver the thing. I have no idea how she did it alone.
She just became very strong. And saved our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently landlocked, Robin is a teacher and raises exotic
garlic. Pam makes arty picture frames out of old earrings and
political buttons. The next boat she's going on is a cruise ship to
Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
   But when they talk about their fishing days they dimple like
Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't ever want to do it again. Seeing that movie made me
realize how lucky we were to survive,'' says Robin. ``But there is
such excitement and anticipation when you're out there. You never
knew what will happen each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam says, ``Not only do you get to be out in nature, but what
you achieve is your own doing, no one else's. That's a good
feeling. But it's a hard way to make a living because there's so
much red tape and restrictions. I'm too chicken to go through a
hurricane for the sake of fish, but I understand going out in nasty
weather because you have a boat payment due.''
</P>
<P>
   They never got badly hurt. They never fell in, except for a
couple of embarrassing mishaps at the dock. They never got rich.
But they were luckier than the friends who never made it back to
port.
</P>
<P>
   They don't call themselves fisherwomen. ``Fisherman is a word
for what you do. It has nothing to do with gender,'' says Robin.
</P>
<P>
   Gentler than most of the critics, they rolled their eyes at only
a couple of movie scenes. ``I don't know about diving into that
kind of a sea to rescue someone with all your clothes on and having
the boat right there to swim back to,'' says Pam.
</P>
<P>
   But they thought the music-to-fish-by was realistic. ``Every
time we stopped the boat and started to fish we played either the
Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said we caught more fish with Dylan.''
</P>

IF TV'S JUST NOT ENOUGH: CONVENTIONS ON THE NET
</HEADLINE>
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Political conventions were once smoky back-room affairs. Then
they became television events. Now they have moved to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally many major news organizations are offering extra
coverage online. But in addition, the major political parties and
independent Web producers are offering novel ways to follow the
conventions online.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet experts say that at this point in history, the use
of the medium may be like the use of television at conventions in
the 1950s, when networks were still learning what the cameras could
do.
</P>
<P>
   The online experiments with convention coverage are ``kind of
like 3-D glasses at the movies,'' said Larry Purpuro, deputy chief
of staff for the Republican National Committee. ``It's for the fun
of the experiment,'' he said, ``but they're not so fun to use.''
Purpuro is director of the party's e.GOP project, an effort to
apply Web-based technologies to the committee's communications,
fund-raising and organizing activities.
</P>
<P>
   Purpuro said that for party leaders, the Internet meant ``a
tremendous opportunity for us to collect a lot of interest that can
be developed and enhanced post-convention.'' The Republican
convention will be held from July 31 to Aug. 3 in Philadelphia.
After the convention ends, Purpuro said, the party can get in touch
with people who have sent in their e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   For many Web site producers outside the parties, the conventions
present an opportunity to test different methods of telling a story
and tapping the public's interests.
</P>
<P>
   During important speeches, producers at America Online will
offer chats and instant polling to subscribers. The idea is to
provide an outlet for discussion and debate to individuals who are
more interested in politics than their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's other people who are interested in it, not necessarily
the people you live with,'' said Kathleen deLaski, director of
political and government planning for America Online. ``That's the
large part of the audience'' for America Online's political
services, she added.
</P>
<P>
   AOL will produce a chat show every evening for both conventions.
Unlike traditional media outlets, in which editors set the agenda,
AOL will poll its members each day on what the topic of the show
should be.
</P>
<P>
   The service is also offering ``delegate diaries,'' daily reports
from delegates that will describe what the convention is like for
the average delegate and put the procedures of the conventions into
easily understood terms.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of Web sites that plan to offer coverage beyond
traditional news, a common idea is to use the Internet to augment
the programs offered by the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest problems the parties face when organizing
conventions is deciding whom to include on the speaking schedule.
FreedomChannel.com, a nonpartisan site (www.freedomchannel.com),
doesn't face the same time constraints, so it will offer video
clips of prominent political figures who are not scheduled to speak
at the convention. For example, the group is working to arrange a
speech from Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida and a brother of
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people want to speak at the conventions who never get
to the podium,'' said Daniel Manatt, media director of
FreedomChannel.com, which is based in Washington. ``So we want to
offer an unlimited amount of time on our Web site. The whole idea
of the Internet is that it's limitless.''
</P>
<P>
   Video clips of the conventions will not be hard to find on the
Web. Two Internet companies not affiliated with major news
organizations have secured skyboxes at both conventions: AOL and
Pseudo Programs Inc. The skyboxes, which provide overall camera
coverage of the convention floor, are usually reserved for
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   For Pseudo Programs, which has a Web site at www.pseudo.com, the
central feature of the convention coverage will be the use of
360-degree cameras. The cameras show whatever surrounds them, and
the company's presentation online will allow members of the
audience to choose their own views rather than depend on a
perspective chosen by a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really giving people the opportunity to sit in the
control box,'' said Jeanne Meyer, senior vice president of Pseudo
Programs. The conventions will give ``a huge illustration of what
we can do,'' she said, ``that we're not just television squeezed on
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The company asked Democratic and Republican groups to nominate a
few members to cover the convention. In keeping with its
audience-driven theme, the company is letting its viewers select
the people who will be sent.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are also planning to use a 360-degree camera to
provide nonstop video coverage on their Web site,
www.dems2000 &QC; .com. Party officials hope that the camera will give
``a free and open perspective'' on their convention, which will run
from Aug. 14 to Aug. 17 in Los Angeles, said Peter Ragone, a
spokesman for the Democratic National Convention Committee. The
Democrats want to offer extensive detail on the Internet about
issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you happen to be a person whose chief interest is the
environment,'' he said, ``we have the ability to talk in depth and
in length with the voter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have collected the opinions of some members of the
public online through a so-called interactive platform. By the
deadline earlier this month, 460 people had submitted ideas
electronically, and party officials said some of their ideas might
be included in the party's platform.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua King, vice president of external affairs for
SpeakOut.com, which built the interactive system for the party,
said: ``Is this 460 more people than would have participated
otherwise? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are offering the public the opportunity to
become ``dot-com delegates'' through their convention site at
www.gopconvention.com. By signing up at the site, the Internet
``delegates'' will be able to see exclusive interviews with
convention participants, receive updates from state delegations by
e-mail, get a convention screen saver and send their opinions about
convention events.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the conventions online may well depend on how
well the parties steer members of their audiences into their
electronic dens at important moments.
</P>
<P>
   Experience has shown that major news articles and splashy events
are the most likely factors to drive the public to political Web
sites. So campaigns and political groups would do well to be
prepared to steer traffic from the convention sites to related Web
sites while the interest is high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to see how well prepared the parties are to catch a
wave,'' said Professor Michael Cornfield, director of the Democracy
Online Project at George Washington University. He said it would be
interesting to see if either party posted Web site addresses _ for
their own convention sites or related sites _ on their stages.
</P>
<P>
   By driving traffic to their own Web sites, Professor Cornfield
said, the parties can build ways to keep in touch with supporters
at a time when voters are interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political scientists will tell you,'' he said, ``that
post-convention bounce really matters.''

SHOOTING IT UP, AND LAUGHING ABOUT IT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (Circuits)  
 By PETER OLAFSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MDK2 made me smile. Not quickly, not broadly, and usually not
for very long, but my reflection in the monitor screen did
occasionally grin back at me for a second or two, and that was
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   It had been years since a game made me smile _ let alone laugh _
with any regularity. I suspect that is a byproduct of the decline
in the late 1990s of the adventure game, the genre best equipped
for pure storytelling and for the exquisite timing that humor
requires. Infocom made me laugh reliably with its text adventures
throughout the 1980s, and its spiritual heir, Legend Entertainment,
made me laugh with its text-and-graphic adventures in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   I have fond memories of trying to get some mundane object from
an uncooperative, monosyllabic sailor in LucasArts' Secret of
Monkey Island. The more I tried, the more he said no. The more he
said no, the more I tried. I could barely stay in my chair for
laughing _ both at myself for my inane persistence and at the game
for responding in such detail.
</P>
<P>
   That was 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In MDK2, the Canadian game developer BioWare, which showed in
1998's Baldur's Gate that the role-playing genre still has a pulse,
demonstrates with a joyful mix of action and whimsy that games can
still find subtle ways to amuse us.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shiny Entertainment's original MDK from 1996, MDK2 is not
conventionally funny. (Indeed, when it tries to be conventionally
funny, as it does in the animations between its 10 levels, it is
the least effective.) Rather, it makes me feel funny, the way I
felt after I had sneaked a couple of sips of my dad's Budweiser
when I was a kid. Around the third level, through the accrual of
minor but telling details, I found MDK2 had kicked me into a kind
of giddy reverie.
</P>
<P>
   That's no mean achievement. Comedy is especially risky in an
action game. To paraphrase John Le Carre's George Smiley: If you
make your enemy look too foolish, you lose the justification for
taking him on.
</P>
<P>
   At the game's start, the victors of MDK have no sooner toasted
their success than they discover that the aliens they thought
vanquished have returned. A mine crawler _ a surface-chewing lawn
mower operating on a planetary scale _ has appeared in Edmonton,
Alberta. (A small in-joke: BioWare is based in Edmonton.) So Kurt
Hectic, hero of the first game, goes back into action, diving from
the orbiting Jim Dandy spacecraft while dodging missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, MDK2 adopts the over-the-shoulder,
third-person view familiar from the Tomb Raider games. It preserves
the level structure: Corridors link stadium-size chambers,
typically with a locked door at the far end that is opened by
finding and disabling a series of devices. You will still find
subgames that range from directing a tropical fish through pipes to
avoiding flying debris. And you'll undertake the conventional
business of collecting weapons and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But while the pieces will seem familiar, the whole is not quite
conventional. Kurt remains an unlikely hero. In his form-fitting
coil suit and pointed helmet, he looks as though he should be
competing in the Tour de France rather than saving the planet. When
he pops open the threadbare parachute that permits him to glide
through the immense levels, it looks as though someone has pulled
back his suspenders to give them a nasty snap.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the weapons are rather extravagant. One type of grenade
opens a black hole that sucks in everything around it _ especially
useful when a resilient enemy absolutely, positively has to be
removed to someplace else. The enemies do not all behave like
normal, preternaturally aggressive enemies. Some of them appear to
be waving at me. And in all honesty, Kurt didn't so much dive from
the Jim Dandy as fall from it.
</P>
<P>
   The original MDK was an all-Kurt affair. (The K in the title
stands for Kurt.) Here, he handles only every third level, sharing
the spotlight with Max (the M) and Dr. Fluke Hawkins (the D). Max
is a six-limbed, cigar-chomping robotic dog who can operate a jet
pack, fire up to four weapons simultaneously and destroy a
formidable array of scenery.
</P>
<P>
   As you would expect of a scientist with spectacles and a crown
of white hair, Dr. Fluke Hawkins is not much of a fighter. But he
possesses a gift for invention: With found items in each hand, he
can sometimes combine them to create something new. It's a skill
that emphasizes chasing down objects and experimentation and gives
his levels a distinctly adventure-game feeling. For instance, the
hand dryer retrieved from the spaceship lavatory and some pipes
come together as a leaf blower; it sends the giant enemies
occupying the leafy lounge bouncing into the maw of a giant, toothy
plant on loan from ``The Little Shop of Horrors.''
</P>
<P>
   But MDK2 tends to celebrate its humor in small touches, from the
quiet ``ding'' of the machines that recharge Max's jet pack to the
distressed body language of aliens in the sights of Kurt's sniper
scope to the little neon labels that appear above the weapons and
supplies. The enemies you shoot sometime collapse in extravagant
fashion, first spinning around on one foot, as though they are
auditioning for a part in a corny western. And advancing through
one room requires that Kurt take the stage and dance to entertain
aliens in the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, few of these little scenes are worth more than a
flutter of a comic eyelash. But taken together, they put the player
just slightly off balance _ not so wobbly as to jeopardize MDK2's
premise, but wobbly enough to enjoy it at a new, silly level. At
one point, controlling Max, I stumbled across a wall panel that
looked like a false front. I had Max do what he does best _ shoot
it _ and the wall panel shattered, only to reveal another wall
panel. And behind that one, another.
</P>
<P>
   That went on for about seven layers, but it never became
repetitious. Rather, it made a joke of the repetition, recalling in
tone the curtains and doors in classic cartoons that open to reveal
another portal, and in its comic persistence, that uncooperative
sailor in Monkey Island a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   I had to smile, and I did.

 COMEBACK KANSAS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Never has a slide into second base appeared more painful than at
the Kansas City Royals game Sunday. The ouch factor: The only
uniform this slider had on was his birthday suit.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards then hauled off this unofficial player who was _
take your pick _ in the skinny, as Adam, for all to see, nude.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a few recent exhibitions _ including an
attention-getting interruption a couple weeks earlier at Wimbledon
_ streaking does not appear to be making a comeback. But for some,
the pastime continues to have appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Streaking _ which streaking.org defines as ``the nonsexual act
of running, jogging, sprinting, Rollerblading or cycling without
clothing'' _ peaked in 1974, with a man running naked across the
stage during the Academy Awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incident marked the high point _ or low, if you prefer _
of a practice that vied with Pet Rocks for the coveted title of
Dumbest Fad of the 1970s: streaking,'' wrote Frederic D. Schwarz in
an April 1999 American Heritage magazine column.
</P>
<P>
   Like bell-bottoms and platform shoes _ other dumb fads of the
'70s _ streaking has been resurrected in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes and goes,'' says Mark Barnett, a psychology professor
at Kansas State University. ``I grew up in the '70s when it
(streaking) was a fun group activity. Fraternities and other groups
would have certain times and certain occasions and they would
streak. It became a sort of tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Streaking made the headlines, too. And that's where Ray Stevens
says he got the idea for his hit song, ``The Streak,'' which topped
the charts in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after reading a newsmagazine article about a college
student streaking in California, Stevens wrote lyrics like, ``Oh,
yes, they call him the Streak//Look at that, look at that//He likes
to show off his physique.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading on an airplane and I saw this article and I
thought, `What a good idea for a song,'/i'' says Stevens, who owns
the Country Tonite Theatre in Branson and currently lives in
Nashville, Tenn. ``You just couldn't resist it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Stevens says he has never streaked (``I think when I get
to be 90, I might try it''), he calls the act ``pretty harmless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all born with a birthday suit and yet we're not supposed
to show it, or should I say, certain parts of it. When someone
says, `Ah, the heck with you' and shows it, it's funny _ especially
if it's a real good birthday suit or a real bad one.''
</P>
<P>
   The act of streaking was born on college campuses in the late
fall and winter of 1973, according to Schwarz's article ``That
Streaking Fad.'' And the candles are still burning. For example,
students at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor run through
campus streaking during the annual Naked Mile event. In an even
more public arena, a woman streaked past tennis players and
spectators at Wimbledon in 1996; a man pulled the same stunt this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, a high school senior from Valley Center, Kan.,
ran naked through a gymnasium during 1999 homecoming ceremonies
(the student was cleared of a disorderly conduct charge).
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think there's nothing more to this than attention
seeking, just an extreme form of attention seeking,'' says David
Holmes, a University of Kansas psychology professor specializing in
abnormal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Holmes points out that streaking is different from
exhibitionism, which is a pathological disorder involving exposure
for sexual gratification. Streakers, on the other hand, often seek
the spotlight, five minutes of fame _ or infamy.
</P>
<P>
   And what better place to score it than at a baseball game, where
beer could also be influential in lowering a person's inhibition?
</P>
<P>
   Professor Barnett asks, ``Where else can you have 35,000 people
look at you and get all that attention for a minute and a half?''

   Despite his best efforts, Montgomerie still not the favored
figure
</P>
<P>
   By Furman Bisherc. 2000 Cox News Service ST. ANDREWS, Scotland -
Poor Colin Montgomerie. He would like so to be popular. To be
greeted with standing ovations by tournament galleries, like a rock
star. Chanting his name. Everybody's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good old Monty,'' they'd say, ``our national idol. Every
Scot's personal hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' the derisive name pinned on him by
some sarcastic member of the British press. Or as ``Glasgow Fats,''
before he went on a diet and came forth a trim figure. He is no
trencherman as in Lee Westwood, who said, ``I'm a golfer, not an
athlete. I don't need to be super-fit.''
</P>
<P>
   With Monty, it's not so much condition as it is an urge to be a
favored figure. Yet, there are his old-maidish responses to
applause, the lips pursed into more a grimace than a smile. The
quick shift from smile to frown, as at the mention of the name
``Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   As you have surmised, golf has come home again for another
British Open at the manger of the game, the Old Course at St.
Andrews. Montgomerie was in for his pre-championship news
conference. Third question, no more than three minutes into the
inquisition, when the question came out of the pack, ``Are you
trying to say Tiger is not quite the favorite everyone might
think?''
</P>
<P>
   Monty bristled. There it was again, Tiger, Tiger, Tiger. ``First
American question, American question about Tiger Woods,'' voice
dripping with sarcasm. ``I never said he wasn't experienced, for
God's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a Scot, you'd suspect that Montgomerie would look upon St.
Andrews as home ground, even with all the liberties the Royal &AMP;
Ancient has taken with this hallowed old relic. New and more severe
bunkers. ``They outdid themselves on the bunkers,'' Jack Nicklaus
said. ``They are very, very different.''
</P>
<P>
   The length has been stretched out, not that in this warm, quiet
weather and interstate fairways any professional should feel
constricted. ``Everybody will be a long hitter here,'' Nick Faldo
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a very, very different Open,'' Nicklaus said.
</P>
<P>
   After Montgomerie came away from being ``pipped'' again, as they
say it over here, at Loch Lomond, he was asked about the Open. ``I
can hardly wait to play the great old course again,'' he said in
the driest of tones. Never would you have expected Colin
Montgomerie not to show proper respect for the course held highest
in world esteem, guarded on the left by grouty old structures and
on the right by St. Andrews Bay.
</P>
<P>
   A flash peek at his record in Opens played here and you find
incriminating evidence. In 1990, he finished 48th. In 1995, he
never finished. Two rounds of 75, missed the cut and went home.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie has tried so hard to be liked in the United States.
He'll even say such a thing as, ``The American Open is my favorite
tournament. It is set up the way a major championship should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Heke nothing we've ever seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees the Old Course set up in such a way as to protect its
chastity. ``The winner will be someone who does not attack every
pin. You will need to play safe some of the time,'' none of that
reflecting on the bombarding game that Woods plays.
</P>
<P>
   For the past seven years, Montgomerie has been the dominating
player on the European Tour. This year, he has dropped to third
place, behind Darren Clarke, who got a head start in World Match
Play, and Els. Still, Scottish punters are collecting strong behind
Monty at 14-1, second choice with Els and Westwood, behind the
pressurized Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you are fed up with people talking about Tiger Woods,''
it was put to him as the conference ground down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am,'' Monty said. ``Next question.''

WILLIAM CORSON, 74, A MARINE NEARLY COURT-MARTIALED FOR BOOK ON
VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ William R. Corson, a retired Marine Corps
lieutenant colonel who was an expert on revolution and
counterinsurgency and was nearly court-martialed for writing a book
venting his disillusionment over the Vietnam War, died on Monday at
a hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Corson lived in Potomac, Md. The cause of death was emphysema
and lung cancer, his wife, Judith, said.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1968, Corson was just back from a tour in Vietnam and
working in the Defense Department, looking forward to retirement.
He spent much of his spare time hunched over a typewriter at home,
working on a book he would call ``The Betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Corson had never believed in the ``domino theory'' that one
Communist takeover would lead to another, and he had long thought
that the struggle in Vietnam was more about nationalism than
Communism, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, W.W. Norton, planned to publish the book on July
1, the day after Corson's retirement became effective. But the
colonel ran afoul of a regulation requiring officers to submit
statements on public policy for official review before making them
public.
</P>
<P>
   Unpersuaded by his argument that the regulation should not apply
to him because he would be a civilian when the book came out, and
that his manuscript violated no national-security laws in any
event, the Marine Corps delayed his retirement and moved to convene
a court-martial. As the debate grew heated, the Corps dropped the
court-martial, and Corson retired a month later than planned.
</P>
<P>
   The book condemned the assumptions that had led the United
States into a quagmire. ``The politicians saw in Vietnam, or so
they thought at the time, a chance to pull off a cheap victory
against the Communists,'' he wrote. ``When their initial judgments
about Vietnam were found to be in error, there was no way to
confess their error, without risking defeat at the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Corson argued that the American-backed Saigon government was
inept and corrupt and out of touch with the people.
</P>
<P>
   William Corson became familiar with Southeast Asia as a young
officer. After Korean War service, he learned Chinese at the Naval
Intelligence School in Washington. In the late 1950s he was
stationed in Hong Kong, and in 1962 he was assigned to the office
of the Secretary of Defense. From 1964 to 1966, he taught a course
on communism and revolution at the Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he was sent to command a tank battalion in Vietnam, a
country he had been studying since it was a French colonial
possession. In 1967, he was named head of the Combined Action
Program, in which Marines aided South Vietnamese militia in
villages. Corson's superiors praised his ability to win the
confidence of the Vietnamese. Had he decided to remain in the Corps
instead of retiring, he seemed destined to wear the eagle of a full
colonel, perhaps even the star of a brigadier general.
</P>
<P>
   His career path had been unusual. Born in Chicago, he spent much
of his early childhood with his grandparents after his mother and
father divorced. As a teen-ager, he preferred wandering and odd
jobs over the classroom. Then he got a job at the Chicago Daily
News, whose publisher, Frank Knox, saw something in him.
</P>
<P>
   Knox, who later became secretary of the Navy, who was on the
board of the University of Chicago and helped the young man get a
scholarship there.
</P>
<P>
   William Corson enlisted in the Marines in World War II and
fought in Guam and Bougainville in the Pacific, rising to sergeant.
After the war, he returned to the University of Chicago and got a
degree in mathematics. He received a master's in economics at the
University of Miami and re-entered the Marine Corps in 1949 as an
officer. Years later, he got a doctorate in economics from American
University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Marines, he taught history at Howard
University in Washington for a year and wrote several books on
national security issues. He also served as compliance director of
the Price Commission, the agency created in 1971 as part of
President Nixon's attempts to stabilize the economy and hold down
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Corson is survived by their three sons,
Adam, Zachary and Andrew, all of Potomac; two sons from an earlier
marriage, Christopher of Silver Spring, Md., and David of
Greenville, S.C.; and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unpleasantness surrounding his retirement, Corson
remained a Marine at heart, up to a point. ``I could kill you in
eight seconds,'' he boasted to an interviewer a year after leaving
the Corps. ``But I don't have the instinct for that sort of thing
anymore.''

   When Capitol releases an Everclear best-of, it'll be a beautiful
thing. Each of the trio's albums has a handful of great tunes and
some clunkers. This is no exception. There's at least one-third of
a very good album here, but a couple of the most entertaining
moments owe a debt to other artists. ``AM Radio'' is a big slab of
goofy fun that pays tribute to the 1970s, incorporating a chunk of
Jean Knight's ``Mr. Big Stuff.'' The stomping ``Now That It's
Over'' contains musical allusions to both Led Zeppelin and the
Beatles. There's one moment that should have remained someone
else's, though _ a well-meaning but icky cover of Van Morrison's
``Brown Eyed Girl.''

<P>
   Nelly's ``Country Grammar'' came up and surprised the musical
world when the St. Louis rapper's first album debuted higher than
the much more hyped Lil' Kim follow-up. Clearly, those caught off
guard by Nelly's No. 3 entry onto the pop charts hadn't listened to
his album, because it both predicts and details his imminent
success _ over and over again. In fact, the main difference among
his songs is which luxury car hip-hop's first prominent bluesman
claims to be driving _ a Range Rover in the insistent title track,
a Hummer in the quirky, Playstation-sounding ``Tho Dem Wrappas''
and a Mercedes on the menacing ``For My,'' with fellow twanger Lil'
Wayne. All of ``Country Grammar'' is revved up on St. Louis pride
and original music, but too often it stalls when it comes to
subject matter and hooks.

   Put Metallica, Radiohead and Fugazi in a blender with a dash of
Smashing Pumpkins, garnish with a twist of trip-hop, and you have
the Deftones cocktail. The alternative metal quintet's third album
barrels out of the speakers with the force of a runaway train, but
the band has a firm grip on the handle. The rampaging riffs are
grabbers, but the abstractly creepy lyrics and the inventive sound
painting of Stephen Carpenter's guitars and DJ Frank Delgado's
turntablism make them stick. You'll bang your head, but it won't
feel empty while you do it.

<P>
   Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 1 is Yoel Levi and the ASO's latest
installment in the composer's symphonic cycle _ they've already
released Nos. 4 through 7. In Mahler 1, Levi inserts the original
second movement, ``Blumine,'' making this a five-movement work. As
in the rest of the cycle, the playing here is exacting, limpid and
subtle, with pure horn calls, crisp, dry-eyed cello statements and
explosive percussion. It's almost a textbook display of orchestral
refinement, captured in Telarc's vivid sound. Levi's interpretation
is a bit generic _ there's room for a thousand touches of
personality in this music, left unexplored _ but for overall sound
and style, this recording is hard to beat.

   Since the 1960s, Koko Taylor has used a winning formula: Work
with great musicians, play barnburners, add raunch _ and top it
with the bluesiest growl this side of Howlin' Wolf. Now 64, the
queen of the Chicago blues is joined on a rockin' set by B.B. King
and Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Time has neither smoothed Taylor's voice
nor dulled her libido: ``When you check my oil, check it nice and
slow,'' she sings in a voice that could make a dipstick salute. The
highlight is the one departure: ``The Man Next Door'' features only
bluesman Keb' Mo' on steel guitar and harmonica _ and one of the
most expressive voices the blues has yet produced.

FAMILIES OF COLUMBINE VICTIMS SUE SCHOOL OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ky., Miss.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The families of three victims of the shootings last
year at Columbine High School have sued the school principal,
teachers and a security guard, charging that they knew the two
killers' propensity for violence and took no steps to intercede.
</P>
<P>
   Had they done so, the families said in complaints filed on
Monday with the Jefferson County District Court, the killings of 12
students and a teacher and the wounding of two dozen others might
never have happened. The lawsuits expanded charges previously filed
by the families against members of the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an awful lot of information that was made available
by these perpetrators,'' James A. Cederberg, a lawyer representing
one of the families, said, referring to the shooters, Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold. ``At some point, the message has got to be
received. These kids were up to something that was a threat to
everybody else at school. So how could it all have fallen through
the cracks?''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Jefferson County School District said that
none of the employees of Columbine, including principal Frank
DeAngelis, had any prior knowledge ``about the horrible plans or
the tragic actions'' of April 20, 1999. The spokesman, Rick
Kaufman, described the Columbine defendants as ``dedicated staff
members who have demonstrated time and again their commitment to
the care, safety and well-being of students and staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Charges against school officials after a mass shooting are not
unusual, and in at least two other cases, families of victims said
that the shooters had exhibited a similar tendency toward violence
as the Columbine lawsuits suggest.
</P>
<P>
   After a teen-age boy shot and killed three fellow students and
wounded five others in West Paducah, Ky., in 1998, victims'
families sued 30 school officials, including school board members,
teachers and a principal. In Mississippi, a school district was
sued after a 17-year-old student killed two classmates in 1997 at
Pearl High School.
</P>
<P>
   If the latest lawsuits involving Columbine employees are any
different, it may only be because, as the three new complaints
charge, the two killers provided more than casual evidence of their
interest in violence.
</P>
<P>
   The families of Isaiah Shoels, who was killed, and of Richard R.
Castaldo and Mark Taylor, who were wounded, said that in a class
taught by Garrett Talocco, a defendant, Harris showed videotapes he
had made that showed him and Klebold using guns to enact ``revenge
shootings'' of other Columbine students.
</P>
<P>
   In a creative writing class taught by Judy Kelly and a
psychology class taught by Tom Johnson, both defendants, the
complaint said that work by Harris and Klebold reflected ``hatred,
anger, possession and use of firearms, and the desire and intent to
kill and injure others.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits also charge that a sheriff's report discussing
Harris' Web site, on which he wrote about bomb-making and threats
of violence, had been forwarded to Neil Gardner, a deputy assigned
to Columbine as a security officer but that Gardner, who was also
named as a defendant, took no action.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all these incidents, the families said DeAngelis
should have been aware of problems with Harris and Klebold and
responded in a way that could have prevented the attack. The
families said that, as principal, DeAngelis was ``responsible for
the overall operation and safety of the school.''

 &HT;    LEGISLATORS SEEK TO END FEDERAL TIES TO BOY SCOUTS
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of Democratic House members says President
Clinton should resign as honorary head of the Boy Scouts of America
because of the group's policy against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawmakers also said at a Capitol news conference
Wednesday she was introducing legislation to revoke the Boy Scouts'
federal charter.
</P>
<P>
   The largely symbolic actions come in response to a recent
Supreme Court decision upholding the Boy Scouts' right as a private
organization to exclude homosexuals as leaders and possibly as
members.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 13 letter to Clinton, 11 Democratic House members said
that ``in order to disavow this policy of intolerance, as well as
to clarify any misconception of implicit presidential approval, we
urge you ... to resign as honorary head of the BSA.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonial position has been held by every president since
William Howard Taft in 1910, said Gregg Shields, a spokesman for
the Boy Scouts of America. ``We appreciate their support,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been tied up in Mideast peace negotiations at Camp
David, Md., and hasn't reviewed the request from his fellow
Democrats, said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important role, but it has been pushed aside by bigger
issues,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The same legislators also want Congress to repeal the
84-year-old federal charter for the Boy Scouts, said Rep. Lynn
Woolsey, D-Calif. She introduced a bill Wednesday to strike the
scouts' ``honorific'' charter granted to ``organizations with a
patriotic, charitable or educational purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a symbolic act,'' Woolsey conceded. But she said it would
``send a message that the Congress of the United States does not
support intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the Boy Scouts to be available to all boys,''
regardless of their sexual orientation, Woolsey said at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said the Boy Scouts is among many federally chartered
groups recognized by Congress as ``patriotic societies'' that
restrict membership to certain people. Other such groups include
the Catholic Veterans, Jewish War Veterans U.S.A., and Vietnam
Veterans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an honor to be a congressionally chartered
organization,'' he said, and the Scouts have strived ``to live up
to that honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said that time is running out on the current
congressional session and that any action on the bill would be
dependent on the Republican House leadership. However, she promised
to bring it up again in the next Congress, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The congresswoman was joined at the press conference by former
Eagle scouts who said the values they learned in scouting help them
later to come out as gay men.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts, along with his family and church, ``helped me
develop my own moral compass,'' said Graham Segroves, who attained
the Eagle rank in Knoxville, Tenn., and now works for the National
Gay and Lesbian Liberation Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Segroves said he is dismayed that national Boy Scout leadership
``says a gay man like me cannot be a positive role model'' for
members.
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved a federal charter for the Boy Scouts in 1916,
six years after the organization was founded.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 vote that the
Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders. The
ruling may also permit the group to reject gay boys as members.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she doesn't dispute the court decision but
disagrees with the Scouts' anti-gay policies. ``We're not saying
that the Boy Scouts are bad,'' said Woolsey, whose grown son is a
former scout. ``We're saying that intolerance is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the recent Supreme Court decision which
effectively allows the BSA to exclude homosexual males from its
leadership and potential membership, we are deeply concerned that
the office of the president, in its capacity as honorary head of
the BSA, is seen as giving implicit approval to this
self-proclaimed intolerant policy,'' the legislators wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 11 liberal Democrats who signed the letter to Clinton
was Rep. Cynthia McKinney of Georgia.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Running mate decision nears finish line
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush said today he hasn't yet decided on a running
mate but would soon. ``I will start notifying people,'' he said
without elaborating. He said his top criterion for picking someone
to share the ticket remains ``whether we can work together for the
good of the nation.'' Those most frquently mentioned as potential
running mates are Govs. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania and George Pataki of New York; Sens. Fred Thompson and
Bill Frist, both of Tennessee; and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before Kansas City-area law enforcement personnel
today, Al Gore upped the ante in his self-described bid to be ``a
law enforcement president'' by proposing to hire 10,000 new
prosecutors in communities nationwide. His proposal is modeled
after President Clinton's grant program to put 100,000 new
community police officers on the streets _ the COPS program, which
Gore has proposed expanding by 50,000. Crime is this week's main
focus for Gore, although he appears preoccupied by the Texas budget
and its shortfall of at least $610 million, due, state officials
say, to underestimated Medicaid costs.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING THE ATTACK TO FOE'S HOME FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is going to San Antonio Thursday to take aim at the
state's newly projected budget shortfall that critics warn may be
growing daily. Gore took a few preliminary shots today, blaming the
projected shortfall _ now officially put at $610 million _ on
George W. Bush mixing unwarranted tax cuts for the rich with
inadequately funded programs for the poor. ``How Governor Bush has
run Texas is relevant to the judgment the American people will make
as to how he would run the country if they ever gave him the
chance,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   THEY'LL ALL BE UPDATING THEIR WEB SITES NOW
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush will promote his new and improved Web site _
www.georgewbush.com _ in a new television ad, using fast-paced
music and tilted camera angles. The ad will begin running in the
San Francisco-San Jose and New York City markets on Friday. The
only talking in the ad is a video clip of Bush declaring that he's
running for president. The site will allow users to download
event-specific posters or placards for campaign events, listen to
live Internet ``radio shows,'' and enter ``fun and humorous''
contests. Bush joked that modern day technology could even play a
role in who he chooses as his running mate. A new qualification for
his partner, he said, would be ``whether they have a good Web
page.''
</P>
<P>
   LET'S SEE IF THOSE NEEDLES JUMP OR STAY LEVEL
</P>
<P>
   The man who accused Hillary Clinton of making an anti-Semitic
slur is willing to take a lie detector test or truth serum to prove
he's telling the truth. Paul Fray has accused Clinton of calling
him a ``Jew b------'' during an argument in 1974 in Arkansas. ``If
she does not have any recollection of it that's not my problem,
it's hers,'' Paul Fray said in an interview broadcast today on
ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' Fray said he does not think she is
anti-Semitic: ``It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.''
</P>
<P>
   KEEP FISHING FOR AN ANSWER
</P>
<P>
   At his brief news conference in Austin today, George W. Bush
took a swipe at opponent Al Gore for declining to take a clear
position on whether to breach Snake River dams in the Pacific
Northwest to save salmon. The administration's top environmental
officials were testifying before Congress today to make the case
that it isn't necessary at this time to take such drastic action
despite pleas by environmentalists. Business interests oppose
breaching the dams. Gore, in Kansas City, Mo., was asked about
Bush's criticism and he refused again to take a definitive stand.
``I'm going to review it carefully,'' he said, adding that he
believes all sides need to talk.
</P>
<P>
   STRIKE WHILE THE CONVENTION IS HOT
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Philadelphia city workers are threatening to strike
July 25 _ a week before the Republican convention _ if their union
and the city can't agree on a contract by then. A strike could mean
piles of uncollected garbage all over the city just as thousands of
people come to town. Herman ``Pete'' Matthews, president of the
blue-collar District Council 33 of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, said he's seen little
progress in three weeks of talks and that he hopes that setting a
strike deadline will put pressure on city negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   TORRICELLI TO TRENTON?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, whose fund-raising prowess propelled him
into Democratic leadership in his first Senate term, said today he
hopes to become New Jersey's next governor. Torricelli said he
admires a governor's ability to ``get things done'' and that he's
tired of fighting for incremental change. At the same time, he
would not have to give up his Senate seat while running for
governor next year. His Senate term expires in 2002. Republican
Gov. Christie Whitman is barred from seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   CALL GOING OUT FOR MCCALL
</P>
<P>
   In what labor leaders are calling a powerful signal that they
intend to support state Comptroller Carl McCall for governor in
2002, nearly all of New York's top union officials are holding a
fund-raiser for him Thursday in Manhattan. Officials said it was
far too soon for them or their unions to make formal endorsements,
but several of them told the New York Times that they intended the
event to be taken as an early sign of their sympathies. ``We'd
elect him tomorrow,'' one prominent union leader said.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER HEALTH PLAN FROM HILLARY
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton presented a plan to extend health insurance to
millions of Americans, including 1.1 million New Yorkers. Her plan,
which hews closely to the one proposed by Al Gore, could not be
further in details and scope from the ill-fated program she helped
to mastermind in 1994. Among other things, it would, expand an
existing government program to insure children, and steers clear
from visions of insuring the entire nation in one blow.
</P>
<P>
   HIT THE GROUND RUNNING
</P>
<P>
   In the first six weeks after he abruptly entered the Senate
race, Rick Lazio spent $1.58 million on TV advertising, and sought
to bolster his candidacy by hiring several political consultants
who had worked on John McCain's campaign. His latest campaign
records filed with the Federal Election Commission show that Lazio
collected $4.99 million in donations from April 1 through June 30.
He spent a total of $2.32 million, and his campaign now has $6.19
million in the bank, including money left over from his House
races.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK VOTE INCREASING
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans were the only race or ethnic group to defy the
trend of declining voter participation in congressional elections,
increasing their turnout at the polls from 37 percent of potential
black voters in 994 to 40 percent in 1998, according to a new
Census Bureau report. Nationwide, overall turnout by the voting-age
population was down from 45 percent in 1994 to 42 percent in 1998 _
about 3 million fewer voters _ the report said.
</P>
<P>
   AFTER COVERDELL, A DEMOCRAT?
</P>
<P>
   The death of Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell means Georgia likely
will be represented by two Democrats in the Senate _ at least for a
few months. Under Georgia law, Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes can
appoint an interim replacement until a Nov. 7 special election.
Barnes has said it is ``inappropriate'' to discuss any appointment
so soon after Coverdell's death.
</P>
<P>
   THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING!
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to improve relations with the Republican Party and learn
how to build a political party, emissaries from Russian President
Vladimir Putin's political faction plan to attend the GOP
convention in Philadelphia. Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), who is
arranging the trip, said the group will be led by Boris Gryzlov,
head of the pro-government Unity group in the Russian parliament.
``They want to cover both bases,'' Weldon explained. ``I've told
the Russians, don't put all your eggs in either party's basket.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG AD BUY FOR PRIESTS
</P>
<P>
   A national group of Roman Catholic priests, saying they want to
expose Christian politicians who support abortion rights as false
prophets, began an ad today aimed at making opposition to abortion
the top issue for voters. Priests for Life took out a full-page ad
in today's New York Times, and plans TV spots in selected markets
next month. ``Voters are free to elect whom they choose. But to be
free, one has to be informed of the implications of one's choice,
including the moral and spiritual implications,'' said the Rev.
Frank Pavone, head of the New York-based group.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD TIME TO BE A FATHER
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are retooling and bringing back a TV ad that stars Al
Gore as son and then father, a biographical montage that emphasizes
the importance of fatherhood. The heartwarming spot was originally
made for Father's Day, but it ran for only four days. Strategists
felt it was an effective demonstration of Gore's ideas on
fatherhood and of him as a person, and will begin airing it again
Thursday. George W. Bush discussed the importance of fathers
earlier this week, but Democrats said that's just a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE STATE, BIG DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island Republicans split over George W. Bush and John
McCain will be heading for separate hotels at the GOP convention.
Eight of 10 delegates backing McCain have rejected the party's
official choice of accommodations in Philadelphia, deciding instead
to stay just over the border in New Jersey. Some defecting
delegates say they'll save about $100 per night. But others say
they're making a statement that they're as independent as the man
they support.
</P>
<P>
   SO OK, GUYS, COOPERATE
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the Democratic attack against his record as
governor, George W. Bush told state legislators from across the
country that Texas is an example of good government _ ``a template
for change in Washington. We have put the public's interests
first.'' Bush said civility and bipartisanship, two traits missing
in Washington, flourish in Texas. ``In order to get anything done
... there has to be a new spirit and attitude in Washington, an
attitude you find in your states _ an attitude of cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   HIS TURN IN THE SPOTLIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party's Ralph Nader took advantage of his newfound
media attention Tuesday, speaking before a full house of
journalists and supporters at the National Press Club in
Washington. Nader said he would raise gas taxes and replace Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. He also took issue with Rep.
Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the openly gay congressman who has said Al
Gore would be a better supporter of civil rights than Nader. Said
Nader: ``I've been an advocate for civil liberties and civil rights
when he was trying to figure out how to play soccer in elementary
school, and I don't need to be lectured by him about this.''
</P>
<P>
   RACIAL INCLUSIVENESS? YOU CAN BET ON IT
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party, moving to head off any threat to George W.
Bush's message of racial inclusiveness, has repudiated a Washington
state GOP resolution calling for the elimination of American Indian
tribal governments. ``We are writing to assure you we reject this
resolution and everything it stands for. ... The elimination of
tribal governments is not an option,'' said a letter sighed by GOP
national chairman Jim Nicholson and Sens. John McCain of Arizona
and Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, the only Indian in the
Senate. Both political parties have sought donations from tribes
with successful gambling casinos.

   LONDON-CULTURE _ LONDON _ Take a walk in Brixton. Four miles
from the gray postcard propriety of Westminster, Brixton is a riot
of noise and color. It pulsates with hefty bass riffs and reggae
rhythms dancing from knee-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD
stores and appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market,
you hear the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish ?
occasionally even English. No less than Parliament House with Big
Ben and Churchill's statue, however, Brixton now is a part of the
fiber of modern London, a city rapidly being redefined by its
ethnic variety. ``Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is
this that is igniting such energy, buzz and creativity,'' wrote

   COMMENTARY:

<P>
   Kick butts by regulating Big Tobacco
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry is like a cockroach. Whacked by a 2-by-4 or
hit with a $145 billion verdict, it still won't die.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that the record-breaking judgment in a Florida
class-action suit against five tobacco companies will either be
reduced by an appeals court or paid off through higher cigarette
prices. Then it will be business as usual for this renegade
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco belongs under the control of the federal Food and Drug
Administration, but so far that hasn't happened. The industry has
fought off government oversight and curried influential allies
through generous campaign contributions. As a result, conglomerate
Philip Morris faces more stringent regulation of its Kraft macaroni
and cheese than its Marlboro cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the FDA, cigarette makers would be compelled to disclose
the contents of cigarettes and all potential health effects. FDA
regulation would end the industry's insidious practice of
advertising to kids and would force companies to address the damage
caused by their product.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of regulation has allowed cigarette companies to
conceal their in-house research on the deadly nature of their
product. In its massive verdict against the industry, the Florida
jury recognized and punished that callous disregard for human life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet elected officials still seem intent on rewarding tobacco
companies for their deadly deceit. Many states, including Georgia,
have passed laws designed to shield the industry from its sins and
insulate it from public outrage. Those laws were spurred by Big
Tobacco's $246 billion settlement with the states in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That settlement did not decimate Big Tobacco. On the contrary,
revenues and profits rose in its aftermath, fueled by a 45-cent
rise in the cost of a pack of cigarettes. Nor will this $145
billion verdict bury the industry, despite what Big Tobacco
attorneys insist. If the appeals court upholds the judgment,
cigarette manufacturers will increase prices again and continue to
prosper. Cigarettes cost almost nothing to produce and are so
addictive that smokers will pay whatever is demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco does not need Georgia lawmakers fretting over its
well-being and legislating special protections. It's true there are
fewer tobacco jobs in the United States, but that's because the
industry put its profits ahead of its patriotism in opting for
cheaper overseas production and labor.
</P>
<P>
   As long as there are 46 million smokers in the country, there
will be profitable cigarette companies. Those companies ought to be
regulated.

 EDS: Has sidebar, TRAVEL-ESHOPPING-CHART 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travel researched and booked on the Internet is one of the
fastest-growing segments of the Web. But does that mean it's more
efficient, easier, and cheaper than the old-fashioned method of
phone calls and travel agents?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, I would have argued vigorously that it
is. After all, I've found some great last-minute air fares on Web
sites; I've also gotten a couple of hotel deals and a steal on a
flight to Europe, booked months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But then I spent a couple of days conducting a little
experiment: trying to book a cruise, a weekend in Las Vegas, and a
Cancun vacation through the most popular Web sites and through
traditional travel agents. And _ surprise _ the two methods turned
out to be a draw.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything else done online, the big plus is
convenience; you can order airline tickets or book a hotel in the
middle of the night or while wearing a mud mask and fuzzy slippers.
If you're lucky, and flexible on your destination and travel dates,
you can find some astounding deals.
</P>
<P>
   But is it faster?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   More frustrating?
</P>
<P>
   Often.
</P>
<P>
   Still, travel is a popular topic on the Net, with more than
1,000 commercial Web sites devoted to the subject. More than 52.2
million people used the Internet for travel planning in 1999, an
increase of 54 percent from the previous year, according to a
survey by the Travel Industry Association of America. The same
report said that 16.5 million people booked travel online in 1999,
an increase of 146 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So it's worth taking a look at how best to use these resources.
</P>
<P>
   For this test case, I visited three large all-purpose sites,
Expedia, Travelocity and Travelscape, which was recently purchased
by Expedia. I also called three local travel agents, chosen at
random, to whom I had never spoken previously. (I didn't identify
myself as a reporter until afterward.)
</P>
<P>
   My goal was to find the best deal on three vacations: a
seven-day Caribbean cruise; a three-day weekend in Cancun, Mexico;
and a three-day weekend in Las Vegas. I asked for moderate but nice
lodgings _ not the Ritz but not a Motel 6 _ for two people. The
trips were to be taken during the first two weeks of December.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   Web sites:
</P>
<P>
   I spend a fair amount of time online and had visited each of the
sites in question, so I expected this to go quickly. Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Using the high-speed T1 Internet connection through my office
computer _ much faster than the 56K modem on my laptop at home _ I
still spent a lot of time watching pages load and then having them
crash or lock up. Sometimes, this was in the middle of a search,
forcing me to start over. What I expected to accomplish in an hour
or two ended up taking a large part of a day.
</P>
<P>
   I also realized that although the Web may be great for
last-minute deals, like the Internet specials the major airlines
offer on weekend flights, it's another thing when you're trying to
find specific destinations at a specific time. Sometimes, search
engines brought up great packages that weren't available on the
dates I needed. Other times, prices were a couple of hundred
dollars higher than I'd been quoted at other sites or by an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Each site was reasonably efficient and, best of all, offered
pictures and details about hotels and cruise ships, letting you see
what you were getting into. But each had its quirks:
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity had some of the best graphics on its hotels, and it
was easy to compare packages, but it seemed most likely to crash at
an inopportune time.
</P>
<P>
   Expedia, too often, just wanted to give links to other sites
that varied greatly in quality of information offered; sometimes
you couldn't book online at these sites but were given a phone
number to call.
</P>
<P>
   Travelscape's search engine produced relevant results fastest,
but in a plain-Jane format; it offered fewer options and doesn't
sell cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents:
</P>
<P>
   Even using agents that I'd never used before, I got quotes
immediately after I explained what I was looking for. (One took the
information and called me back within 30 minutes with prices and
specifics; the others kept me on the line while they looked.) All
three said they had been to the destinations in question and would
refer me only to properties they knew. The prices, for the most
part, were equivalent to or better than what I found on the
Internet, sometimes for the same properties.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drawback, of course, is that you don't see the
properties; to get brochures, you need to visit an office or wait
for materials to be sent to you in the mail. (One agent referred me
to the Internet to look up hotels he'd recommended.) And unless you
know and trust the agent, you might be suspicious as to why a
certain hotel or cruise line is being recommended over others; is
it really the best option, or is the agent getting some kind of
financial incentive to sell it?
</P>
<P>
   The experiment did reinforce one valuable lesson: As with any
major purchase, it pays to do your research before whipping out
your credit card. And it's wise to use every tool at your disposal.
Traditional travel agency or Internet travel site? At this point,
the smart traveler uses them all.

 &HT;    Drought has us holding our ground, not working it
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Financed in part by the harvest and sale of one
of my kidneys, we recently upgraded to House 2.0. It's in a nice
neighborhood with big trees, two Ford Expeditions in every garage
and lush, expertly groomed lawns that appear to be tended with the
assistance of Paul Mitchell hair care products.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I have no business being there, so I secretly
applauded the city's edict over the weekend to impose mandatory
watering restrictions because it enables me _ in the guise of being
a good, environmentally proper Austinite _ to ignore the lawn, to
watch this magnificent green space turn to brown and eventually,
sometime next month, burst into flame. For someone as impaired as I
when it comes to lawn care, this is liberating.
</P>
<P>
   Burn, baby, burn, I say.
</P>
<P>
   The old neighborhood _ small yards, 10-year-old Volvos, no
garages _ was different. Mowing there appeared to be strictly
optional, and watering was a suburban extravagance. The people next
door had a great lawn, but it was Xeriscaped, festooned with
greenery that (unlike, oh, turf grass) was meant to grow in these
parts. The primary user of the back yard was our large, profoundly
stupid dog, and I get all misty when I think about the dry,
neglected grass crunching under her clumsy paws. Not watering led
to not mowing, which led to a lot more time devoted to more
worthwhile pursuits such as beer. Not that I didn't try for a
while. In addition to making a steadfastly half-hearted effort at
keeping the lawn together, I planted basil. It died. So did the
jalapenos. The rosemary just sort of sat there, too proud to
succumb but too neglected to grow, which I'm told is what it
ideally does. Potted plants committed suicide on the way home from
the greenhouse rather than subject themselves to our deadly
combination of indifference and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Those were, I now realize, the salad days, except without the
salad. Then the yard got so ugly we had to sell the house and move.
</P>
<P>
   The greenery around the new place struck both my wife and me
when we toured it. That great back yard with more than a dozen
trees. The Mexican oregano. The plants in pots and the shrubs out
front. This is a great yard, and we will take care of it, we
resolved. I even spent several minutes seriously weighing the
benefits of gas vs. electric weed whackers. In a few hours after we
closed on the place, however, the back yard looked like Sherman had
just marched across it and the oregano drooped in defeat. The
corners of the front yard, where we couldn't quite position the
sprinkler to hit, turned the color of Kansas wheat.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the neighbors' lawns continued to look like
picture postcards from County Cork.
</P>
<P>
   Then the mandatory restrictions kicked in, and with them a kind
of reverse competition. A well-kept, painfully green lawn suggests
a home where the husband works in a dull but dependable trade, the
wife answers the door in June Cleaver heels and the kids never talk
back to their parents. This is not anywhere near my life (I don't
work, my wife only wears heels to the beach and my three-year-old
teaches me cuss words) and I see no reason to compel my lawn to lie
for me. The goal now is not who has the greenest lawn, but whose
will die most quickly. In this, we're off to a smashing start. The
neighbors are brown with envy. Wait'll I put the washing machine
and the pit bull in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   One of the enduringly baffling qualities about life in Central
Texas for me, a non-native (my wife is from here _ what's your
excuse?), is why people spend so much time working their ground,
attempting to keep things alive that simply weren't meant to grow
here. Allow me to note that, a) it's much too hot to be outside,
and b) despite what you hear from well-meaning horticulture
professionals with no financial motivation for telling you
otherwise, absolutely nothing is meant to grow here. True, there's
the Xeriscaping movement, the success of which, I suspect, is due
to animal sacrifice or something, and said movement has made
inroads among enlightened yard-diggers, but far too many of us
spend excessive water, money and time trying to keep our greenery
green. This makes lazy people such as myself feel terribly
inadequate, but not so inadequate as to effect a behavioral change.
I mean, ``The Simpsons'' are on every night.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful lawns are the domain of the overly socialized. But if
this fine drought holds for a few more weeks, the new place ought
to look a lot like home.

   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Tex., said the gray-market provision was eliminated from the
trade bill because it would have opened the door to numerous tax
amendments when it reached the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal with the bill was to create a non-controversial bill
devoted entirely to trade,'' Archer said. ``While I do not think
the gray-market act is controversial, this committee has worked on
this trade bill for over two years and we did not want it to be
subject to tax amendments once it is on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he hopes to take action on the proposal later this
session.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would have banned the sale of cigarettes labeled
``For use outside the U.S.'' and would have required the
destruction of all gray-market cigarettes that are seized by the
federal government. It also would have prohibited the
re-importation of previously exported cigarettes except for returns
to their original manufacturer.

ATTACKS BY GUERRILLA GROUP FOLLOW ANNOUNCEMENT OF INCREASED U.S.
AID 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Apparently responding to the passage in the
U.S. Congress of $1.3 billion in aid for Colombia's armed forces,
the country's largest guerrilla group has begun a series of attacks
on isolated towns and police headquarters in recent weeks, killing
more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, carried out by guerrillas operating in large units,
have underscored the armed forces' lack of mobility and
intelligence tools that the aid package is intended to improve.
They have also further weakened President Andres Pastrana by
hampering his efforts to bring the military and the opposition
Liberal Party fully behind his effort to negotiate a peace
settlement with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which have been carried out by the country's
largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia,
or FARC, are considered so serious that on Monday the army
announced that it would reinforce its defenses around the capital
and put 7,000 troops on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts say that the guerrillas in recent months have
been stepping up their efforts to organize more urban cells and
even a clandestine political party in an effort to expand their
military reach from far-flung rural fronts to the cities. And the
latest attacks appear intended to disperse the armed forces into
static, defensive positions scattered around the country, the
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the attacks have been staged from a large demilitarized
zone handed to the guerrillas by the Colombian government in 1998
as a gesture to promote peace negotiations, which have sputtered
for more than a year. Military and police units were removed from
the zone, giving the Marxist rebels a safe-haven in the heart of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Senior military officials said the rebels appear to be
attempting to expand the zone, which is already the size of
Switzerland, and create corridors to other areas they control in
the southern provinces of Tolima and Huila to improve their supply
lines and offensive range.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask why we don't simply surround the zone, but it is
impossible,'' Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez said in an
interview this week. ``It is easy for them to attack and return to
the zone the same day without having to carry heavy provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious of the recent attacks came late Friday night
when 180 rebels attacked the ranching town of Roncesvalles, 100
miles southwest of Bogota, overwhelming a police station staffed by
14 policemen, killing 13 of them. In a coordinated action, the
rebels blew up sections of highway leading to the town to block
army reinforcements, and then launched their attack with a barrage
of homemade missiles made from propane gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
   One policeman who hid said his colleagues had surrendered and
were then executed. When the armed forces finally arrived the next
afternoon, they found the mayor's office, a telephone office, a
supermarket and a dozen houses destroyed. They also found
propaganda pamphlets criticizing the new U.S. aid package strewn
around the town.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel communiques have called the U.S. aid program ``a threat to
the peace process.'' In a recent interview with the Associated
Press, a FARC leader, Ivan Rios, compared the stepped up U.S.
involvement to ``throwing fuel on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid package will provide 60 Black Hawk and Huey
helicopters as well as support for intelligence and training to a
new anti-narcotics army brigade that will provide protection for
stepped up police activities in the southern provinces of Putamayo
and Caqueta. The two sparsely populated provinces are FARC
strongholds that contain 300,000 acres of coca for cocaine
production. It will take more than a year for all three battalions
of the new brigade to be outfitted, trained and begin full
operations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Colombian military officials said they hope the aid will help
them attack the guerrillas' main source of funding _ the taxes and
protection money the rebels get from coca growers and traffickers _
that have fueled the guerrilla war in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mao said that guerrillas are like fish that swim in a sea of
popular support,'' said Gen. Fernando Tapias Stahelin, the
commander of the Colombian armed forces, in an interview this week.
``But in Colombia the guerrillas do not have popular support nor
foreign support. Their support comes from narcotrafficking and
kidnapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the U.S. program note that the anti-narcotics brigade
will not operate in the demilitarized zone, and that the guerrillas
can simply move their operations out of Putamayo and Caqueta while
planters grow their coca deeper in the jungle. They also express
concern that stepped up anti-coca spraying operations will drive
growers into the arms of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the guerrillas are still debating how to respond to
the increased U.S. aid and whether to step up the conflict by
attacking U.S. businesses and military personnel or by using
sophisticated rockets to bring down the new helicopters. U.S. and
Colombian military officials say the guerrillas have the money and
contacts to buy such missiles, if they do not already have them.

PROJECT GIVES SMALL NONPROFIT GROUPS A BIG-TIME MAPPING TOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA P. McNAMARA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Matthew Bregman, the Brooklyn Academy of Music's
development director, initiated a marketing plan to spur
neighborhood real estate development for use by the performing
arts, he searched for a way to project accurate images of the
borough's landmarks, potential sources of financing and residential
areas lacking access to the arts. He found the solution in the New
York Public Interest Research Group's computer mapping software.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting the project to BAM's board without visual aids would
have been ineffective, Bregman said. ``It's kind of like if you
tried to play chess without a chess board,'' he said. ``The visual
difference is extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the research group, known as NYPIRG, began the
Community Mapping Assistance Project (www.cmap.nypirg.org) to
provide customized computer mapping services to nonprofit groups
like the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The Web-based program generates
detailed maps using sophisticated Geographic Information Systems
software. Since the project's inception, NYPIRG has been engaged in
more than 250 projects for almost 100 nonprofit clients.
</P>
<P>
   Although many federal government agencies and for-profit
corporations regularly use Geographic Information Systems software
to present statistical data visually, nonprofit organizations do
not often rely on the costly software mapping programs because
those groups lack the financial and highly specialized technology
personnel resources, Steve Romalewski, CMAP's technology director,
said. NYPIRG's service fills this need by providing the technology
that can plot an organization's data and provides
computer-generated maps, graphs and reports tailored to the needs
of New York state's nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``These maps are not just a convenience,'' Bregman said. ``It's
a necessity to have this technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit organizations use the GIS mapping technology primarily
to facilitate their advocacy wrk. The United Hospital Fund of New
York, for example, uses the technology on its Web site to display
the locations of ambulatory care sites, hospitals and nursing homes
(www.uhfnyc.org). By entering a ZIP code, people can find phone
numbers and other information to get the help they need, said
plained Amy Cohen, the United Hospital Fund's technology editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to return to our site when they see how easy it is
to find these locations for their elderly family members,'' Cohen
said, ``and it's easily accessibly for volunteers who want to help
out in local centers.'' The Web site receives 400 to 500 hits per
month.
</P>
<P>
   CMAP also serves as a political tool for nonprofits lobbying for
increased political or financial support by creating digital images
of an organization's membership, demographic patterns and
legislative districts. Interactive sites that use the CMAP
technology include Who Represents Me? New York City residents can
enter their address to find representatives at the federal, state
and city levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Council Finder is extraordinarily helpful. Lobbyists in
the nonprofit community could spend two hours just to locate the
right people to contact and to find out who your representative
is,'' Bregman said.
</P>
<P>
   Converting data from a raw statistical database into a visual
image makes it easier for nonprofit groups to find sources of
financing. The mapping software also helps advocacy groups mobilize
public opinion. Arnold Cohen, president of the Partnership for the
Homeless, a nonprofit that operates homeless shelters in New York
City, uses maps on the organization's Web site to show lobbyists
which representatives to focus on to increase New York City's
financing of homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a detailed map, we can see our network of 140 shelters
sprinkled throughout the boroughs,'' Cohen said, ``which makes us
more informed when we speak to congressional or City Council
representatives. We also see where there are gaps in our network so
we can push for more funding.''
</P>
<P>
   On its own Web site, CMAP creates maps that draw on its
databases of research stored during the past 10 years from NYPIRG's
environmental and consumer projects. Once the figures are converted
to digital form, nonprofit organizations can translate the numbers
into vivid visual displays that increase public awareness. The
visual images of demographic and income patterns retrieved from
1990 census data enable some organizations to examine the locations
of social service centers. Similarly, a Top 21 Dirty Power Plants
in NY link on CMAP's Web site draws users from NYPIRG's
environmental research projects to a map with the location of power
plants and emission reports for each plant.

LOOKIN' MIGHTY PRETTY:OKLAHOMA CITY'S REDEVELOPMENT IS INCREASING
ITS TOURISM TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
 OKCITY KANSAS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 TIM JANICKE  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because I-35 is the mother road for many of us around Kansas
City, The Kansas City Star decided to explore its length _ 1,593
miles _ this summer. Watch for the stories in Travel each week
until Sept. 3. For more pictures from Oklahoma City or to read
earlier stories, log on to www.kcstar.com//fyi//fyi.htm. Look for
the I-35 Odyssey icon.
</P>
<P>
   Next week: See every kind of lighter imaginable in Guthrie,
Okla.
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
Oklahoma City is gettin' hip. That's right, Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be that a lot of Kansas Citians saw Oklahoma City as a
bottleneck in their race to get to Texas. Now it's becoming a
place, not just to slow down, but to stop.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons is Bricktown.
</P>
<P>
   Once a decaying, 20-block warehouse district on the southeast
corner of downtown, Bricktown was named for its brick sidewalks and
streets. Revitalization began in the mid-1990s, and now there are
restaurants and bars, the Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ball Park and
a canal with water taxis, as well as other attractions and
businesses. That's right, in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sophisticates such as we here in Kansas City don't
give much respect to Oklahoma City. We'd rather point to our
Country Club Plaza, Westport, the River Market or any of a dozen
plans on the drawing board that we think are going to elevate us in
the eyes of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But Oklahoma City's $700 million downtown renovation is going to
put it on the map, too. A renovated convention center adjacent to
Bricktown and three new downtown hotels are expected to
dramatically increase the number of conventions there. That's
right, in Oklahoma City. In the beginning
</P>
<P>
   Bricktown Brewery manager Jim Cowan marvels at the explosion of
restaurants and bars in the area since 1992, when the first brewpub
in the state opened in Bricktown. Now there are 18, with more
planned or under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year we seemed to be on the verge of a boom,''
said Cowan, who also is president of the Bricktown Merchants
Association.
</P>
<P>
   A theater complex and 20,000-seat downtown arena, both slated to
open in 2001, will be magnets that will draw more people to
Bricktown, Cowan said. He hints that Oklahoma City will make a
strong bid for the Big 12 basketball tournament once the new arena
opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last trigger (of Bricktown development) will be the movie
theater project that is close to starting construction,'' he said.
The complex will have 20 regular movie screens plus a 3-D IMAX
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the brewery stands Chelino's, with by far the best
Mexican food I found on my nearly two weeks this spring exploring
I-35 _ and that includes Laredo, Texas, hard by the Rio Grande,
where I began this I-35 odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Chelino's has a main level plus has two upstairs dining rooms
and three outside terraces. It's huge. For me, the chicken fajitas
made the trip worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Chelino's outside terraces overlook the Bricktown Canal, where
water taxis glide day and night. The canal, which connects to the
North Canadian River south of downtown, was built for the taxis. A
taxi pass will let you get on and off the taxis all day; hours vary
from late morning until 11 p.m. and later on weekends, holidays and
during special events. A narrator describes points of interest
along the way. Brick paths line both sides of the canals for
pedestrians. You could ride the water taxis for transportation, but
most attractions in Bricktown are no more than three or four blocks
from one another. Could be crowded
</P>
<P>
   So far business bustles some days, then lags on others, Cowan
said. When the theaters open next year, he thinks crowds will
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the weekends things are fantastic,'' he said, ``but the
crowds are event-driven. When we have an arena football game, when
we have the RedHawks (the Triple-A baseball team), then Bricktown
is covered up. If we have a Wednesday night in the summer with no
baseball, football or conventions, you don't see as much activity
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ballpark anchors the southeast
corner of Bricktown, and its brick-dominated architecture blends
nicely with the brick streets and sidewalks. Completed in 1998, the
park seats 15,000 and draws more than 650,000 fans each year to see
the RedHawks, a farm club of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a message here if you read between the lines. Call ahead
if you want to make sure there's a place to park and room in the
restaurants to eat.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at 9 p.m. July 1, a Saturday, my family pulled off
I-35 on our annual trip to see my in-laws in Texas. Bound for
Chelino's, we threaded our way through Bricktown. The streets and
parking lots were packed with holiday revelers. We opted to pass on
through and stop on the way back, after the holiday. By the
afternoon of July 5, we found it easy to park and found plenty of
places to sit in Chelino's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fourth of July is the biggest weekend down here,'' Cowan
said. ``We have a history of fireworks displays and parades, stuff
that's pedestrian-friendly. Last year (on the Fourth of July) we
marked the opening of the canal.'' The renaissance
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City's revival was born of despair, said Sara Atkins,
an economic development officer with the Greater Oklahoma City
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to 1993 when we were trying to get a major
airline, and we didn't get 'em,'' she said. The mayor then, Ron
Norick, decided to call the airline to find out why it stiffed OKC,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So anyway, Ron calls them up and says, `How come you didn't
choose us?' They said, `Quite frankly, we don't think your city is
that attractive.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron said, `We're going to have to invest in ourselves.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Norick went to the taxpayers for a sales tax increase. The
$350,000, raised over 5 years, is being matched by private funds,
Atkins said. The money goes for several projects, of which
Bricktown is currently the most visible. Two other Oklahoma City
business districts, Automobile Alley and Stockyards City, were
included in the same renovation project. Both will cater primarily
to business tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bricktown buildings are still under renovation. The old
Santa Fe Depot, for instance, will be completed next year, but is
already serving as an Amtrak station with trains going south to
Fort Worth and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bricktown is a dining and entertainment draw, many
tourists stop in Oklahoma City to visit the memorial that
commemorates one of its greatest tragedies. The Oklahoma City
National Memorial, on the north side of downtown, was dedicated
April 19 of this year, at the site of the bombing of the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The design features a reflecting pool and 168 chairs, one for
each of the bombing victims who died. Atkins, a survivor who was
working in the adjacent Journal-Record Building during the blast,
said the new memorial is ``absolutely beautiful at night.''
Vacation time?
</P>
<P>
   To the vacationer, Oklahoma City used to be nothing more than
truck stops and gas stations, interspersed with motels. You might
eat or get gas, and if you were tired, you might sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's Bricktown, too, a welcome respite. You might not
plan a week's vacation here, but there's enough to keep you busy
for a day or two. According to Chamber of Commerce estimates,
Bricktown drew 4 million people last year. The chamber projects 3
million additional customers by 2002, after the arena and theater
openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to be down here, to have people have Oklahoma
City on the map when they think of tourism.'' Cowan said.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Oklahoma City. OKLAHOMA CITY INFO: Farm club

<P>
   The Oklahoma RedHawks, who play baseball at the Southwestern
Bell Bricktown Ball Park, are a Triple-A farm club for the Texas
Rangers. Taxi please

A NOVEL IS NOT ENOUGH FOR 007 FANS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JEFF GUINN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a half-century makes.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven years ago, author Ian Fleming introduced James Bond,
agent 007 of the British Secret Service, in the novel ``Casino
Royale.'' The suave and deadly Bond quickly became a literary
sensation _ and the poster boy for a hip, martini-sipping,
villain-pounding, woman-loving way of life that would be embraced
as the ideal by a generation of men. In the early 1960s, a series
of films based on Fleming's Bond adventures made actor Sean Connery
a star and kept Fleming's hero-spy novels at the top of the
bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1964, Fleming died. With permission from his estate,
nearly 20 subsequent Bond novels have appeared, written variously
by Kingsley Amis, John Gardner and Raymond Benson. A new Bond book
by Benson, titled ``Doubleshot,'' has just been published by
Putnam. Although the James Bond mystique continues to fascinate,
the excitement and influence of the novels are long gone. Many,
probably most, modern-day James Bond fans skip the books and live
for 007's onscreen exploits.
</P>
<P>
   James Rumley, news editor for the popular Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang
Bang Web site (www.ianfleming.org/mkkbb/), which chronicles all
things Bond, thinks he knows why interest in the literary Bond is
in such serious decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bond fans look first and foremost now for movies because (the
movies) still present Bond as a sort of superhero,'' says Rumley, a
22-year-old who first shared Bond gossip on the Internet when he
was 16. ``I read all the books, too, and for a while they tried to
make James Bond politically correct. We can't have that. It takes
the fun out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In particular, John Gardner tried to make Bond politically
correct, and I think he alienated fans,'' says Benson, the current
keeper of the Bond literary portfolio. ``They want a smoking,
gambling, womanizing man.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gardner's Bond novels, 007 did clearly mellow. After the
death of longtime boss/mentor M, a woman became the new head of the
British Secret Service. And Bond changed with the times. He became
more sensitive and aware, he recognized that women had more to
offer than their sexuality. He watched what he ate and drank. Once,
he even let somebody else drive the car.
</P>
<P>
   And hard-core fans, steeped in the idea of Bond as the ultimate
male fantasy, recoiled in horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Bond shouldn't have to worry about AIDS,'' Rumley says.
``I agree that some things in the books have to be updated; it
would be silly to do period books, keeping Bond in the '60s. But
his attitude has to stay the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   Benson's first 007 literary turn came in 1984, when he published
``The James Bond Bedside Companion,'' which is out of print.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of established me as a Bond expert,'' says the writer,
a native Texan who lives in Chicago. ``I had loved the early Bond
books and movies, and in doing this reference book, I met with Ian
Fleming's family. They seemed to like my book.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid '90s, sales of individual Bond titles were flagging _
none was making the bestseller lists _ and, Benson says, ``John
Gardner decided he didn't want to do them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumley, for one, was glad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardner tried to add more to Bond's character, to modernize
him,'' he says. ``That upset purists like me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the big-screen Bond was getting the same
modern-day makeover, causing Timothy Dalton to flee the franchise
in failure and MGM/UA to consider abandoning the series. It took a
recommitment to the original concept of Bond and the casting of
Pierce Brosnan to breathe life back into the secret agent in 1995's
``GoldenEye.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, starting with the aptly titled short story ``Blast
From the Past,'' which appeared in ``Playboy'' magazine, Benson set
out to recapture the old Bond swagger in print. Irma Bunt, 007's
old ``From Russia With Love'' adversary, returned in ``Blast.''
Afterward, Benson felt ready to tackle a full-length Bond novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fleming people asked if I wanted to take a shot,'' he
says. ``I had to write an outline, then the first few chapters on
spec. In March '96, I got the go-ahead to write `Zero Minus Ten'
(published in 1997).''
</P>
<P>
   Although his books are published by Putnam, all Benson's Bond
material must be approved by the Ian Fleming Foundation in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work for the Fleming family, and go to England to meet with
them three times a year,'' Benson says. ``I give them an outline
for every projected book. After it's approved, I go to work.
They've suggested minor things, but nothing major. I've never had
an outline rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges for Benson or any other approved Bond
chronicler is how to keep the memory of Fleming and his work alive,
since younger 007 fans may have never heard of Bond's creator.
</P>
<P>
   ``That name doesn't mean anything to anybody but longtime
fans,'' says Edward Gross, who edited ``Bond and Beyond,'' a book
about 007 films that is out of print. ``Remember, the first movies
were all based on Fleming's books. Now, they're original
screenplays, so people have forgotten about James Bond's literary
roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross even speculates that young Bond fans might not enjoy the
Fleming books or even the movies of the '60s and '70s based on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching `Goldfinger' recently, which I think is a great
movie,'' Gross says. ``My 11-year-old son watched a while, and he
asked me, `Why are they spending so much time talking?' He wanted
nonstop action like the modern movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it's part of his charge to keep James Bond as
envisioned by Ian Fleming, Benson admits that common sense about
modern-day expectations weigh heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public these days wants the cinematic Bond in books,''
Benson says. ``So, more than in the early books, my Bond has a
sense of humor. We may refer to earlier books and events, but some
we don't pinpoint. We don't mention the fact that Bond was in World
War II, for instance. The younger readers don't want him to be too
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, in the long run, still might not be enough to resuscitate
the book series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the films over the last decade, I don't think the Bond
books would even be around,'' Rumley says. ``The Bond movies now
have tremendous momentum. We had `The World Is Not Enough' last
year, and we're all waiting for the next one. That's not true of
the books.''

   COVERSENATE _ WASHINGTON _ An official day of remembrance hasn't
been designated yet, but tributes poured forth on the Senate floor
Wednesday morning for the late Sen. Paul Coverell (R-Ga.). A vase
of white roses sat on his Senate desk, now coverd in black.
(Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   COVERDELL-MEDIA _ Piedmont hospital's announcement that the
media reports were wrong and Coverdell was alive (though he had
died 10 minutes before) was a huge media disaster for the hospital
and spokeswoman Nina Montanaro. We'll try to trace how that
happened, and what the hospital will do in the future to prevent
those kinds of blunders, plus include what the networks plan to do
on funeral coverage for the senator. (Jubera, Druckenmiller,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   COVERDELL-STROKE _Trying to get the doctors/hospital to talk to
us about Coverdell's treatment, which may be impossible given that
the family must grant permission for that to happen. But we'll try
to get docs to talk about how people with his condition are
typically treated and how important it is to get to the hospital
immediately, not wait three weeks like he did. Doctors probably
could have saved him, perhaps with interventional radiology to shut
off the bleeding aneurysm _ one of the specialities at Piedmont.
We'll try to reach Dr. Lou Jacobs, who specializes in that, and
other doctors who might comment on the difficulty of treating the
kind of stroke Coverdell had. (Guthrie, Atlanta

   GEORGIA-SENATE _ With the unexpected passing of Georgia's senior
Senator, speculation is already rampant over who'll run for the
seat in November, and who, if anyone, Barnes will appoint to the
seat. Everyone from Zell Miller to Johnny Isakson has been
mentioned. But nobody's talking much on the record yet out of
respect for Coverdell. Still, as one wonk said, don't be surprised
if potential candidates are buttonholing people at Coverdell's
funeral. (Chapman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

settlements, a proposal to ban the sale of ``gray market''

   GAY-SCOUTS _ WASHINGTON _ A group of liberal House Democrats on
Wednesday sent a letter to President Clinton asking him to step

symbolic action _ following a Supreme Court ruling that the
organization could bar homosexuals. (Dart, Cox News Service)

 &HT;    Wagoner rolls again
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bless his pea-pickin' heart. Porter Wagoner, the last living,
rhinestoned relic of the Grand Ole Opry, has made a new album that
is as naive and untarnished as Grandma's Sunday china. No, he still
can't sing all that well. And the simplistic arrangements and
melodies here sound like Wagoner, 72, hasn't turned on the radio in
35 years. In fact, most of the tunes are so literal and trite they
could have been in the soundtrack of Robert Altman's searing
indictment of country music, the movie ``Nashville.'' (Remember
Karen Black's ``Rolling Stone (Gathers No Moss)''?) But in today's
country music, Wagoner's outing is like a big spoonful of cowpeas _
simple, familiar and satisfying. Whether it's a song about missing
the spring nesting of bluebirds (``Watching Eagles Fly'') or
childhood memories about a kid down the street nicknamed
``Scooter'' (``House on Mulberry Street''), the tunes are as
wistful and heart-warming as old black-and-white photos in a
scrapbook. If you are looking for the kind of scratchy country
music that will have you crying in your beer in spite of uneven
quality, here it is.

 &HT;    Hit-man comedy wholly satisfying a `The Whole Nine Yards' from
Willis
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a comedy with a body count and familiar mafia premise, but
with enough twists to overcome its familiarity. Bruce Willis stars
as a hit man who moves next door, incognito, to henpecked dentist
Matthew Perry. As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' Willis doesn't seem to
mind playing genial straight man to his cast mates: Perry, Patricia
Arquette and Kevin Pollack. The movie's high point is Amanda Peet's
giddy performance as a dental technician who wants to make a very
unusual career change.

be too scattered for some. Like the skirmishes between the
pro-South Bushwackers and the pro-North Jayhawkers, the movie is
random, sprawling and piecemeal, with Quantrill's Raid on Lawrence,
Kan., providing the blood-soaked centerpiece and moral fulcrum. But
others may find it a sublime contemplation on the warring factions
of the American nature _ settling scores vs. settling down. Grade:
B+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The War Zone'' (R) _ Actor-turned-director Tim Roth has
created the most Bergman-esque movie since the great Ingmar Bergman
stopped making movies. On the desolate coast of Devon, a seemingly
normal family is beset by secrets and lies that lead to total
breakdown. The teen son (Freddie Cunliffe) suspects his father (Ray
Winstone) is having sex with his older sister (Lara Belmont). A
brutal, challenging film that asks you to take a risky journey.
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Ninth Gate'' (R) _ This major disappointment from Roman
Polanski stars Johnny Depp in a tale of old books, the devil and a
gateway to satanic powers. Imagine one of those seasonal Halloween
horror houses, but designed by librarians. And what do you get at
the end of the trek? The spectacle of a bunch of rich twits in
black robes, play-acting a satanic mass. Grade: D +
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``What Planet Are You From'' (R) _ It's ``I Married a Stand-Up
From Outer Space.'' A strangely desperate and unfunny comedy about
a galactically equipped alien and his mission to breed with Earth
women. Poor Annette Bening plays one of the women; Garry Shandling,
who also co-wrote and produced this mess, is the R-rated
extraterrestrial. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _Stephen Whitty, Newhouse News Service
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Big Tease'' (R) _ A slight bit of silliness about a
Glasgow hairdresser (Craig Ferguson) who thinks he's been invited
to compete in a stylist competition held in L.A. Ferguson is
pleasant enough, and there's good work by Frances Fisher, Mary
McCormack and David Rasche as L.A. types. But for the most part,
the satire is tepid, and the movie more often than not takes the
low-comedy road. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rosetta'' (R) _ When the grim teenage heroine gets thrown
into a muddy pond in this Belgian flick, you'll want to cheer.
Teenage Emilie Dequenne won the top acting award at Cannes for her
deeply annoying performance as a teenager who will do anything it
takes to get a job and get away from her trailer-park life. It's a
slice-of-life flick that mistakes gloom for artistry. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Isn't She Great'' (R) _ Isn't great. Or even good. Bette
Midler plays ``Valley of the Dolls'' author Jacqueline Susann, but
the movie is neither biography nor burlesque. It can't decide if
its main character is great, or a gargoyle. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Diamonds'' (PG-13) _ Kirk Douglas plays an aging boxer and
stroke survivor who convinces his estranged son (Dan Aykroyd) and
loving grandson to drive to Reno, where he stashed some diamonds 60
years ago. The bonding road trip is excruciating, and a visit to a
brothel (run by Lauren Bacall) is almost unwatchable. But then
there's Douglas, game, courageous and still with a legend's sheen.
Grade: D+

 &HT;    `X'actly what we need: Superheroes
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``X-Men,'' the comic phenom that had been roaming around the
``in development'' film beat for almost a decade, has finally made
it to theaters. Its long-term success or failure could mean life or
death for similar comic book projects such as ``Spider-Man,''
``Black Panther'' or ``Sgt. Rock.'' Frankly, I'm still waiting for
the long promised movie version of ``The Fantastic Four'' (the
Invisible Girl would now be the Invisible Woman, i.e., any female
over 40).
</P>
<P>
   But while we're waiting to find out whether the others will make
it to film, here are a few lesser known comic-inspired characters
you may want to check out on video. And not one of them wears a
cape.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Swamp Thing'' (1982): Made my heart sing. This scrappy
little flick brings the DC Comics half-veggie hero to oozy life
with metaphysical philosophy intact and the merest touch of camp
(the relentlessly straight-arrow dialogue, the comic-panel-style
wipes). Evil scientist Louis Jordan (``Gigi'') wants good scientist
Ray Wise's (``Twin Peaks'') secret formula. He leaves Wise for dead
in a swamp where the formula and whatever's been lying around in
the bog for eons (Jimmy Hoffa?) combine to turn him into something
that looks like a cross between the Creature From the Black Lagoon
and the Pillsbury Doughboy with a weak sphincter. Director Wes
Craven went on to fame, fortune and fingernails with his
``Nightmare on Elm Street'' series.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Phantom'' (1996): Since it's fast-paced and
kid-friendly, I'm not sure why this cleverly put-together update of
the old Phantom comic strip never made it big in theaters. Maybe a
Jar Jar Binks would've helped. Created as sort of the thinking
man's Tarzan in 1936, the Phantom wore a mask and a long purple
body stocking instead of a loincloth. And instead of elephants and
an ear-splitting yell, he depended on his wits and a carefully
cultivated superstition, i.e., that he was immortal when, in fact,
his was a 400-year-old father-to-son dynasty. Set in the '30s and
globetrotting back and forth between the Phantom's jungle home and
an art deco Manhattan, the movie is especially notable for its
cast. Billy Zane, who later chased Leo around the sinking Titanic
with a gun, plays the Phantom; Kristy Swanson, the original Buffy
the Vampire Slayer, is a fearless heiress.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Li'l Abner'' (1959): Not exactly in the superhero vein, but
certainly cartoonish. This adaptation of a '50s musical based on Al
Capp's satirical comic strip about the denizens of Dogpatch USA may
not be a classic, but its bold set design and art direction make it
seem like the Sunday funnies come to life. Plus, there's a fine
Johnny Mercer score. Designated the most useless place on earth,
Dogpatch is set to become a testing site for atom bombs unless the
inhabitants can find something necessary. Sort of the way the
National Historic Landmark registry works. The stars, Peter Palmer
and Leslie Parrish (Daisy Mae), never went anywhere, but Julie
Newmar became a cult icon thanks to her rendition of Stupefyin'
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Darkman'' (1990): Leave it to Sam Raimi to do it backwards
and get it right. While everyone else was rifling through their old
comics for the next ``Batman,'' Raimi simply created his own comic
book character: a horribly scarred scientist (Liam Neeson) who uses
the experimental synthetic skin he created to wreak vengeance on
the thugs who blew up his lab and ruined his life. Raimi knows the
pulp heart of comic-book love. His movie is brain-poundingly
violent, operatically emotional, and _ rather like ``X-Men'' _
obsessed with the existential angst of being a superpowered freak.
Look for Oscar winner Frances McDormand (``Fargo'') as the female
lead.

 &HT;    Having fun with form and function
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Medernach is on to something. With killer heat and drought,
gardening isn't much fun _ though it surely will be again.
Meanwhile, Ken has found a way to enhance just about any growing
space: those still looking good, as well as the many that are dying
and dragging and flagging.
</P>
<P>
   He goes to his basement workshop and creates all sorts of copper
pieces, including statuary, garden torches, tomato cages. Fountains
and birdbaths with recycling pumps _ and whatever else his clients'
imaginations might come up with.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ken showed off his wares at home in Atlanta (a sign on
the gate says, ``Warning _ Strange Dog''), where he grows a
demonstration garden of copper, seeded and nurtured by the
companionable characteristics of form and function. Gardeners
always have valued the pairing of those traits, seen in so many
plants. How beautiful the form and flowers of the peach tree, the
plum, apple and cherry. How tasty their fruit. Okra's sumptuous
yellow blossom, recalling its lovely cousin, hibiscus, gets outdone
only by the taste of those fine pods sliced and fried in cornmeal.
That's function for you.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Ken's tomato cage, I thought, this would look good in
my garden even if I had my usual short crop of squirrel-devastated
'maters. Similarly, his spiral sprinkler of copper tubing adds zip
and flash even if it's standing dry half the time because of the
drought-imposed cuts in water usage. Ken says he tells gardeners
that, when they buy sprinklers these days, they're ``serving art.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Ken is doing. A 15-year building contractor (also
a buddy with a serious gift for cooking and martini-making), he has
loved metal art and craft since the 1950s, when he held an
after-school job in a Savannah welding shop. Over the years, Ken
has worked mostly with copper but also with steel, wood and stone.
His art, which provides a calming counterpoint to the hassles of
building and remodeling, began asserting itself dramatically about
a year ago, when Ken, mentored by metal artist Ivan Bailey, spent
more and more time working with the copper sheets, tubing and pipe,
using heat, anvil, hammer, band saw and snips to make the metal
what he wants it to be. He first set up on a concrete pad outside,
but when a pignut hickory began throwing down on him, ``I figured
I'd have to move inside or wear a hard hat.'' No, wife Meg and
daughter Erin don't bend and pound metal; ``they kibitz.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many who have seen a pastime grow into a passion, Ken
nurtures a hope for his metal sculpting: ``to at some point make a
living at it and stop being a building contractor.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the appeal of copper?
</P>
<P>
   An avid gardener, Ken likes the metal's aging process,
describing it in ways he might talk about the changes in a shrub or
tree as it matures, grows great bark, changes appearance with the
seasons: ``Copper enhances itself, taking on a rich brown patina
that becomes mahogany. After many years _ it could take up to 20 _
it turns green.''
</P>
<P>
   As garden material, copper gets beautiful competition from
bamboo. But, says Ken, the reeds are good for a mere season or so,
while ``copper is virtually forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Long enough for all the down-pressed, heat-struck,
drought-stricken gardens to recover their form and function. I
hope.
</P>
<P>
   For information, on Ken Medernach's copper tomato cage, call
404-875-5905.

 &HT;    Atlantans find one cool hobby in water gardening
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick and Joann Koch thought they were fixing a drainage problem
eight years ago when they hauled huge rocks into their Marietta,
Ga., back yard.
</P>
<P>
   The rocks solved their erosion woes all right but also laid the
foundation for a hobby about which they've grown passionate _ water
gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love it. It just becomes a part of you,'' Joann said of the
two earthen ponds and waterfall her husband built.
</P>
<P>
   Like the estimated 9 million homeowners with ponds across the
country, the Koches have the fever _ big time _ and warn it can be
contagious, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe them, they say, try visiting some of the 50
metro-area ponds this month and next on the Atlanta-based National
Pond Society's 12th annual tour. ``Pondering,'' as the hobbyists
call it, reels in most converts by whetting their appetites with
examples of what can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pond creates another pond with visitors and neighbors,''
said Roswell, Ga., resident Alan Sperling, whose pond, along with
the Koches', is on tour.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. Sperling founded the National Pond Society 11
years ago after growing desperate for help in locating supplies and
advice. He was living in Acworth at the time and ran a newspaper ad
asking people to share their pond knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got about a thousand calls,'' said Sperling, a retired
engineer. With that kind of response, he organized the nonprofit
group and started a newsletter, which evolved into a magazine,
Pondscapes, published from his home office. Membership now totals
more than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The number of water gardening enthusiasts, which Sperling said
grows by 30 percent annually, has skyrocketed in recent years as
improvements are made to pond products and hobbyists discover the
benefits of relaxation and family activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, the pond society's members were 50 and
older; today, most are 30 to 35. The vast majority own water
gardens with aquatic plants and fish _ from large earthen ponds to
lined pools and even just containers, Sperling said. A small
percentage tend strictly to Japanese koi ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Another group devoted to the hobby, the International Waterlily
and Water Gardening Society, has members, including commercial
suppliers, in 30 countries. Ironically, its U.S. offices are in
Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   So why so much interest in the Atlanta area?
</P>
<P>
   First, the mild climate allows for all types of gardening nearly
year round _ lucky for Atlantans, who love their yards. Second,
gardeners, like gracious Southerners, know the value of sharing
information and ponderers are among the most willing, Sperling
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You meet the most fabulous people with ponds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As proof that pondering is contagious, Sperling estimates there
are some 5,000 ponds within a five-mile radius of his Roswell home.
</P>
<P>
   There, he and his wife, Madalyn, have created a marina-like
setting along a steep embankment on Loch Highland Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a master plan for the site because everybody
who visited us contributed by saying, 'Can you imagine if you did
this, or did that,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a series of gray wooden decks, stairs and bridges,
lined with rope bannisters, that meanders several water features.
They begin with a pool, created by Mystic Ponds &AMP; Waterfalls, where
the boards in one bridge are spaced far enough apart so that water,
accented with lights, is visible at night.
</P>
<P>
   From the pool, a waterfall built from rock spills into a gentle
stream. ``My wife and I hauled in 11 tons of rock by rolling each
one of them down the hill,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Farther downhill, Sperling split the stream in two _ not an easy
feat. It then feeds into an L-shaped water garden, filled with gold
fish and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Raised storage bins along the deck's edge not only hide the
pond's mechanics but make for handy benches for enjoying the shady
setting. ``Observation, if you hang around a pond, is the best way
to manage it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Koch picked out his spot early on when he and his wife
built their pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I just sit,'' he said, pointing to one of the
rocks _ all hand picked _ he hauled in with heavy equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It all started when his next door neighbors attempted to build
their house on a rocky site. They needed to get rid of the rock,
and the Kochs were battling erosion along a kudzu-covered ravine
that flows past their house.
</P>
<P>
   Dick , a computer consultant, used the rocks to build two
earthen ponds _ each 20 by 60 feet and 3 feet deep _ connected by a
waterfall. Pumps circulate the water from a spring at the top of
the hill into the first pond, then over the waterfall and into the
lower pond, then finally a spillway that empties into the
Chattahoochee River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being earthen ponds, they're never really crystal clear, but
we like the natural look of them,'' said Joann, retired from the
hotel food industry.
</P>
<P>
   She spends most days gardening along the embankments, lined with
river birches, rhododendron, ferns and colorful impatiens, while
her husbands maintains the ponds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't enjoy something like this, it can become a chore,
said Dick, who drains the ponds to about one foot every spring to
clean them.
</P>
<P>
   That requires moving some 100 fish, including three koi about 2
feet long, which Dick wraps in towels for a quick but precarious
transfer from one pond to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``What started as a maintenance project is now a major hobby for
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention a beautiful setting that's a far cry from that
kudzu-ensnared ravine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out here you don't realize you're sitting almost
in the middle of the city,'' Joann said of the site, where a family
of mallards has taken up residence. ``It's like you're way up in
the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's another benefit _ that one thing that keeps spawning
more ponderers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be able to help other people get started,'' she
said. ``By visiting ponds, they see it's something they, too, can
do.''

<P>
   &QR;  Make your water garden at least 18 inches deep _ more if you
plan to include Japanese koi. Deeper ponds may require fencing.
Check your local zoning laws for pools and fences.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For safety's sake, don't consider a pond if you have children
under 6.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't rush when building a pond. Have a plan but first get to
know the site by working it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't forget electricity when considering costs. For a basic
pond, count on a liner costing about 80 cents a square foot; pump,
$100; filter, $200; rocks, $175 a ton. Other costs include plants,
fish, hardscaping, lighting, outdoor furniture.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Visit ponds; research products before launching construction.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use pond water, which is recirculated, to water lawns and
plants.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start small when adding fish (four to six), regardless of pond
size, until you get used to caring for them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Control algae by providing the right conditions _ the right
types and number of plants, few fish, little sunlight.

 &HT;    The buzz on bugs
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's that? Butterflies in the punch bowl? A trail of ants
across the picnic plate? Bugs atop the napkins?
</P>
<P>
   Such pests are usually the uninvited guests at summer
gatherings, but this year they are the life of the party _ or at
least the partyware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bugs, butterflies and dragonflies are on everything from
glasses to dishes to napkins,'' said Suzanne Williamson, author of
``Entertaining for Dummies'' ($19.95, I.D.G.) and consultant to
Rich's. The whimsical winged things just seem to go with the more
casual summer entertaining atmosphere, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Real bugs are likely to be a part of a porch party anyway. And
the drought is driving many pests indoors. Why not also invite
inside buggy napkin rings or bumble bee votives? And if the
lightning bugs aren't providing enough twinkles, just string up a
set of dragonfly patio lights.
</P>
<P>
   We found everything from colorful bee-themed tumblers at
Wal-Mart to a red-checkered tinware plate with a trail of ants
painted across it at Metropolitan Deluxe in Virginia-Highland.
Paper plates splattered with images of bugs and captions of ``eek''
and ``gross'' (also at Metropolitan Deluxe) are sure to get the
guests buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   And at Watershed in Decatur, we found a clever dragonfly made of
pantyhose stretched around a wire hanger frame and painted green
that can be attached to anything from the edge of the table to a
centerpiece flower arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson said the critters can even be used creatively for
more formal table settings. ``I love the juxtaposition of engraved
linens, bone china, sparkling crystal and a few bugs painted on
tabletop pieces,'' she said. ``To carry the bug theme further, use
branches and leaves for a centerpiece and large-leaf-patterned
linens, and serve chocolate-covered ants with coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   And the best part _ the bugs won't bite.
</P>
<P>

   While waiting for watermelon time, we set aside a request from
Bessie Jo Britt of Decatur, Ga., for her long-lost recipes for
watermelon rind preserves and pickles like her mother made.

   Q: My sister in Chicago gave me a great candle made by Trapp
Private Gardens. It really smells terrific! My favorite scent is
Rejuvenating Rain. Where can I purchase more of these candles here
in Atlanta? My sister's suitcase is getting heavy bringing me
candles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Debbie Baugher, Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We didn't have to burn the candle at both ends to find this
particular brand. Trapp Private Gardens candles, which are made in
Kansas City, Mo., are available at Hodge Podge, 970 Piedmont Ave.
N.E. (404-874-6037), Lemon Grass in Phipps Plaza (404-760-0503) and
the Mole Hole stores in malls throughout Atlanta. Candles range
from about $4 for the votives, lasting 15-20 hours, to $20 for the
signature perfume candle (in photo), which lasts 45 hours. To
achieve total scent saturation, each candle is infused with a
bottle of perfume, says a company representative. There are 16
scents available, including Guava Mango, Lily of the Valley,
Essence of Gardenia, Orange-Vanilla, Summer Flowers and Cool
Cucumber.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Ricola Pearls _ tiny mints that you can put
under your tongue, to refresh your mouth. They disappeared several
months ago, and I would appreciate it if you could locate a source.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patricia A. Herman, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We have a few pearls of widsom for you. A spokeswoman for
Ricola U.S.A., Pamela Hehl Dalessio, says that she does not
``currently have a store location in Atlanta.'' She adds, ``our
mints are widely distributed in metro New York, California and
Hawaii. But we have just gone through a packaging update and are
preparing to increase distribution throughout the rest of the
country.'' You can buy the mints on the Internet at
www.providentinc.com. Or call 215-364-4515. A box of 25 mints is 89
cents. Sugar-free Ricola mints are made from natural herbs grown in
the Swiss mountains. Each little mint _ called a pearl because of
its shape _ has 1.5 calories and comes in peppermint, spearmint,
orange-mint, lemon-mint and menthol eucalyptus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have combed Atlanta's food markets in a vain attempt to
find finnan haddie. This salted, smoked and dried haddock is a New
England staple and assumes gourmet proportions when properly
prepared. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Lee Palermo,
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: You will soon be savoring finnan haddie, which takes its name
from Finon in Scotland, where it was developed more than 100 years
ago. And haddie is the Scottish term for haddock. We reeled in your
finnan haddie ($6.99 a pound) at Harry's Farmers Market, 1180 Upper
Hembree Road, Alpharetta (770-664-6300). Publix at the Peach, 2868
Peachtree Road N.W., and Cub Foods, 2625 Piedmont Road N.E., will
special order this fish for you. While haddock is naturally white,
finnan haddie is dyed before smoking to give it a characteristic
tawny/amber color.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a WWII Air Force veteran and am looking for a CD or
cassette recording of military bugle calls, from reveille to taps.
Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   _ George Reid,
</P>
<P>
   Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: At ease, solider. We found your request. Army Surplus Sales,
342 Peachtree St. N.E. (404-521-2227) has the tape of America's
Bugle Calls for $11.99. It includes 58 of the most famous military
bugle calls, including Reveille, Morning Colors Sequence, First
Call, Attention, To the Colors, Carry On, Assembly, First
Sergeant's Call and Taps. Surplus City, 2906 Buford Highway, Duluth
(770-497-4906) can order this tape for $13.95. A CD is $17. Or
order on the Web: www.militaryrecordings.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During a recent vacation in Florida, I purchased several
packages of Kool-Aid Slushies mix, which makes for a refreshing
summertime treat. I have searched for this product at local grocery
stores but have not had any luck finding it. Please help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Morrow, McDonough, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another Slushies request: I am looking for Kool-Aid
Slushies. All flavors are excellent, especially the lemonade. Last
year I could find the mix in grocery stores. But now I am having
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lida Moulder, Palmetto, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Mix it, freeze it, serve it! That's how Kool-Aid describes
Slushies, its seasonal soft frozen beverage mix. We discovered the
icy treat mixes _ in lemonade, cherry and grape _ at the Wal-Mart
in Snellville, 2135 E. Main St. (770-979-2447). Other Wal-Mart
stores also stock this product. A 5-ounce package is 96 cents. Each
packet makes about four 1-cup servings; each serving contains 140
calories but no fat or cholesterol.

 ART ADV: With photo of Veronica McGreevey (NNS6). 
 By RON MARSICO and JOE DONOHUE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ On the campaign trail this spring, Democratic
U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine repeatedly implored whoever was
listening to support Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey for governor
next year.
</P>
<P>
   His comments at a Democratic Party confab in Atlantic City in
early May were typical. ``You can make certain Jim McGreevey is
that governor.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., abruptly entering
the gubernatorial fray, Corzine -- like various other Democrats who
were behind the Woodbridge mayor just a few days ago -- has
recalled his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's remaining neutral and focusing on this year's race,''
said Tom Shea, Corzine's spokesman, this week. He said his boss was
attending a family event and was unavailable for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very close to both of them. He just doesn't want to
distract attention from what he's trying to accomplish this year,''
Shea said. Corzine has issued a memo urging his staff to remain
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey, who has enlisted his mother and other family members
in an all-out counterattack, said he was unfazed by news that
Corzine was shifting to neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our most important task is to secure Mr. Corzine's election as
the next U.S. senator. Unfortunately, gubernatorial politics are
now distracting us from the primary charge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine is but one on a growing list of prominent Democrats who
have hedged on previous commitments to McGreevey, turning what some
considered a sure-thing primary into a wild Democratic scramble.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, state Senate Minority Leader Richard Codey, a
Democrat who has been a strong McGreevey backer, would say only,
``I expect to be conferring with my chairman and other county
leaders sometime in the very near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Janiszewski, Hudson County executive and county party
leader, previously has said he is reconsidering his endorsement.
Thomas Giblin, Democratic State Committee chairman and Essex County
chairman, who had been backing McGreevey, said he would convene a
meeting of local party officials to reassess the situation.
</P>
<P>
   While McGreevey, who narrowly lost the governorship in 1997,
says he is in the race to stay, supporters of Torricelli are trying
to create the impression of a juggernaut behind the senator's bid
to wrest away the party's nomination. Many are buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like Poland,'' said one Democrat of the Torricelli
offensive against McGreevey. ``It was blitzkrieg. There was some
opposition. But it was mopped up relatively quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey denied his campaign was in panic mode even though his
supporters were working a frantic pace trying to keep his campaign
from collapsing. McGreevey has even had family members lighting up
the phone lines on his behalf for the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Ronnie McGreevey, Jim McGreevey's mom, calling,'' said
Veronica McGreevey, working her way through a list of Essex County
Democratic committee members Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know we came so close in '97, within one point, right?
Jim's been working all up and down the state for three years. We're
asking for your support. We want to take back the Statehouse
together. What do you think about that?''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey's sister, father and fiancee have all been calling
local-level Democrats since late last week in what McGreevey called
a ``stepped-up'' phone campaign following the emergence of the
Torricelli threat. McGreevey said the team has made more than 2,000
calls in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   The calls have been made out of the office of Gary Taffet, an
insurance executive who formerly served as McGreevey's chief of
staff and currently heads his political operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's (Torricelli) a great senator,'' said Veronica McGreevey.
``We're putting in a junior senator, Corzine. We need to keep a
senior senator in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning his deferential tone of the past few days, McGreevey
took a swipe at Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Governor's Office is not simply a matter of one person's
ambitions or political interests. It ought not be about political
gamesmanship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey said he remains ``confident'' while citing strong
support statewide among labor officials, elected officials,
grass-roots organizers and clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Fran Fiore, staff representative of Communications Workers of
America Local 1040, which has 10,000 members, said a number of
locals met last week and voted to continue to back McGreevey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much our position that Jim McGreevey had our
support last time (in 1997), and he'll have our support again,''
Fiore said.
</P>
<P>
   While both McGreevey and Torricelli supporters claimed to have a
majority of county Democratic chairmen in their camp, clear
divisions were emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming what most had assumed, South Jersey Democratic leader
George Norcross said Camden, Burlington and Gloucester counties,
which produce 82 percent of the region's votes, all will be backing
Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``People view Torricelli as a lock. And that's what's driving
this more than anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since Brendan Byrne has a statewide candidate been drafted
for governor, and Bob Torricelli is being besieged by those who
want him to lead this party to victory,'' Norcross said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chuck Chiarello, Atlantic County chairman, said he intends
to remain with McGreevey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have loyalty and respect for Jim McGreevey, and I'm sticking
with Jim. I've been part of a commitment to Jim from Day One --
back when it wasn't even fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't have some loyalty, I don't think you have much
credibility in politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most other party leaders tended to praise both prospective
contenders and acknowledged divided loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Torricelli, Union County chairwoman Charlotte
DeFilippo said, ``Love him dearly, he's a great senator. But I'm
behind Jim McGreevey. Union County has been with and intends to
stay with McGreevey. He's a party builder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My phones have been ringing off the hooks from both sides,''
said Thomas Pankok, the Salem chairman. ``I'm really thinking
seriously of taking a neutral position and just staying out of it.
I think I'm to the point now where I'm just going to refuse to talk
about it to anybody.''
</P>

 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ On the campaign trail this spring, Democratic
U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine repeatedly implored whoever was
listening to support Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey for governor
next year.
</P>
<P>
   His comments at a Democratic Party confab in Atlantic City in
early May were typical. ``You can make certain Jim McGreevey is
that governor.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., abruptly entering
the gubernatorial fray, Corzine -- like various other Democrats who
were behind the Woodbridge mayor just a few days ago -- has
recalled his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's remaining neutral and focusing on this year's race,''
said Tom Shea, Corzine's spokesman, this week. He said his boss was
attending a family event and was unavailable for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very close to both of them. He just doesn't want to
distract attention from what he's trying to accomplish this year,''
Shea said. Corzine has issued a memo urging his staff to remain
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey, who has enlisted his mother and other family members
in an all-out counterattack, said he was unfazed by news that
Corzine was shifting to neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our most important task is to secure Mr. Corzine's election as
the next U.S. senator. Unfortunately, gubernatorial politics are
now distracting us from the primary charge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine is but one on a growing list of prominent Democrats who
have hedged on previous commitments to McGreevey, turning what some
considered a sure-thing primary into a wild Democratic scramble.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, state Senate Minority Leader Richard Codey, a
Democrat who has been a strong McGreevey backer, would say only,
``I expect to be conferring with my chairman and other county
leaders sometime in the very near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Janiszewski, Hudson County executive and county party
leader, previously has said he is reconsidering his endorsement.
Thomas Giblin, Democratic State Committee chairman and Essex County
chairman, who had been backing McGreevey, said he would convene a
meeting of local party officials to reassess the situation.
</P>
<P>
   While McGreevey, who narrowly lost the governorship in 1997,
says he is in the race to stay, supporters of Torricelli are trying
to create the impression of a juggernaut behind the senator's bid
to wrest away the party's nomination. Many are buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like Poland,'' said one Democrat of the Torricelli
offensive against McGreevey. ``It was blitzkrieg. There was some
opposition. But it was mopped up relatively quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey denied his campaign was in panic mode even though his
supporters were working a frantic pace trying to keep his campaign
from collapsing. McGreevey has even had family members lighting up
the phone lines on his behalf for the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Ronnie McGreevey, Jim McGreevey's mom, calling,'' said
Veronica McGreevey, working her way through a list of Essex County
Democratic committee members Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know we came so close in '97, within one point, right?
Jim's been working all up and down the state for three years. We're
asking for your support. We want to take back the Statehouse
together. What do you think about that?''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey's sister, father and fiancee have all been calling
local-level Democrats since late last week in what McGreevey called
a ``stepped-up'' phone campaign following the emergence of the
Torricelli threat. McGreevey said the team has made more than 2,000
calls in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   The calls have been made out of the office of Gary Taffet, an
insurance executive who formerly served as McGreevey's chief of
staff and currently heads his political operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's (Torricelli) a great senator,'' said Veronica McGreevey.
``We're putting in a junior senator, Corzine. We need to keep a
senior senator in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning his deferential tone of the past few days, McGreevey
took a swipe at Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Governor's Office is not simply a matter of one person's
ambitions or political interests. It ought not be about political
gamesmanship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey said he remains ``confident'' while citing strong
support statewide among labor officials, elected officials,
grass-roots organizers and clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Fran Fiore, staff representative of Communications Workers of
America Local 1040, which has 10,000 members, said a number of
locals met last week and voted to continue to back McGreevey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much our position that Jim McGreevey had our
support last time (in 1997), and he'll have our support again,''
Fiore said.
</P>
<P>
   While both McGreevey and Torricelli supporters claimed to have a
majority of county Democratic chairmen in their camp, clear
divisions were emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming what most had assumed, South Jersey Democratic leader
George Norcross said Camden, Burlington and Gloucester counties,
which produce 82 percent of the region's votes, all will be backing
Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``People view Torricelli as a lock. And that's what's driving
this more than anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since Brendan Byrne has a statewide candidate been drafted
for governor, and Bob Torricelli is being besieged by those who
want him to lead this party to victory,'' Norcross said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chuck Chiarello, Atlantic County chairman, said he intends
to remain with McGreevey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have loyalty and respect for Jim McGreevey, and I'm sticking
with Jim. I've been part of a commitment to Jim from Day One --
back when it wasn't even fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't have some loyalty, I don't think you have much
credibility in politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most other party leaders tended to praise both prospective
contenders and acknowledged divided loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Torricelli, Union County chairwoman Charlotte
DeFilippo said, ``Love him dearly, he's a great senator. But I'm
behind Jim McGreevey. Union County has been with and intends to
stay with McGreevey. He's a party builder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My phones have been ringing off the hooks from both sides,''
said Thomas Pankok, the Salem chairman. ``I'm really thinking
seriously of taking a neutral position and just staying out of it.
I think I'm to the point now where I'm just going to refuse to talk
about it to anybody.''

 UNDATED: mass appeal.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first stumbling block _ storage _ is being tackled on
several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Practically all portable players store music on solid state
memory chips, including Compact Flash, Smart Media cards and Sony's
Memory Sticks.
</P>
<P>
   While solid state memory chips are small, run noiselessly and
are reliable, they are also expensive and appear to be growing more
so as demand begins to outstrip supply, manufacturers say.
</P>
<P>
   One frustrated executive at an American consumer electronics
manufacturer said he had traveled to Asia in an unsuccessful search
for a company that could make and then sell the hardware components
for a digital audio player to his company for $1. The reason? Much
of the cost of a player, which is passed to consumers, is consumed
by the cost of memory.
</P>
<P>
   A digital player with adequate memory _ for at least a half-hour
of playback _ that costs less than $100 has eluded the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Most players are sold with 32 megabytes of embedded, often
called ``onboard,'' memory. A 32-megabyte memory card costs about
$100. And the rule of thumb is that a player, like Samsung's Yepp
player, requires about a megabyte of memory for every minute of
recorded MP3 music (at near-CD-quality sound).
</P>
<P>
   Adding more music requires more memory for storage, and the cost
starts to climb steeply, said Craig Rathbun, the worldwide director
of Clik technology for Iomega, maker of disk-based removable
storage devices like the popular Zip and Jaz cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-megabyte memory cards used in audio players are
``essentially $100 half-hour albums,'' Rathbun said. Iomega is
taking a different approach by adapting its Clik drives to digital
audio players so that they may use the 40-megabyte Clik disks to
store and play music.
</P>
<P>
   Clik disks are not solid state and introduce moving parts into
the players. But they are cheaper than solid state memory, Rathbun
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-megabyte Clik disk can cost as little as $10. They are also
rugged, Rathbun said, as he held a handful of the half-dollar-size
Clik disks, each containing a different genre of music.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the first digital player using Clik technology, the
Rave MP 2300 by Sensory Science, reached the market. Iomega
officials said seven players with built-in Clik drives by other
manufacturers _ including one by Iomega itself _ are expected to be
available before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rio is exploring alternatives to expensive, solid-state flash
memory for storing music in its players.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Rio 600, which is the first player to seamlessly
play music encoded in the MP3 or Windows Media format, comes with
32 megabytes of memory. A more feature-laden Rio 800 is expected
later this summer, with 64 megabytes of included memory.
</P>
<P>
   Rio has also taken a novel approach to the question of expanding
the storage capabilities of its audio players. Earlier models like
the Rio 300 and Rio 500 use, as most players do, a slot in which an
expansion memory card can be inserted, boosting the player's
overall capacity to play more music. But such designs are limited,
making it difficult to add more than a 64-megabyte card to the 32
megabytes already built into the player.
</P>
<P>
   The new Rio players are designed with what its engineers call a
backpack. It is a slip-off and slip-on back that contains the
player's memory and power supply. The Rio 600, which costs $169,
comes with a backpack with 32 megabytes built in and a single AA
battery to power the unit.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 64-megabyte backpack comes with a rechargeable
battery. And Rio, in partnership with IBM, will soon release a
backpack that will house a 340-megabyte IBM Microdrive. Also in
development is a Rio backpack equipped with a new 500-megabyte
drive by DataPlay.
</P>
<P>
   While executives at S3's Rio division said they were not ready
to discuss the cost of the backpacks with the minidrives, they said
the emerging memory technology helps to make their new Rio players
``future-proof.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the disk-based storage devices spin only to retrieve
a song before playing it from small embedded memory, they do not
greatly tax battery life or make players more susceptible to
skipping when moved or bumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are turning the corner with the release of the Rio
600 and other products in the family,'' Reed said, and added that
Rio is looking beyond the youth market.
</P>
<P>
   S3's Rio division, as well as a number of other consumer
electronics companies, is also preparing to release a line of
home-based digital audio players that resemble conventional stereo
components. The newly released SongBank SL CD Memory System by
Lydstrom not only plays and records CDs, but can also convert their
content into a digital format and save iton the $800 machine's hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the ways that people listen to CD's today,''
Reed at Rio said, you can pretty much count on us to replace that
CD technology in the future with our technology.''

PAY ATTENTION TO VOLTAGE AND FREQUENCY ABROAD
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm moving to Europe and wish to take my computer with me.
Will I have a problem with the computer because of the different
electrical standards overseas?
</P>
<P>
   A: Different European countries have different electrical
standards, so find out ahead of time what the voltage and frequency
rates are for your new home. Most computers of recent vintage,
especially laptops, should be able to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Most electrical current in the United States operates at 110 to
120 volts, with a frequency of 60 hertz, while other parts of the
world use 220 to 240 volts and varying frequencies (usually 50
hertz in Europe). Ireland, for example, operates at 220 volts, 50
hertz.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a Windows-based PC, check the back of the computer
for the voltage switch that leads to the computer's power supply,
inside the case. You will probably see a switch that will let you
manually select either 115 volts for use on U.S. electrical systems
or 230 volts for use with European standards.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer states that the majority of its Macintosh
computers that were manufactured after the Macintosh SE model in
1987 are ``universal'' and can handle currents between 100 and 240
volts, and 50 to 60 hertz. To determine whether a Mac is indeed
universal, look at the machine's FCC identification label for its
voltage requirements, or refer to the technical specifications
section of the user's manual. Some Apple machines have a manual
voltage selector that allows you to choose 110 or 220 volts.
</P>
<P>
   Your monitor, printer and other devices may not be so versatile,
so refer to the electrical specifications in the documentation that
came with your equipment. If the country you're moving to uses a
line frequency other than 50 to 60 hertz, make sure your devices
are flexible, or ``frequency independent,'' to ensure proper
performance. Apple says most of its products are indeed frequency
independent, but double-check before using any particular device.
If you have lost the manuals that came with your Mac, Apple has a
searchable Tech Info Library at til.info.apple.com.
</P>
<P>
   PCs running Windows, DOS, OS/2 or other operating systems are
made by a wide range of different companies, so refer to the
manufacturer's technical specs for your machine. Most computer
makers will have that information in the tech support area of their
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a voltage converter for around $30 to $40. And you
will probably also need a plug adapter (or a set of them) for your
various power cords.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I use a different keyboard layout for my computer besides
the American one? Is there a system setting to change, or do I have
to buy a program and a new keyboard to do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both the Windows and Macintosh operating systems will allow
you to substitute foreign-language keyboard layouts. For Windows
98, go to the Start menu, then Settings and Control Panel, then
double-click on the Keyboard icon. Click on the Language tab, then
on Add. Pick your choice from the pop-up list.
</P>
<P>
   For the Macintosh, go to the Apple menu to Control Panels and
select Keyboard. You will see a list of languages. Check the one
you wish to use. If you don't see the additional keyboards, you may
need to install the files from your operating system's CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   The accents, alphabet and punctuation for many languages,
including Danish, French, Norwegian, Spanish and German, are
usually readily available. If you need a language that you don't
see listed, check with your operating system's maker for additional
language kits. Appropriate keyboards (or inexpensive letter
stickers to use with yourU.S. model) are available, and you can
find a good supply of foreign-language hardware and software at
www.worldlanguage.com.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It began with a jammed feed-chute gate deep within the country's
only working chemical-weapons incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six hours of repairs, an inexperienced furnace
operator, whose boss felt the event ripe for a little on-the-job
training, became overwhelmed by a series of automatic system
shutdowns his work manual didn't cover.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, nobody told him about the sock of sarin-laced trash
workers left atop the chute after cleaning it. Hours later, his
superiors discounted alarms and ordered him to keep relighting a
furnace, even as the sock's deadly fumes had been sucked through
hundreds of feet of pollution controls into Utah's cool desert air.
</P>
<P>
   The leaks the night of May 8 and 9 likely amounted to two drops,
traveled only 8 feet and posed no risk to 32,000 residents near the
Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, said U.S. Centers for
Disease Control officials.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials emphasize the leaks occurred during an unusual
repair and don't reflect normal operations. They insist that new
safeguards being built into three similar incinerators throughout
the United States -- in Umatilla, Ore.; Pine Bluff, Ark.; and
Anniston, Ala. -- would have prevented the leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we can do is retrain and once again
re-emphasize an overall safety culture,'' Army spokesman Greg
Mahall said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Utah environmental officials have shut down Tooele -- its
fifth such closure in four years -- until the Army puts new
safeguards in place. Congress plans a hearing on the matter later
this year. And in Oregon, state regulators have demanded assurances
that the Army apply recommended fixes to the Umatilla Chemical
Depot before it burns 221,000 munitions filled with 3,000 tons of
sarin, VX and mustard agents. Construction delays have pushed the
start date to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the incident shows how highly engineered systems can
malfunction in unthinkable ways, overwhelming humans trying to
respond and endangering surrounding populations. One noted
organizational sociologist says even with operator retraining,
other accidents will undoubtedly surprise Army officials as they
fire up the three other incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``These systems are not very safe,'' said Charles Perrow, a Yale
University sociologist and author of the book ``Normal Accidents:
Living With High-Risk Technologies.'' ``And I would not want to
live near one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarin, or GB, is essentially a human pesticide, like everyday
organophosphates that eliminate insects and weeds. Sarin assaults
the nervous system and a fraction of a drop, inhaled, can kill. In
1995, a doomsday cult unleashed sarin in a crowded Tokyo subway,
killing 12 and injuring more than 5,000. But in wind and heat, it
disperses quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Tooele, built 30 miles southwest of Salt Lake City at the
Deseret Chemical Depot, was designed to destroy nearly half of the
nation's chemical-weapons stockpile. It has incinerated 5 million
pounds of agent since 1996. Two of its four furnaces were online on
May 8, the night of the leak, processing fencepost-like M-56
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The night's events were detailed in four separate investigations
by the Army, the CDC, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality
and the incinerator's operator, EG&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   Just before a 5:30 p.m. shift change, a tipping gate began
sticking inside a 2-by-2-foot metal chute where agent-laced rocket
parts fall into a rotary kiln. Workers left the problem for the
next 12-hour shift, whose manager was the least experienced at
Tooele, and whose regular control-room supervisor had the night
off.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 8, two workers donned masks and full-body vinyl
suits to enter the hot, sarin-laced room and free the gate.
Eventually, they cleaned it using up to 100 gallons of water.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:37 p.m., just before leaving, they set a one-pound bag of
agent-laced fiberglass atop the upper gate of the chute, expecting
it to drop into the furnace upon restart.
</P>
<P>
   In the control room, the furnace operator, using a dozen
computer screens, tried to bring temperatures back up to normal.
Certified for the job only three months earlier, this was his first
experience with an ``upset condition.'' His supervisor thought it
would be a good experience. But his procedure booklet didn't cover
the unusual repair job. And nobody had said anything about the
lingering bag of sarin-laced waste above the kiln.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the feed-chute washdown had generated a large cloud
of steam in adjoining furnaces, causing temperatures and air
pressure to drop. The steam inundated an air-flow meter hundreds of
feet downline until it malfunctioned and automatically shut down
the furnace and an adjoining afterburner.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers call this a ``lock-out.'' It required a system purge,
which pumped more cool air into the furnace. Internal pressures
began fluctuating wildly, veering off the operator's gauges.
Temperatures inside the afterburner, usually 2,100 degrees,
plummeted to 1,160 degrees. Eventually, pressures fell so low, it
created a vacuum, sucking air through the afterburner in under two
seconds. That was too quick and too cool to burn the sarin gases
being drawn off the sock.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:26 p.m., the first of three alarms inside the facility's
100-foot chimney sounded. But the control-room supervisor either
discounted or misunderstood them. Instead, he ordered the operator
to again relight the furnace. The plant site manager, thinking it
another false alarm, unmasked the site.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight, the alarms sounded again. By now, an
onsite lab confirmed the first alarms: GB had escaped the stack at
3.5 times the allowable limit.
</P>
<P>
   There were other problems, too. The Army didn't tell Tooele
County officials of the leaks for four hours, violating an
agreement between the two agencies. Workers failed to immediately
check highly sensitive air monitors lining the depot's perimeter.
When they did six hours later, they didn't take all possible
readings, rendering the results from one monitor, which detected a
trace of GB, uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, over the previous month, 33 false alarms rang inside
Tooele's stack, nearly a dozen for unknown reasons. Those false
alarms, investigators later concluded, led supervisors to discount
warnings the night of the leak.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Army and EG&AMP;G officials cite the root cause of the leaks as
operator and management error. But Utah and CDC officials note that
the same feed chute had jammed before, in part because the liquid
sarin inside the rockets has unexpectedly gelled, sticking to
rocket parts and incinerator walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chute design stinks,'' said Sue Oliver, who monitors the
Army's demilitarization program for the Oregon Department of
Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   Perrow, who led a presidential probe into the Three Mile Island
accident, called the events leading up to Tooele's leaks a classic
example of the unintended consequences of complex industrial
systems. Parts inside these ``tightly coupled'' systems have prompt
and major impacts on others, he says. When things go wrong -- the
jammed feed chute and the drenched flow meter, for example --
operators cannot fathom them quickly enough. Their intervention
usually only makes things worse, Perrow says.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects similar crises will arise at the three other
incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they designed (the incinerator), they never thought of
these two complexities,'' Perrow argued. ``There are thousands more
they never thought of. When they get it running again, there's
going to be another thing.''

CHICKEN SOUP FOR ALL SOULS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First came the fanciful fowl of ``Chicken Run.'' Then three
chickens were awarded to one of the tribes on ``Survivor'' (alas,
they were promptly eaten). Now comes the chicken coop on ``Big
Brother'' (alas, even the hens have no privacy). And let's not
forget the food fight being waged by Chick-fil-A and Burger King
over Chick's contention that Burger King's ``save the chickens''
and ``eat a Whopper'' ad is a rip-off of its 5-year-old ``Eat mor
chikin'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With both sides crying fowl, it seems that in pop culture, the
chickens have finally come home to roost. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD?
</P>
<P>
   Buddha: If you ask this question, you deny your own chicken
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with
a toad? Yes! The chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed it,
I've not been told!
</P>
<P>
   Ayn Rand: It was crossing the road because of its own rational
choice to do so. There cannot be a collective unconscious; desires
are unique to each individual.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Leary: Because that's the only kind of trip the
Establishment would let it take.
</P>
<P>
   Machiavelli: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who
cares why? The ends of crossing the road justify whatever motive
there was.

MIKE THE HEADLESS CHICKEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's true what they say about running around like a chicken with
your head cut off. On Sept. 10, 1945, in Fruita, Colo., Lloyd Olsen
decapitated a young chicken for dinner, but the hearty fowl refused
to die. Impressed, farmer Olsen fed him with a medicine dropper,
and Mike lived another months, sans head, becoming quite famous.
Today, there's an annual headless chicken festival in Fruita. Don't
believe it? It's documented at www.miketheheadlesschicken.org. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FANCY CHICKENS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chickens are descended from the wild red jungle fowl of India,
where they were first domesticated about 5,000 years ago. Although
supermarket chickens have had any interesting traits bred out of
them, there are many fanciful breeds to occupy chicken enthusiasts.
A sampling:
</P>
<P>
   Sultan: very fanciful, with long feathers shooting up from head,
tail and feet
</P>
<P>
   Brahma: very colorful and stately
</P>
<P>
   Polish: looks like a chicken wearing a Phyllis Diller wig
</P>

SOUL FOOD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sales of ``Chicken Soup for the Soul'' books topped $100 million
last year (as well as inspiring several parodies, including
``Chicken-Fried Steak for the Soul''). Which of the following is
NOT a real title in the series?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Chicken Soup for the Cat- and Dog-Lover's Soul''
</P>
<P>
   B. ``Chicken Soup for the Golfer's Soul''
</P>
<P>
   C. ``Chicken Soup for the Country Soul''

   D. ``Chicken Soup for the Co-Dependent Soul''
</P>
<P>
   E. ``Condensed Chicken Soup for the Soul''
</P>
<P>
   (The answer: D. ``Chicken Soup for the Co-Dependent Soul'')  &QL; 
THE BIG CHICKEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An architectural landmark in Marietta, Ga., (just north of
Atlanta and hometown of Newt Gingrich), the Big Chicken is a
56-foot-tall metal fowl with movable beak and eyes. It was built in
1963 for a local ice-cream parlor, which has since become a KFC
franchise. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DEM DRIED BONES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turn a chicken carcass into a model apatosaurus or T-rex with
help from paleontologist Chris McGowan's books ``Make Your Own
Dinosaur Out of Chicken Bones'' (HarperCollins, $13) and ``T-Rex to
Go'' (HarperCollins, $14). &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE CHICKEN PLANT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Echeverias _ succulent plants native to Texas and parts south _
are commonly called ``hen-and-chickens'' because of the way new
little plantlets develop in clusters around the mama plant. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOW TO HYPNOTIZE A CHICKEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lay the chicken on its stomach, then move your finger in a
straight line away from its beak. ``This induces total sensory
overload in the chicken's two-volt brain, putting him/her/it under
for anywhere from 15 seconds to 30 minutes.'' _ From ``The Straight
Dope'' by Cecil Adams &QL; 
 &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Jefferson Davis' Southern Chicken &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that Jefferson Davis. This is his very own recipe:
</P>
<P>
   Cut a chicken into serving portions. Cook in a pressure cooker
for about 20 minutes to tenderize. (OK, they DIDN'T have pressure
cookers in the days of the Confederacy. They steamed the chicken in
a cast-iron pot with the lid held down by cast-iron bars. Same
result.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove chicken from pressure cooker and dust lightly with fine
cracker crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Put four heaping teaspoons of butter _ not margarine or oil _
into a large frying pan and melt over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken
until light brown. Turn the pieces frequently. This will take about
5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove and serve at once, while good and hot. _ From ``Bull Cook
and Authentic Historical Recipes and Practices'' by George Leonard
Herter and Berthe E. Herter &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe is from ``Bless the Cook'' by Bessie
Munson, legendary Fort Worth cook and restaurateur. She also spent
some time in Hollywood catering for the likes of Loretta Young, and
was food director for Camp Waldemar, near Kerrville. &QL;

GORE TO BRING CAMPAIGN INTO BUSH TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAYTOWN, Mo. _ Sensing an opening in reports of Texas budget
troubles, Vice President Al Gore is scrambling his schedule for a
detour into Bush's backyard Thursday to make his point in person.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has spent the week unveiling anti-crime initiatives
between attacks on what he says is the governor's fiscal
irresponsibility, will be in San Antonio in the afternoon. There,
he will criticize Bush's handling of the economy, which Gore said
will see a shortfall this year, reducing the state's surplus from
$6.4 billion to about $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was not previously scheduled, but the Gore campaign
hopes to capitalize on news reports suggesting that Texas's fiscal
situation has worsened over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers continue not to add up,'' said Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane, referring to Bush's budget. ``It's become a major
issue in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign maintains Gore has exaggerated the shortfall,
and that the state has more than ample funds to cover its expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent several weeks on a ``Progress and Prosperity'' tour,
traveling the country to herald the administration's success in
producing record federal budget surpluses, and promising more of
the same. In recent days, he has also gone on the attack, seizing
on the shrinking Texas surplus to chip away at a record of which
the governor is very proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Governor Bush has run Texas is relevant to the judgment
the American people will make as to how he would run the country if
he ever gave them the chance,'' Gore told an audience of about 100
law enforcement and government officials gathered at the Raytown
City Hall to hear his crime policies. ``Especially since he is
calling for the same priorities that gave Texas its budget
shortfall: unaffordable tax cuts for powerful interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also spoke of some additional anti-crime notions Wednesday.
He proposed to add 50,000 more police officers, and 10,000 new
prosecutors, to the nation's justice system, to increase the number
of state and local prosecutors by a third. He also proposed
targeting so-called crime ``hot-spots'' by making grants to those
areas, to pay for police overtime, and to improve communications
between local and federal law enforcement authorities. Raytown,
currently in the grip of a methamphetamine epidemic, is one such
``hot spot.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the Gore crime proposals, like everything else he has
brought up in recent days, were laid against the backdrop of Bush's
state budget.
</P>
<P>
   You can't improve crime-fighting ``if your policies would leave
no money for cops and prosecutors, in order to cut taxes for
powerful interests and the wealthy,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters of the San Antonio visit as part of an
answer to a completely unrelated question. During a brief visit to
a playground at the Richard C. Green Sr. Family Center _ at which
Gore tossed children into the air and had a long conversation with
two little girls about their dolls, and about Henry, their
troublesome classmate _ Gore was asked whether he agreed with the
Clinton Administration's opposition to the removal of four dams on
the Snake River, in the Pacific Northwest. Environmentalists have
pushed for the dams' removal, to recover salmon runs in the region.
Bush believes the dams should be retained.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, closely associated with environmental causes, was
noncommittal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to bring all the parties together for a solution
that protects the environment and doesn't harm the economy,'' Gore
said. ``I'm going to review it carefully. What's needed is to bring
all the stakeholders together.'' Then he segued into his
announcement of the San Antonio stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the Vice President is always welcome to Texas,''
said Bush spokesperson Dan Bartlett. ``But Texans won't appreciate
his continued misrepresentations and distortions of the record in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush will be in Texas Friday, Bartlett said, but in
Austin, not in San Antonio. He said the governor has no plans to
head elsehwere.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll give (Gore) a big Texas welcome,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ``In one way or another.''

DUVAL SAYS HE'S MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ The warm afternoon had given way to a
gray chill, spectators made their way toward the exits, and vendors
began closing up shop at the Old Course. Seemed like a perfect time
to start playing a few holes of golf, so there was David Duval
strolling down the first fairway at 5:15 Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   On a long list of charming aspects to St. Andrews, the fact that
you can get in 18 holes after dinner ranks near the top. Yet it
seemed surprising to see Duval out that late, given the fact that
most of his colleagues already had played 18, hit balls, putted,
and gone to get some rest as they prepared for the 129th British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval has his own game plan, even if it's not in his nature
to be big with specifics. After all, he reasons, his intentions
seem to get twisted and misunderstood. An example is the perception
that he has a genuine dislike for the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' said Duval, who knows the misconception
comes from problems he had with the media (mostly European) at last
year's British Open at Carnoustie. The course was a brutal setup,
Duval said. And even though his colleagues echoed those sentiments,
it was Duval who took the brunt of the beating in the papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disillusioned with what transpired in the papers,
obviously,'' said Duval. ``Not with the Open itself. The
championship itself is second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that he wants to do well in this major, Duval
played in the Loch Lomond last week in Glasgow, a tournament that
ended Saturday and allowed for an early arrival here. He played St.
Andrews Sunday and Monday, played a little Tuesday night, and was
back at it Wednesday. And it's all business, said Duval. This isn't
a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel like when I'm at a golf tournament, I'm there
to work and golf,'' said Duval, explaining why he didn't bring his
fishing equipment to Scotland. ``I'm not there to fish. I do enough
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks he's done enough talking when it comes to the
topic of his winless streak. Duval's last trip to the winner's
circle came in April 1999, and while he hasn't had to declare
bankruptcy, he said it has been frustrating _ not so much that he
hasn't won, but because his play has been good enough for
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm driving it pretty good,'' said Duval. ``I
think I'm in the top five for hitting greens in regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves?
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting. The putting has been lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Duval ranks 168th on the PGA Tour in putts per round,
mind-boggling for a guy who is a fairways-and-greens machine.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a comforting thought coming into an event in which
long lag putts and buckets of 4-footers are considered the keys to
winning. But Duval, through his wraparound shades, sees a cup
half-full.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are going to change,'' said Duval. ``I think
there are some great things in front of me.''

&HT;     PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES STILL LAG BEHIND REST OF SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 10 years after a law was enacted to halt
discrimination against them, people with disabilities continue to
lag behind the rest of society in employment, income and access to
health care, according to a survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``America must do more to release the talents and abilities of
our citizens with disabilities who want to work, participate and
contribute to the nation,'' Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said at a news
conference here.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleland, a Vietnam veteran who lost both legs and an arm in
the war, said the survey also reflects progress in some areas
especially among younger people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have grown up in a society that tells them that
they are capable of doing anything are beginning to make good on
that promise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law July 26,
1990, by President George Bush. The law was aimed at easing access
to the everyday world at a time when people with mental or physical
disabilities were often institutionalized. Some 54 million
Americans are considered disabled today.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law went into effect, hundreds of technical guidelines
have brought wider aisles, lower counters and drinking fountains,
automatic doors and more accessible restrooms in stores and other
places of public accommodation. Many restaurants, hotels and office
buildings have installed ramps and more elevators to accommodate
disabled guests. Movie theaters have listening devices for deaf
people, and 80 percent of public buses now are equipped with
wheelchair lifts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by the National Organization on Disability
(NOD), a Washington-based advocacy group, and the New York-based
Harris Poll found that 56 percent of people with disabilities who
are able to work currently hold full- or part-times jobs, compared
with 80 percent of those without disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Brewster Thackeray, NOD's communications director, said the
employment picture for people with disabilities who are able to
work has improved since 1986 when only 46 percent held jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these changes (will take) a generation or two to
really set in and alter the way society looks at people with
disabilities and the way people with disabilities look at
themselves,'' Thackeray said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed a significant income gap between people
with and without disabilities. Twenty-nine percent of those with
disabilities live in households with incomes of $15,000 or less.
Ten percent of people without disabilities live in such households.
Conversely, 16 percent of people with disabilities live in
households with $50,000 or more annual income. But 39 percent of
those without disabilities live in such households.
</P>
<P>
   Thackeray said much of the income gap stems from the fact that
people with disabilities lag in education, with more than one of
every five failing to complete high school, compared with fewer
than one of 10 people without disabilities lacking a high school
diploma. Twelve percent of people with disabilities have graduated
from college compared with 23 percent of those without
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   However, Thackeray said the education gap may be closing. He
noted that 77 percent of people with disabilities have graduated
from high school today compared with 61 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of health care, people with disabilities are just as
likely to have health insurance as their non-disabled counterparts.
However, the disabled are much more likely to postpone seeking
needed health care because they cannot afford it. Twenty-eight
percent put off doctor visits, versus 12 percent of non-disabled
people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people with disabilities are four times as likely
as their non-disabled counterparts to have special needs that are
not covered by their health insurance, 28 percent compared with 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll was conducted between May 25 and June 11 with
a nationally representative sample of 1,005 people ages 16 and
above with disabilities and 1,000 people ages 16 and above without.
The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NOD President Alan A. Reich said the survey also showed that
people with disabilities do not go to restaurants or vote as
frequently as people without disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 40 percent of people with disabilities go
to restaurants at least once a week, compared with 60 percent of
people without disabilities. In addition, 62 percent of people with
disabilities were registered to vote in the 1996 election compared
with 78 percent of people without disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuing problems, Reich said people with
disabilities have a ``very positive'' outlook on the future.
According to the survey, 63 percent said life has improved for them
over the past decade and nearly 50 percent said they believe things
will get better in the next five years.

   PASADENA _ It's a network without a ``Big Brother'' or a
``Millionaire'' that's looking for a ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacock network surprised TV critics Tuesday by admitting it
wants to jump into reality television _ despite the controversy
surrounding the shows _ possibly with a woman in chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ignore this as something that's going to go away,''
said Garth Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment, at the
semiannual TV press tour. ``The public spoke, and they want these
shows. The challenge is not just chasing a clone (of `Survivor' or
`Millionaire').
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find the next genre of this programming that
will have some life. We've heard every variation of putting people
on a bus or train or whatever and have them kicked off one by one.
Nothing we've seen so far is something we're happy announcing (as
being in development).''
</P>
<P>
   It's been reported that NBC was looking at a program developed
in Europe of a woman chained to prospective boyfriends. She must
make a decision who to stay with and who to set free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality programming is definitely here,'' agreed Scott Sassa,
president of NBC West Coast. ``This is not a fad; it's a trend
that's going to be around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The line of what is acceptable has definitely been blurred.
It's a moving target defined by public tastes and public sentiment.
We weren't as aggressive as we should have been in pursuing that
type of programming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa conceded that the network's success in traditional
fictional series programming such as ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order,''
and its adherence to a concrete schedule contributed to NBC's
flat-footed response to reality TV's explosion on competing
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success in story form hurts us in (developing reality
shows),'' he said. ``Because of our stability, we're more
vulnerable because we have none of those shows.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC was second in the network ratings last season for the much-
sought-after 18-to-49 viewers coming in behind ABC, whose success
can be planted squarely on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa has taken some criticism for not jumping into reality
programming sooner and boosting the network's ratings. He was in
for some good-natured ribbing Tuesday during a skit that introduced
him and hinted at his demise at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports had Jack Welch, head of NBC's parent company,
General Electric, and one of the best-known and toughest executives
in the country, pressuring and criticizing Sassa for having missed
the reality programming trend.
</P>
<P>
   Reality programming will likely pop up on NBC next summer,
despite the added costs of generating original programming during
the season when viewers are watching the networks the least. It
has, however, been a success for CBS this summer with its popular
``Survivor'' series and to a much lesser extent with ``Big
Brother,'' which has taken a caning from critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``One smart thing about placing them in summer is that they're
against competition that's not as great,'' Sassa said, admitting
that due to the fact that such programs have such short shelf lives
_ they can't really be repeated or syndicated _ their ostensibly
lower price tag is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tricky field _ one of the trepidations is that you
don't want to inhibit the brand of quality we've established with
NBC over the years,'' Sassa said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa suggested that criticisms that series such as ``Big
Brother'' have debased network airwaves are ``not a good thing or
bad thing. It is what it is. Public sentiment and morals have
changed. I'm not comfortable making value judgments of other
people's programming.'' &QL;

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I poured my concrete driveway in several sections about three
years ago and now the surface of the concrete has started to flake
off and also seems to be crumbling in numerous places.
 &HT;    Without actually breaking up and pouring a whole new driveway,
can you tell me what I did wrong and what I can do to level off
this concrete?
 &HT;    A: The flaking condition you speak of is usually the result of
adding too much water to the concrete mix, or not allowing the
concrete slab to cure properly.
 &HT;    It's not easy, but you can resurface the driveway by adding a
new 1/2-inch layer of concrete on top, covering one half-width
section at a time.
 &HT;    Wash the surface with a degreasing solution (sold for use on
garage floors) and a pressure washer.
 &HT;    Then install 1x2 furring strips edgewise along the side of the
driveway so that the top of the strip sticks up 1/2 inch above the
concrete.
 &HT;    Lay a strip of 1/2-inch plywood down the center of the driveway,
then coat the old concrete between these strips with an acrylic
masonry adhesive.
 &HT;    Before this dries spread on a mix of one part Portland cement
and three parts fine sand with enough water added to form the
consistency of thick oatmeal.
 &HT;    Level this off by dragging a 2x4 edgewise across the top of the
wood strips, then trowel smooth with a long wood float.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I stained and varnished some solid mahogany cabinets, but
after applying three coats of varnish and sanding between coats the
finish still does not have that mirror-smooth, glossy look I have
seen on similar pieces.
 &HT;    There are still tiny indents or pores showing in the wood, even
though I sanded the wood smooth.
 &HT;    What did I do wrong?
 &HT;    A: Mahogany is an open-pored wood and the pores tend to show
through when varnish or paint is applied without filling these
pores first.
 &HT;    The pores are filled by applying a wood filler paste before the
first coat of paint or varnish.
 &HT;    Sold in most paint stores, and normally applied before the
stain, this filler comes in a thick, paste form that must be
thinned with solvent then brushed on across the grain.
 &HT;    Before it has a chance to dry the excess must be rubbed off with
a coarse cloth by wiping in a circular motion. After this dries,
sand smooth with fine paper before the first coat of varnish is
applied.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Our kitchen ceiling was painted with a semi-gloss enamel and
now needs repainting. However, there is grease on the area over the
stove and in several other places.
 &HT;    Cleaning all this grease off will be very difficult for us, so
can you suggest any type of paint we can use over this greasy
surface?
 &HT;    A: I would not advise painting over the grease; it's bound to
cause trouble later on. You really should wash the grease off
first.
 &HT;    Even after washing the ceiling I recommend you play safe and
apply a first coat of a primer such as BIN, Kilz, or similar
stain-killing sealer before you apply your regular paint.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My vacation house is in the mountains and has oak floors. In
several places this hardwood flooring has dark colored small dents
_ almost like pit marks that have shown up recently.
 &HT;    Most of these marks are in the middle of the floor, not around
the edges.
 &HT;    What explanation can you offer for the source of these dark
dents or marks?
 &HT;    A: Impossible to say for sure, but I suspect that they are
caused by gritty materials that are being brought in from the
outside on people's shoes after they have walked over sandy or
gravelly areas.
 &HT;    Particles of sand or pebbles get caught in the soles of their
shoes and these gouge or scratch the floor.
 &HT;    It's also possible that small amounts of road tar or dirt have
been caught in people's shoes before they come in and this could be
leaving the dark appearance.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to

Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general

&HT;     RICK MIRER, BACKUP QUARTERBACK, SUDDENLY FINDS THAT HE'S A
VET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE ADAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. - Rick Mirer is not sure where the time has
gone. One day he was a rookie with the Seattle Seahawks. Now he's a
well-traveled veteran coming into 49ers training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the old guy,'' he said with a sense of wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   Moving around will do that. This is the quarterback's fifth team
in five years and he's tired of the days of ``if this is a yellow
helmet it must be Green Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get things turned around,'' Mirer said.
``Hopefully this is the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirer has been in the league for eight years. He got off to a
promising start in Seattle, where he was named rookie of the year
in 1993 after setting three NFL rookie passing records.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't follow up on that brilliant beginning in his next
three seasons and was traded to the Chicago Bears in `97. Then it
was the Packers in `98 and the New York Jets last year. At each
stop he was mostly a backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard for me to get comfortable anywhere _ settling
in, feeling good about my role,'' he said. ``It's been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci plans on going through camp with four
quarterbacks, probably keeping just three for the regular season.
Second-year man Jeff Garcia comes in as the starter. Beyond that,
it gets crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Third-round draft pick Giovanni Carmazzi, a rugged, intelligent
quarterback out of Hofstra who just came to terms with the team
Tuesday, has yet to practice but is valued by coaches for his
potential. Seventh-round pick Tim Rattay has been getting a lot of
snaps in early drills, bringing from Louisiana Tech a familiarity
with the pro-style offense.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Mirer, fighting to not permanently be seen as that
NFL cliche of the savvy aging vet usually signed in desperation as
insurance against injury.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer spent much of the spring and early summer dangling while
the 49ers quarterback situation was as unsettled as Steve Young's
future plans. Finally on June 13, the day after Young retired,
Mirer was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I was waiting for,'' Mirer said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he didn't have any inside information, but he did
feel he'd eventually end up with the 49ers, so it wasn't a
stressful period for him.
</P>
<P>
   Without a proven starter in the style of Joe Montana or Young,
the 49ers find quarterback depth to be a critical issue. While
Garcia is the starter, he is still, in Mariucci's words, ``a work
in progress.'' When he faltered last year, the team briefly turned
to Steve Stenstrom in an effort to spark the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer has a head start on the rookies in learning the 49ers'
complex offense. He said the Packers had a similar scheme, although
his practical experience there was limited because he was behind
Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got to play in it a lot,'' he said. ``I didn't get a
lot of practice time either.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirer, who is comfortable scrambling out of the pocket then
``winging it,'' hopes to get some quality time at quarterback
during the exhibition season. He said playing time as a backup is
precious, and he'd like to be in a situation ``where you're not
living and dying on every play.''
</P>
<P>
   He diplomatically won't compare himself to the other
quarterbacks because he doesn't want to ``confuse the issue.'' He
acknowledges Garcia has the starting job. ``He paid his dues,'' he
said. ``It's his team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear Mirer would be very happy to come out of camp as the
primary backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every team in the league has to go in with more than
one guy they think can play,'' he said. ``Usually the second guy
gets a shot at some point. As a competitive person, I want to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirer said he reached one of his goals when he signed with the
49ers. ``I've always wanted to be in this system,'' he said, adding
he felt his style was a good fit with the West Coast offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be involved,'' he said. ``You don't want to
stand around just rusting.''

ARMSTRONG MAINTAINS LEAD AS TOUR ENTERS SWISS ALPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The Tour de France said goodbye to the
Alps _ and, briefly, to France _ as the riders left from Evian to
cover one mountain, cross the border, and finish here, the home of
the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong's lead was secure as he held onto the yellow
jersey that he will likely _ barring a crash _ wear into Paris,
while Erik Dekker of the Netherlands won the race in a sprint
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was without some of his biggest rivals as he stayed
with the pack for the entire 96-mile ride that made a wide loop
around Lake Geneva. Italian Marco Pantani, citing intestinal
problems, didn't start, and Alex Zulle of Switzerland missed a
chance to be cheered by his countrymen when he dropped out early.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani won the Tour in 1998, and Zulle was second to Armstrong
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dekker, an Olympic silver medalist in 1992, said he surprised
himself with his third win of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it!'' he said. ``Yeah, I had thought about it,
but not this way. I didn't imagine it would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The record for Dutch victories in a Tour is four stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 500 meters, I was gambling,'' he said. ``I saw the
bunch coming behind me and knew I had to sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   His gamble paid off as he nipped German Erik Zabel at the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   American Fred Rodriguez once again was in the hunt, but once
again he fell short. Wednesday he finished third in the sprint
finish; two weeks ago he came in fourth. Dekker won that day, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually felt worse today than two weeks ago,'' said
Rodriguez, the US national champion who rides for the Italian Mapei
team. ``But it's my first Tour, and you have your good days and bad
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall standings stayed the same, with Jan Ullrich more
than five minutes behing Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Bruyneel, director of the US Postal Service team, said
Armstrong went to all of his teammates Tuesday night to apologize
for his poor performance that day when, in Armstrong's word, he
``bonked'' going up the last mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show that you can't think the Tour is ovr
until you reach the Champs Elysees,'' Bruyneel said.
</P>
<P>
   Just 130 of the original 988 riders are left, and the
American-based US Postal Service team is the only one left with its
full roster of nine riders.

`THE IN CROWD': IMPERSONAL MISHMASH

theater mix of ``Rebecca'' and ``Caddyshack.'' Warner Brothers has
asked that the press not reveal the ending of the film, but
probably the only people who could be surprised at this movie will
be those who wandered into the wrong multiplex theater by mistake.

   Mary Lambert, whose crystalline, dexterous video work of the
1980s made many of us believe she had a career in film ahead of
her, directed this impersonal mishmash. Only a vaguely techno score
and a pansexual central figure distinguishes it from summer
thrillers of years past, back in the days when versions of the song
``The In Crowd'' by Ramsey Lewis or Dobie Gray would have been on
the soundtrack. (For those who are about the age of this movie's
cast, the song was used during a bank robbery sequence in the 1996
film ``Set It Off.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The In Crowd'' stars Lori Heuring, who resembles Madonna.
Heuring plays Adrien, who has just been released from a mental
asylum, St. Anastasia, and has been placed in a work program at a
tony country club. Based on the characters and their poor little
rich kids problems, the club must not be far from Melrose Place. Of
course that show has been canceled, but those in need of a
third-generation Xerox version of Darren Star's patented bitchery
can wander into a theater running this film.
</P>
<P>
   Adrien finds herself caught in the intrigues at the country
club, where Brittany (Susan Ward) takes an immediate liking to her.
There's an obsessive nature to Brittany's courtship of Adrien as a
friend that has something to do with Brittany's vanished older
sister, Sandra, who looks just like Adrien. It turns out both women
have some deep, dark secrets of their own. Brittany is not to be
trusted, according to the herd of underdefined characters who
stampede past Adrien. Only someone who was recently released from a
movie mental asylum would allow herself to be fooled by Brittany.
Sure, Adrien reaches out to Brittany despite her better judgment
because of some big void in Adrien's scarred soul that fuels a
desperate need for friendship. But does it really matter?
</P>
<P>
   No, since the plot must build to a final cat fight that has to
take place in a setting with as many lethal implements as a
hardware store. Apparently all of the deserted warehouses were
being used in other summer pictures, so the climactic battle in
``The In Crowd'' breaks out in a storage room under the country
club.
</P>
<P>
   Some talented veteran actors get a chance to deepen their tans
here, among them Daniel Hugh Kelly, Tess Harper and Nathan Bexton,
who had a brief but very memorable turn in ``Go,'' where an Ecstasy
overdose had him believing he could communicate with cats through
telepathy.
</P>
<P>
   Some portions of ``The In Crowd'' are just as funny as his
scenes in ``Go,'' just not intentionally. Many of the younger
actors _ Heuring and Laurie Fortier _ flash a hint of something,
but they mostly do their best to stay out of the way of that
surprise ending.
</P>

LAWSUIT SAYS NOT COVERING CONTRACEPTIVES IS DISCRIMINATORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (Eds: Story may be led with comment from Bartell.) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a case that could have broad impact on contraceptive coverage
nationwide, Planned Parenthood filed a class-action lawsuit
Wednesday charging that a company whose health insurance plan
covers most prescription drugs, but excludes contraceptives, is
illegally discriminating against its female employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sex discrimination when male employees get their basic
health care needs covered by insurance, but women are forced to pay
for their own,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   The case, brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, was
filed in federal court in Seattle on behalf of Jennifer Erickson, a
pharmacist at the Bartell Drug Co., and all other female employees
of the company, which operates 45 drugstores in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, who is 26, married and spends more than $300 a year
out of pocket on her own contraception, said she had become
increasingly troubled by the inequity as she had to tell women who
came to the store that their insurance would not pay for
contraceptive prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single day, I'm processing prescriptions and telling
women that their pills aren't covered,'' said Erickson, who has
worked at the drug chain for about 18 months. ``Sometimes, they
walk away from the counter and say they can't afford it. It really
makes you sad, and then you realize your own company doesn't cover
it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Erickson said, she wrote to the human resources
department asking that contraceptive coverage be added to the
company policy, and was told that it was not something the company
felt it should cover. She got a similar response, she said, when
she talked to her supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of contraceptive coverage has been a rallying point
for women's rights activists for several years _ especially since
many employers who do not pay for contraception moved quickly to
provide coverage for Viagra, which, at nearly $10 a pill, is used
to combat impotence.
</P>
<P>
   While almost all traditional indemnity insurance plans provide
coverage for some prescription drugs, only about half cover any of
the five contraceptive methods available by prescription _ oral
contraceptive pills, the intrauterine device, Depo Provera,
Norplant, and diaphragm _ all of them prescribed to women. And only
about a third cover the pill, which costs about a dollar a day.
Even among HMO's, which offer the most comprehensive coverage, only
39 percent cover all five methods, and 7 percent do not cover the
pill.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute found,
women of reproductive age typically spend 68 percent more on
out-of-pocket health care than men.
</P>
<P>
   In response to requests by Planned Parenthood of Western
Washington and other women's rights groups, the Microsoft Corp.
changed its insurance benefits to cover contraceptives, as have
Darigold and Swedish Hospital, two other major employers in the
Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the question of gender equity in prescription drug
coverage has mostly been one for the legislatures. Since April
1998, 13 states have passed laws requiring that private insurance
plans that pay for prescription drugs must also include
contraceptive coverage: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,
Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, North
Carolina, Rhode Island and Vermont. Similar legislation is pending
in more than a dozen other states, including New York and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Equity in Prescription Contraceptive Coverage Act
has been stalled in Congress since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of taking the matter to court, as a form of sex
discrimination under Title VII, is not a new one. Indeed, a New
York University law professor, Sylvia Law, argued for that strategy
in a 1998 article in the Washington Law Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfectly clear that Title VII covers sex discrimination
in health coverage,'' Law said this week. ``The defendants may say
that they're not excluding contraception for women only, they're
excluding contraception for everyone, and it just happens that the
only prescription contraceptives available in this country are for
women. But there's such a disparate impact on women, 100 percent,
that I think there's a pretty persuasive argument for sex
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting from a legal strategy to a live plaintiff, however, took
some doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that it's hard to find a woman who wants to sue
her employer over contraceptive coverage, for all the obvious
reasons,'' said Eve Gartner, a lawyer for Planned Parenthood.
``It's not like suing when you've been fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still untested water, but it could be an important
case,'' she added. ``Even though the verdict will only be legally
binding on this one employer, if we win, it puts everyone who
doesn't provide contraceptive coverage on notice that their
employees could sue.''

`AMERICAN RHAPSODY': WILD EMBELLISHMENTS, BUT YOU KNOW THE REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At last we have concrete evidence that during the events leading
up to President Clinton's impeachment trial, the level of national
discourse really did reach the level of a Joe Eszterhas movie.
Because in his new book, Eszterhas, author of the award-winning
``Showgirls'' (jacket copy cites its Sour Apple Award from the
Hollywood Women's Press Association), has brought his screenwriting
skills to bear upon imagining the deepest, darkest, sudsiest
thoughts of this scandalous story's major and bit players. Harry
Potter is the rare contemporary celebrity whose sex life does not
come under lascivious scrutiny here.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways in which even the author's ``Basic Instinct''
pales by comparison to his ``American Rhapsody.'' After all, by
page 5 Eszterhas has the president smoking marijuana while wearing
a girlfriend's dress, and this is quite a long-winded, excitedly
profane book. And his most attention-getting move here is writing
not just a speaking part, but also rap lyrics to be delivered to
the president by the president's chatty penis, in verse that
bespeaks either the author's professional death wish or his
pathological nostalgia for junior high school. Sample rhyme: ``You
want fame, I want a dame.'' Sample couplet: ``For better or worse,
it's me and you/So stop feeling so low-down blue.''
</P>
<P>
   As this may suggest, sex is central to ``American Rhapsody.''
But it's sex as in ``sexagenarian,'' since the author is largely
concerned with the presidential generation now crowding 60, and
since reflections on his own heavily fraught sexual identity
provide the book's galvanizing force.
</P>
<P>
   Something about this presidential scandal has rekindled the
countercultural energy in Eszterhas, who was a gutsy, pioneering
Rolling Stone reporter long before he hit Hollywood (and vice
versa). He is reminded, sometimes ad nauseam, that behaving like a
rock star around groupies was once (to his thinking) the mandate of
the free-spirited male sex-drugs-and-rock 'n' roller, and that a
funny thing happened to those standards on the way to the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   So this loose, rambling sketchbook, which is both personal and
political memoir, becomes the author's effort to understand what
became of the sexual mores of his floridly evoked youth. ``We wore
no underwear, and the funkier our bell-bottoms looked, the hipper
they were, especially if there was a copy of Chairman Mao's Little
Red Book in the back pocket,'' he writes, with a typical taste for
generational slander. ``We swore by our genitals the way Nixon
swore by his `old Quaker mother.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thus predisposed, and ready to embrace Bill Clinton as the
poster president for 1960s culture and idealism, not to mention as
a kindred spirit whose ``mad priapic obsession'' he shared,
Eszterhas found himself obsessed and enraged by recent White House
scandals. In writing this book, he explains, he ``was thinking
about the state of the union and the state of our hearts and
privates as we tried not to stumble and slide on the treacherous
Internet ice of the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means, in more nuts-and-bolts terms, is a book that is
interspersed with clearly fictitious, largely awkward monologues
(ascribed to Bob Dole, Al Gore, Monica Lewinsky, etc.) but consists
mostly of the author's rehashing and embellishing recent, familiar
events.
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas demonstrates, for instance, a sharp ear for dialogue
in choosing telltale taped conversational snippets from Lewinsky
and Linda Tripp, but anyone who followed these revelations as they
unfolded is liable to have heard this material before. And not even
his prodigious research into the writings of Gennifer Flowers has
much news value by now.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has researched this material so thoroughly as to come
up with trivia from Matt Drudge's high school yearbook, the story
he tells is not easily improved upon. It was a bad enough movie
before Eszterhas decided to use a nickname for the presidential
penis (``Willard'') and write White House love scenes with feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Thus one-upped by the awful truth, Eszterhas winds up looking
elsewhere for frissons of scandal. So his otherwise surprisingly
tame account is punctuated by all manner of free-floating slurs,
from Jay Leno's meanest Hillary Clinton jokes to casual asides.
(``Her style was to eat fried chicken in the back seat of the limo
with Bill when he was governor and to leave the chewed bones on the
limo floor.'') And, as he says repeatedly, Eszterhas likes Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He saves the real venom, and the cheapest shots, for those
practitioners of Hollywood ethics whose behavior, as the book
argues, is the model for the sexually exploitative power politics
that real politics have come to mimic. He seems both shocked and
amused to suggest that the distance between Bill Clinton and the
producer Bob Evans (described here as the compleat party animal, in
the book's least interesting revelation) is smaller than it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Beach-book fanciers will undoubtedly gravitate to the freely
flung dirt here, from invidious suggestions that Sharon Stone is
the kind of actress who sexually curries favor with the
screenwriter, even if the screenwriter is Eszterhas, to a
particularly cruel anecdote about Farrah Fawcett, to Larry Flynt's
description of having sex with a chicken. ( Flynt, unlike many of
the more straight-arrow types described here, comes across as a
well-evoked kindred spirit.) But this kind of reference is what
demolishes the book's real passion.
</P>
<P>
   The author's fierce longing for a lost '60s idealism comes
through even when he is not dropping the name of his friend Jimi
Hendrix or noting that he was the only white listener to a speech
given by Stokely Carmichael. But he can't easily rekindle that
generational fire while dragging this memoir through the mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Rhapsody'' is mercifully free of cynicism, though.
It's easy to believe Eszterhas' assertion that he was genuinely
roiled by national events to the point where this was a book he had
to write. It's also easy to hear traces of the (by now) grand old
Rolling Stone tradition of fearless, indignant first-person
political reporting in the youthful outrage that he struggles to
reinvent. Freed of all the excess (and excessive) baggage he piles
onto ``American Rhapsody,'' perhaps that old voice could have been
loud and clear.

&HT;     WEIGHTLIFTER, CANCER SURVIVOR, HOPES TO MAKE OLYMPIC TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JERRY BRIGGS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Cancer-surviving Olympic weightlifter Wes Barnett
never will roam a baseball outfield with Jim Edmonds, Andruw Jones
or Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the vision-impaired Barnett even finds it hard to play a
game of catch with his 12-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``My depth perception,'' the two-time Olympian explained
sheepishly, ``is terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing, however, remains clear in Barnett's life: his desire
to win an Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, waging a battle against choroidal melanoma, will
compete Saturday in the U.S. Weightlifting team trials in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   If he makes the squad, he will be headed to Sydney, Australia,
for a dramatic appearance in the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling people that if I didn't think I could win a
medal, then I wouldn't have continued on for another four years,''
he said. ``It's going to be a matter of staying healthy and getting
some good, quality training in.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett's health became a major issue in August 1998, when tests
revealed he had developed a tumor on the right eye.
</P>
<P>
   This type of melanoma, normally an affliction of the elderly,
struck Barnett at age 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like, 'How can this be?''' Barnett recalled. ``I'm an
Olympic athlete. I'm 28 years old. I'm healthy. There's no way this
could be.'''
</P>
<P>
   But it was true _ the tumor had grown to the point that surgical
radiation treatment was required to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a situation where you put your faith in God,'' said
Barnett, a 30-year-old Colorado Springs resident. ``You put your
faith in the doctors, and you hope for the best. Fortunately for
me, it's so far, so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the long-term prognosis for his health is good, his
chances of making the U.S. team are less than certain.
</P>
<P>
   Only two male American weightlifters are assured of competing
for the United States, and Barnett recently dropped to No. 3 in the
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   He will need a strong showing Saturday afternoon to move up into
the top two.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Barnett may have to settle for one of two alternate
roster spots, and hope that the international federation allows all
four American males on the travel squad a chance to compete.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with the national media in May, Barnett brushed
off a suggestion that recent bouts with blurred vision and dizzy
spells might hurt his cause in the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Barnett, who won a gold medal in San Antonio at the
1993 U.S. Olympic Festival, ``because the bar isn't moving away
from me. You don't have to catch anything, or deal with any moving
objects. I'm real fortunate in that aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning a bronze medal in the 1997 world championships _
the high point of his career _ Barnett has ridden an emotional
roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   First came the cancer, the surgery and radiation treatment,
which caused him to sit out all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Then he launched a remarkable comeback in 1999, when he won his
sixth U.S. championship and placed 15th at the worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, he has struggled.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a back strain in the most recent U.S. championship
and failed to lift his usual heavy poundage at an exhibition one
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Oscar Chaplin III and Tom Gough have passed him
in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett has expressed optimism about increasing his lifts by
20-25 pounds between now and September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said confidently, ``should put me in the medal
range. That is what I'm going to be shooting for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Barnett made a name for himself as an
all-state basketball player at Benton High School in St. Joseph,
Mo., a small industrial town north of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of coaches at a nearby recreation center, he
gradually became infatuated with weightlifting and soon started to
win national meets on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett pretty much owned the American weightlifting scene in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, at age 22, he qualified for his first Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   He consistently finished in the top 15 at the world
championships and placed sixth among the 238-pound
super-heavyweights at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how he fares Saturday, fans can remember him as an
athlete who refused to quit in the face of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to kids or groups of people,'' Barnett said, ``I
let them know that if you set your goals and stay focused, then no
matter what your obstacles are, you can overcome them.''

HOME CLINIC: TIPS ON INSTALLING A NEW WINDOW

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, this column focused on selecting new windows. If you
decide to buy one, you will need three measurements before you can
place the order: the rough opening, the outside dimensions and the
thickness of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   To find the rough opening, pry off the interior casing, then
measure the distance between the studs on either side of the window
and the distance between the rough sill and the header. Measure the
height and width of the frame, i.e., the dimensions of the jamb, to
determine the outside dimensions. To find the thickness of the
wall, poke a ruler in the gap between the stud and the window
frame. Take the measurement from the leading edge of the stud
(where the outside sheathing is mounted) to the interior edge of
the wallboard. Take these measurements with you when you buy the
new window; they will help the dealer select the ideal size for
your opening.
</P>
<P>
   Once you buy a new window, you still have to install it. This is
not a particularly difficult task if the size of the replacement is
close to the old window. If it is larger, you will have to open up
the wall. This will require carpentry skill. If the window is much
smaller, you will have to close in the opening. This in itself is
not difficult, but you will have to extend the exterior finish to
the edge of the new window frame without making the repair into an
eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can install the new window, you will have to remove
the old one. From the inside, pry off all the window trim, the
casings and stop molding, then remove the sashes. Most window
frames are held in place with finishing nails that go through the
inner and outer casings into the wall studs. When you remove the
exterior casing (you already removed the inner when you pulled out
the sashes), the window may be loose. If not, check to see if there
are any finishing nails that go through the jamb into the studs.
Cut these with a hacksaw blade, then pull the frame out.
</P>
<P>
   Working from the outside, use a stiff putty knife to gentle pry
up the siding and insert 30-pound asphalt impregnated building felt
under the edges. Start at the bottom and work around the perimeter
of the window. Staple the pieces in place as you insert them. The
felt will keep moisture from penetrating into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the top of the window opening. If there is no drip cap
in place, install one. Slide the metal flange of the drip cap under
the siding, but do not nail it. When the window is installed, the
trim will hold it in place.
</P>
<P>
   Since the window frame will rest on the sill plate, it is a good
idea to check to see if it is level. If it is not, add shims on the
low end. Place the window in the opening; you may need a helper to
hold it while you insert shims to get the window centered and
leveled. From the exterior, measure around the window frame from
the jamb to the edge of the siding. Use these figures to measure
and cut the exterior trim molding. Remove the window and nail the
trim molding to the jambs. Squeeze a bead of caulk around the wall
opening in the area that will be covered by the overlapping trim
molding.
</P>
<P>
   Put the window back into the opening and tack it in place by
driving finishing nails through the trim into the wall. Do not
drive the nails home. Leave the heads projecting out so you can
remove the nails to make adjustments, if necessary. (It is not
necessary to nail exterior trim molding to aluminum or vinyl
windows because they have nailing flanges attached to the window
frame.)
</P>
<P>
   Use a level and a framing square to check that the window is
level, plumb and square. If not, insert shims to correct the
alignment. Open and close the window to make sure the sashes
operate freely. If they do not, then the frame is probably out of
square and needs adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   When all adjustments are satisfactory, secure the window by
driving 10d galvanized casing nails, spaced 16 inches apart,
through the exterior trim into the wall. Seal the unit by drawing a
bead of caulk around the perimeter of the trim.
</P>
<P>
   Working from the inside, fill the gaps between the jamb and
studs with fiberglass insulation. Do not pack too much insulation
in the gap or it could distort the window frame. Fiberglass
insulation can irritate the skin, so wear long sleeves, gloves and
a dust mask when working with it. Finally, reinstall the old
interior trim or cut new pieces to fit. &QL;

 SPELLING'S CAMPY NEW SHOW HAS tv CRITICS, NOT STARS, LAUGHING  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ``Titans'' isn't a comedy, but a promotional
trailer for the new NBC series shown this week in Pasadena had
critics laughing so hard that producers might want to reconsider.
NBC executives even recommend it as ``guilty pleasure''
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling, dean of prime-time soaps and very quick on his
feet, seized the opportunity and suggested that ``Titans'' is
indeed campy with tongue-in-cheek humor. But the pilot episode
wasn't shot that way, and cast members were visibly stunned by the
reaction, clearly not sure if critics were laughing with them or at
them.
</P>
<P>
   Yasmine Bleeth, who plays a manipulative vixen wheedling her way
into a moneyed Beverly Hills family, followed Spelling's lead and
suggested that something like ``Titans'' is merely the same sort of
mindless diversion as ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't really reality we're watching,'' she said. ``It's
pumped-up fantasy. It's like, what would happen if? Our types of
shows are what would happen if you just happen to be a trillionaire
family, and you had the kind of people who sleep with everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titans'' will air on Wednesday nights this fall, leading off a
night of drama that includes ``The West Wing'' and ``Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to feel sorry for Scott Sassa. Here's a guy who 18
months ago said he wanted NBC to bring a little more dignity to a
prime-time schedule that was already the smartest and most
sophisticated in the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes ``Survivor,'' a bona fide success story for CBS, and
Sassa starts second-guessing himself. Next comes ``Big Brother,''
not quite the success CBS had hoped for but still a summertime
force to be reckoned with, and the industry starts up a betting
pool on when Sassa will lose his job as president of NBC West Coast
because NBC doesn't have any viewer-as-voyeur programming to
counter CBS, nor does it have anything in the wings just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa's counterparts at ABC don't feel the same pressure because
they're still riding the crest with ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire,'' which will make up 18 percent of ABC's prime-time
slate this fall. And you'd think Sassa would have learned a lesson
from all the ``Millionaire'' copycats _ including NBC's own
``Twenty-One'' _ that tanked last season. He's a smart programmer,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, he probably has learned. But network honchos rarely get
to speak _ or act _ from the heart. They are driven by the bottom
line, which now says that ``reality'' programming like ``Survivor''
is attracting top advertising dollars, which is something that
can't be said about the low-brow cheese that has populated the
reality genre for years. Thus, it is incumbent on Sassa and Garth
Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment, to find progamming to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a fad,'' Sassa said Tuesday. ``It's a trend.
... The line of what is acceptable in television has definitely
been blurred. The sensibility of what's right and what's wrong is
different.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But couldn't there be one commercial network that
stands above it all, that dares to draw the line and not cross it?
</P>
<P>
   Sassa still looks as if he'd like NBC to be that network, but
his words indicate he has been given little choice in the matter:
``One of the problems that we had is that we are so obsessed with
making sure we have the highest-quality shows, the highest-quality
audiences, ... we weren't as aggressive as we should have been in
this (reality) area,'' he told TV critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want new, they want different, they want distinctive.
... Hopefully, we can find something that captures the imagination
of the public the way that `Survivor' did or the way that
`Millionaire' does.''
</P>
<P>
   What might that be?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Sassa and Ancier say they're considering another European
import, this one a ``relationship'' show in which a woman must
decide which of four men she'd rather be with by being chained to
all four at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Beam me up, Scotty. I think I'm ready to be voted off this
island.
</P>
<P>
   Cable isn't immune to the ``reality'' craze. As part of a
Halloween promotion, Fox Family Channel is looking for an extended
``family'' to spend a week in a supposedly haunted castle, all
under the camera's eye. Each 18-plus member of the five-person
family, which can include nieces, nephews, in-laws, etc., will
reside in a different part of the 300-year-old castle and be
required to accept ``physical challenges and ghost-hunting tasks''
without benefit of much sleep. Those who can last a week win a
vacation on a tropical isle, presumably without the ``Survivor''
gang. Think it's your family's turn for their 15 minutes of shame?

PBS TO TEST NEW SCHEDULES IN THE AUTUMN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY HANDELMAN   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif._ Public television is shaking up its schedule
in a test that will send long-running programs to different nights
in an effort to boost viewership.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot schedule project, as it is called at PBS, will begin
in October and run in seven cities through early winter, and will
likely lead to a new national strategy of programming, executives
told TV critics gathered in California.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are part of an ``effort to create a better schedule,
a more viewer-friendly schedule that will make some sense out of
the terrific programs we have and were offering,'' said John F.
Wilson, senior vice president of the PBS Programming Service.
</P>
<P>
   Because PBS is not a network like NBC, CBS or ABC, but rather is
a membership organization made up of affiliated stations, many
national programs do not air at the same time in every city. That
makes it more difficult for PBS to advertise and to promote
programs nationally.
</P>
<P>
   While some local stations air the national schedule, they
frequently pre-empt programs for locally produced shows.
</P>
<P>
   The test sites are Cleveland, Orlando, Fla., Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City, San Diego and Atlanta, along with all
of Georgia Public Television.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the cities were chosen to represent all regions of
the country and the different types of public-television stations,
such as university markets, community licenses and state networks.
</P>
<P>
   With increasing numbers of cable stations offering competition
and the types of programs that have been the staple of public
broadcasting, PBS is more closely looking at other schedules and
programs its shows will face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of being a counter-programmer is increasingly
difficult in a 50-channel environment,'' Wilson said. ``But, you
can take a look at some overwhelming competition to a given genre
or subject matter and get your program out of harm's way, in that
case.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he cited one of the system's signature series,
``Masterpiece Theatre,'' which has aired on Sunday nights for
decades. In the test cities, PBS likely will move the series to
another night, away from the strong competition of
made-for-network-TV movies, mini-series and regular network series.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he also wants to package shows with similar themes,
such as ``American Masters'' and ``The American Experience,'' both
of which are primarily biographical series. ``Nova'' might be
paired with ``Scientific American Frontiers.'' Wilson said the new
schedule arrangement is expected to spread nationally in April,
after some fine tuning. ``It's a case of when, not if,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke along with new PBS president Pat Mitchell, who joined
the system in March, after seven years with Turner networks, and a
long career at several other networks. Mitchell helped to produce
such multi-part documentaries as ``The Cold War'' and
``Millennium.'' One of her first initiatives is to launch a series
of summits with program producers and filmmakers and documentary
producers who will meet in September to discuss a range of
programming possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   All of them, she said, will address the networks new promotional
theme, ``Come to Public Television If You're Curious.'' In talking
with viewers, she said, ``They kept describing themselves as adults
with a big Why?' and that it was the curiosity factor that kept
bringing them back again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is best scheduling a variety of programs that she
call ``an embarrassment of riches.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the programs viewers will be seeing this season are Ken
Burns' 18-hour series ``Jazz'' in January, ``American Masters''
biographies of such subjects as Norman Mailer, Bob Marley, Clint
Eastwood and Lucille Ball, numerous pre-election specials, a Bill
Moyers miniseries focusing on American attitudes toward death and
dying, and a live ``Great Performances'' broadcast of a new
Broadway revival of ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' starring Nathan
Lane and Jean Smart.

MR. BIG RETURNS TO `SEX AND THE CITY'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MIKI TURNER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Noth wants a better dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm the least comedic character in `Sex and the City,'
'' says the man who has played Sarah Jessica Parker's ``Mr. Big''
the past three seasons on the hit HBO series. ``I actually
complained the first season about my role, because everyone was so
wonderfully dysfunctional and I seemed like this rich, spoiled,
self-made man. I was kind of worried. I didn't quite know what to
do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   So Noth, who returns to the show Sunday, cast a longing eye at
the bizarre sexual quirks some of his fellow men on the series have
gotten to offer Parker and her pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the men _ for better or worse _ have their dysfunction
handsomely served up on the show,'' Noth says with a laugh. ``Those
are delicious things to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but such quirks would be new to Mr. Big, who, so far,
can only claim some rather prosaic dsyfunctions, like being unable
to commit to Carrie (Parker's character).
</P>
<P>
   Which has certainly been enough for Noth to handle. The
Yale-trained actor, who starred on ``Law &AMP; Order'' from 1990 to
1995, says he's often approached on the street by viewers who want
to vent their frustrations with his ``Sex'' character.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask me, `What's wrong with you?' `Why can't you commit to
her?' `You're so bad.' `I've had a Mr. Big. You're terrible, get
lost.' You know, it's just entertainment, for God's sake,'' he
says. ``I hope (the show) isn't becoming a manual for people to
define their dating habits. We have enough trouble as it is. Maybe
people are watching too much TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least too much ``Sex and the City.'' The series, which
last year won the Golden Globe for best comedy (as well as a best
actress award for Parker), is HBO's highest-rated original series,
besting even ``The Sopranos.'' Noth is a fan, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's some honest moments in it about people and
everything else,'' the 42-year-old Wisconsin native says. ``I think
it's more honest in its portrayal of men and women than a lot of
the other shows are in terms of their portrayals of cops and
hospitals. Even when they try to be real, they are grossly
exaggerated and overdramatized and sentimentalized when they're
supposed to be gritty shows. Well, I think this little funny show,
with all its eccentricities, sometimes hits on the truth between
men and women, whether they like it or not. And maybe that's what
people are responding to.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, HBO is also expecting fans to respond to the return
of Big, who was last seen breaking Carrie's heart by taking up with
the waifish Natasha. So, can he give us a hint about whether Big
and Carrie will get back together?
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't do that,'' he replies simply.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can he help viewers grasp his take on his character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really bad when it comes to talking about character,'' he
says. ``I used to say this on `Law &AMP; Order,' too. ... It's hard for
me to articulate how I get into character. It all sounds like
googly-gook. The only actor that I ever knew who talked about
character in print intelligently was Laurence Olivier _ and maybe
something I read'' about Marlon Brando, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very instinctual process and it bleeds into you, but it
doesn't bleed into you. I can separate it, but to articulate how I
do it will make me sound like a raving idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the secret of his characterization, it's hit a chord
with viewers _ as has the whole show. And Noth, who's appeared on
stage in such classic plays as Hamlet and Shaw's Arms and the Man
and has a series-development deal with CBS, was taken by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would be as big as it has become,'' he
admits. ``The response in New York and LA has been outrageous. It
was pretty unexpected. I really never know what ... is going to hit
and what's not. It took `Law &AMP; Order' five years to really make a
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Sex,'' it was immediate _ as was the chemistry between
Noth and Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier working with Sarah,'' says Noth. ``She's
incredibly supportive and I feel very close to her. My relationship
with Sarah is so healthy and full of fun that I think it helped me
play the character _ especially in the first season when I didn't
know who he was supposed to be. He didn't even have a name.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question, of course, is this: Is Big worth all the
heartache and pain he causes Carrie?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll answer that as Chris Noth,'' Noth says. ``Yeah, sure,
everybody's worth it. He's no different than anybody else. He has
his problems and that relationship has its own particular problems.
They were together and did try to make it. The very things that
attracted them to each other and made them love each other were the
same things that drove them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, those kinds of questions always make me laugh a
little, and when I read what I said I always barf.'' .MDBO/.MDNM/

HITCHCOCK BY WAY OF DE PALMA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
What is it this summer? Directors who absolutely don't need to are
suddenly acting like Brian De Palma, overloading their movies with
Hitchcock references like they never had styles of their own.
</P>
<P>
   First, John Woo lifts plot and wholesale scenes from
``Notorious'' for his sequel to (the _ aha! _ De Palma-directed)
``Mission: Impossible.'' Now Robert Zemeckis, creator of the
cinema-savvy yet distinctively original ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit,'' ``Forrest Gump'' and ``Back to the Future'' movies, comes
down with a severe case of Hitch homage heaves in his latest, the
classy ghost story ``What Lies Beneath.''
</P>
<P>
   A none-too-clever yet incorrigibly tricky, slow-moving thriller
starring a coolly agitated Michelle Pfeiffer and a typically grumpy
Harrison Ford, ``Lies'' doesn't only borrow from Hitchcock. It's
also a sort of ``Post-Fatal Attraction'' that eventually employs
every creaky door hinge, rumbling music cue and suspenseful red
herring that Hollywood's canned in the last 40 or so years.
</P>
<P>
   But the main show here, simply because it's so unavoidably
obvious, is Spot The Alfred Influence. The whole first act is a
kind of bucolic ``Rear Window,'' as Pfeiffer's Claire Spencer
suspects her volatile new Vermont lakeside neighbor of doing away
with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who's seen the film's giveaway trailer knows that
that's not what's really responsible for all the mysterious
picture-fallings, computer-bootings and bathtub-fillings that start
occurring in Claire and her research professor husband Norman's
(Ford) picturesque home without benefit of mortal action. Mist,
drafts and rain seem to have moved in as well.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, we're getting spooky identity transfers by way of
``Vertigo.'' ``Beneath'' does for clawfoot tubs what ``Psycho'' did
for showers _ and in at least one sequence, does it shot-for-shot.
And that long-standing controversy over ``Suspicion''? If you're
not familiar with it, I don't want to spoil the one surprise the
DreamWorks marketing department hasn't already. But if you do know
what I'm talking about, let's just say that, finally, the matter
gets settled here conclusively, if not entirely satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
   There are more general nods to the master, such as Alan
Silvestri's very Bernard Herrmann score. Perhaps the most pleasant
one is Pfeiffer herself, who brings a troubled but rarely
overwrought humanity to the blond icon position. ``Beneath'' is
primarily Claire's story, and Pfeiffer deftly balances
defensiveness, vulnerability and a sense of humor about her
increasingly outlandish situation as the heroine falls deeper into
apparent insanity _ and maintains as much dignity as could be
expected when Claire learns that things are much, much worse than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Zemeckis has mentioned that he's quite proud to have gotten away
with ``What Lies Beneath's'' deliberate pace and careful buildup in
these short-attention-span, quick-payoff movie times. And while
that isn't a bad thing, you wish that it had been done in the
service of a more original story that actually followed its title's
dictum and dove deeper into character motivations and interpersonal
deceptions, rather than just repeatedly plunge people into bodies
of water.
</P>
<P>
   That movie might have been a real Hitchcock homage, instead of
just a Brian De Palma one. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than two years ago, the first handheld MP3 player was
introduced, at a time when downloadable digital music was still a
mystery to just about anyone who wasn't a college student or a
basement-bound techie.
</P>
<P>
   That first player, the Rio 300 PMP, has now spawned its third
generation, the Rio 600, as sleek and curvy as its predecessor was
boxy and bland. And it is only one of a new wave of
consumer-friendly digital players, aimed not at the early adopters,
the tech-hungry minority who will buy anything as long as it is
shiny and showy and it beeps, but at the mass market, the rest of
the gadget buyers, the ones who do not like a complicated
instruction booklet.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is nothing less than overtaking the cassette player and
the CD player as the standard for listening to music on the go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical fact in the technology market right now is
tailoring the product to consumer interests, rather than acting as
if consumers' lifestyles and listening habits can be made to adapt
to a singular device,'' said Mike Reed, vice president of marketing
for S3's Rio division. The new mantra among consumer electronics
executives and designers is ease of use, ease of use, ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   Designers at the newly founded Nike Techlab, a sort of Skunk
Works for Nike Inc., in Beaverton, Ore., called the approach
``simplified logic.''
</P>
<P>
   And audio-player designers say they are reworking software as
well as trying to improve the hardware, particularly the quality of
the sound (still, on average, too tinny) and its volume (in most
cases not yet approaching that of a common CD player) and storage
(a paltry hour of music using the MP3 format and about twice that
using the newer Windows Media Audio format). But for a few
exceptions, they have a way to go.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the players still depend almost exclusively on personal
computers as a way to download digital music, which makes the
audience smaller than that for tapes or CDs. But 45 million
American households have personal computers, according to Forrester
Research, so there are a lot of potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   Legal issues about copyright still plague the downloading of
music from the Web. But the industry is coming to terms with the
idea that downloadable music will increasingly be a fact of life
for consumers, and it is working with computer and electronics
companies to develop better ways to offer music online that also
protects copyright.
</P>
<P>
   EMI Recorded Music announced earlier this month that it is
releasing some of its songs using Liquid Audio, a digital format
seen by many as being one of the more secure in the industry. And
the makers of digital players are developing not only new hardware,
but also new forms of memory and new systems that do not depend on
personal computers for getting the music.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Concepts, a research company in Tempe, Ariz., forecasted
that the market for portable digital players will swell to 15
million in 2003 from a projected 3 million users this year. And
young people view downloadable music as just another way to listen
to what they want to hear. In a survey this spring by eBrain Market
Research, a service of the Consumer Electronics Association, 57
percent of consumers 15 to 21 years old said they had played MP3
music files. Among those who had listened to MP3 music, most,
according to the survey, found its sound comparable to that of a
typical stereo.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the appeal of personal digital players has rested on
several factors: small size (the Sony VAIO Music Clip is slightly
larger than a hefty fountain pen); completely skip-proof music
playback; and the user's freedom to put any combination of songs on
them. All of that can be done without cassette tape, compact discs,
minidiscs or audio DVDs whirling away inside of them.
</P>
<P>
   The new players, due this summer and early next year, share
those features and add new ones. Prices range from about $170 to
$300. And some are so simple to use that they would not require
extensive thumbing through a voluminous operating manual to learn
how to turn the thing on. (That's once you get the music downloaded
from the Web or copied from CDs.)
</P>
<P>
   The flattened-egg-shaped audio player called the Personal Sport
Audio (PSA) Play, the result of a collaboration of the Nike Techlab
and Rio, has its controls _ play, stop, forward and back _ on its
smooth face with symbols for key functions so highly raised that
users can press them through the fabric of their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Milander, marketing manager for the Nike Techlab, calls
the approach blind design. ``You don't have to look at it to
operate it,'' Milander said. The PSA Play is scheduled to be
available later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The MiniJam by InnoGear, scheduled for release Aug. 1, is packed
into a small module that plugs into a Handspring Visor handheld
computer. Once in place, the device is ready to store and play
MP3's.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at PortalPlayer, a Santa Clara, Calif., developer of
audio hardware and software, say they are building systems that
will allow portable players to record digital music directly from a
source, like a CD player, without the need of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, almost all portable digital players must be plugged
into a computer that either downloads music in a compressed format
like MP3, which is the most popular, or the computer can translate
music from CDs into a format like MP3, a process called ripping.
The files are then copied and moved to the memory of a portable
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are saying is that with our technology, all you have
to do is press the Record button on a player,'' said Michael J.
Maia, vice president of marketing for PortalPlayer.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, said Ron Boire, senior vice president of portable
audio for Sony Electronics, personal digital players may be
equipped with BlueTooth technology, an international standard that
would allow devices like computers, electronic organizers and
mobile phones to exchange information using radio waves. It would
let consumers wirelessly load music into their players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to make the technology as seamless and transparent
to the user as possible,'' Boire said.
</P>
<P>
   S3's Rio said it shipped 500,000 players between November 1998,
when the first Rio player was introduced, and February 2000. By the
end of this summer, Reed said, that figure is expected to double.
</P>
<P>
   But industry executives and others who follow the industry agree
that if portable digital audio players are going to find a mass
market _ customers other than those between the ages of 16 and 24 _
the players are going to have to offer mass appeal.

A CAREER DEFINED BY `Maude'? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent production of ``Harold and Maude'' at the Theatricum
Botanicum in Topanga comes on the heels of the release of the 1971
cult film on DVD. The film, which was a failure at first, was the
second directorial effort of Hal Ashby, who in the '70s had a
string of successes that would be the envy of most Hollywood
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby now is mostly overlooked as a filmmaker. This is to some
degree because after his 1979 film, ``Being There,'' he made a
number of flops and died in 1988. And as Peter Biskind points out
in his excellent book on the Tinseltown scene of the 1970s, ``Easy
Rider, Raging Bulls'': ``There's no worse career move in Hollywood
than dying.'' Between ``Maude'' and ``Being There,'' however, Ashby
made ``The Last Detail'' (1973) ``Shampoo'' (1975), ``Bound for
Glory'' (1978) and ``Coming Home'' (1978). Except for ``Maude,''
all of them received Oscar nominations. As further proof of Ashby's
slide in recognition, only two other of these films are available
on DVD _ ``Detail'' and ``Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Contemporaries like Francis Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Steven
Spielberg and Robert Altman have made a more lasting impression,
rightly so. Each of them has a stronger, identifiable cinematic
style, but Ashby, who had won an Oscar as an editor, had an
intuitiveness as a filmmaker that, when it was working, created
movie magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maude,'' from a script by Colin Higgins (``Foul Play''), is
about an 80-year-old woman (Ruth Gordon) and a 20-year-old boy (Bud
Cort). She has a zest for life; he feels smothered by his
privileged upbringing and exhibits it by committing fake suicides
and attending funerals for people he doesn't know. According to
Biskind, the film closed a week after it opened. Eventually, it
found its way into revival houses and started winning fans. It's
sentimental, for sure, but it's hard not to be won over by Gordon's
plucky performance. Plus it's ``live-life-to-the-fullest'' and
anti-establishment messages were perfect for the era, and, I
suspect, even work today.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby followed ``Maude'' in 1973 with ``The Last Detail,'' a
story of a young seaman (Randy Quaid) who has been convicted of
petty theft and is being escorted to prison by two shore patrolmen
_ Billy Budduskey (Jack Nicholson) and Mulhall (Otis Young).
Nicholson is brilliant as the wise-cracking, foul-mouthed ``Bad
Ass'' and, along with Quaid, received an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was known for his work _ or some say lack of work _ with
actors, allowing them freedom that other directors wouldn't. It's
clear though that he had a good eye. In his next film, ``Shampoo,''
Lee Grant and Jack Warden got Oscar nominations, with Grant winning
hers for best supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   While David Carradine didn't pick up a nomination for his
portrayal of folk singer Woody Guthrie in ``Bound for Glory,'' his
performance captured the spirit of the man. Guthrie's travels from
the Dust Bowl to California must have struck a chord with socially
conscious Ashby, who grew up with hard times on a farm in Utah
before making his way at 21 to the Golden State. The magnificently
shot film (Haskell Wexler was the cinematographer) is in tune with
Guthrie's ``Do Re Mi,'' a song that depicts the plight of
Depression refugees being turned back at the California line by the
police for not having enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby's next film, the Vietnam-era ``Coming Home,'' brought
acting Oscars to Jane Fonda and Jon Voight and a directing
nomination to Ashby. Melvyn Douglas won the best supporting actor
Oscar for his performance in the wry fable ``Being There,'' Ashby's
last good film. It also brought a best actor nomination to Peter
Sellers as Chance the Gardener, in what turned out to be his
penultimate role.
</P>
<P>
   Some lay Ashby's success to his work with others. It's true he
had heavyweights like scriptwriter Robert Towne on ``Detail'' and
``Shampoo'' (along with Warren Beatty), Wexler and others, but
Ashby did pull it all together or at least recognized when to let
talent work. Unfortunately, in Biskind's and other accounts, drugs
took their toll on Ashby in the end. And though he tried a
comeback, his health gave out before he found another hit.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ``Harold and Maude'' (Paramount) is 29.99 for the DVD. ``The
Last Detail '' (Columbia) is $24.95 is $24.95 on DVD and ``Bound
for Glory'' (MGM) is $24.98 on DVD. All the titles are available on

 UNDATED: mass appeal.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first stumbling block _ storage _ is being tackled on
several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Practically all portable players store music on solid state
memory chips, including Compact Flash, Smart Media cards and Sony's
Memory Sticks.
</P>
<P>
   While solid state memory chips are small, run noiselessly and
are reliable, they are also expensive and appear to be growing more
so as demand begins to outstrip supply, manufacturers say.
</P>
<P>
   One frustrated executive at an American consumer electronics
manufacturer said he had traveled to Asia in an unsuccessful search
for a company that could make and then sell the hardware components
for a digital audio player to his company for $1. The reason? Much
of the cost of a player, which is passed to consumers, is consumed
by the cost of memory.
</P>
<P>
   A digital player with adequate memory _ for at least a half-hour
of playback _ that costs less than $100 has eluded the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Most players are sold with 32 megabytes of embedded, often
called ``onboard,'' memory. A 32-megabyte memory card costs about
$100. And the rule of thumb is that a player, like Samsung's Yepp
player, requires about a megabyte of memory for every minute of
recorded MP3 music (at near-CD-quality sound).
</P>
<P>
   Adding more music requires more memory for storage, and the cost
starts to climb steeply, said Craig Rathbun, the worldwide director
of Clik technology for Iomega, maker of disk-based removable
storage devices like the popular Zip and Jaz cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-megabyte memory cards used in audio players are
``essentially $100 half-hour albums,'' Rathbun said. Iomega is
taking a different approach by adapting its Clik drives to digital
audio players so that they may use the 40-megabyte Clik disks to
store and play music.
</P>
<P>
   Clik disks are not solid state and introduce moving parts into
the players. But they are cheaper than solid state memory, Rathbun
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-megabyte Clik disk can cost as little as $10. They are also
rugged, Rathbun said, as he held a handful of the half-dollar-size
Clik disks, each containing a different genre of music.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the first digital player using Clik technology, the
Rave MP 2300 by Sensory Science, reached the market. Iomega
officials said seven players with built-in Clik drives by other
manufacturers _ including one by Iomega itself _ are expected to be
available before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rio is exploring alternatives to expensive, solid-state flash
memory for storing music in its players.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Rio 600, which is the first player to seamlessly
play music encoded in the MP3 or Windows Media format, comes with
32 megabytes of memory. A more feature-laden Rio 800 is expected
later this summer, with 64 megabytes of included memory.
</P>
<P>
   Rio has also taken a novel approach to the question of expanding
the storage capabilities of its audio players. Earlier models like
the Rio 300 and Rio 500 use, as most players do, a slot in which an
expansion memory card can be inserted, boosting the player's
overall capacity to play more music. But such designs are limited,
making it difficult to add more than a 64-megabyte card to the 32
megabytes already built into the player.
</P>
<P>
   The new Rio players are designed with what its engineers call a
backpack. It is a slip-off and slip-on back that contains the
player's memory and power supply. The Rio 600, which costs $169,
comes with a backpack with 32 megabytes built in and a single AA
battery to power the unit.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 64-megabyte backpack comes with a rechargeable
battery. And Rio, in partnership with IBM, will soon release a
backpack that will house a 340-megabyte IBM Microdrive. Also in
development is a Rio backpack equipped with a new 500-megabyte
drive by DataPlay.
</P>
<P>
   While executives at S3's Rio division said they were not ready
to discuss the cost of the backpacks with the minidrives, they said
the emerging memory technology helps to make their new Rio players
``future-proof.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the disk-based storage devices spin only to retrieve
a song before playing it from small embedded memory, they do not
greatly tax battery life or make players more susceptible to
skipping when moved or bumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are turning the corner with the release of the Rio
600 and other products in the family,'' Reed said, and added that
Rio is looking beyond the youth market.
</P>
<P>
   S3's Rio division, as well as a number of other consumer
electronics companies, is also preparing to release a line of
home-based digital audio players that resemble conventional stereo
components. The newly released SongBank SL CD Memory System by
Lydstrom not only plays and records CDs, but can also convert their
content into a digital format and save iton the $800 machine's hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the ways that people listen to CD's today,''
Reed at Rio said, you can pretty much count on us to replace that
CD technology in the future with our technology.''

BOYS WILL BE BOYS?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warning: It takes a willingness to overlook a fair amount of
swinish behavior to appreciate ``The Gift,'' the strangely
charismatic new musical at Hollywood's Tiffany Theater. Building on
the assumption that boys will be boys _ hurrah! _ until something
happens to turn them into actual human beings, co-authors and
cousins Steve and Robbie Fox have constructed a musical tribute to
ye old frat-boy days and the bonds thence erected. This is ``Animal
House'' meets ``Very Bad Things'' as repackaged by Pat Conroy.
</P>
<P>
   Why ``The Gift'' works isn't easy to explain. Steve Fox's
rock/pop score, currently being put on CD by Geffen Records, is a
largely consistent assemblage of drum-heavy numbers that delivers
the play's messages with a decidedly heavy hand. Credit then the
five actors who somehow get underneath the skin of their
occasionally cliched characters and kick the play's credibility
factor up a few notches. They believe these transformable frat boys
are worth caring about, so we can, too.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the female point of view, sort of, is a high-priced
stripper/call girl named Elektra who wears the flimsiest of
clothing and calls herself the ``escort to the truth.'' It's a
silly role and a bad choice for TV star Alicia Witt to have
selected for her stage debut. Elektra's not exactly the play's
conscience, and there comes a point when neither they nor director
Andy Fickman knows what to do with her. More on this presently.
</P>
<P>
   Elektra's the linchpin, the one who delivers a memorable
bachelor party send-off to bridegroom Mark (Burke Moses), and
former Northwestern frat mates Travis (James Barbour), Lance (Larry
Poindexter), Don (Robert Torti) and Teddy (John Kassir). The five
partied hardy through college before growing apart and moving into
unsatisfying relationships and career paths. Now with Mark about to
tie the knot, the bachelor party and an ensuing catastrophe land
all five men back in Don's Malibu home, where they can reassess
their lives and friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Fickman, who directed several of these actors in the
long-running hit ``Reefer Madness,'' has a nice feel for the
guy-guy dynamics and for their interactions with a plethora of
female characters (juggled between Luann Aronson and Shanola
Hampton). He could afford to give the entire piece a bit more
cynicism, but to do so would probably go against the grain of the
play.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Somebody should rethink both what Elektra
is supposed to be and who should be playing her. As easily as she
seems to wear both the character's clothing and attitude, the
statuesque Witt simply doesn't look comfortable on stage. Part of
the problem is the character's status as a non-reactive narrator,
meaning Elektra is permitted to angrily vamp the audience, deliver
the same ``come hither'' glances numerous times and not much else.
Placed next to more seasoned actors like Barbour or Torti, Witt
doesn't just look out of her league. She looks lost.
</P>
<P>
   In a house with the Tiffany's intimacy, it seems peculiar that
all of the actors should be equipped with body microphones (many
don't seem to need them). All the better, I suppose, to compete
with an off-stage band conducted by Dave Manning. &QL;

OKINAWANS HOPE MEETING PUTS FOCUS ON ART MISSING SINCE WAR
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders on the Japanese island of Okinawa plan to use the
eight-nation economic summit conference there this week to help
speed the recovery of cultural property that disappeared from
homes, public buildings and religious shrines when U.S. soldiers
seized the island in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   To date, more than 100 artworks _ including ancient Buddhist
temple bells, statuary and sacred manuscripts _ have been returned
by U.S. veterans, their heirs and, in at least one case, forcibly
by the U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   But one scholar, Peter Kleinen of the German Institute of
Japanese Studies, recently reported finding nearly 800 objects of
Okinawan origin in the holdings of 21 American museums.
</P>
<P>
   Since many of these artworks were put on display after World War
II, scholars believe they were looted during and immediately after
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most cherished objects still missing is the ancient
headdress worn by the Ryukyu kings who ruled Okinawa until the
island was annexed by imperial Japan in 1879. The headdress is a
silk, helmet-shaped crown studded with pearls, gold, jade and other
precious stones. It has not been seen publicly since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a delegation of six City Council members from Nago,
where the economic meeting is to begin on Friday, flew to
Washington and gave President Clinton and other administration
officials a council resolution calling on the United States to
``investigate the whereabouts of our lost cultural assets and take
relevant steps for their return.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikio Yabu, the leader of the group, said at a stop in New York,
``We hope the summit conferees will pay attention not only to
international economic issues but to the restoration of cultural
losses from Okinawa.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from Naha, Okinawa's capital, Shizuo
Kishaba, chairman of the semi-official Ryukyu-American Historical
Research Society, who has played a major role in returning stolen
objects to Okinawa, took a more forceful position.
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of predicting that Clinton would face a
hostile demonstration when he arrives in Okinawa, Kishaba said,
``The president knows what we are seeking, and if he arrives
empty-handed it will certainly sour our relationship with the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, in response to an inquiry, issued a
statement saying, ``We recognize the deep concern of the people of
Okinawa about artifacts missing since the end of World War II.''
The FBI, the statement said, has offered to list missing items in a
database available on its Web site,
www.fbi.gov/majcases/arttheft/art.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Missing items are also being listed in the national stolen art
file, accessible only to law enforcement officials, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman, however, said that it was unlikely
that the U.S. delegation would actually bring any of the artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II priceless artworks were seized by soldiers in
both the Pacific and European theaters and sometimes justified as
war trophies. The issue of unreturned works still troubles
relations between Germany and Russia. For U.S. troops theft from
conquered territories was prohibited by the Articles of War, No.
93.
</P>
<P>
   Kishaba said that many servicemen who stole objects from Okinawa
in 1945 later sold or donated them to U.S. museums. ``The result is
that Okinawan treasures are scattered across the United States,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass., has a group of six
ceramic and pewter objects sold for $75 in 1947 by Cmdr. Carl W.
Sternfelt, an U.S. intelligence officer who served on Okinawa
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Records of this sale are particularly significant, Kishaba said,
because he and many others believe that Sternfelt, who died in
1976, also took the royal Ryukyu headdress in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Sternfelt's loot was confiscated by U.S. Customs agents
in 1953 and returned to Okinawa later that year in a ceremony
celebrating the centennial of Matthew Perry's historic visit to
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Sternfelt's son, Robert Sternfelt, of Scituate, Mass., denies
that his father ever possessed the headdress and said that his
father voluntarily surrendered the booty he brought from Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Hellmich, a spokeswoman for the Peabody Essex Museum,
said, ``If we are presented with evidence that Sternfelt stole the
objects now in our possession, we would repatriate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another point of contention is a 10-inch flat stone from Okinawa
incised so as to suggest that it may have been used as an ancient
sundial or a navigational instrument. It is now in the collection
of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and
Anthropology in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Kishaba believes the stone was taken by a U.S. soldier after the
war and wants it returned to Okinawa, but Gregory L. Posschl,
curator of the Asian collection of the museum, said that the
provenance of the object was uncertain and that it could not be
returned unless Okinawa's rightful ownership was established.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no desire to keep things that don't belong to us,''
Posschl said. ``But we have to go through a process that is both
rigorous and fair to determine the validity of these claims.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1945 Okinawa was the scene of one of the largest land, air
and sea battle in history, and the focus of Japan's desperate
resort to kamikaze attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The 81 days of fierce fighting that began on Easter left 12,000
Americans dead or missing and 72,000 wounded, more than twice the
numbers from Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima combined.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese losses were even greater. The Japanese death toll
soared to 120,000 combatants and more than 150,000 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Few structures on the island were left standing, and looting by
U.S. soldiers _ commanders as well as enlisted men _ was
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``A frenzy of souvenir hunting was part of the terrible
strangeness of that battle,'' said George Feifer, author of
``Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb'' (Houghton
Mifflin, 1992). ``The Marines risked their lives to tear a
photograph off of a wall or even to grab a pair of sneakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kishaba said, ``We were in danger of having our culture
erased.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the delegation spoke emotionally last month about
their sense of loss. Kazunori Nagayama said learning to play the
sanshin, a classical Okinawan stringed instrument, had inspired his
interest in Okinawan cultural history.
</P>
<P>
   When he plays his 80-year-old sanshin, he said, he dreams of
ancient court life where such instruments were played in the
presence of the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my dreams are frustrating because we have so little to
remind us of our roots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morio Kohama, 42, said he had learned about the history of
Okinawa from his father, who is 86. ``But I have no proof, nothing
I can hold in my hands, of the truth of what he is telling me.''

THE LIFE OF BRION
</HEADLINE>
  Musician/lyricist/composer a well-kept secret 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Producer-musician Jon Brion is someone you've probably heard if
not heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Known by insiders as the sought-after producer of Fiona Apple
and Rufus Wainwright as well as a session player on hit albums by
the Wallflowers, Elliott Smith and the Eels, Brion also hosts one
of Los Angeles' most reliable nights out.
</P>
<P>
   His informal weekly shows at Hollywood's intimate Largo club
have been among the town's best underground bets for years. Brion
can be counted on for relaxed, eclectic evenings that often include
cameos from pals like Michael Stipe, Neil Finn, Aimee Mann, Rickie
Lee Jones and Michael Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Even while working on the orchestral score for Paul Thomas
Anderson's acclaimed epic, ``Magnolia,'' Brion _ popular in
recording studios for his collection of vintage keyboards _
continued his residency at the Fairfax Avenue nightspot, where his
performances often give way to song-sharing sessions until the wee
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no set list and people do drop by but it's not like an
open mike or blues jam,'' Brion said. ``We'll do songs people know
but in a more intimate manner. Or it can be completely crazy
avant-garde music or me taking requests. It depends on my mood. I
could do my own songs all night or make up songs on the spot,
depending on titles from the audience. It varies each week.''
</P>
<P>
   Brion and Anderson first worked together on the director's 1997
screen debut, ``Hard Eight.'' For ``Magnolia,'' Brion penned the
evocative score and produced many of the extensive soundtrack
contributions made by Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon is one of those musical-genius types,'' Anderson said.
``So when it came time to create an hour and a half worth of
orchestral score for the movie, I came to Jon. In other words, Jon
was asked to write a few full symphonies.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brion recalls his scoring technique as
surprisingly simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched Paul watching the film,'' he said. ``We sat together
in a room and I would work out what he wanted by watching the
visual cues he provided me as he responded to what was happening on
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Brion's reputation in the biz began growing in the early '90s
when he was often called to sessions not for his Beatlesque pop
spirit but for his collection of barely working synthesizers from
decades past.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in vintage keyboards started early. Growing up in
New Haven, Conn., the son of a mom who sings and an
orchestra-conductor dad, Brion was exposed to family friends who
experimented with the then-revolutionary Moog synth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began looking for instruments that had a humane quality,''
Brion explained. ``I began collecting vibraphones and old recording
gear. I would put on records I loved, like the Beatles, and try to
figure out how they managed to be so populist and creative and
artistic. Those elements don't ordinarily collide but they do on
those records.''
</P>
<P>
   It's rare for a behind-the-scenes guy like Brion to have a
public persona. But at the Largo each Friday, the in-demand
producer mixes pop standards by the Beatles and the Beach Boys,
campy '80s tunes and his own often skewered songs for crowds of
friends and admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an odd career,'' the Hollywood-based Brion, 36, admits.
``I'm a musician who doesn't specifically make hit records even
though I've been involved in some. When I'm producing, my main
thing is lyrics. I'll sit around and obsess about the words and
question if the music is giving proper support to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with studio work for others, Brion has completed a solo
album, ``Meaningless,'' which is so far unreleased. A compilation
of material recorded live at Largo may also come out someday.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his renown in the industry, Brion doesn't even have
a manager _ nor does he want one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really very simple,'' he says. ``Over the years, people
like lawyers and managers have told me I should focus on just one
thing, either be an artist or producer. I always hear if there's an
opportunity that comes along that could make a lot of money, I
should do it. But I believe if I want to go off and produce someone
_ whoever it is _ it's not going to be detrimental to my career.
It's hard to get these concepts across to people. I make the
big-picture decisions on my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And ever since I've taken control of that, I quite like the
life I have.'' &QL;

<P>
   PASADENA _ It's a network without a ``Big Brother'' or a
``Millionaire'' that's looking for a ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacock network surprised TV critics Tuesday by admitting it
wants to jump into reality television _ despite the controversy
surrounding the shows _ possibly with a woman in chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ignore this as something that's going to go away,''
said Garth Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment, at the
semiannual TV press tour. ``The public spoke, and they want these
shows. The challenge is not just chasing a clone (of `Survivor' or
`Millionaire').
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find the next genre of this programming that
will have some life. We've heard every variation of putting people
on a bus or train or whatever and have them kicked off one by one.
Nothing we've seen so far is something we're happy announcing (as
being in development).''
</P>
<P>
   It's been reported that NBC was looking at a program developed
in Europe of a woman chained to prospective boyfriends. She must
make a decision who to stay with and who to set free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality programming is definitely here,'' agreed Scott Sassa,
president of NBC West Coast. ``This is not a fad; it's a trend
that's going to be around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The line of what is acceptable has definitely been blurred.
It's a moving target defined by public tastes and public sentiment.
We weren't as aggressive as we should have been in pursuing that
type of programming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa conceded that the network's success in traditional
fictional series programming such as ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order,''
and its adherence to a concrete schedule contributed to NBC's
flat-footed response to reality TV's explosion on competing
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success in story form hurts us in (developing reality
shows),'' he said. ``Because of our stability, we're more
vulnerable because we have none of those shows.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC was second in the network ratings last season for the much-
sought-after 18-to-49 viewers coming in behind ABC, whose success
can be planted squarely on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa has taken some criticism for not jumping into reality
programming sooner and boosting the network's ratings. He was in
for some good-natured ribbing Tuesday during a skit that introduced
him and hinted at his demise at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports had Jack Welch, head of NBC's parent company,
General Electric, and one of the best-known and toughest executives
in the country, pressuring and criticizing Sassa for having missed
the reality programming trend.
</P>
<P>
   Reality programming will likely pop up on NBC next summer,
despite the added costs of generating original programming during
the season when viewers are watching the networks the least. It
has, however, been a success for CBS this summer with its popular
``Survivor'' series and to a much lesser extent with ``Big
Brother,'' which has taken a caning from critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``One smart thing about placing them in summer is that they're
against competition that's not as great,'' Sassa said, admitting
that due to the fact that such programs have such short shelf lives
_ they can't really be repeated or syndicated _ their ostensibly
lower price tag is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tricky field _ one of the trepidations is that you
don't want to inhibit the brand of quality we've established with
NBC over the years,'' Sassa said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa suggested that criticisms that series such as ``Big
Brother'' have debased network airwaves are ``not a good thing or
bad thing. It is what it is. Public sentiment and morals have
changed. I'm not comfortable making value judgments of other
people's programming.'' &QL;

`POKEMON' CONTINUES ITS MARCH

Our rating: 2 1/2 stars

<P>
   It didn't take long for Warner Bros. to follow up last fall's
hugely popular ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' with another animated
feature foray into the arcane mythology of the Pokemon world.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for parents is that Pokemon is still a powerful
enough franchise (by a lot, it seems, from my informal survey of
the neighborhood kids) that they'll have little choice about taking
their preteen children to this film.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, though, is that this is a much better film than
the first one, with better animation, less pablum masking as
dialogue and a engaging- enough storyline involving the usual
suspects dealing with an overly enthusiastic collector of some of
the ultimate Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   For those who've been hiding in a pop-cultural cone of silence
for the past two years, Pokemon is a contraction for ``pocket
monsters,'' which originally populated a series of hugely
successful video games for the Nintendo Game Boy and N64 machines.
</P>
<P>
   After several billion dollars, boatloads of merchandise and an
equally successful trading card game, the newest film promises to
further feed the frenzy with a first-week's giveaway of a rare
Pokemon card and the introduction of dozens of new creatures to
fire the collecting _ and collective _ frenzies of fans of the
games.
</P>
<P>
   In ``2000,'' Ash and his Pokemon trainer buddies get mixed up in
the efforts of Lawrence III, a wealthy, wacked Pokemon collector
whose airship (a highlight of the film's animation for its detail
and imagination) is perfectly suited to capture three elemental
Pokemon birds who represent the warring but equilibrous natural
forces of fire, ice and lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In temporarily capturing one, then another of the great beasts,
Lawrence disrupts the planet's balance of forces and sets the birds
fighting against each other and against another, greater,
peacemaking Pokemon, Lugia.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, only Ash, who happens to be in the area on something
of a vacation at an island festival, can help put things to right.
He also gets help from his friends and Pokemon, and even from his
putative nemeses, the comic foils of Team Rocket (think the Harlem
Globetrotters' Washington Generals, or closer to recent context,
Rocky and Bullwinkle's Boris and Natasha).
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket crew have a number of funny lines, and children in
particular will enjoy the enhanced production values of this year's
film, which nicely mixes traditional 2-D Japanese animation
conventions with several excellent 3-D computer-generated pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Parents will like a film with a positive message that is filled
with action, but not blood, where even the losers merely get a conk
in the head and later return to the fray or move on _ wiser for
their failures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the short that proceeds the movie, ``Pokemon's Vacation
Rescue,'' is more comprehensible and adult-accessible than its
hallucinogenic 1999 predecessor, ``Pikachu's Vacation.'' As with
the 1999 short, there is virtually no dialogue involving speech you
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   The short and the feature debut six of the 90 new Pokemon types
that will be featured in upcoming versions of the games. Needless
to say, your children (if they're younger than about 14 or so) will
want to catch them all. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
The film: ``Pokemon the Movie 2000'' with the short, ``Pikachu's

A SENSORY EXPERIENCE

Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Five Senses'' is an ambitious, character-based ensemble
movie about the current state of human relations. It's along the
lines of ``Magnolia'' or ``The Decalogue,'' and while it's not as
demanding, insightful or formally audacious as either of those,
Jeremy Podeswa's dour Canadian film possesses a pleasing amount of
emotional sense and sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a nagging obviousness to Podeswa's organizing
theme. The film's five main, intertwining stories are _ you guessed
it _ keyed to acts of touch, taste, sight, smell and hearing.
Whereas you really had to think multilaterally to get
``Decalogue's'' Ten Commandments references and follow feelings
like you would a symphony in ``Magnolia,'' this one connects the
dots much more simply. The circumstances here are, for the most
part, intelligent and moving, but a sense of the schematic
sometimes takes away from the mystery and richness finely detailed
behavior ought to possess.
</P>
<P>
   The film's other central motif is a Toronto brownstone where
several of the characters live and/or work. One is a masseuse and
widowed mother (Gabrielle Rose of ``The Sweet Hereafter''), whose
anti-social teen-age daughter Rachel (Nadia Litz) loses a client's
young child in a nearby park. While the search for the missing
toddler occupies the local news and much of the film's dialogue for
three days, Rachel refocuses her imperfect watchfulness on a young
male acquaintance (Brendan Fletcher), who shares her interest in
dressing up and role playing.
</P>
<P>
   A French eye doctor (Philippe Volter), who also has an office in
the building, is losing his hearing; he's trying to collect a
backlog of aural experiences in his head while he still can. And on
another floor, we've got Rona (Mary-Louise Parker), who bakes
great-looking but bad-tasting party cakes for a living and who
could use the dose of real sweetness Roberto (Marco Leonardi), an
Italian vacation romance come home to roost, would love to inject
into her life and work if she only trusted him enough to let him.
</P>
<P>
   On the olfactory front, Rona's bisexual best friend Robert
(Daniel MacIvor) hires out as an upscale housekeeper and has
convinced himself that he can smell true love. He's busy looking up
old boyfriends and girlfriends in the hope that he might be able to
sniff out that special pheromone he might have missed the first
time around.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some of these plotlines sound mighty ludicrous; some of
them inarguably are. But there's a straightfaced, measured
sincerity _ call it Canadian if you must _ in Podeswa and his fine
cast's attack that draws credible behavior out of even the
cutesiest script notions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what all of these folks and the characters who enter
their orbit are longing for is that often elusive sixth sense, the
one that just makes you know you're connected to someone else. In
its deliberate, gray-and-brown, well-mannered way, ``The Five
Senses'' is deliriously passionate about making that connection. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
The film: ``The Five Senses'' (R; nudity, language, sex, children
in jeopardy). &QL; 
The stars: Gabrielle Rose, Molly Parker, Mary-Louise Parker, Marco

<P>
   ``Loser'' is a sour, inept comedy that tries to wring humor and
pathos from used condoms, cute kittens and college cretins slipping
co-eds the date rape drug. Needless to say, the laughs and
endearing moments are few and far between, as are characters that
remotely resemble human beings. This is a spectacularly bad movie
that not only lives up to its name, but sinks below it to earn the
distinction of being the year's worst movie.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials promoting ``Loser'' like to trumpet that its
writer-director, Amy Heckerling, was the guiding force behind
``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' and ``Clueless.'' True enough. But
she also made ``Johnny Dangerously,'' ``Look Who's Talking Too''
and ``National Lampoon's European Vacation.'' Consistent she's not.
And after watching ``Loser,'' one begins to question not only her
talent, but her taste as well.
</P>
<P>
   The movie looks as though it has gone through a number of
revisions, and Heckerling has complained publicly that Columbia
studio executives meddled with her film, taking away its edge. My
guess is that they were trying to do what they could to save this
disaster. Some things just aren't worth saving, though, and
``Loser'' should have been sent straight to video or, more
mercifully for its cast members, simply left on the shelf unseen.
</P>
<P>
   The movie stars ``American Pie's'' Jason Biggs as Paul Tannek, a
small- town nerd who wins a full scholarship to an NYU-like
college. Paul worries about fitting in at a big-city university
since he thinks all the people there will have sophisticated
``Seinfeld'' humor. He finds the reality is much worse, which is
too bad, since an appearance by Kramer or George Costanza would
have enlivened the action here immeasurably.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's three roommates are loathsome, obnoxious jerks who
delight in tormenting and belittling him and making him play the
fool. There is not one laugh in all of this unless your idea of a
good time is watching a nice guy suffer through a barrage of
despicable, reprehensible behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari from ``American Beauty'' and
``American Pie'') is the only seemingly nice student at Paul's
school. But that's probably because she has her own set of
tormentors. She waitresses at a strip joint to pay for tuition; the
owner there shorts her on wages. And she's involved with a
manipulative professor (Greg Kinnear at his most unctuous), who
inflicts all sorts of cruel mental abuse upon her. (Professor:
``Would you please just quit talking. Just sit there and look
pretty.'')
</P>
<P>
   What Heckerling was thinking is unimaginable. The story is set
up so Dora and Paul will cast off their abusers and find true
happiness, but their characters are so bland that we could not care
less what happens to them. Watching them take punishment after
punishment is a miserable experience, and this lifeless movie
doesn't even give the audience the satisfaction of seeing the jerks
get their comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   Even more incomprehensible is why Heckerling thought it would be
funny to watch Paul's roommates slip a date rape drug to Dora at a
party. And it's not the only time they do this; a good chunk of the
film revolves around the boys' date-rape ``high jinks.'' You could
possibly understand such misogyny played for laughs if a man wrote
the movie; coming from a woman, it's both sad and shameful.
``Loser'' indeed. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
The film: ``Loser'' (PG-13; drug content, crude sexual material and
language). &QL; 
The stars: Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, Greg Kinnear. &QL;

 &HT;    Grueling Tour de France nears ends; Armstrong keeps lead
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ With the grueling Tour de France nearing
the end, a regenerated Lance Armstrong of the United States
maintained his lead Wednesday as one of his vocal rivals dropped
out.
</P>
<P>
   Only 130 riders started stage 17, which took the competitors on
relatively flat ground from Evian Les Bains to Lausanne, the first
time the Tour has crossed into Switzerland in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who ran out of energy Tuesday after he bypassed a
feeding station, was revitalized. He finished 35th, but with the
same time as stage victor Erik Dekker. Armstrong maintained his
5-minute, 37-second cushion over Jan Ullrich, the 1997 champion who
is the only rider with a remote chance of catching the Texan.
Armstrong lost two minutes to Ullrich on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recovered well,'' said Chris Carmichael, Armstrong's
longtime coach. `` He's doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-seven riders shared the same winning time of 3 hours, 24
minutes and 53 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and the race's eight other top riders passed a
surprise blood test taken Wednesday, the first test of its kind on
this year's Tour. It marked the latest step taken by the
International Cycling Union following a scandal-plagued Tour in
1998, when several top riders were expelled or quit for taking
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong lost two major rivals: Marco Pantani, the 1998 Tour
champion, said he felt too ill after Tuesday's stage to continue
riding. And Alex Zulle, who finished second to Armstrong last year,
withdrew midway through the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, who had fallen to 14th place overall, blamed intestinal
pains for his decision. Other riders suggested it might have more
to do with his fading performance Tuesday during the competition's
last major mountain-climbing stage _ the last real chance for
Pantani, a poor sprinter, to narrow Armstrong's lead before the
final race to Paris on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who overcame testicular cancer to win the Tour in
1999, exchanged harsh words with Pantani after allowing him to win
a mountain stage. He said he shed no tears about his rival's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   He pointedly referred to Pantani as ``the Elephant,'' a nickname
referring to Pantani's jug ears and a reference the Italian has
sought to shed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elefantino is a different man. I don't think anybody fully
understands his motivations,'' Armstrong said. ``It's his problem.
He's not my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17th stage wound east around Lake Leman and then turned west
toward Lausanne. There was only one climb of any significance, the
1,455-meter Col des Mosses.
</P>
<P>
   Dekker and Erik Zabel, who have combined to win five stages this
Tour, led the charge to the finish line. Dekker was not familiar
with the final six miles of the course, but he darted past Zabel's
left shoulder just as the two caught the emerging shadows of the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Dekker crossed the finish line with his arms outstretched as if
to say, ``No problem.'' But moments later, the native of the
Netherlands was holding back tears before he could speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this. This is impossible,'' Dekker said.
``This is one thing I didn't think of.''
</P>
<P>
   Dekker, 29, turned professional after winning a silver medal in
the 1992 Olympics, but he didn't emerge as a pro star until eight
years later.

There's a funny idea buried deep inside the campy
self-congratulation of ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' screaming to get
out.
</P>
<P>
   Heh, heh, we said ``out.'' And while that isn't a very good pun,
it's better than any of the broad, clumsy jokes this satire of
sexual reorientation programs makes. Yes, such operations, which
try to make gay folks straight, are more than ripe for needling.
But first-time feature director Jamie Babbit and screenwriter Brian
Wayne Peterson's cartoonishly cliched approach to the material
takes all the sting out of what could have and should have been a
wicked, angry black comedy.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way, these filmmakers could use a little humor
reorientation. And that's no joke.
</P>
<P>
   The bright young actress Natasha Lyonne (``Slums of Beverly
Hills'') mostly just pops her eyes in bewilderment as Megan, a
suburban cheerleader who, due to a growing affinity for tofu and
Melissa Etheridge tunes, is judged by loving friends and family to
be at risk. She is henceforth packed off to True Directions, a
Victorian gingerbread mansion/prison run by blatantly
overcompensating dragon lady Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty) and her
gratefully heteroized assistant Mike (RuPaul Charles, without the
makeup), where Megan is quickly convinced, to her horror, that she
is indeed a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned parents park their embarrassing kids here to be
straightened out. Of course, all except Megan are so obviously,
well, who they are that the whole dithering process is a joke. And
since the filmmakers presume anyone who doesn't wholeheartedly
approve of homosexuality has to be a complete moron, their movie
becomes one long, subtlety-free gag about deceiving both oneself
and clueless authority.
</P>
<P>
   The production's one non-caricature, Clea DuVall's Graham, soon
captures Megan's heart, and ours, too. Wandering in from some good
movie we're not seeing, DuVall projects all the real yearning,
sullen resentment and emotional intelligence that the film's topic
deserves. Unfortunately, DuVall's thoughtful performance looks
about as isolated here as a same-sex couple might at a North Dakota
prom.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the film, you'll be hard-pressed not to imagine ways in
which it could have been funnier and more pointed. One suggestion:
Make it a lot harder for Megan to accept her lesbian tendencies.
Her protests against her incarceration then could have framed a
sharper critique of anti-gay hysteria ... and of course, when she
fell in love with Graham, it would actually mean something
politically and satirically, not to mention representing an
interesting character development or two.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we're expected to laugh at elementary-grade gags about
gender role stereotypes (the girls at True Directions must wear
pink and practice vacuuming, the boys are in blue and chop wood)
and cheer on the kind of by-the-book, star-crossed teen-age romance
that's as overused in gay cinema as it is on the WB. ``But I'm a
Cheerleader'' is all mindless rah rah, backed up by very little hah
hah. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The film: ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' (R; language, sex). &QL;

Charles. &QL;

EMMY VOTING CHANGES UPSET `EMMYS' AUTHOR 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAY HANDELMAN   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Thomas O'Neil is worried. For the first time
in decades, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has changed
the voting procedures for the Emmy Awards and O'Neil calls it ``one
of the great tragedies in history.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a bit hyperbolic when you consider world wars, famines
and natural disasters. But O'Neil's world is show-business awards,
particularly the Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   He is the author of ``The Emmys,'' a history of the annual
prime-time and daytime television awards. He is also the author of
``The Grammys,'' about the music awards, and a forthcoming look at
13 different major film awards.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the announcement of the prime-time Emmy
nominations at 8:35 a.m. on Thursday, O'Neil said he expected the
changes in the voting to reduce the chances of new shows and
underdogs, while allowing sentimental favorites to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, volunteers gathered over a weekend to view tapes of
all nominees in a specific category, and picked the winners. This
year, volunteers will be able to watch those tapes at home, where
there is no guarantee that they will watch entire episodes before
they vote.
</P>
<P>
   The new system was announced in March in what academy officials
said was an effort to get more people involved in the voting.
O'Neil said the changes were a reaction to the outcry from critics
when ``The Practice'' defeated ``The Sopranos'' for Best Dramatic
Series at last year's awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all to blame for this,'' O'Neil told an audience of
writers here.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he said, ratings never mattered. ``Shows that would
have been canceled were saved by winning Emmys in their first
year,'' he said, citing ``Hill Street Blues,'' ``Cheers,'' ``Cagney
and Lacy'' and ``Mission: Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice in Emmy history, shows that had been canceled won the top
awards, ``The Bob Newhart Show'' in 1962 and ``My World and Welcome
To It'' in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   That will not happen under the new system, O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   Academy officials said that the new procedure is in progress and
that it will affect only the 27 awards presented during the
televised ceremony, which airs Sept. 10 on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had triple the number of people agree to participate
as judges in the process,'' said Meryl Marshall, academy chairman.
</P>
<P>
   She said that O'Neil's concerns are unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the members of the television academy take the
Emmy quite seriously,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil said he's keeping his eye on several potential winners as
proof that the system has been diminished. Michael J. Fox has never
won an Emmy Award for his role in ``Spin City'' (he won three times
for ``Family Ties'') but he may be a sentimental favorite this year
since he revealed he has Parkinson's Disease and left the series.
Nancy Marchand, who died last month, could win for her role as
Livia Soprano in ``The Sopranos.'' And Julianna Marguilies could
win again for her final season as nurse Carol Hathaway on ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any of these people could be deserving; we have to see what
tapes they submit and how they compare to other nominees, but they
are more likely to win for sentimentality sake than anything
else,'' O'Neil said.

 &HT;    Coke reshaping pays off in profit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After two consecutive money-losing quarters, Coca-Cola
rebounded to earn $926 million, or 37 cents a share, in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to see the benefits from the large-scale
reshaping that we started several months ago,'' Coke Chairman Doug
Daft said Wednesday in a statement. ``I think these (results)
demonstrate that our business is moving on plan, and it is moving
in the right direction,'' he added during a conference call with
industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   This is Daft's first full quarter at the helm of the world's
largest beverage company since becoming chairman and chief
executive in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Daft has moved with a sense of urgency to vigorously
manage expenses, while being disciplined in spending marketing
money,'' said Andrew Conway, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Healthier economies in many parts of the world helped drive up
case sales _ a key indicator of performance _ by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solid business trends in the second quarter are the result
of strong innovation around brand Coca-Cola and improving global
economic conditions,'' said company President Jack Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders were rewarded by the news as Coke stock climbed $2
Wednesday to close at $61.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there is still uncertainty,'' said Sanford Bernstein
analyst Bill Pecoriello, ``as investors become more comfortable
they are not stepping in front of a train wreck, they will begin to
anticipate the real benefits of the strategic changes ... and the
(stock) valuation should move higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft said those changes include a decentralized and
``impactful'' marketing strategy in which 26 different directors
around the globe are rewarded for innovative campaigns that connect
with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's second-quarter performance was a welcome change
from the loss of 2 cents a share it posted in this year's first
quarter, as well as in last year's fourth quarter. Those results
included one-time charges.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's room for improvement. Second-quarter profit was
down 2 percent from a year ago, when it earned $942 million, or 38
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts, however, pay more attention to financial
results that exclude one-time charges because they give a better
picture of a company's ongoing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding nonrecurring items, Coca-Cola earned 42 cents a share,
beating analysts' estimates by a penny a share. Those charges
included 5 cents a share for the massive restructuring the company
announced in late January.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue increased 5 percent to $5.62 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, where beverage prices in supermarkets have
increased about 5 percent during the past year, case sales in the
quarter increased slightly more than 1 percent, which was below
analysts' expectations. It was the poorest performing region for
the company in volume growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pricing actions taken in the last year by our bottlers in
North America have been a necessary step to improve the overall
returns for our customers (retailers) and bottlers,'' Stahl said.
``As we move into the second half of 2000, we anticipate that the
company, our bottlers and our customers will benefit from improving
volume trends at a more profitable level.''
</P>
<P>
   During the conference call, Stahl said the company will soon be
launching new marketing and advertising campaigns to boost North
American sales of Coke Classic and Diet Coke. He acknowledged the
company has ``some work to do'' on Sprite, one of its main brands
that has experienced declining supermarket sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl also said new brands would be introduced in North America
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, meanwhile, second-quarter case sales jumped 13
percent. In Latin America and Asia, volume rose 8 percent, while it
increased 5 percengrowth in core profit margin countries, such as
Japan, Germany and Mexico, was robust,'' analyst Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   On the cost front, the company said it expects its
restructuring, which resulted in the elimination of 5,200 jobs
worldwide, to save it $150 million this year and $300 million
annually in the years ahead.

<P>
   ``SITE R,'' Pa. _ In a crisis that threatened national security,
senior civilian and military officials would relocate from
Washington to this nuclear warfighting command center, built deep
inside a solid rock mountain near the bucolic town of Blue Ridge
Summit, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   So secret it doesn't have a proper name, the underground command
and communications center is part of an extensive, painstaking and
costly government effort to secure a cherished American political
principle:
</P>
<P>
   Elected civilian leaders are in charge. Not the military,
especially in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   But that principle would be overturned by the proposed national
missile defense system, which would have to react so quickly to the
threat of incoming warheads that its military operators themselves
would make the decision to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the decision to go to war, perhaps the most grave that a
democracy can face, would be removed from the president in the Oval
Office and given instead to an unknown military officer sequestered
in an underground command post.
</P>
<P>
   Warheads could detonate on American soil within minutes. And so
it would be a snap decision under enormous pressure, based on what
little could be learned about the nature and the intention of an
apparent attack.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed missile defense system -- meant to detect, track
and shoot down enemy missiles as they streak through space -- is
scheduled for a test July 7 as the Clinton administration weighs a
decision to begin it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the idea of missile defenses has been endorsed by
both major presidential candidates, the concept has been enormously
controversial, with bitter disputes over the potential
effectiveness of the system and its ramifications for global
stability.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has raised the more fundamental issue of who is in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, asked for comment, was initially flummoxed.
After several days, Army Lt. Col. David Stockwell, spokesman for
the National Security Council, said in a statement that the
president ``would be involved'' in the command and control
arrangements of a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But Stockwell declined to say that the president would take part
in a decision to actually fire interceptor missiles. ``It's all
under development at this time and to say anything more would be
speculation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed system will rely heavily on sophisticated computer
software to detect missile launches, track the devices as they arc
toward space, and try to determine if they are hostile and where
they will land. Then it will launch and guide interceptor missiles
to collide with the warheads before they streak down toward their
targets.
</P>
<P>
   But officials stressed that there will be a human in the
decision-making loop.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, believe the relentless time pressure of
the perceived missile attack will drive the system toward full
automation. That is particularly true, they said, for a
``boost-phase'' missile defense system advocated by, among others,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   This second phase of the system would intercept missiles within
the first five minutes of launch, even before they released their
warheads and decoys -- perhaps leaving too little time for any
human decision at all.
</P>
<P>
   But even under the first phase of the system, projected to be in
operation by 2005, the decision to open fire would be made entirely
within the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not enough time to call back and say, `Can I shoot?'''
said Vice Adm. Herbert A. Browne, deputy commander of U.S. Space
Command, which would control the missile defense system from its
warfighting headquarters inside Cheyenne Mountain near Colorado
Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   That decision would fall to the commander in chief of Space
Command, Browne's boss. At present, that position, called ``CINC
Space,'' is held by Air Force Gen. Ralph ``Ed'' Eberhart.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president would learn from a phone call that the
country had gone to war, with consequences already set in motion.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   For example, in one scenario the system is intended to handle,
North Korea fires a missile with five chemical warheads at the
United States. A dozen U.S. interceptor missiles are launched in
defense. They appear on China's primitive early-warning radar,
making that nation believe it is under an American nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a panic, China launches its nuclear missiles at the United
States before they can be destroyed in their silos. That triggers a
genuine U.S. nuclear counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Would the risk of having five Korean chemical weapons detonate
on American soil be worth a global nuclear holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   That's a question ``CINC Space'' would have to answer, in a
heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to have to be special trust and confidence
placed in the hands of the CINC,'' Browne said at a recent press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The time pressure of a missile attack is unrelenting, as it was
for much of the Cold War. Even so, one option has always been to
``ride out'' a limited nuclear attack -- to wait until the warheads
detonated and the smoke cleared before ordering a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for this ``ride-out'' option was to give civilian
authorities time to assess the severity of a small attack, to
ascertain whether it was accidental, and to weigh appropriate
responses.
</P>
<P>
   It was specifically to preserve this option for civilian
authorities that the United States invested so heavily in
protecting its nuclear forces from attack, by encasing them in
underground silos and in submarines hidden at sea and by building
fortified underground bunkers, such as Site R, for civilian and
military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed missile defense system will not eliminate the
``ride-out'' option. But it will increase the pressure for a
quick-draw response, said Stan Norris, an analyst at the Natural
Resources Defense Council, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington.
Norris is the author of numerous books on nuclear weapons and
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of detection and interception in the system
currently under consideration would look like this:
</P>
<P>
   -- U.S. early-warning satellites detect a foreign missile launch
with infrared sensors less than a minute after launch, as the
missile soars above 50,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   -- Satellites and ground radars immediately begin tracking and
analyzing the threat as the missile roars toward space. From its
trajectory, sophisticated computer programs make guesses about
where the missile's payload will land and draw conclusions about
what the missile is carrying.
</P>
<P>
   If the missile nose cone is projected to splash down harmlessly
in the south Pacific Ocean, the missile probably is launching a
satellite. But if the payload looks like it will land on the
Washington Monument or on the U.S. nuclear missile submarine base
at Bangor, Wash., it's safe to assume it's not harmless.
</P>
<P>
   -- About five minutes into its flight, the missile engines burn
out, and as the missile coasts into space, its nose cone ``shroud''
opens to free its payload -- perhaps a satellite, perhaps one or
more warheads carrying conventional explosives, or nuclear or
chemical weapons. Decoys or dummy warheads might also be released
to confuse defense interceptors.
</P>
<P>
   -- The warheads of land-based missiles begin to explode on
American soil roughly 20 to 25 minutes after launch, depending on
their launch location. Warheads fired from submarines could
detonate in America within 10 minutes of launch, if the submarines
were lurking close offshore. Russia has ballistic missile
submarines, and China is developing a new sub-launched nuclear
missile.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The problem of response was slightly easier in the early days of
the Cold War, when U.S. strategy called for an unthinking ``massive
retaliation'' for what was presumed would be a massive Soviet
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Authorizing such a counterstrike would have been an ``awesome''
decision, but not an especially tricky one, strategist Walter
Slocombe wrote in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision does not particularly lend itself to analysis and
could be delegated'' from the president to lower-ranking officials
should the president be at risk of being killed, wrote Slocombe,
now undersecretary of defense. ``Far more difficult are the choices
that would have to be made in the case of limited attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Limited attack'' is the most likely risk the United States
faces today, according to the most recent CIA assessment.
</P>
<P>
   In the strategic environment developing today, for instance, the
United States faces not one potential enemy but many.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cold War, strategists reasoned that a massive attack from
the Soviet Union would come at the climax of a slowly rising
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Today, the risk is an attack of one or a handful of missiles in
ambiguous circumstances -- in which it might not be clear, for
example, whether the launch was deliberate or an accident. But
knowing which would be critical in determining the U.S. response.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the ``ride-out'' option is attractive, Norris said.
</P>
<P>
   But missile defense technology is narrowing the opportunity to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``boost-phase'' system, for instance -- in which
interceptors deploy within five minutes of an incoming missile's
launch -- ``you really have a knee-jerk reaction, and you wouldn't
know yet what the missiles are intended to do,'' said Bruce Blair,
president of the nonpartisan Center for Defense Information, also
in Washington, and a former missile launch officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have a few tens of seconds to detect a launch and fire
within another few seconds,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if a country is just going to test a missile? Are we
going to knock it out just because it has the range to reach our
country? It could be a peaceful space launch.''
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of questions now are considered and debated at
places like Site R, where military police occasionally open the
massive chain-link front gate to allow military joggers out for a
midday run in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its pastoral setting, nothing about Site R encourages a
casual visit. Well-armed military police are on patrol, authorized
to use deadly force. Video cameras, motion detectors and unseen
devices monitor the tightly fenced perimeter. Tours of the facility
are not offered, said an MP who spoke through the gate.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-1980s, a survey by William M. Arkin, an
independent researcher and writer, found a ``massive and
pervasive'' system of fortified bunkers like this, where civilian
government officials would relocate during a nuclear war. Some 350
facilities could, like Site R, provide ``post nuclear attack
operations'' including protection from radioactive fallout and food
and water, Arkin found.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them are maintained today, Arkin said, including a fleet
of 18-wheeler tractor-trailer trucks carrying mobile command
facilities. These are garaged in several parts of the country,
including Washington, D.C., where the mobile center, according to
Arkin, is code-named ``Island Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Navy provides airborne command posts in
converted Boeing 707s called TACAMO (for ``Take Charge and Move
Out'') aircraft. These link the president, the secretary of defense
and the nation's ballistic missile submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these precautions, ``go-to-war'' authority was
reluctantly delegated beforehand by the president to certain
military officers in some specific instances during the Cold War
and afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In the event that Washington was destroyed and the president and
his Cabinet killed in a massive nuclear attack, the commander in
chief of the U.S. Strategic Air Command, now redesignated the U.S.
Strategic Command, was authorized by President Eisenhower to launch
a retaliatory salvo of missiles on his own.
</P>
<P>
   The commander in chief of the U.S. Air Defense Command also was
given limited nuclear launch authority. During the 1960s, U.S.
fighter-interceptors on patrol along the coasts carried a
supersonic nuclear-armed missile called the Genie and code-named
``Ding Dong,'' designed for use against inbound Soviet bombers.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Blair, all such authority was revoked in the
late 1980s. The Air Defense Command itself was inactivated in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Today, at least for now, authority to go to war rests entirely
with the ``national command authority,'' the military designation
for the president and his secretary of defense and their deputies.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of keeping a civilian, or any human being, ``in the
decision-making loop'' may become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world, the human in the loop basically serves as
little more than a circuit breaker to prevent the system from going
off half-cocked,'' said John Pike, a space and military policy
analyst for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the missile defense system is operational, the
computer software that assesses an attack and analyzes response
options ``will be the culmination of many thousands of work-years
of modeling and calculation and simulation and refinement and
testing,'' Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software is going to be in an infinitely better position
to make a considered judgment about what should be done than the
few human beings sitting in the room,'' Pike said. ``There will be
too much stuff going on too fast for any human operators to figure
it all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just won't be any time for mere human meddling.''

   The day is gray and damp at the small cemetery next to Our Lady
Queen of Poland Church in suburban Silver Spring, Md. The only
noise is the occasional whish of a car rolling past on the wet
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Atop a flat gravestone rests a soaked Mother's Day card. Nearby,
a pottery frog, fuzzy rabbit statue and colorful plastic
hummingbirds with pinwheel wings decorate an elderly man's grave.
The last few years, especially around holidays such as Memorial
Day, cemetery aficionados are noticing an increase in the placement
of these ``grave goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentimental objects left at the final resting spot of a loved
one include everything from the simple -- cigarettes -- to the
poignant -- car keys on a young man's birthday, and from the
personal -- a wig -- to the elaborate -- wrapped gifts beneath
fully decorated Christmas trees complete with battery-operated
lights.
</P>
<P>
   This resurgence in the use of grave goods, a tradition since
ancient times, is creating a quandary for modern cemetery
officials. Just what is ``appropriate'' to place on a grave? When
is a display of affection and loss too elaborate or too personal?
Is a mourning family's need to leave these items more important
than the cemetery's duty to keep graves tidy?
</P>
<P>
   It is a controversy pitting the power of grief against the
pragmatic needs of cemetery maintenance and decorum.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Seneca, Fla., a daughter is fighting attempts to remove a
pink flamingo statue from her father's grave. The Seneca Cemetery
Association last month voted to ban such ornaments. The family
insists the flamingo is there to ``remind us of what a jovial
person he was and to give us all something happy to focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   -- At Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington, Vt., Joyce Martin may no
longer put her husband's hunting cap, favorite hunting shirt and a
small plastic deer on his grave. The town's Cemetery Commission
recently passed rules against such items, citing visitor complaints
and maintenance problems.
</P>
<P>
   -- The placement of grave goods also was banned late last year
at Oaklawn Cemetery in Jacksonville, Fla., after ``it had become
out of hand,'' according to a cemetery official.
</P>
<P>
   -- So many items are being left on graves in a cemetery in
Independence Township, Mich., that the assistant director of public
works is considering installing underground, lockable boxes to hold
them.
</P>
<P>
   These grave goods are part of a larger trend toward
personalization in funeral practices, said Travis Cunningham,
associate editor of American Cemetery: The Magazine of Cemetery
Management.
</P>
<P>
   Cemetery personnel ``are struggling with it,'' Cunningham said.
``They want to please everybody, but they have to keep things
looking the way most people want it,'' which is respectful and
dignified.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fells, general counsel for the International Cemetery and
Funeral Association in Reston, Va., said safety also is a
consideration. ``Workers and visitors could be injured by these
things shooting out of mowers,'' Fells said.
</P>
<P>
   Families see it another way. ``It's part of the grieving
process,'' said Joyce Martin of Milton, Vt., who remains upset that
she can't leave her husband's hunting memorabilia at his Lakeview
Cemetery gravesite. He died in 1996. She understands the need for
families to be able to leave sentimental mementos.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things were important to them, so they're important to
us,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Fells said that there are no uniform rules within the cemetery
industry regarding grave goods. He estimated there are 100,000
cemeteries in America; each sets its own guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Westbrook, Maine, has typical rules for its three
cemeteries: ``Lawn ornaments (such as balloons, wooden crosses,
ducks, fish, etc.) are not permitted. ... All flags and artificial
flowers must be removed by the second weekend in November except
for winter arrangements. ... The director has the right to remove
any objects that do not comply with the cemetery rules and
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   For Thomas Smith at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati,
communication of the rules is what's important. The cemetery
publishes brochures with cleanup schedules so families will know
when to gather items.
</P>
<P>
   Officials try to be understanding. If individuals ask that
something special be left on a grave for a certain occasion -- say,
a birthday -- that request will be honored, said Smith, senior vice
president at Spring Grove.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the power of memorialization, people leaving things,
and we encourage it,'' he added. ``We try to be really sensitive.
One of our missions is to help create good memories in all we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring grave goods is a huge task at Spring Grove. The
150-year-old cemetery houses more than 200,000 graves on 750 acres.
</P>
<P>
   People feel so strongly about these items that they are seeking
out cemeteries that allow grave goods to be placed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm seeing in increasing numbers is, people want a say in
how they will be remembered,'' said Helen Sclair, who teaches
cemetery appreciation classes and leads tours as the ``cemetery
lady of Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they find out a cemetery doesn't permit people to leave
things, they'll go find one that will'' and plan to be interred
there instead, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   One of the most bittersweet items Sclair has seen at a grave was
for a deceased young man's 30th birthday -- ``General Motors car
keys placed very securely in a little homemade jar; the family
figured out how to attach it to the tombstone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of grave goods ``always surprises me,'' Sclair said
-- cups of tea, money, a bottle of whiskey, a man's cane, a dish of
chop suey.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Katie Karrick, editor of the ``Tomb With a View'' cemetery
newsletter in Cleveland, has seen all kinds of items in her visits
to hundreds of gravesites.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   One grave in Florida struck her as especially poignant. ``A
young man, it was about six or nine months after he died,'' she
said. ``The whole surface of his grave was covered with those bead
bracelets popular with kids; necklaces, packs of cigarettes,
candles, nickels, dimes and pennies.'' The gravestone was ``a very
stylized image of a person on a surfboard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so moved,'' Karrick said, ``I felt that I wanted to
leave something, too. On the way back to the car I saw a penny on
the ground, minted the same year the young man had died. So I left
that on the grave myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Karrick has seen the use of grave goods spread from the
traditional remembrance holiday of Memorial Day to other
celebrations such as Halloween, the Fourth of July and Easter,
along with birthdays and anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to do with a period of time, determined solely by the
individual, in which they want to continue sharing with their loved
ones,'' said Karrick. ``Bringing things they enjoyed -- be it golf
balls, golf tees, teddy bears, balloons, toys -- is a way of
keeping their memory alive. With time, memory begins to fade; this
is a way of keeping it a little fresher, keeping the person close
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Karrick leads Ohio cemetery tours called ``Stones and Bones,''
presents lectures on cemeteries and publishes the 1,700-circulation
newsletter. She thinks the baby-boom generation, now coming to
grips with mortality by burying parents, has a lot to do with the
resurgence in grave goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers don't want to be ignored or forgotten,'' Karrick
said. ``Many are trying to leave some kind of a mark that we were
here, that we lived our lives and cared passionately about
something; we don't want people to forget us.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurel Gabel of Pittsford, N.Y., has been seeing more graveside
items made on home computers. She's the research clearinghouse
coordinator for the Association for Gravestone Studies, a nonprofit
group in Greenfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen whole grave plots covered with messages kids have
printed out on computers: `I love you Papa,' things they've done in
school, all strung together on that computer paper with holes on
the side,'' Gabel said.
</P>
<P>
   She notices a lot of wedding invitations and baby announcements.
``I've also heard people play favorite music on tape, then leave
the tape there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these things are a little chronicle of what's going
on,'' Gabel added. ``It indicates this person is still really a
member of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the Mother's Day card in the Silver Spring cemetery.
It read: ``The weather is nice. Broke my right arm. Had Barbara's
wedding shower -- she misses you so much. Saw her and Stan get
married on the Internet. I told her you, Poppop and Daddy were
right there. I'll come back on Memorial Day ... God knows how much
you're missed.''

 By DAVID WOOD  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The story, a cruel morality play, will haunt him
forever.
</P>
<P>
   On a combat sweep through rural hamlets of South Vietnam, U.S.
Marines accidentally wounded a 4-year-old child, torn by shrapnel
from a hand grenade.
</P>
<P>
   James Webb, then a 23-year-old company commander: ``My medic
came up to me carrying the boy in his arms and said, `Skipper, we
gotta get this kid medevacked in 20 minutes or he's gonna die.'''
</P>
<P>
   Daylight fading into deadly shadow. Webb, holding two radio
mikes, struggling to get his men safe for the night. Knowing he
cannot divert a medical evacuation chopper that's ferrying
desperately wounded Marines. A civilian, even a child, is a lower
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Doc, I just can't do that.' And he said, `OK, fine,
then you watch him die.' And he put that child down on an ammo box
in front of me. ... While I was working, I was watching this little
kid die.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in half an hour he was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bloody terror and chaos of combat, when American soldiers
are clawing for their survival, does the concept of ``moral
behavior'' have any meaning?
</P>
<P>
   The timeless question, bitterly debated during the Vietnam War,
is back again, raised this time by recent revelations about two
combat incidents -- one during the Korean War and one during the
Persian Gulf War -- in which American troops may have committed war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a set of moral absolutes by which society should judge
those whom it sends into combat?
</P>
<P>
   Or is war so fundamentally brutal and immoral that civilians
ought not examine it too closely?
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I was supposed to do, and I don't have any hang-ups
about it,'' says Webb, who went on to become secretary of the Navy
and a best-selling author.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing clamor over the Korea and Persian Gulf incidents
suggests that more than ever, once-obscure battlefield actions seem
subject to national second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   And the issues are becoming more acute as the nature of war
changes. Many of today's conflicts are fought by mobs instead of
national armies in uniform. Civilians are deliberately targeted.
Things happen fast, in confusion, under intense media scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Is it even possible to fairly judge, not having been there?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to second-guess somebody when you're sitting at
home,'' said Ralph Peters, an author and strategist who retired as
an Army colonel last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a matter of condoning `war crimes,''' Peters said.
``It's a matter of understanding the fundamental speed, confusion,
terror and eruptive violence of warfare. An army should be as moral
as practical, but to me, war is by its very nature a fundamentally
immoral act. So this is a matter of degrees, not absolutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, soldier and civilian alike have a responsibility to
work toward a resolution or at least a common understanding, argues
antiwar activist and philosopher Michael Walzer, who teaches at
Princeton University's School of Social Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to opt out'' of the debate, but ``only the wicked
and the simple make the attempt,'' Walzer wrote in his landmark
study, ``Just and Unjust Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   But even he concedes that ``the world of war is not a fully
comprehensible, let alone a morally satisfactory, place.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the cases that has prompted renewed debate occurred
during the first weeks of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   As South Korean and U.S. forces staggered back under the impact
of the North Korean invasion in 1950, American soldiers are said to
have fired on and killed perhaps hundreds of South Korean civilian
refugees gathered under a railway trestle near the village of No
Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed account last September by the Associated Press, which
won a Pulitzer Prize for its reporting, said many of the dead were
women and children. The AP account quoted soldiers saying they
opened fire on orders of their superiors. The report prompted the
Pentagon, which had earlier denied rumors of the incident, to open
a high-profile investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While the AP's account has been challenged in some detail by
other media investigations, its main conclusions stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has declined, however, to pursue reports of a second
accusation. Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, in a lengthy
report that appeared in The New Yorker magazine May 22, said that
units of the 24th Infantry Division, commanded by then-Maj. Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, had with little or no provocation attacked
retreating Iraqis two days after the Feb. 28, 1991, cease-fire in
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said McCaffrey's men killed many Iraqis, including
soldiers who had already surrendered, as well as civilians and
children.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and others hotly deny the allegations, insisting they
returned fire only after being attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Many disputes over battlefield actions, like this one, pivot on
the issue of ``fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1949 Geneva Conventions, which form a large part of the
``laws of war'' under which U.S. forces operate, specifically
forbid attacks on civilians. The Hague Convention, also part of the
laws of war, forbids ``treacherous'' attacks on enemy who have laid
down their arms or who have no means of defense. International
agreements also forbid the use of disproportionate force.
</P>
<P>
   But successful combat leaders, from George S. Patton to Norman
Schwarzkopf, have scoffed at the notion of waging a ``fair'' fight.
</P>
<P>
   If soldiers are committed to battle, should they not intend to
win?
</P>
<P>
   The issue relates directly to McCaffrey's 24th Division's clash
with retreating Iraqi units. When McCaffrey's men opened fire on
Iraqi tanks, vehicles and soldiers, the Iraqis were clearly
outgunned. Was that a ``disproportionate'' or even ``treacherous''
use of force outlawed by the laws of war?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to close with and kill the enemy,'' said Gary
Solis, a retired Marine colonel who teaches the law of war at the
U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the enemy is at a disadvantage, that is to your advantage.
You're not looking for a fair fight,'' said Solis.
</P>
<P>
   But Solis, who wrote a book about the 1970 court-martial of five
Marines for the murder of 16 Vietnamese women and children,
acknowledged that the issue is not quite so clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an insoluble debate, but these are questions we have to
address,'' he said. ``There are no clear-cut answers in life and
surely not in combat, and as we go on it's going to become more
murky.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, military officers and others recognize that morality
plays a critical, if poorly understood, role in combat performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an aspect of courage which comes from a deep
spiritual faith which, when prevalent in an Army unit, can result
in uncommon toughness and tenacity in combat,'' Gen. Gordon
Sullivan, who was Army chief of staff, wrote in a 1991 Army field
manual.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Shay, a Boston psychiatrist with long experience in
working with Vietnam combat veterans, puts it the other way around.
Combat veterans, he believes, can recover from the shock and horror
of combat as long as their sense of moral purpose, their belief in
``what's right,'' has not been violated by their own or their
unit's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers who fight in sync with a moral code -- ``duty, honor,
country'' -- are thus thought to be hardened against the
psychological horrors of war.
</P>
<P>
   But that sense of ``what's right'' remains infuriatingly
difficult to define.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of his class on war and ethics at West Point,
Solis gives his cadets this problem to ponder: A crowd of civilians
mixed with enemy soldiers is approaching your position and will
overrun it. At what point does your responsibility to protect
innocent civilians yield to your responsibility to enable your
soldiers to defend themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that is a tough one,'' said Solis, noting that it
reflects the dilemma of the U.S. troops at No Gun Ri. ``At the end
of the course I tell my students that there is no answer to that
question, and they will have to answer it for themselves when the
time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   How well they will do depends on what they carry into battle
with them -- and the ultimate judgments of the society they serve.
Many military analysts have observed that men don't need to be
taught to kill, but to stop killing. That is one reason military
discipline is so critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are really good. It is a rare man who wants to be
bad,'' the legendary Army Gen. Creighton Abrams once remarked.
``But a lot of men are not strong enough to be good all by
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when the facts of a situation are clear, moral choice may
demand more moral courage than even a competent professional can
muster,'' Anthony E. Hartle, a West Point professor of English,
wrote in a 1989 book, ``Moral Issues in Military Decision-Making.''
</P>
<P>
   Commonly, the horror of war swamps all other considerations,
according to some battle-hardened veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chaplains that were attached to the infantry that I was in
practically never did spiritual work because they knew they'd be
ridiculed,'' recalls Paul Fussell, a scholar and author who was
severely wounded as a World War II infantry officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``controlled despair'' of endless combat, ``everybody
recognized that religion was no help whatsoever,'' Fussell recalled
in a 1996 interview with Humanities magazine.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, perhaps, these issues cannot be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   There is no neat, precise moral theory that can ease the acute
dilemma of military commanders trying to balance their men's
survival with consideration for the rights of enemy and civilians
on the battlefield, Walzer observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can only prove their honor by accepting responsibility
for (their) decisions and by living out the agony,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As for those judging from the outside, ``It is sometimes said we
should draw a veil over the crimes that soldiers and statesmen
cannot avoid. Or we should avert our eyes -- for the sake of our
innocence, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is dangerous business,'' Walzer concluded. ``Having
looked away, how will we know when to look back?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAU CLAIRE, Wis. _ Charles Kemper has picked up dead songbirds
for 40 years, retrieving their broken carcasses and bloody feathers
from beneath a local TV and radio tower.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120,000 birds have fallen. They've dropped overnight
in the grass, on rooftops, in the street. A recent night's death
toll was 11, including two Tennessee warblers, a species in
decline.
</P>
<P>
   And always the question remains: What makes these nighttime
travelers, some able to navigate mountain ranges and cross oceans,
crash into the lethal latticework of a blinking communications
tower?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know very little more now than I did then,'' said Kemper,
one of the cadre of amateurs and professionals long puzzled by the
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists estimate that more than 4 million migrating
birds are killed each year in tower collisions nationwide. And
together with industry representatives, they're weighing landmark
strategies to keep birds away from the sky-high death traps.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize the slaughter, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
hopes soon to issue voluntary construction guidelines on tower
height, lighting and location. Compliance would mean considerable
expense to an industry that is racing to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The task is urgent, advocates say. Thousands of towers have
risen during the cellular phone and digital pager booms. And a new,
taller generation will appear with the spread of digital TV.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ornithologists plan a pioneering study to learn why
some towers lure the chirping birds to a grotesque end. Researchers
also hope to reveal more answers to some of nature's most
tantalizing questions: How many birds roam the heavens? What
species goes where? What keeps them on course?
</P>
<P>
   But the priority is to unravel the tower mystery.
</P>
<P>
   While more birds are killed by other hazards -- cats, cars,
office buildings -- conservationists view the towers as a threat
that can at least be minimized. Any gains would be embraced by
ornithologists who fear that pesticides, development and other
factors have sent populations of migrating, neotropical songbirds
into a prolonged slide.
</P>
<P>
   At some towers, including the 1,000-footer in Wisconsin, bird
deaths are dwindling -- and that's not necessarily a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw tremendous casualties in the '60s and '70s,'' Kemper
said. ``But they've gradually been fewer. ... I think there may be
fewer birds. I wouldn't like to think that, but it may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird kills have been reported for more than 100 years. Confused
birds have flown into fires, monuments, street lights and airport
ceilometers that measured cloud height.
</P>
<P>
   At communications towers, birds are killed in several ways. Some
crash into girders and wires. Some accidentally spear each other
with their beaks. Disorientation sends others straight into the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath is rarely seen. Towers commonly stand in sparsely
populated areas, and raccoons and other scavengers quickly pick
through the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   It's even more rare that a tower kill is witnessed as it takes
place. ``This happens 100 yards up in the middle of the night,''
said Ronald Larkin, a wildlife ecologist for the Illinois Natural
History Survey.
</P>
<P>
   The kills occur during spring and fall migrations, and at night,
when songbirds travel to avoid the heat and daytime predators. Fog,
mist or other weather increases the odds of trouble. Unlike larger
birds that might climb above the clouds, smaller migrants may try
swooping underneath, into altitudes interrupted by the towers.
</P>
<P>
   The worst kills happen when a flock, perhaps numbering half a
million, flaps toward a lighted tower. Something about the lights
draws the birds closer. They begin to circle closer and closer to
the tower and its steel tethers.
</P>
<P>
   It is unknown what physiological trick is at work. Many
ornithologists believe birds navigate by the stars. In stormy
weather, a tower's lights, intended to warn away airplanes, may
mimic the celestial beacons.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Larkin used a radar dish several years ago to follow a flock of
birds approaching a 1,000-foot tower in Michigan. When the tower,
which was marked by steady and blinking lights, became enshrouded
in descending clouds, ``we noticed that the birds flying inside the
cloud started behaving strangely,'' Larkin said. ``A substantial
number made turns. They were well out from the tower, but the birds
were flying in a slow arc.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin believes that birds caught in bad weather are afraid to
leave a tower's glow. ``They circle, and as they turn, maybe the
circle gets a little smaller, they strike the guy wires and fall to
the ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Evans, a researcher who has used audio monitors to
study migration for Cornell University, told a workshop of
ornithologists last year about a kill at a 317-foot tower on the
Nebraska plains.
</P>
<P>
   After pointing a monitoring device at the sky near a tower,
Evans said, ``I was very surprised to discover I had recorded some
bird collisions with the tower. You could actually hear the wing
beats of ducks as they approached the tower, then a collision
sound, and in one case, a thud on the ground. ... A blue-winged
teal was found dead under the tower. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But they didn't sound like vocalizations I had recorded in the
past 15 years from other regions of the country. They were alarm
calls. ... These birds were flying along at night in the dark and
they just didn't see the tower until they were right up on it. Many
apparently became aware of the tower right at the last minute and

</P>
<P>
   Among the most vivid accounts of kills are written reports and a
scratchy home movie kept by Kemper in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper became interested in birds during World War II. While
crossing the Pacific, he was captivated by albatrosses that
zigzagged across open sea. After the war he read about bird deaths
caused by ceilometers, skycrapers and towers. While a young doctor,
he began checking a 500-foot tower in nearby Eau Claire.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing turned up for several months. But then a 1,000-foot
tower was erected near the 500-footer. Kemper missed the first kill
while on vacation, but the local paper published a report.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made for interesting reading,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carcasses were ordered buried by a town official who feared
disease. But other kills followed, including one widely recognized
as the largest single kill ever recorded: more than 20,000 dead
birds discovered Sept. 20, 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see, as far as 500 feet from the tower, birds lying on
the highway crushed by passing vehicles,'' Kemper wrote in an
Audubon Magazine article recounting the deaths of warblers,
thrushes and tanagers. ``There were men, employees from the
next-door junkyard and neighboring businesses, raking up dead birds
like leaves into piles.''
</P>
<P>
   An 8-millimeter film, spinning from a dusty Kodak projector,
documents another kill in the late '50s or early '60s. Its
flickering scenes are all the more powerful for being silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are just the injured ones,'' Kemper said, narrating a
segment showing handfuls of birds collected in a net sack. ``Most
of them died.''
</P>
<P>
   The images are wrenching: Kemper's teen-age son walking on the
roof of a nearby body shop, dropping dozens of dead birds into a
plastic bag. His small dog, Tramp, stepping cautiously in the
street among hundreds of feathered lumps. Kemper's daughter sitting
at a table, stacking victims into piles according to species.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Many specimens, preserved in backyard freezers, were shipped to
university researchers. Kemper's yellowed logs tally the species.
On Oct. 1, 1959, for example, among hundreds of victims were 64
Swainson's thrushes, 44 red-eyed vireos and 46 blackpoll warblers.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper understood he was documenting an important phenomenon,
but ``it got so you went out there and you hoped you didn't find
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another of his accounts documents a 1964 kill of about 4,600
birds. ``You were lucky if you weren't clunked on the head by a
falling bird,'' Kemper wrote. ``Some of the station personnel ...
got out a 1,000-candlepower television spotlight. Aiming it at the
tower, we beheld a tremendous spectacle. Great masses of birds were
buzzing or milling around the tower like swarming bees or moths
around a flame.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, efforts to address tower kills have accelerated. Not only
are there fears about new towers, but on Jan. 22, 1998, up to
10,000 birds, mostly lapland longspurs, were slaughtered at a tower
during a West Kansas snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were birds scattered all around the agricultural fields,
up to a quarter-mile from the tower,'' said Eugene Young, a
visiting ecology professor at Southwestern College in Winfield,
Kan. ``And you could see birds that were impaled on the stubble. It
was milo or wheat stubble. The birds actually flew into the ground
hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, the Cornell researcher who helped organize last fall's
workshop, said ``the longspur kill catalyzed everyone.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The actual number of communications towers in the United States
is unknown but estimated at perhaps 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Only towers of 200 feet or taller, which are required by the
Federal Aviation Administration to have safety lighting, are
federally registered. There are nearly 50,400 of those, according
to the Federal Communications Commission. But shorter towers,
controlled only by local zoning, have proliferated with the spread
of cell phones and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, bird conservationists fear that 1,000 so-called
megatowers for digital TV transmission -- including some
approaching 2,000 feet, taller than the Empire State Building --
will be erected in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 federal officials, conservationists, researchers and
members of the private sector have formed a committee, the
Communication Tower Working Group, to launch research into tower
kills.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Fish and Wildlife Service has drafted its interim
measures for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Manville, a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist, said
expanding companies would be asked to locate transmission equipment
on existing towers rather than build new ones. If that's not
possible, companies would be encouraged to build shorter towers
with no supporting guy wires, locate towers outside areas prone to
low clouds, and mark towers with white strobe lights rather than
slowly pulsing red ones, which are believed to be more alluring to
birds.
</P>
<P>
   It follows that tower construction would become more expensive.
A tall tower without supporting guy wires, for example, requires
more concrete and steel. American Tower Corp., with plans to build
1,200 towers this year, would pay an estimated $70,000 extra for
every 300-foot tower without guy wires, said Rebecca DeMoss, a
company official.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Williams, a lawyer for the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, a trade group represented on the working
group, said her organization had not yet adequately reviewed the
proposals. ``We're withholding our support until we can have the
serious dialogue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, federal officials hope the industry will pay for much
of the planned ornithological study, which may run $5 million to
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most research would probably take place at towers in the eastern
two-thirds of the country, where migration routes are heaviest.
Ornithologists might use radar, acoustical monitoring, night vision
goggles or other devices. Experts in bird vision and navigation
would participate. One expert has suggested measuring dead birds'
body fat and water content to learn what role exhaustion might play
in their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are already brainstorming ways to keep birds away.
In addition to white lights instead of red, they'll try fluorescent
paint, mirrors to shine lights skyward, giant netting, devices that
spin in the wind, horns or devices that broadcast low-frequency
sounds, similar to sonic booms.
</P>
<P>
   The study would take years, but the possible payoffs are
enormous, ornithologists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit like medicine in the Middle Ages,'' said
Larkin. ``You have a symptom, and you have something that might fix
it, but you have no idea what's going on in the body. It's animal
behavior, bird migration and bird vision. There are areas that we
don't understand.''

<P>
   The moment takes you by surprise: the sound of coins shaken in a
cup, followed by the plea, ``Can you spare some change?''
</P>
<P>
   During one of the most prosperous times in the nation's history,
with unemployment at a 30-year low and many companies desperate to
hire workers, the outstretched hands of beggars provide visible
reminders that some Americans aren't riding the big wave of the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   From San Francisco to New York, cities have passed laws and
toughened policies to get panhandlers out of public places, if not
society's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet begging continues, nearly always evoking a personal
response, ranging from recoil to giving.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a right thing to do? Even experts in ethics,
homelessness and poverty disagree on the proper course of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on my mood,'' said Kim Hopper, co-founder of both
the New York Coalition for the Homeless and the National Coalition
for the Homeless. ``I'm afraid that's not a very principled stand.
If I know the people, I'll respond with some money. But if I'm just
hitting a new town and get deluged by panhandlers while I'm trying
to find my way, my irked response will be, `I'm out of change right
now.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could call it a quandary.''
</P>
<P>
   It torments public relations consultant Kristen Spargo every
time she meets a panhandler, and recently when she encountered
David Frost seated on a downtown Washington sidewalk with his back
against a row of newspaper machines. Frost held a sign: ``Homeless.
Please Help. God bless all. Every little bit helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Spargo, walking past, didn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a socially minded community person and I struggle with
this issue,'' she said. ``I've thought a lot about it, and I
usually walk right on by and feel guilty. I think about the Phil
Collins song (`Another Day in Paradise') about the homeless woman
in the street with no shoes on her feet and people pretending they
don't see her. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my rationalization is that there are organizations out
there that people can use, there are resources in which people can
get help. You can pull yourself up by the bootstraps.''
</P>
<P>
   The homeless have been much studied, but not so panhandlers, who
aren't always homeless, said Dennis Culhane, an associate professor
of social work at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``But trust me on this,'' said Culhane, who has done research
for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ``There is
still a considerable amount of people whose only route to get money
is begging.''
</P>
<P>
   They include the unemployable no longer receiving government
checks because of welfare reform, the physically and mentally
disabled trying to stay under strict income limits in order to
qualify for federal aid, and ex-convicts who just finished prison
terms but haven't been trained in how to join the work force,
Culhane said.
</P>
<P>
   Culhane doesn't usually give cash to panhandlers, but has a
clear conscience because ``I can say I'm spending my life on this
issue.'' He urges people bothered by panhandlers to pressure their
politicians to start government programs that would eliminate the
need to beg.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Cote, founder of Denver's Step 13 shelter, doesn't give to
panhandlers either, for a different reason. Cote sees individual
irresponsibility as the real culprit.
</P>
<P>
   A former panhandler himself, Cote says most beggars are lying
drunks or addicts like he used to be. A foolishly sympathetic
society enables their addictions by refusing to make them
accountable for their choices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think they're going to straighten up their lives?'' he
asked. ``They're just going to go out and panhandle enough to buy
another drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Cote came up with the idea of printing coupons for a meal at his
shelter of Beanie Weenies, apple sauce and a fruit drink. His board
of directors was reluctant to go along, fearing a deluge of people.
</P>
<P>
   That was 11 years ago. Cote said he has distributed more than
100,000 coupons at churches and civic organizations throughout the
Denver area. Only 32 beggars have redeemed them, he said, and two
threw the food down in disgust when they saw what it was. None
enrolled in Cote's tough-love program, which requires people to get
sober, get a job and pay a low rent at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Some people try to make an instant evaluation of a panhandler's
worthiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you can tell if somebody is a hustler,'' Mark Mallus,
a Washington commercial real estate broker, said after reaching
into his pocket and giving a panhandler a dollar. ``I trust my
sense and if my sense tells to it's genuine, I give them money
because I make a lot of money and have a place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Waldron, a homeless Vietnam veteran who said he's been
sleeping under an outdoor bench in St. Petersburg, Fla., since a
recent hospital stay, panhandles on occasion, but is wary about
giving to others. That's because he has seen working people with
addictions change into shabby clothes in order to look needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at their eyes,'' said Waldron, 50. ``If they've got
bloodshot eyes, they're either drinking or on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Beggars create discomfort because they challenge our fundamental
values, said Aaron Kipnis, 51, a psychologist and author.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to either say, `There's something I have to do' or
`There's something the matter with these people and it's their
problem,''' said Kipnis, 51, who works in Carpinteria, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Kipnis begged on the streets of San Francisco from ages 14 to 17
between stints in juvenile institutions and foster homes. His wife
gives money to panhandlers, he said, but he rarely does out of
concern they -- as he did -- might spend it on drugs. But Kipnis
tries to establish eye contact and conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on the street, there was this sense of
worthlessness projected toward me by people who were well-dressed
and clean and obviously had places to go,'' said Kipnis, whose
book, ``Angry Young Men: How Parents, Teachers and Counselors Can
Help `Bad Boys' Become Good Men,'' was published last year by
Jossey-Bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember anyone ever asking me, `Why are you on the
street and how can I help?' Not once.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then, the 1960s. This is now, when unemployment has
dipped below 4 percent nationally, according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. In some major cities, it's even lower.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that in a full-throttle economy like this one,
most people should be able to find a job most of the time,'' said
James O'Gara, executive director of the Washington-based
Philanthropy Roundtable, moments after he passed a panhandler.
</P>
<P>
   The panhandler, Gregory Ward, mans the same corner of 17th and L
streets every weekday, including national holidays.
</P>
<P>
   O'Gara volunteers weekly at a homeless shelter and has an office
near Ward's corner. He said he'd been impressed by the panhandler's
diligence, and wonders why he can't apply it to a regular job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably too lazy or has another problem,'' O'Gara
speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he begged, the 43-year-old Ward said he'd had problems
getting ``back on my feet'' since his mother's death a year ago. He
said he makes about $10 a day panhandling, sleeps at a nearby
homeless shelter and spends the change dropped into his paper cup
on fast food.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how much panhandlers make on average nationally,
but researcher Culhane said he suspects the numbers vary widely by
skill, location and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather is pleasant and people are on the streets of
Washington, Mark Wade said he can make up to $20 an hour. An
average week brings in around $300, with lows of $100 or less in
the winter and highs of more than $500 in the summer -- tax free,
for the IRS considers his proceeds to be gifts rather than income.
(Givers enjoy no tax advantage, for gifts to individuals are not
deductible.)
</P>
<P>
   Wade relies on humor. He has learned to target tourists by
saying ``show me the money'' in French and Arabic. He switches
spots according to the time of day, and makes his best money when
he targets college students outside night clubs on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays from noon to 3 p.m., Wade sits on a crate near a
bridge linking the upscale neighborhoods of Foggy Bottom and
Georgetown. Lately he's held a broken umbrella handle like a
fishing rod, dangling a donation pail from blue yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Wade brings out pumpkin and Santa Claus pails for Halloween and
Christmas and is searching for something red, white and blue for
July. A flashing red light worked wonders before police took it
away, accusing him, he said, of aggressive panhandling.
</P>
<P>
   He's held clerical jobs and would like to work, he said. But he
sleeps at shelters, which don't allow him to remain during the day,
making it difficult for prospective employers to contact him.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekday afternoon, most pedestrians smiled, but
didn't give, as Wade entertained them with myriad sounds:
``beep-beep,'' ``yoo-hoo'' and ``OK, I'm ready.'' He delivered
rhymes in a rap-like cadence: ``The best nation is a donation'' and
``the best city is generosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Sylvester, a Howard University student, dropped a dollar
into his pail as a reward for making her laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who am I to decide what they do with their money?'' Sylvester
asked, adding that she was raised in a Christian household and
taught to give to those in need.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every religion advocates charity in general, but disputes
arise regarding beggars. Judaism emphasizes
``Tzedakah''(righteousness) and ``Gemilut Hasadim'' (bestowing
kindness). Christianity stresses a responsibility to help the poor,
with Christ saying ``give to the one who asks you'' in Matthew
5:42.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims take guidance from the account of Mohammed telling
beggars to cut wood and sell it in the market instead of asking for
money, said Anwar Hajjaj, professor of Islamic studies at The
American Open University, an Islamic school in a Washington suburb.
``Islam promotes work and fights those who choose to rely on
others,'' Hajjaj said. In his view, persistent panhandlers should
be jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thurman, professor of Buddhist Studies at Columbia
University in New York City and a prominent scholar, said that
Buddhism leaves much room for personal interpretation. A personal
friend of the Dalai Lama, Thurman said he tries to give without a
trace of irritation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old argument that you shouldn't give to one because you
can't give to everyone is not very good for your karma,'' he said.
``After all, everyone isn't asking you. There's just one poor guy
there in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Thurman doesn't want to end up like the rich man who
died and encountered St. Peter at the pearly gates of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you ever give to those who asked you for money?''
Peter asks the new arrival in Thurman's story.
</P>
<P>
   The rich man replies that in 50 years, he'd given three beggars
a grand total of $15. Peter says he's got to check this one with
The Boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``What should I do with this rich guy?'' he inquires. ``He
endowed libraries. He contributed to the arts. But his direct
giving to people was only $15 and he was a multimillionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a moment of silence, then the loud command: ``Give him
his money back and tell him to go to hell.''

indicators over time).

 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a generation makes.
</P>
<P>
   When Sonny Collie, a musician from Dallas, considers the six
consecutive interest rate increases approved by the Federal Reserve
Board and the sharply spiking spring and summer price of gasoline,
he shudders with these bad memories:
</P>
<P>
   The gas lines during the energy crises of the 1970s. The
combination of runaway inflation and high unemployment known as
``stagflation.'' The recessions that seemed to undercut every
recovery. And the double-digit interest rates that made it nearly
impossible to buy a home in 1980 and 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Rob and Cara Olsen react without the fearful imagery -- perhaps
because they were mere children when the economy of the '70s and
early '80s whacked huge holes in the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Both are 31 years old -- Collie's juniors by 17 years. Unlike
the Texan, they haven't lived scared or coped with the notion that
they might not be as prosperous as their parents, let alone surpass
their standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers and today's young adults regard the nation's
longest economic expansion through the eyes of their respective
experiences. The resulting differences may not create the kind of
wall the Great Depression put up between American generations of an
earlier era, but it is still a substantial divide between those who
have lived through economic upheaval and those who have never been
intimate with recession and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a generation of people used to good job markets and
higher levels of disposable income and easy about carrying a lot of
debt,'' James Schmotter, dean of business at Western Michigan
University, said of the younger set. ``There's a whole generation
that probably understands to some degree what inflation is through
college courses or its impact in other countries, but they haven't
seen friends losing jobs or lost one themselves because of tough
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Olsens. They bought a house in Silver Spring, Md.,
a month ago, braving the interest rate bumps with which Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan has tried to chill the inflation out of
America's boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not losing a lot of sleep at night thinking the economy is
going into the crapper and that I'm going to lose my job,'' said
Rob Olsen, an economist for a public policy research firm. ``The
economy's been pretty good through most of my adult life. ... It
does breed confidence year after year when you don't hit that many
rough spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers like Collie have a tougher time trusting the
current prosperity precisely because of their rocky economic
experiences, their loss of the sense of entitlement created while
growing up in the post-World War II economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was broke and living on Beanie Weenies,'' Collie said of the
'70s. ``I remember being terrified by what was going on. I don't
remember it being an analog to what our parents faced during the
Depression, but it hit me hard. It made me paranoid and destroyed
my notion that this was a great nation that was going to roll
forward no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that moment, we were a generation that knew no limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments among baby boomers fuel a broad wariness of the
economy that caused consumer confidence to lag well into the
current expansion, said Lynn Franco of the Conference Board, a
research organization that regularly measures Americans' economic
mood. Not until 1995's sharp drop in the unemployment rate did
consumer confidence top the Conference Board's magic 100-point
mark, its indicator that a majority feel good about the economic
future.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, it seems not even the twin golems of rising
interest rates and gas prices can shake the economic faith of U.S.
consumers, never mind their age.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the consumer confidence index shattered its monthly
record, posting a 144.7 mark. It is now at 144.4, its
second-highest level ever, said Franco, director of the Conference
Board's consumer research center in New York. This despite the fact
that 71.2 percent of those surveyed expect interest rates to go
still higher.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's string of boosts, said Franco, hasn't caught
consumers off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've built it into their thinking about the economy,'' she
said. ``It's just not having the big psychological impact and it's
not impacting consumer spending.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Recent Gallup polls conducted for CNN and USA Today suggest
consumer optimism isn't monolithic. And they reveal an ironic twist
in the difference between generations: Many boomers, born again in
their economic faith, are clinging more tightly to it.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to gas prices, the younger generation exhibits the
greater pessimism. Fifty-eight percent of those ages 18 to 29 think
the increases are a harbinger of permanent change, according to a
May survey. Only 45 percent of those 50 to 64 agree with that
position.
</P>
<P>
   As for higher interest rates, a June survey shows a larger
percentage of the 18-to-29 young adults are reacting by adjusting
major spending decisions -- 41 percent, compared with 32 percent of
those ages 50 to 64.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't as contradictory as it first appears.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a long, more haunted economic view, young adults are
exhibiting a sharp, almost tactical reaction to interest and gas
price increases -- in some cases, accelerating a house purchase to
lock in a good mortgage rate. But their long view of the economy
remains unshaken.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the more bitter economic experience of older
generations helps them take a broader perspective. This may be bad
news, they say, but they've lived through worse.
</P>

   Collie paints all this in dark tones. Though he is surprised by
polls showing somewhat greater ``price sensitivity'' to gas and
interest rate increases among young adults, his take on that
generation remains unchanged: Youngsters, particularly those who
buy into the notion that technology is creating permanent
prosperity, exhibit the arrogance and naivete of inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sense of entitlement to all the things that we
know may not be there forever,'' Collie said. ``We know how close
that chaos can be much better than an 18-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Cara Olsen, a statistical consultant, gives her generation's
outlook a different spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I think the economy's going to keep getting
better and better,'' she said. ``But because of our experiences, we
think we can weather any little ups and downs and don't think too
much about big downs.''
</P>
<P>
   This generational difference echoes an ongoing argument among
economists, historians, financial professionals and business
people:
</P>
<P>
   Are the very fundamentals of economics being rewritten by
technological marvels like the Internet, resulting in immunity from
capitalism's traditional cycle of boom and bust? Or do those old
rules still apply, albeit in an atmosphere of global competition,
greater productivity and instantaneous communication?
</P>
<P>
   The young wizards of the Internet preach the former with
evangelical zeal. Economists are more cautious, but point out some
significant differences between the modern U.S. economy and the
troubled editions of two and three decades past.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Cold War or accompanying economic drag of four
decades of military competition with the Soviet Union. There has
been no tectonic shock like the Arab oil embargo of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But greater productivity and efficiency are the prime
difference, said Robert Dauffenbach, director of the Center of
Economic and Management Research at the University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that improvement is driven by technology -- from
computers to robotics to the Internet -- and the dismantling of the
vertically integrated corporate behemoths of the past, Dauffenbach
said. Innovations such as outsourcing and just-in-time supply
deliveries have trimmed payrolls and tailored supply more closely
to consumer demand, lessening the likelihood of the inventory gluts
that triggered previous recessions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Dauffenbach said, globalization -- aided
mightily by the Internet -- has expanded markets and increased
competition among suppliers. This keeps prices down, punishes
inefficient players and cools inflationary forces despite the
lowest U.S. unemployment levels since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Another key difference is demographic, said Diane Macunovich, an
economics professor at Barnard College of Columbia University who
has studied the baby boomers' impact on the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   As this giant bulge of humanity entered the work force, it at
first stimulated the economy with demand for products, creating an
expansion that helped absorb its numbers. But this mass of young,
cheap labor encouraged companies to hire more bodies instead of
investing in more efficient machinery and plants, inefficiency
exacerbated by the inflationary pressures of the Vietnam War and
the Great Society programs, Macunovich said.
</P>
<P>
   When the first Arab oil embargo hit, consumer spending dropped
off rapidly, triggering a steep recession in 1974 and a glut of
goods. But production costs remained high, resulting in what Collie
remembers as ``stagflation'' -- simultaneous economic sluggishness
and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The movement of the baby boom into the work force caused a steep
decline in young workers' wages. From 1970 to 1985, wages of young
white males dropped 40 percent when adjusted for inflation. Young
black males experienced a 60 percent drop. In addition, women began
working in record numbers, ending what economists call the ``family
wage,'' the unspoken extra paid to a married male in the theory
that he was more productive with a wife taking care of chores at
home.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Boomers made all kinds of compensating adjustments as a result,
Macunovich said. They put off marriage and children, prolonged
their education or dependency on parents.
</P>
<P>
   Collie, making his living backing such luminaries of the Austin
music scene as Willis Alan Ramsey, Roky Erickson and the late B.W.
Stevenson, delayed marriage until 1986 and parenthood until 1988.
He and his wife Cathi, a billing manager for a Dallas law firm,
didn't buy a house until 1992. He told himself he was a free
spirit, a musician with a bohemian lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I was totally full of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a strong historic correlation between the number
of 15-to-24- year-olds and the strength of the U.S. economy,
Macunovich said. Even the early edge of the baby boom expanded the
economy until their sheer numbers overwhelmed and overheated a
system soon wracked by inflation and oil shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the American economy has enjoyed yet another surge
in the absolute numbers of this age group, an echo boom of the
boomers' children. But this generation isn't having the same
proportional impact on the work force as its parents did; it's
being easily absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is suffering none of the high unemployment, low
relative wages and high inflation that buffeted the boomers,
Macunovich said. In other words, its members are perfectly
positioned to enjoy the fruits of continued expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But will that sweet harvest be unending?
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Collie doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   To his experienced ear, Greenspan's notes sound like the opening
bars of a golden oldie of economic disillusionment and dashed
hopes. It is a classic that has never left his head. ``What our
generation lived through trimmed our sails psychologically,'' he
said. ``It definitely limits my optimism about the economy and the
future.''

A BOTTLENECK BETWEEN THE DIGITAL PLAYER AND THE EAR: THE PC 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CIR-MP3-PLAYERS) 
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Makers of personal digital audio players readily concede that
despite almost two years of gradual improvements, using the
palm-size and smaller devices is still not nearly as simple as
slapping a CD into a conventional CD player and pressing the play
button.
</P>
<P>
   The chief source of all the complication is the personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the dozens of models of digital audio players on
the market today, and most scheduled to be available soon, require
a computer to load them with music.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest method is to copy songs from CDs _ called
``ripping'' _ and then store them on the computer in highly
compressed audio formats, or codecs, like MP3 and Windows Media
Audio. The other approach is to use a computer with an Internet
connection to hunt up some of the countless songs available on
various Web sites. Music on the Web is already compressed in an
audio format, and listeners can download it into a computer.
Portable players are not yet able to do this alone.
</P>
<P>
   Once the digital music is in the computer, either stored on the
computer's hard drive or on a removable storage medium like a Zip
disk, the computer needs special programs to best identify the
music, organize it, play it and load it into a portable player.
Those programs are integrated into something commonly called music
management software. And there's the rub.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the music management software that greeted early
adopters of portable players was complex, temperamental and
generally user-hostile. But in recent months, as portable-player
hardware has significantly improved, so has a new batch of music
management software. Some of the programs are included with new
portable players; others are sold separately, like Sonic Foundry's
Siren Jukebox, a standout for its abundance of features and
exuberance of design elements. And still others are being posted on
the Web as shareware.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most improved examples of music management software
can be found in S3's Rio Audio Manager 3, which comes with the Rio
600 portable player, and Microsoft's Windows Media Player 7, which
can be downloaded free at www.microsoft.com/windowsmedia.
</P>
<P>
   These programs are simple to master. And they can be used both
to convert music taken from CDs into music files and to download
music from Internet sites. They also offer features that permit
users to turn digital music collections into custom CDs (if the
computer has a CD-R or CD-RW drive).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with so much digital media on the Internet these days,
like streaming video and audio (including live radio, concerts and
music videos) in multiple formats, the new Rio and Windows programs
are being marketed as all-in-one solutions. Each easily searches
and categorizes content in the computer, even tracking down music
files users may have squirreled away in some forgotten corner of
their hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   People can use the software to create playlists by artists,
genres or any theme, in much the same way they would name and
organize documents using a word processor program. Once the
playlists are made, the music management software can do one of the
things it does best _ move digital music into portable players.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Audio Manager is especially well suited to work with
Rio's line of portable players, either automatically recognizing
them when the devices are plugged into a computer's Universal
Serial Bus port (or serial port on older models) or by manually
selecting the player model from a pull-down menu in the software.
</P>
<P>
   Once the portable player is recognized, the program displays two
adjoining windows; the one on the right side lists what is on the
portable player, and the one on the left displays what music is
available for a listener to copy into the attached player. A
playlist can be placed in the left-side window by simply dragging
and dropping in songs or double-clicking them into the window.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio software plays MP3, Windows Media Audio and other
leading audio and video formats.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows Media Player 7 also reads MP3 and, of course,
Windows Media Audio (almost twice as compressed as MP3, with
similar high fidelity), as well as a range of other audio and video
formats. But the Windows player especially excels at ease of use.
Its look and design is sleek and simple. All the buttons and
windows are well placed, well labeled and intuitively arranged so
their function is clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows player also has audio sweeteners, sound-enhancing
programs by SRS Labs called WOW and TruBass which, among other
things, create the illusion when music is played through the
computer that the speakers are farther apart than they are likely
to be on a desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Windows and Rio management software feature annoying
visualization programs, windows that fill with a variety of
computer-generated, three-dimensional animations that respond to
whatever music the software is playing. Even at their best, the
light shows hardly seem to justify the heavy demand they make on
the computer's central processing unit, and they can impede music
playback on all but the most robust computers.
</P>
<P>
   Like most audio management software, both also have graphical
equalizers to adjust the audio characteristics of the music.
</P>
<P>
   And there are alternative ``skins,'' fun and fanciful versions
of the interface.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some notable exceptions. Sony's OpenMG Jukebox
software, which comes with the VAIO Music Clip, has a strikingly
unadorned appearance. It does not offer alternative skins. It also
bears only a dash of 2-D animation seen on a thumbnail-size screen
when music is being played back. The animation can be turned off.
</P>
<P>
   However, while the software will recognize and play music
encoded in MP3, it will copy music files from CDs into Sony's own
format, Atrac3, only.This feature, unlike MP3, severely limits the
number of times a music file may be copied. This is one attempt to
prevent wide dissemination of MP3 files without payment to music
companies or artists.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony software is simple and straightforward. A five-minute
song takes about a minute and a half to copy using the highest bit
rate offered, 132 kilobytes per second. The higher the bit rate,
the better the sound quality but the larger the file. Using Atrac3
at 132 kbps limits recording time to an hour. Copying the same
music using a 66 kbps bit rate yields 120 minutes of playback.
</P>
<P>
   With MP3, using a bit rate that will play back music at what is
usually called near-CD quality, the rule of thumb is about 1
megabyte per minute of music.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring music to the portable player is a three-step
process: highlight the song or album, indicate with a mouse click
that the selection is to be transferred and then click a start
button. Three songs of average length can be transferred in about a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Iomega, which is making and licensing portable players with Clik
drives, takes a different approach. Yes, music software, included
with the players, is used to manage music downloads and rip CD
tracks. But the actual process of transferring the music to
portable players using Clik drives involves nothing more than
dragging a desired song from column A to column B.
</P>
<P>
   In Iomega's digital architecture, a music file is nothing
particularly fancy, just another file to be dragged and dropped
from one hard drive to another.
</P>
<P>
   No, it is not as simple as popping a CD into a CD player, but it
is getting easier.

CHICAGO CORN PUDDING &QL; 
What's so good about this is that it is crunchy on top and creamy
inside and gets a big boost of flavor from the green chiles. &QL; 
2 (10-ounce) packages frozen corn kernels, slightly defrosted OR 7
ears leftover fresh corn kernels, removed from cob &QL; 
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter, melted &QL; 
3 large eggs &QL; 
1 1/2 cups dairy sour cream &QL; 
3/4 cup yellow cornmeal &QL; 
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese &QL; 
1 (4-ounce) can whole green chiles, drained, patted dry and cut
into 1/2- inch-wide strips &QL; 
2 cloves garlic, crushed and chopped &QL; 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Puree 1 package corn (or 1/2 of fresh corn) in a food processor
with all but 1 tablespoon melted butter and transfer to a large
bowl. Add eggs and sour cream and combine well. Fold in other 1/2
of corn. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium-size bowl, combine cornmeal, cheese, chiles and
garlic and season with salt and pepper. Combine this with corn
mixture and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Use remaining 1 tablespoon butter to grease a 2- or 3-quart
casserole and pour in corn batter.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 375-degree oven about 1 hour, until puffy and
brown. Serve immediately. Makes 6 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD &QL; 
!ital!If you are thinking of doubling this for a party, a word to
the wise: Double everything but the chicken, which should be
increased by half the original amount. If you double it outright,
you will have too much chicken and not enough sauce. &QL; 
CHICKEN: &QL; 
4 whole chicken breasts (about 4 pounds), split into halves &QL; 
2 tablespoons sesame oil &QL; 
1 tablespoon soy sauce &QL; 
SALAD: &QL; 
2 cups vegetable oil &QL; 
1 (5-ounce) package rice sticks &QL; 
3 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted until golden brown &QL; 
6 green onions (white and green parts), cleaned and chopped &QL; 
1 head iceberg lettuce, cored and sliced thin &QL; 
SAUCE: &QL; 
6 tablespoons red, white OR rice wine vinegar &QL; 
6 tablespoons sugar &QL; 
1 tablespoon soy sauce &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
3 tablespoons sesame oil &QL; 
3/4 cup vegetable or canola oil &QL; 
3 tablespoons finely chopped crystallized ginger
</P>
<P>
   For Chicken, in a large baking dish, marinate chicken in sesame
oil and soy sauce, turning breasts several times, for a few hours
or overnight, refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   Bake chicken in same dish in marinade in preheated 350-degree
oven 25 to 30 minutes; let cool. Remove skin and bones and discard.
Shred chicken into bite-size pieces. Set aside in fridge until
assembly time.
</P>
<P>
   For Salad, the morning of the dinner, heat vegetable oil in a
large saucepan over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.
Drop in a few rice sticks and watch them. They will puff up and
turn white. Now put in rest of sticks in batches. Turn pile over
and cook on other side. They should stay white and not turn brown.
This takes only a few seconds on each side. When they stop making a
sizzling noise, they are done. Drain on paper towels and set aside
until assembling salad.
</P>
<P>
   For Sauce, in a small bowl, whisk together all Sauce
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble salad, wait until just before eating. In a large
bowl or pot, combine chicken with toasted sesame seeds, chopped
green onions and sliced lettuce. Pour sauce over salad and toss
well. Place crispy noodles on a big platter and spoon tossed
chicken salad on top of them. Serve immediately. Makes 6 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKES &QL; 
These are old-fashioned Strawberry Shortcakes _ baking powder
biscuits that are split while they are still warm, then topped with
sweet strawberries and spoonfuls of fresh whipped cream. &QL; 
BERRIES: &QL; 
2 pints fresh strawberries, washed, hulled and thinly sliced &QL; 
1/2 cup sugar &QL; 
BISCUITS: &QL; 
2 cups all-purpose flour &QL; 
4 teaspoons baking powder &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1 tablespoon sugar &QL; 
6 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening &QL; 
3/4 cup milk &QL; 
2 cups heavy whipping cream, whipped to stiff peaks
</P>
<P>
   For Berries, place strawberries and sugar in a medium-size bowl
and steep several hours, refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   For Biscuits, place flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a
large bowl. With a pastry cutter or two knives, cut cold shortening
into dry ingredients, or use food processor, pulsing until dough
looks like coarse meal. Add milk and mix lightly with a fork or
pulse two or three times until dough comes together. Place dough on
a lightly floured work surface. Knead very lightly for a few turns
and pat into a 1 1/2-inch-thick piece.
</P>
<P>
   Cut out 3-inch rounds and place on an ungreased baking sheet,
spaced 1-inch apart.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 450-degree oven 10 to 12 minutes or until
lightly brown. Set aside on a wire rack to partially cool.
</P>
<P>
   Split biscuits open while still warm and spoon several
tablespoons of berries and juice over two halves. Place a generous
dollop of whipped cream on berries and serve. &QL;

BOB'S MARGARITAS &QL; 
Really good margaritas like these are made one batch at a time &QL; 
1 cup cracked ice (8 ounces) &QL; 
1 (8-ounce) can frozen limeade concentrate &QL; 
8 ounces tequila (silver OR gold) &QL; 
2 ounces triple sec &QL; 
3 to 4 tablespoons margarita salt &QL; 
1 (3-inch) piece lemon peel
</P>
<P>
   Put ice in a blender, add frozen limeade, tequila and triple
sec, and blend until ice is chopped up.
</P>
<P>
   Lay out a sheet of wax paper and put salt on it. Rub outside
edge of each margarita glass with lemon peel. The lemon oil
provides enough moisture to make salt stick. Press edge of each
glass into salt and freeze until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   Pour drink into prepared glass and enjoy. Makes 6 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GUACAMOLE &QL; 
2 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted (keep one of the pits) &QL; 
1 medium ripe tomato, chopped &QL; 
1 small red onion, chopped &QL; 
Juice of 1 lemon &QL; 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
Dash Tabasco sauce
</P>
<P>
   In a medium-size bowl, mash avocados. Add tomato and onion to
avocados and mix with a fork. Add lemon juice and season with salt,
pepper and Tabasco sauce. Push reserved pit into mixture to keep it
from turning brown. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
ready to serve. Serve with taco chips. Makes 6 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOMATO PHYLLO PIZZA &QL; 
You can prepare this pizza a couple of hours ahead, leave it at
room temperature and reheat it for only 10 minutes in a preheated
325-degree oven. You'll find that people want to make an entire
meal of it. You will need a feather brush or a very soft pastry
brush to prepare this recipe. &QL; 
5 tablespoons butter, melted, plus extra for baking sheet &QL; 
1 (17-ounce) package phyllo pastry, thawed to room temperature &QL; 
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese &QL; 
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese &QL; 
1 cup thinly sliced onion &QL; 
2 pounds ripe, medium-size tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch-thick
slices &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme &QL; 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Brush a large baking sheet with butter. Roll up 1/2 of the stack
of phyllo, rewrap it tightly in plastic and return to refrigerator
until you need it. Using remaining phyllo: Take 1 sheet and place
it on a baking sheet. Butter with soft brush and melted butter. Add
next sheet, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and continue buttering
and sprinkling with Parmesan until you have 7 layers total. It is
OK to overlap each layer to fit baking sheet. Crimp edges around so
you form an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle top layer with mozzarella. Place tomato slices on top,
creating a grid of tomatoes about 1 1/2 inches apart. Sprinkle
onion slices over tomato and season with oregano, thyme, salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 375-degree oven 45 to 50 minutes or until
golden brown. Serve on a large tray or bread board, cutting squares
with 1 tomato for each serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHEESE STRAWS &QL; 
This is a very rich dough of Cheddar cheese, butter, flour and egg
that bakes up into absolutely incredible sticks or cookie shapes.
You can bake them in advance and freeza them when they are
completely cool. You should reheat them before serving. They are
really good served with drinks, or with a soup, a salad or as a
snack. &QL; 
1/2 cup all-purpose flour &QL; 
1 teaspoon baking powder &QL; 
Pinch salt &QL; 
Pinch Colman's dry mustard &QL; 
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter &QL; 
1/3 cup shredded sharp yellow Cheddar cheese &QL; 
1 large egg, lightly beaten &QL; 
2 tablespoons sweet paprika
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, stir flour, baking powder, salt and dry
mustard together. Place dry ingredients with butter and cheese in
bowl of a food processor and pulse to make a coarse meal. Add
beaten egg, pulsing until a thick paste forms.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface until 1/4-inch thick
and cut into 5-inch-long strips. Sprinkle lightly with paprika and
place 1 inch apart on a greased baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   You can twist strips and press down ends to make them more
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 15 to 20 minutes or until
golden brown. Makes 24 straws. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHICKEN LIVER PATE WITH CORNICHONS &QL; 
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, at room temperature &QL; 
1/2 cup chopped onion &QL; 
2 tablespoons chopped shallots &QL; 
1 tart apple, cored, peeled and chopped &QL; 
1 pound chicken livers, trimmed of membranes &QL; 
1/4 cup Calvados OR applejack brandy, warmed &QL; 
2 to 4 tablespoons heavy whipping cream (to your taste) &QL; 
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice &QL; 
1 1/2 teaspoons salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
1 cup cornichon pickles
</P>
<P>
   Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium-size skillet over medium
heat. Add onion, shallots and apple and cook, stirring, until
softened. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Melt 3 more tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium
heat and cook chicken livers until medium cooked, about 7 minutes,
turning several times. Add warmed Calvados and carefully light it
with a long match, averting your face and keeping long hair and
hanging sleeves out of the way. Let it flame out by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Place apple mixture and chicken livers in a food processor and
process until smooth, adding cream a little at a time to achieve
consistency of sour cream. Add 1/2 cup butter and process again
until smooth. Mix in lemon juice, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan. Spoon
pate into a dish or container and top with melted butter to
preserve color of pate. You will scrape this butter off when you
serve it. Wrap tightly and refrigerate overnight. Serve with toast
squares or your favorite crackers, and cornichons. Makes 6
servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: The pate can be frozen for up to 2 weeks if tightly
wrapped. &QL;

   &QL; 
Ellen Wright, author of ``Bridgehampton Weekends,'' relies on the
following principles, learned from experience, when she entertains:
</P>
<P>
   Keep it simple. That translates into stay focused and make it
easy. You'll have more time and energy to enjoy your party.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid last-minute panic. Get organized relative to the details
of the meal, where you'll be serving it, dishes and serving pieces,
decorations, etc. Plan to make as much of the food in advance as
possible _ and take advantage of the freezer if feasible. You'll
find recipe tips sprinkled throughout the book to guide you.
</P>
<P>
   Mix and match. That goes for dishes as well as guests. ``The
more diverse the mix, the better the party,'' says Wright.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to serving, she combines elegant serving pieces
such as platters with casual items like juice glasses _ the yin and
yang theory, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mix and match by course. For example, use Mexican mugs or
demitasse cups for sipping soups as a first course, majolica
(Italian ceramics) for salads or desserts and transfer ware for
dinner entrees. Wright buys lots of funky dishes, Mexican ware,
transfer ware and other serving pieces online at ebay.
</P>
<P>
   Crackers or bread sticks served in an old-fashioned challice
look great. Be imaginative and create new ways to use dishes and
containers. ``Serve with flair with a little irreverence thrown
in.'' You don't need to put on airs or be pretentious. You want
people to feel at home and comfortable when they eat.
</P>
<P>
   Get guests to help. Not only does it break the ice, but no
matter how well organized you are, a little assistance pouring wine
or passing appetizers is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Stay calm. Don't panic if something goes awry. Make the best of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the cocktail hour short.
</P>
<P>
   Less is more. Wright likes clean food and uncomplicated tastes.
Don't put garlic, basil, dill and oregano in everything. And don't
feel obligated to serve hors d'oeuvres.

<P>
   With the summer season at its peak, now is the perfect time for
alfresco dining. If you're looking for ways to entertain casually
but with flair, take some tips from interior designer Ellen Wright,
author of ``Bridgehampton Weekends, Easy Menus for Casual
Entertaining'' (William Morrow; $30).
</P>
<P>
   A hostess who enjoys her own parties, Wright transforms simple
seasonal fare into something creative and wonderful tasting like
Tomato Phyllo Pizza, Chicago Corn Pudding, Rosemary-Marinated Lamb
Chops With Apricot Chutney, Strawberry Shortcakes and more.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be put off by the book's title. ``The Bridgehampton
metaphor should not be limited to any area of the country or
world,'' emphasizes Wright. It simply refers to casual
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be in a ski cabin in Aspen, in a little shack on Lake
Michigan or in Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon or anywhere. The same
principles still apply.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you think it is intimidating _ or that the Hamptons are
fancy _ that couldn't be further from the truth. Wright has chosen
to do the book her way, which means casual and low-key.
</P>
<P>
   Her Bridgehampton house is a weekend and summer getaway where
she has been going for years to enjoy the beauty of the land,
beaches and sky, the ocean breezes and the charm of farm stands and
picket fences and vegetable and flower gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Easy, casual and stylish are her trademarks. But she is quick to
point out that she's not ``talking about egg crates and cinder
blocks. We're talking about doing things tastefully. I believe that
simple is better, casual is good and home-cooked is best.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright chose straight-forward, user-friendly recipes (some,
although not difficult, are more time consuming than others to
prepare) to include in this, her first volume. She wanted them to
be accessible and unintimidating and encourage people to cook more,
not less. Many of the recipes _ representing different countries _
have been passed down by relatives and friends while others have
been in her collection for years. You don't need professional
training to cook her recipes.
</P>
<P>
   When she designs a menu, she considers who is coming, what she
feels like eating (and the season) and how much time she has to
cook, all the while keeping it simple (her recurring theme).
</P>
<P>
   Wright opts for adding a little bit of panache and a few
different twists in the way she combines the menu to keep it and
the recipes from being trite or mundane. But in whatever she does
she wants people to feel welcome and taken care of. Success lies in
how all the parts come together, she stresses.
</P>
<P>
   The author's exposure to good cooking started at an early age
when she used to stand by her Russian grandmother, Bessie, in her
kitchen as she made special sweet rolls. The first cooking
demonstration she ever attended was a class on quiche by Julia
Child in 1961 in San Francisco. And she has been experimenting in
the kitchen ever since. ``I never had any fear of cooking _ I was
intuitive and brave in the kitchen,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   Wright wants people to entertain and enjoy it. She keeps hearing
that the 30-something crowd wants to have friends over but is
afraid to cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find people overdo things and don't know when to stop.
People stack the deck against themselves and make things
complicated. The idea is to be a success. If you choose a menu that
is doable, then you end up looking like the Queen of the May. When
you do things that are too difficult, you're tense and fail.
Everybody needs permission not to fuss.''
</P>
<P>
   For fun and a change of pace, Wright favors serving different
menu courses in different places in the house. For instance, try
cocktails on the terrace and dessert in the living room. ``It gives
guests the freedom to roam around and talk to people and not sit in
one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright opts for short flower arrangements as centerpieces _ no
more than 5 or 6 inches tall _ so you can see people across the
table. Avoid using flowers that have a pronounced fragrance as they
fight with the flavors of the food.
</P>
<P>
   Float flowers in small dishes and use votive candles to decorate
the table. Or try ceramic water pitchers in different sizes and
colors but with the same kinds of flowers as table decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Color themes, such as yellow and green, give a table a feeling
of cohesiveness. Often she picks flowers such as sunflowers from
the garden and floats them in a big flat Mexican dish and uses
yellow napkins and green plates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a theme and an idea going and one decision leads to the
next thing. In the wintertime I always have small earthenware pots
of violets around (with saucers) and use them as centerpieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Big bowls of either pine cones or lemons or shells on the table
are other inexpensive possibilities. You don't have to spend lots
of money.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she uses a Pierre Deux fabric tablecloth, a gingham
cloth or a quilt on the table while other times she simply opts for
placemats on her pine table.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up dishes, mats, napkins and decorations when you see them
at garage sales and store them away until you entertain.
</P>
<P>
   While Wright wants everything to look good _ visuals do matter_
``I do not want the food and setup to look `done.' Done is not my
style but subtle, understated and easy _ these are words that
describe my philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of creations selected from several different
menus in the book for summer festivities. &QL;

<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ It might as well be considered one giant
Road Hole.
</P>
<P>
   The famous strip of macadam on golf's most historic hole, the
17th at the Old Course, is little different from the rest of Old
Tom Morris' famous property.
</P>
<P>
   While the pre-tournament talk was how Tiger Woods' length will
allow him to overpower the Old Course with 350-yard drives and
knock-down wedges, it looks now as if Tida or Earl Woods could get
it out there about 250.
</P>
<P>
   The course is so firm and fast that it is going to play more
like the floor of the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the much anticipated British Open at St. Andrews,
the treasured Home of Golf. Woods, a 2-1 favorite, is going for a
career Grand Slam at 24, to join Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Gene
Sarazen and Ben Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Open Championship has gone from historical to
potentially hysterical. Somebody must have spiked the fertilizer
with cement: Players are on a search for wedges with less bounce to
slide more easily under the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Royal and Ancient Golf Club officials wanted to return tradition
to the British Open after last year's over-the-top setup at
Carnoustie. Instead of growing the rough so deep that errant drives
were nearly lost, this year they turned the Old Course into a place
where the greens are slower than the fairways.
</P>
<P>
   If the wind blows hard at any point of the week, John Daly's
drives could bounce halfway to Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted a true links test in the year 2000, and they
certainly have,'' Scot Colin Montgomerie said. ``If you did not
have the spikes on, you would slip down the first fairway. It is
incredible. . . . Length might not be the greatest asset that we've
all talked about. Everyone is going to hit it an awful long way
this week. This is as links a golf course as we will ever play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish weather conditions of the past two days have been
as kind as possible. Wednesday was downright balmy, near 70, with
hardly a breeze, allowing the course to bake ever harder. But it
could change by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Scores also could hinge on how harshly the flagsticks are
tucked. If not accessible, with the Old Course's dips and slopes
and giant putting surfaces, three-putts will be common. In the best
of conditions, the Old Course tests the chipping and putting
talents of the world's best players, many of whom are used to
playing target courses where the ball is flown to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hit it quite close to some of the greens (from the
tee),'' Scotland's Andrew Coltart said, ``but you cannot play
normal shots to the flag, because they spin and they will catch on
the large slopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience is paramount. Players hit to find distant spires or
to avoid mounds. In places, a dead-center 300-yard drive can be
less useful than a 210-yard iron, because of hidden pot bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who haven't played there might see a flag fluttering in
the distance and fire a wood straight at it without realizing there
is no fairway there, that it tends to be off to the left
somewhere,'' Coltart said. ``But the greens are so big and
difficult that you could hit every one in regulation and still
shoot 80.''

LAWSUIT SAYS NOT COVERING CONTRACEPTIVES IS DISCRIMINATORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (Eds: Inserts new 7th graf, Mike McMurray ..., to add comment from
company being sued.) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a case that could have broad impact on contraceptive coverage
nationwide, Planned Parenthood filed a class-action lawsuit
Wednesday charging that a company whose health insurance plan
covers most prescription drugs, but excludes contraceptives, is
illegally discriminating against its female employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sex discrimination when male employees get their basic
health care needs covered by insurance, but women are forced to pay
for their own,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   The case, brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, was
filed in federal court in Seattle on behalf of Jennifer Erickson, a
pharmacist at the Bartell Drug Co., and all other female employees
of the company, which operates 45 drugstores in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, who is 26, married and spends more than $300 a year
out of pocket on her own contraception, said she had become
increasingly troubled by the inequity as she had to tell women who
came to the store that their insurance would not pay for
contraceptive prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single day, I'm processing prescriptions and telling
women that their pills aren't covered,'' said Erickson, who has
worked at the drug chain for about 18 months. ``Sometimes, they
walk away from the counter and say they can't afford it. It really
makes you sad, and then you realize your own company doesn't cover
it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Erickson said, she wrote to the human resources
department asking that contraceptive coverage be added to the
company policy, and was told that it was not something the company
felt it should cover. She got a similar response, she said, when
she talked to her supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McMurray, Bartell's vice president for marketing, said the
company had worked hard to provide the health benefits its
employees consider most valuable. ``No medical benefits program
covers every possible cost,'' he said, going on to add that
Bartell, for example, does not pay for infertility drugs, Viagra or
cosmetic surgery. ``We strongly believe our program is a quality
program for all of our employees. Our program is lawful and
nondiscriminatory.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of contraceptive coverage has been a rallying point
for women's rights activists for several years _ especially since
many employers who do not pay for contraception moved quickly to
provide coverage for Viagra, which, at nearly $10 a pill, is used
to combat impotence.
</P>
<P>
   While almost all traditional indemnity insurance plans provide
coverage for some prescription drugs, only about half cover any of
the five contraceptive methods available by prescription _ oral
contraceptive pills, the intrauterine device, Depo Provera,
Norplant, and diaphragm _ all of them prescribed to women. And only
about a third cover the pill, which costs about a dollar a day.
Even among HMO's, which offer the most comprehensive coverage, only
39 percent cover all five methods, and 7 percent do not cover the
pill.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute found,
women of reproductive age typically spend 68 percent more on
out-of-pocket health care than men.
</P>
<P>
   In response to requests by Planned Parenthood of Western
Washington and other women's rights groups, the Microsoft Corp.
changed its insurance benefits to cover contraceptives, as have
Darigold and Swedish Hospital, two other local employers.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the question of gender equity in prescription drug
coverage has mostly been one for the legislatures. Since April
1998, 13 states have passed laws requiring that private insurance
plans that pay for prescription drugs must also include
contraceptive coverage: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,
Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, North
Carolina, Rhode Island and Vermont. Similar legislation is pending
in more than a dozen other states, including New York and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Equity in Prescription Contraceptive Coverage Act
has been stalled in Congress since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of taking the matter to court, as a form of sex
discrimination under Title VII, is not a new one. Indeed, a New
York University law professor, Sylvia Law, argued for that strategy
in a 1998 article in the Washington Law Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfectly clear that Title VII covers sex discrimination
in health coverage,'' Law said this week. ``The defendants may say
that they're not excluding contraception for women only, they're
excluding contraception for everyone, and it just happens that the
only prescription contraceptives available in this country are for
women. But there's such a disparate impact on women, 100 percent,
that I think there's a pretty persuasive argument for sex
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting from a legal strategy to a live plaintiff, however, took
some doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that it's hard to find a woman who wants to sue
her employer over contraceptive coverage, for all the obvious
reasons,'' said Eve Gartner, a lawyer for Planned Parenthood.
``It's not like suing when you've been fired.

   ``This is still untested water, but it could be an important
case,'' she added. ``Even though the verdict will only be legally
binding on this one employer, if we win, it puts everyone who
doesn't provide contraceptive coverage on notice that their
employees could sue.''

 &HT;    UPS package volume to reveal industry trend
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is United Parcel Service Corp. taking business away
from rivals FedEx and Airborne Express?
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say they'll be paying close attention to
package volume figures Thursday when UPS announces its
second-quarter earnings at 8 a.m. via its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for market share, they say, will be nearly as
important to them as financial performance. A survey of analysts
predicts the company will earn 60 cents a share for the three-month
period that ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the industry is focusing on package volume,''
said Art Hatfield, transportation analyst for Morgan Keegan &AMP; Co.
``The volume figures will tell us who's winning and who's losing
the market share game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield said UPS and FedEx have been gaining in recent months
at the expense of Airborne Express and the U.S. Postal Service.
FedEx outperformed Wall Street estimates in its most recent
quarter, while Airborne Express warned analysts its volume would be
flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overnight document business is dying,'' Hatfield said.
``Transportation companies need solid ground networks in order to
compete, and Airborne doesn't have one.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS, the world's largest transportation firm, delivers more than
13 million packages a day, and the vast majority of them travel on
trucks and vans _ not airplanes. UPS also operates an online
``document exchange'' designed to drastically reduce or even
eliminate the need for some premium-priced next-morning shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day is fast coming when it won't make sense for anyone to
fill up airplanes with pieces of paper in envelopes,'' said Norman
Black, a UPS spokesman in Atlanta. ``That gives us a leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Hatfield said fax machines and secure e-mail are cutting
into a core FedEx business, but the Memphis-based company has
responded by offering a broad range of air and ground deliveries
for high-value goods.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey L. Pittsburg, transportation analyst at Pittsburg
Institutional Services, said the UPS report also will be watched as
a gauge for business-to-consumer Internet sales. About 55 percent
of the consumer items bought and sold online travel via UPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS does a lot of business in the B-to-C arena,'' he said.
``The company is a good barometer of that whole side of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed Wednesday at
$60.75, up 31 cents.

A HANGING RECALLS THE HORROR OF THE PAST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raynard Johnson is dead. He was found hanging from a pecan tree
in his front yard in Kokomo, Miss. Maria and Jerry Johnson, his
mother and father, are certain he was killed because he dated white
women. I agree. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Acts of racial hatred still occur in the United States.
Authorities sometimes rule such deaths suicides; I prefer to call
them what they are: lynchings. They're no different from the
hangings that occurred during the Civil War and continue still. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was just 17 years old when his father found him hanged
June 15. The Rev. Jesse Jackson has said his death has ``the smell
of Emmett Till all around it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Till, a black Chicago teen, was lynched in 1955 after being
accused of whistling at a white woman while visiting relatives in
Mississippi. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five years have elapsed between the deaths of Till and
Johnson, and little seems to have changed. Black skin can still be
a death sentence in America, even more so when white women are in
the mix. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is not racism on my part. It is not raw emotion. I believe
it to be fact; it's a part of our history that is repeating
itself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gary Flowers, field secretary for the Rainbow Coalition, had
this to say about Raynard's death in a telephone interview: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the belt (around his neck) was not his,'' Flowers
said. ``We know that the climate of racial intolerance was reported
to be a stronghold for white supremacists groups such as skinheads
and the Klan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Raynard was in high spirits on that day. He had
just received a computer. He was preparing for a family reunion. He
was a rising senior named in Who's Who Among American Students _
the top 5 percent of students in the nation. He was starting on the
football team, and he was a very popular young man.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in what Flowers said that indicates Johnson was
a distraught teen-ager about to take his own life. Indeed, none of
the classic suicide warnings _ withdrawal from friends and family,
changes in eating and sleeping habits, drug and alcohol abuse _
were apparent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Raynard's full-of-life demeanor lead a reasonable person to
conclude that he would not take his own life,'' said Flowers,
speaking on behalf of the teen's family. ``Given the climate within
Marion County of racial intolerance, he was a victim of a
homicide.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Marion County coroner's office has said Johnson's death is
consistent with suicide because he had no marks or injuries on his
body. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just months before Johnson's death, Flowers said, a bridge
less than a quarter mile from the Johnson home had racist graffiti
on it. In addition, he said, that bridge is rumored to be a meeting
place for white supremacists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Coalition is offering a $10,000 award for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved
in Johnson's death. The group has a hot-line number, (601)
583-4943, Ext. 113. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in donating to the Raynard Johnson Memorial
Fund may write to: First Federal Bank, Box 268, Columbia, MS
39429. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flowers said that Jackson has asked the Justice Department to
pursue any and all leads and to broaden its investigation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope investigators will call Johnson's death what it is.
Murder. &QL;

&HT;     HISPANIC GROUPS LOBBY CONGRESS OVER HIGH-TECH WORK VISAS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The leaders of major Hispanic groups threatened
Wednesday to use their clout at the ballot box to pressure Congress
into including long-standing immigration issues in legislation
expanding the number of visas for skilled technology workers.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the special work permits, know as H1-B visas, for
computer programmers, electrical engineers and other high-tech
workers. Computer and software companies are pressing Congress to
raise the number of visas issued annually to fill jobs California's
Silicon Valley and other technology centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to bring up immigration legislation, you must
address the needs of the Latino community,'' said Cecilia Munoz,
vice president of the National Council of La Raza, one of the
nation's largest and most influential Hispanic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos are a very critical voting block,'' Munoz said. ``We
potentially hold the keys to the White House and to control of
Congress. Both parties need to step up to the plate and show they
are interested in our issues. The Latino community is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a Capitol Hill news conference, the Hispanic leaders
called for action on three ``Latino Fairness Issues,'' asking that
they be attached to legislation that would increase the numbers of
visas for high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   H1-B visas are capped at 115,000 this fiscal year, but all of
them were issued in the first six months. Under present law, the
ceiling will fall to 107,500 in the next fiscal year, starting Oct.
1, and 65,000 in fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least three bills before Congress that would raise
the ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the H1-B program enjoys high levels of support in
Congress, labor unions and many high-tech workers contend the
industry has used the visas to hold down wages and discriminate
against higher-paid American workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Latino groups said they would help muster support for the
stalled visa legislation only if three issues are attached to it.
They want Congress to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Change from 1972 to 1986 the date by which illegal immigrants
must prove they have lived continuously in the United States in
order to apply for permanent residency. That would apply to about
350,000 illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grant Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and Haitians the
same opportunity to apply for permanent residence as was extended
to Cubans and Nicaraguans in 1997. Nicaraguans and Cubans who apply
for green cards, or residency permits, get them immediately while
immigrants from these other countries may wait as long as 11 years
to have their applications processed. Congress granted a speedier
processing for Cubans and Nicaraguans after determining they were
exposed to violence and hardship if they returned to their home
countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow immigrants without green cards or visas who are
sponsored by family members or employers to apply for permanent
residence in the United States. Current law requires they complete
their applications at the U.S. Embassy in their home country.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the high-tech industry urged Congress not
to attach other immigration measures to legislation that would
boost the numbers of visas for foreign high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support a clean approach to this legislation and urge House
and Senate lawmakers to do likewise,'' said Harris N. Miller,
president of the Information Technology Association of America,
which represents Internet and computer software companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic-sponsored amendments related to long-staying
immigrants and Central American immigration have confused and
delayed this legislation long enough,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Mirabel, chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership
agenda, a coalition of 35 groups, said Hispanic groups would keep a
close eye on the positions representatives and senators take on
these key issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any legislative agenda that attempts to frame itself as
pro-immigrant and pro-Latino must address these issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabel noted that Vice President Al Gore has stated his support
for these issues, but that Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential hopeful, has not taken a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe both the candidates have the responsibility to urge
their colleagues to bring it forward,'' Mirabel said, referring to
the Hispanic legislative agenda. ``Bush can't stay quiet on this.
He's got to be on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential candidates are investing significant time and
money in courting Hispanic voters. Bush is trying to extend his
broad support among Texas Hispanics to the national arena.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabel said the Hispanic vote would be especially important in
California, Texas, New York, New Mexico, Florida, Arizona,
Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Sanchez, executive director of the Labor Council for Latin
American Advancement, which has 1.5 million members, urged the
high-tech industry to support Hispanic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without it, the Latino community will do everything it can to
see that H1-B bombs out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gonzalez, director of the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials, which has 5,000 members, said this
is a battle about Silicon Valley and new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about big money versus low-income communities,''
Gonzalez said.

 &HT;    4% gain by Genuine Parts hits target
 &HT;    By Peralte C. Paul
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Buoyed by strong sales across most of its divisions,
Atlanta-based Genuine Parts reported a 4 percent increase in
second-quarter earnings Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Net income in the quarter ended June 30 rose to $96.6 million,
or 55 cents a share, from $92.6 million, or 52 cents a share, a
year earlier. The results matched Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue increased 6 percent to $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company distributes automotive and industrial replacement
parts. It also supplies office products and manufactures electrical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Sales increased 10 percent in the office products group. They
rose 9 percent in the industrial parts group and 7 percent in the
electrical group.
</P>
<P>
   The auto parts group _ its largest segment _ grew 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Matthew T. Stover at Salomon Smith Barney said the soft
growth in the automotive parts division is indicative of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an industry standard, it was a tough quarter,'' said
Stover, explaining that car parts are better made, reducing the
frequency of replacing them.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine Parts officials said they expect that earnings for the
year will meet analysts' forecast of $2.27 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be pushing hard to improve the sales picture in the
automotive parts group,'' said Chairman Larry Prince. ``Secondly,
we will continue our efforts toward improving our overall operating
margins with specific emphasis on our recent acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   To increase auto parts sales, the company will push its
e-commerce site that was launched in March, and begin a national
advertising campaign, said Jerry W. Nix, executive vice president
of finance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is expected to
tell Congress today that the economy is slowing, but that inflation
persists as a threat. Analysts caution investors not to look for
anything that would ignite a Wall Street rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman is scheduled to make one of his twice-yearly
appearances before Congress to report on the economy and Fed
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's senior economist Rick MacDonald said he
expects Greenspan to deliver a ``less threatening'' forecast than
he did in February, when the numbers still showed robust economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times since
June 1999 in a move to restrain a growth rate it regards as
inflationary, especially in wages.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe the government's reports released since
May show enough economic slowing to make additional rate hikes less
likely _ with maybe one more to go at most.
</P>
<P>
   But MacDonald looks for Greenspan to reiterate a warning the Fed
issued after its June meeting. While acknowledging evidence of
slower growth, the Fed added that conditions still existed ``that
may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald also cautioned that ``the last thing Greenspan wants
to do is set off a stock market rally'' that might rekindle
consumer spending fueled by the market's ``wealth effect.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bloomberg News survey of economists also concluded that
Greenspan will leave the door open to further interest rate
increases this year while citing evidence the economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   In Wall Street action Wednesday, analysts said disappointed
investors dumped Internet stocks that failed to meet overly
optimistic expectations for the second quarter, sending all major
stock averages lower.
</P>
<P>
   The catalysts for the sell-off were quarterly results from two
bellwether stocks: software giant Microsoft, which fell $5.38 to
$73.135 after reporting stagnant second-quarter sales, and Apple
Computer, which fell $4.56 to $52.69 after it beat earnings
forecasts by only a penny.
</P>
<P>
   The falloff in blue-chip stocks came despite a positive earnings
report from Citigroup, the largest U.S. financial services company.
Citigroup said its profits rose 23 percent over the same period a
year ago, and its stock rose $1.31 to $68.
</P>
<P>
   The main economic news was a Commerce Department report that the
U.S. trade deficit jumped to a record $31 billion in May, mainly
due to America's trade imbalance with oil-producing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Total May imports of goods and services dipped 0.3 percent to
$116.8 billion, but exports fell even more sharply by 1 percent to
$85.7 billion.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since his post-punk band put out its first compact disc in
May, Ken Peterson, a guitar player and commercial dishwasher
salesman, has been spending a lot of time on the Internet. The
Lawrence, Kan., band, mi6, has never played outside of the Kansas
City area, and its self-financed CD is only available in local
stores.
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson, determined to attract a wider audience, also
released several of the new tracks for free on Web sites devoted to
music. He has e-mailed anyone who has ever expressed an interest in
mi6 and persuaded several on-line radio stations to give the band
airplay. So far, about two dozen people who otherwise would never
have heard of mi6 have bought the CD _ not bad, Peterson considers,
``for a no-name band.''
</P>
<P>
   But what really has him logging on lately is the rankings on
garageband.com, where one of mi6's songs has claimed the top spot
based on the reviews of visitors to the site. If it remains No. 1
after another round next week, the band stands to win a $250,000
record contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has been very cool for us,'' said Peterson,
adding that he has also been contacted by an executive at a major
record label who came across mi6 on another Web site. ``The thing
about our band is we just want to play. But a record contract _
yeah, that would be awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   As the recording industry and commercial artists like the heavy
metal band Metallica try to stamp out the distribution of
copyrighted music for free in the form of computer files known as
MP3s, tens of thousands of aspiring rock stars are happily using
the technology to give their music away _ and more than a few are
beginning to see some payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Most, of course, are not getting record deals from the major
labels. But for some bands, that may no longer be the ultimate
goal. For these musicians, the Internet's emerging role as an
equal-opportunity jukebox is providing new ways to make a modest
income from a relatively small base of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Ulike most of the MP3s available through popular services like
Napster, it is unquestionably legal to download, play and copy with
abandon those posted by unsigned artists on the growing cluster of
Web sites designed for them.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat to the surprise of the artists themselves _ and even to
the proprietors of these sites _ millions of Internet users are
doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a lot of days the downloads of unsigned artists are right
up there with the name acts in the music videos on our site,'' said
Andy Schuon, chief executive of Farmclub.com, a site owned by
Universal Records. ``And they're not necessarily even looking at
the ones we feature. People like to dig into the jukebox and type
in ``G'' and just see what's there.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com, the largest repository of free music on the Web, said
it receives more than half a million visitors who listen to more
than a million items each day. The company is perhaps best known
for its legal dispute with the record industry over adding
thousands of copyrighted songs to its database, a case that it is
in the process of settling. But its revenues are generated from
advertising sales based on visitors who come to hear almost
exclusively unsigned artists.
</P>
<P>
   Last November it began to pay all artists, signed or not, a
small fee each time someone listens to one of their songs. And
particularly since May, when the company expanded its monthly
``Payback for Playback'' pool to $1 million it has become a source
of significant revenue for those at the top of the MP3.com heap,
and an incentive for the 75,000 or so others to promote their
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been quite a victory for us after having a lot of record
companies close doors on us for years,'' said Chris Geith, a jazz
guitarist in Madison, Conn., whose Chris Geith Group last month
made more than $6,500 from MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those consistently ranking in MP3.com's top 10 said
they have little interest in a record deal. That may be just as
well, since it is hard to imagine a major label promoting them.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   They include Ernesto Cortazar, a 60-year-old Mexican composer
whose career was spent mostly in piano bars and who has earned more
than $100,000 from his online efforts since last fall, about
$80,000 from nearly 4 million downloads and the remainder from CD
sales; Mikel Fair, a 26-year-old engineer who quit his job at
Compaq Computer and built a home recording studio when he began
earning more than $20,000 a month from downloads of his electronic
music, and Alex Smith, who just graduated from high school in
Stillwater, Minn., and last month earned $10,239.08 from MP3.com's
program.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com, which says its program has safeguards against
ballot-stuffing, has yet to turn a profit, and Michael Robertson,
the company's chief executive, has made no assurances about the
continuation of the payment program. But other sites, such as the
Internet Underground Music Archive (iuma.com) and Audiohighway.com,
have also initiated compensation schemes for unsigned artists.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, few of the 100,000 or so unsigned artists on the
Internet participate in such revenue-sharing. Most say the main
benefit of distributing MP3s of their songs is the ability to
attract an audience that may eventually buy CDs or t-shirts or come
to a live performance.
</P>
<P>
   And the more experienced caution that none of that will happen
without logging plenty of hours on old-fashioned marketing, online
and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did was ask my father to reply to all his
e-mail,'' said Ernesto Cortazar Jr., who has taken as a full-time
job the promotion of his father's music on MP3.com. ``I am always
motivating him. The first time he appeared on the charts I printed
that paper, I showed it to him, I framed it. I was like, 'you're
going up!' ''
</P>
<P>
   After convincing his father to put his music on the Internet
last year, the younger Cortazar spent weeks scouring the MP3.com
message boards and picking up tips from other artists. He sends out
regular e-mail updates to a growing database of fans, asking in
each one that they tell a friend about the elder Cortazar's talent
for the piano. Since about half of Cortazar's CD sales come from
outside the United States, his son recruited fans to translate his
Web pages into Korean, Spanish, French, Slovenian, Romanian,
Portuguese, Hungarian, Greek, Italian and Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   The result has enabled both Cortazars to devote themselves
full-time to music.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Rubenstein of the Northern California band Headboard
credits the Internet with vastly expanding the band's reach.
Starting with an e-mail list of about 10,000 fans who had attended
gigs over the last three years, Rubenstein doubled the list over
the last year, which he has spent e-mailing fans of other bands
like his own and offering t-shirts to those who drove the most
traffic to his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts won the band a spot on Farmclub.com's television
show on the USA Network a few months ago. But more important,
Rubenstein said, after sending out an e-mail message informing fans
of a new CD, he received 200 checks for $12 in the mail last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The postmaster said there was too much mail to fit in the
box!'' crowed Rubenstein, who holds down a day job as an editor at
an Internet news site.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so enamored of the Internet as a means of
distributing or discovering new music. Traditional record
executives mostly see the Internet as another repository for the
demo discs that pile up unopened in their offices. And even bands
that use all the right Internet marketing tricks can fail to find a
way to get to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Red Delicious, a Pasadena, Calif., band, spent several months on
the top of MP3.com's charts last year. But several nibbles from
record labels fell through.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in the record industry you have a chance to make
money,'' said Rob King, the drummer for Red Delicious, estimating
that Internet revenues bring in only about $1,200 a month for the
band. ``We got tons of press. We were the Internet band, everyone
knew who we were, but none of it helped us get a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies are also beginning to forge new relationships
with labels and artists. Emboldened by the idea of being able to
obtain demographic information and e-mail addresses of thousands of
potential customers who have become fans of an artist on-line,
companies like Farmclub.com and Garageband.com have already signed
several bands to emerge from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major record labels are interested in artists that are
going to come out of the chute and sell millions of records,'' said
Tom Zito, chief executive of garageband.com. ``That is not really
music that people deep in their gut embrace. Our process really
allows people to find music that is more interesting to music
lovers than the kind of stuff that people who work at record
companies think they're going to like.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the global network has seemed to tap into a
near-universal desire to be a rock star, it appears to have
unleashed the latent record executive in many a music listener.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like with the radio once they get a hit song they
play it over and over and over until you get tired of it,'' said
Lisa Fields, 42, a property manager for an apartment complex in
Fitzgerald, Ga., who cites the unsigned Buzz Poets as her favorite
new band. ``Going on the Internet you can constantly get new music,
new sounds, new groups so you've got something new to listen to all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane J. Strait, an accountant in Harrisburg, Pa., explains his
hours on MP3.com and other Internet music sites another way: ``It's
always better to find bands when they're just forming,'' he said.
`That's when they care more about their fans.''

WEB INVESTOR COMPANY GARNERS $24.8 MILLION IN VENTURE FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three months after tabling its IPO plans, CCBN.com
Inc., a Web-based investor relations company, has landed $24.8
million in venture capital from some big Wall Street players.
</P>
<P>
   That's roughly half the $58 million CCBN.com had aimed to raise
in its initial public stock offering, filed in February but yanked
when stocks tanked in April. The company had already completed its
European road show when it canceled the stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting fabulous feedback, but it didn't matter what
you were selling at that time,'' said chief executive and founder
Jeffrey Parker _ best known for having launched First Call, the
well-known clearinghouse for analyst reports.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar saga for many start-ups lately: going back for
more venture money when the public markets are unwelcoming. Some
have been turned away.
</P>
<P>
   But CCBN.com in this third round tapped deep pockets, as is
expected to be announced Thursday. Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. leads the
deal and will become CCBN.com's biggest outside investor. Others in
the round include brokerage Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Boston's
HarbourVest Partners, Trident Capital, and America Online Inc.,
which also invested $1.5 million in December.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the three-year-old company had raised $11 million in
venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   CCBN.com builds and hosts investor relations Web sites to help
publicly traded companies handle communications with their
shareholders. It claims 1,500 customers for the service, including
FleetBoston Financial Corp., Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., and Akamai
Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   It also runs a site called streetevents.com, where institutions
and individuals can track the events that can affect a public
company's stock, from earnings releases to analyst calls and CEO
speaking engagements. CCBN.com helps investors hook into public
companies' conference calls at earnings time, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Parker sees the Internet as a disclosure tool, the best way to
deliver to individual investors the same information that Wall
Street gets about public companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're helping companies use the Internet to level the playing
field between institutional and retail investors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Taylor, a partner with HarbourVest, said the investments
from Goldman and Morgan are significant: ``The money means
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, 57, sold First Call and a group of other firms he
started to Boston's Thomson Financial Corp. in 1986. Thomson was
the first investor in CCBN.com.

 &HT;    Pilots at Delta regional subsidiaries seek merger with main
union
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The pilots' unions at Delta Air Lines' two regional
subsidiaries want to be merged into the parent carrier's pilots'
union, a change they say is needed to gain fair representation for
their members.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Air Line Pilots Association units at Comair and
Atlantic Southeast Airlines comes a little over a year after Delta
bought full ownership of the two regional carriers, which feed its
hubs in Cincinnati and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's pilots also are represented by ALPA. But the three
unions continue to operate as separate chapters of the national
union, with separate contracts and elected leaders. On certain
issues that affect pay and career advancement, the larger chapter
has more clout and can negotiate terms that hurt the smaller units,
merger advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a two-tier system within the Air Line Pilots
Association,'' said J.C. Lawson, chairman of the Comair ALPA
chapter. ``This is a very big issue and one the national union has
got to address.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comair and ASA unions on Wednesday petitioned ALPA's
national headquarters to merge the three units, which would entail
putting all pilots onto a single seniority list for pay and
promotion purposes. Details of how that would be done would come
later, but Lawson said it would likely raise pay rates for pilots
at the subsidiaries ``somewhat.''
</P>
<P>
   ALPA's national leadership council will consider the request at
a meeting in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Duncan, a spokesman for Delta's ALPA unit in Atlanta, said
the smaller unions ``didn't consult us'' before filing the
petition.
</P>
<P>
   Delta management views the petition as ``an internal union
matter,'' said John Kennedy, a Delta spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson said the mushrooming use of regional jets at the
subsidiaries has brought the issue to a boil. The Delta pilots'
union, like those at other major airlines, views regional jet use
as a form of ``outsourcing'' in which the parent airline uses
lower-paid subsidiary crews to fly routes once reserved for bigger
jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta union, which is in contract talks, has said it will
seek tighter limits on how many regional jets ASA and Comair can
operate. The smaller unions' petition argues that such limits
result in subsidiary pilots' careers being ``unilaterally and
egregiously restricted.''

MASS. COMPANY TO HELP BUILD WIRELESS NETWORK FOR AT&AMP;T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring Tide Networks of Maynard, Mass. has won a big chunk of a
$250 million contract from AT&AMP;T Wireless to build a nationwide
fixed-wireless broadband network delivering telephone service and
high-speed Internet access, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, with which Spring Tide has a lucrative
comarketing arrangement, won the deal to build out fixed-wireless
systems in 180 US markets over the next two years to help AT&AMP;T roll
out broadband and local calling services in areas where it does not
own cable television franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of privately held Spring Tide's share were not disclosed.
But based on a list price of $80,000 to $700,000 for its
Internet-protocol switching devices, based on how many features
they have, $50 million or more of the $250 million could be flowing
to the 2-year-old start-up.
</P>
<P>
   As it aims to become a nearly nationwide provider of local phone
service and Internet access, AT&AMP;T is looking to fixed wireless to
fill coverage holes where it has not obtained cable television
franchises as part of its $100 billion acquisition of MediaOne and
TCI.
</P>
<P>
   Already launched in Fort Worth, the fixed wireless service will
be added starting in September in Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego,
and Anchorage, AT&AMP;T said Wednesday. Areas with 15 million more
homes are to be added by 2002, but AT&AMP;T spokesman Richard Blasi
said it has not been determined whether any New England markets
will be eyed for fixed wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Tide is providing its IP Service Switch 5000 to
complement Lucent gear being used in the first phase of the service
rollout.
</P>
<P>
   With fixed wireless systems, homeowners attach a small dish-like
device to the side of their house aimed at a neighborhood antenna
to get telephone service and 516-KBS Internet access. That is about
12 times faster than a dial-up modem but only one-third as fast as
a cable modem. AT&AMP;T plans to boost the fixed-wireless Net access to
1 megabit by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Tide marketing vice president Bob Sullebarger said the
AT&AMP;T deal easily exceeds in value the company's three other
announced contracts, all with small competitive local phone
companies using Spring Tide gear to offer high-speed Internet
access such as digital subscriber line services. Spring Tide late
last year reached a deal with Lucent to sell its gear under a
cobranding arrangement, opening big markets for the start-up.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, AT&AMP;T stock fell $1.4375 to
$33.9375. Lucent rose $1.4375 to $64.50.

EMC CITES E-COMMERCE GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMC Corp. said second-quarter earnings vaulted 50 percent to
$429 million as orders from e-commerce companies helped the data
storage maker meet its ambitious growth targets.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Corp. faces a host of fresh challenges from competitors, but
keeps reporting strong results. Wednesday, the Hopkinton, Mass.
company said sales climbed 30 percent to $2.1 billion for the
quarter, marking the first time it has taken in more than $2
billion in a three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were driven by rising demand for its products from
companies such as American Family Insurance Group and State Street
Corp., which must keep track of vast amounts of data as they move
more business onto the Internet. As a result, EMC boosted revenue
targets for this year and said it is still on track to sell $12
billion worth of devices, software and services in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's software and services business lines have grown rapidly.
Software revenue nearly doubled to $350 million in the
April-to-June period, a faster growth rate than rivals such as
Veritas Software.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's primary business continues to be building
refrigerator-sized cabinets containing arrays of hundreds of
computer disk drives, and in recent months it has faced new threats
from competitors like IBM and Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   To counter them, EMC introduced new hardware in April, and its
gear has sold so briskly that even traditionally skeptical analysts
were left echoing the EMC line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find any fault with any part of the way they
executed in the quarter,'' said analyst Gary Helmig of the Wit
SoundView Group in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The company itself was clearly satisfied with its performance.
``This was our strongest quarter ever, marked by superior
execution,'' said EMC chief executive Michael Ruettgers.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's profit was 19 cents per diluted share, up from 13 cents a
year ago. The numbers were adjusted to reflect an EMC stock split
in May. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial had
expected EMC to earn 17 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   EMC shares sprinted up $5.4375 in New York Stock Exchange
trading Wednesday to close at $84. Shares have more than doubled in
the past year to give the company the highest market valuation of
any in Massachusetts, more than $170 billion based on Wednesday's
closing price.
</P>
<P>
   EMC also said sales rose 30 percent to $141 million during the
quarter for the midrange storage products it took on when it
acquired Data General Corp. last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its rapid growth, some industry watchers have
expressed concern that EMC might have trouble obtaining all the
parts it needs. In a conference call with reporters Wednesday,
Ruettgers acknowledged that might become an issue later this year.
Component shortages ``may keep us from accelerating the
acceleration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Employment growth is also a concern, as EMC tries to keep up
with orders. EMC had 20,700 people worldwide at the end of June,
1,900 more than at the end of March. In Massachusetts, it now has
7,600 employees, 400 more than three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite low unemployment rates, Ruettgers said the company faces
no talent shortage. ``The difficulty hasn't been candidate flow,''
he said. ``The challenge is to make them productive.''
</P>
<P>
   The supply and work force constraints mean EMC isn't likely to
exceed expectations in the third quarter, said Phil Rueppel,
analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. But Rueppel said EMC is
likely to meet its $12 billion goal next year.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Wednesday said it had boosted its overall revenue target for
this year to roughly $8.7 billion from $8.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   SoundView's Helmig said his main concern for EMC is the
competition. For instance, IBM and Compaq earlier this month
announced an agreement to jointly market their equipment.
</P>
<P>
   EMC executives, Helmig said, go ``out of their way to say
competition's not an issue, and it may not be now. But the users
are all rooting for competition to come along, if only to keep
prices under control.''

&HT;        PENNSYLVANIA CANDIDATE FUND RAISING HEATS UP
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Melissa Vogt  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (July 19)--Candidates for Pennsylvanian Congressional
seats are stepping up their fund-raising efforts as the November
election nears, according to campaign finance reports from the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Area incumbents held a definite fund-raising edge over their
challengers for the second quarter of this year - April 1 through
June 30. Federal law requires all campaigns that raised or spent
more than $5,000 to submit a finance report to the FEC by last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates without challengers seemed to raise money as if they
were in a hotly contested race.
</P>
<P>
   Running unchallenged, Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Altoona, led the pack
in fund raising and holding onto his cash. By the end of the
three-month period he raised $105,850 and had $221,613 in the bank.
Rep. John Peterson, R-State College, also without a challenger,
took in $55,015 and had $88,483 in cash for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Lancaster, second in fund-raising efforts and
liquidity drew in $56,094 and had $165,118 in cash on hand. Pitts'
challenger Bob Yorczyk of Exton, who started with empty pockets on
April 1, raised $747 and had $72 in the bank by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Harrisburg's Republican Rep. George Gekas raised the least among
the area's incumbents but continued to bring in more than his
Democratic opponent Leslye Herrmann. Gekas took in $9,851 during
the recent quarter, raising $54,634 since the year's start. He
spent $7,034 and had $87,941 on hand at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Gekas gave $2,925 to the Republican committees in Dauphin,
Lancaster and Cumberland counties in May. Other major expenditures
included $1,451 paid to campaign treasurer Raymond Bucks for
accounting and $1,129 for a petition party.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann spent $1,398 more than she raised during the second
quarter. Contributions to Herrmann's campaign totaled $2,314 for
the quarter and $6,875 since Jan. 1. She had $592 cash on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Goodling's retirement leaves open the 19th district
House seat, which covers Adams, York and Cumberland counties.
Contenders for the seat showed markedly different approaches and
goals for campaign fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic contender Jeff Sanders, a professor at Towson
University, Towson, Md., spends six to eight hours a day calling
possible donors, said his campaign finance director Jaime Fleet.
Fleet said the campaign is gaining momentum and he expects to meet
the $250,000 fund-raising goal by election time.
</P>
<P>
   Sander's campaign coffers swelled to $13,469, up $13,136 or 390
percent from the $333 in the bank on April 1. Of that sum, $7,740,
came from contributions and $7,567 in loans.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Todd Platts, R-York County, said he is keeping things
low-key with ham and cheese submarine sandwich sales each month and
a refusal to accept money from political action committees. He used
the same tactics to win and keep his state seat since 1992. Platts
said the strategy can work for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Platts won the five-way April primary race for his party's
nomination in spite of the fact he came in fourth in fund raising.
Sandwich sales brought in more than $5,000 during the primary
period, Platts said.
</P>
<P>
   Platts said he expects to raise $175,000 for the fall election.
For the first six months of the year Platts' campaign receipts
totaled $83,942. Platts brought in $22,729 during second quarter
2000 and had $6,174 in the bank. Platt said postage has been a
major expense.

DUMA BOOSTS PUTIN'S POWER OVER PROVINCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In what many called the biggest overhaul of Russia's
government since the fall of Communism, the Kremlin Wednesday
rammed legislation through parliament that stripped the country's
provincial leaders of much of the power and independence they had
won over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The new laws give President Vladimir V. Putin the right to fire
any governor accused of breaking the law. In addition, they take
away the governors' automatic membership in the Federation Council,
the upper house of parliament, and the blanket immunity from
prosecution that went with it.
</P>
<P>
   The upper house had rejected the bill allowing Putin to fire
governors, but the State Duma, the lower house, of parliament voted
363-35 to override the Federation Council's veto.
</P>
<P>
   By a veto-proof margin of 308 for and 88, the Duma also passed a
compromise version of a second bill depriving governors of their
seats in the Federation Council. The upper house must still approve
that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said the changes are necessary to fight corruption in the
far-flung provinces and establish what he calls a ``dictatorship of
law.'' But critics said the measures threaten Russia's shaky
democracy and could pave the way for a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal lawmaker Boris Nemtsov said granting the president the
right to remove elected governors ``goes against the will of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the first step toward an authoritarian regime,''
said Nemtsov in televised comments Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Few here dispute that many of the governors of Russia's 89
provinces have abused their power and run their regions like
personal fiefdoms. From St. Petersburg in the west to Vladivostok
in the far east, critics have accused them of stomping on civil
liberties, suppressing dissent, fixing elections, and enriching
themselves and their cronies at the public's expense.
</P>
<P>
   But the question that hung in the air Wednesday was: Will a more
powerful Kremlin solve the problem and bring good government to
Russia?
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts were skeptical, not least of all because most of
the accusations against regional leaders _ corruption, cronyism,
and creeping despotism _ have also been levelled against the
Kremlin as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bad choice between the centralized authoritarianism
of the Kremlin and the local authoritarianism of the governors,''
said Vladimir Pribylovsky, a Moscow-based political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, Putin can only remove governors accused of
committing a crime. But politicians and analysts pointed out that
Russia's federal prosecutors and courts are beholden to the
Kremlin, meaning Putin could easily use his new power to pressure
uncooperative regional leaders to get in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``A road has been opened wide for unbridled arbitrariness by
prosecutors,'' Nemtsov told reporters after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Some regional leaders said the changes could result in unrest.
``This poses a threat of the collapse of the Russian Federation,''
said Nikolai Fyodorov, governor of the Chuvashia region in central
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Business magnate Boris Berezovsky, who has bitterly attacked
Putin's proposals, formally resigned from the State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, to protest the expected vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of people already understand that the actions of the
authorities are absolutely dangerous for our society, brazen and
dangerous,'' Berezovsky said. ``We must try to stop them, hold them
in check.''
</P>
<P>
   Yury Korgonyuk, a political analyst with the Moscow-based INDEM
think tank, said the laws would do little to improve how Russia is
governed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just gives federal bureaucrats a weapon to pressure local
bureaucrats. None of the bureaucrats are under the control of
citizens, and nothing will change until they are,'' Korgonyuk said.
``In America you have the mentality toward bureaucrats that: `I am
a taxpayer, I pay your salary, you work for me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia you never hear this.''

DRIVE TO GO WET IN ONE KENTUCKY COUNTY HAS AN UNLIKELY SOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRY RIDGE, Ky. _ Almost seven decades after the end of
Prohibition, 75 of Kentucky's 120 counties remain dry by local
choice, but the pressures to go wet _ or ``moist,'' the new limited
imbibing option devised by frustrated state legislators _ are
mounting against the state's temperance leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The question of going wet will be back before voters on Tuesday
in dry Grant County, once rural but now rapidly suburbanizing.
Civic leaders have been wondering what mysterious force conducted
the discreet petition drive that put the issue on the ballot with
1,115 signatures, something of a local shock. Was it, as many
townspeople speculate, a cabal of business executives wary of being
denounced in this rigorously Christian bluegrass community?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it was just me,'' said Dara Florek, a 29-year-old native
of these rolling hills. ``I've done it all by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   An office worker impressed by the booming growth and arrival of
young people, Florek said she just decided it was time that the
options of modern life be fully faced in the county. ``I kind of
kept this hush-hush because I wanted to sneak up on the dry side,''
she said in an interview after being identified as the organizer of
the petition in the fine print of a pro-wet advertisement in the
weekly newspaper, The Grant County News. She collected 300 more
signatures than required.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot question of permitting the sale of alcoholic
beverages in Grant County is of no small moment, as only 30 of the
state's 120 counties have opted to go wet since Prohibition was
repealed in 1933. But the pro-dry ramparts recently appear to be
weakening, as indicated by close margins in various county votes.
Over the years, 15 other counties have evolved as mixed, or moist,
with the largest cities authorized to go their own way within dry
counties.
</P>
<P>
   But a new state law, quietly passed in the closing hours of this
year's Legislature, is designed to promulgate the ``moist'' option
down to small jurisdictions and might considerably liberalize life
in dry counties. The law permits even the smallest communities to
vote on whether to end the alcohol ban in local restaurants with
100 or more table settings, even if the surrounding county stays
dry. The House speaker, Larry Clark, said he moved the measure as a
relatively conservative response to complaints that various regions
were losing out in the competition for tourism and convention
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Progress can be a wild ride,'' said the Rev. David Tucker,
pastor of Sherman Baptist Church here and one of the leaders of
KIDS (Keep It Dry and Safe), the anti-wet coalition hurriedly
organized by local church and civic leaders when the ballot
petition surfaced last month. He denounced the ``moist'' law as an
end-run by the Legislature to foil what is one of the few important
direct-voice options still in county hands, one that he and other
pastors are urging their flocks to reaffirm on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a crossroads,'' Tucker said of Grant County's growth
rate, one of the state's highest. Grant's population has more than
doubled in the last decade to close to 25,000, with a flood of
newcomers from Lexington, 50 miles south, and Cincinnati, 35 miles
north. ``If we set the tone now for raising our children, we'll
grow into that community,'' he said, of the importance of setting
high standards.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, 35, insisted the issue was a modern one of family values
and nuisance-free neighborhoods, and not that of the old-fashioned
pulpit-thumping denunciation of drink that once resounded in the
area's hilltop churches.
</P>
<P>
   But Florek, flatly denying that she is fronting for any business
conglomerate, says the issue is one of convenience, not morality.
Florek started her petition drive before the new moist option took
effect on July 14. ``Why should I have to drive 20 miles out of my
way to Florence to buy a reasonably priced bottle of wine for
dinner guests?'' she asked, contending that the nearest liquor
stores in Kenton County, a wet oasis to the north, were not only
fueling Grant County's rate of drunk driving but price gouging as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Intent to the last, Florek worked this week on a
5-foot-by-8-foot sign calling for residents to vote on Tuesday. She
planned to put the sign up across from the local Wal-Mart. All the
while, she worried that with the birth of her first child four days
overdue, she might find herself bedridden and unable to vote
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of guts for her to do this,'' said her husband,
Jeff, describing a low-key, six-month, one-woman petition drive.
``And, no, we're not naming the baby `Jack Daniels' or anything
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   A raft of elected officials and local business leaders are
firmly opposed to going wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very safe livable county, with almost no crime
rate,'' said County Judge-Executive Darrell Link, predicting a dry
victory, although with perhaps a smaller margin than the last such
vote 15 years ago when wet forces were turned back by a 2-to-1
margin. Dry Ridge, he noted, is a name that predates Prohibition
and was coined in the days of early railroading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life here is slow, it's wholesome, it's safe,'' Link said,
emphasizing that this is a community of new housing developments
sprouting in old farm fields, not of glasses clinking in the sort
of new strip club that opponents point to in nearby Gallatin
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of put my head on the chopping block, but it's worth
it,'' declared Mrs. Florek, saying she simply grew fed up with the
inconvenience and political passivity on the subject. ``People talk
around here,'' she said, describing some rough and righteous
letters she said she had received after her name surfaced in the
newspaper advertisement that she said cost her $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for truth,'' read the headline on the advertisement,
which noted that drunken driving rates were higher in Grant County
than in three neighboring wet counties.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Mrs. Florek's stealth and industry, some voters will
go to the polls on Tuesday convinced that a larger wet force has
been at work in raising the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the business community is somehow behind this,'' said
the Rev. Willie Ailstock of the Dry Ridge Baptist Church. ``And in
a small town like this, nobody wants to be known as a
troublemaker.''

DOWNGRADING CUTS INTO BOSTON SCIENTIFIC TRADING PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Scientific Corp. shares fell 28 percent Wednesday after
nine Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock following the
company's lower-than-expected second-quarter sales and a gloomy
outlook for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Natick, Mass. medical device company saw its shares fall
$7.3125 _ its largest one-day drop _ to close at $18.5625 as more
than 11.7 million shares were traded.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Boston Scientific said its second-quarter sales
were down 4.3 percent, to $695 million, from $726 million a year
earlier. And while cost-cutting moves improved earnings, the
company warned that revenue in the second half of 2000 would be
about the same as last year, with lower earnings estimates due to
lackluster sales.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts cut their Boston Scientific stock rating to
``hold,'' while Merrill Lynch downgraded the company to
``accumulate'' Wednesday from ``buy'' just eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The lower rating is due, in part, to the increasing friction
between Boston Scientific and Medinol Ltd. of Tel Aviv, Israel, its
key supplier of advanced coronary and peripheral stents, noted
Daniel T. LeMaitre, first vice president at Merrill Lynch in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Surgical stents are tiny devices used to prop open once-clogged
arteries. Boston Scientific owns 25 percent of Medinol and
reportedly has been unsuccessful in trying to acquire the Israeli
company.
</P>
<P>
   LeMaitre and other analysts said the animosity between the two
companies is resulting in delays for product launches, which are
negatively impacting SCIMED and Meditech, Boston Scientific's two
largest divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its rival Guidant Inc. of Indianapolis, which makes its
own advanced coronary stents, Boston Scientific is dependent on
Medinol under a 10-year contract that requires buying hefty
inventories of stent products.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a disconnect in research and process engineering of
new stents between the two companies that is not turning around
very soon,'' said David A. Gruber, senior vice president of equity
research at Lehman Brothers. ``And that has put Boston Scientific
at a disadvantage with Guidant.''
</P>
<P>
   On a conference call with Wall Street analysts late Tuesday,
James Tobin, company president and chief executive, said the
relationship with Medinol has gone from bad to worse. Many
analysts, however, praised Tobin, who joined Boston Scientific last
year, for taking steps to improve the company's internal
efficiencies while struggling to iron out difficulties with
Medinol.
</P>
<P>
   Those proposed improvements include Friday's announcement that
Boston Scientific was dismissing 1,900 manufacturing people in
three states, including 850 in Watertown over the next 18 months.

&HT;     GOP PLATFORM CHAIR PLEDGES OPENNESSS TO PRO-CHOICE SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, who chairs the
Republican Platform Committee, assured GOP pro-choice advocates
Wednesday that their views will get a full airing next week when
the committee meets before the party's national convention begins.
</P>
<P>
   After a closed-door meeting that Thompson held with several
pro-choice groups, Susan Cullman, co-chair of the Republican
Pro-Choice Coalition, said, ``What was newsworthy to us is that we
continue to have a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the groups' efforts to have the strict anti-abortion
plank modified or removed altogether at earlier Republican National
Conventions, Cullman said, ``In 1996 and 1992, no one would return
our calls. So this is a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Thompson told the pro-choice advocates that
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, does
not want the plank changed and that it will be virtually impossible
for them to succeed in their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Stone, chair of the Republicans for Choice Political Action
Committee, which funnels campaign contributions to pro-choice
Republican candidates, said the meeting with Thompson ``went about
as well as could be expected.'' Stone said Thompson asked the
advocates ``to think creatively'' about how to get their message
across without throwing a wrench into the convention.
</P>
<P>
   With the convention opening July 31 in Philadelphia, the
abortion plank represents one of the few areas of debate among the
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 abortion plank does not allow for any exceptions _ such
as in cases of rape, incest or where the woman's life is at stake _
to its opposition to the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   It says, ``The unborn child has a fundamental individual right
to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life
amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make
clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of
that right against those who perform abortions. We oppose using
public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which
advocate it. We support the appointment of judges who respect
traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human
life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past Bush supported the rape, incest and
life-of-the-mother exceptions. He has declined to apply an abortion
litmus test to judicial appointments. But in an effort to win
backing of Republican conservatives during the primary season
earlier this year, Bush pointedly endorsed the 1996 plank's
language. ``This is a pro-life party,'' he said, adding, ``We need
to say, `Life is precious.'''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fear that an open squabble over the plank would hurt
the party in a year when its presidential candidate is strong in
the polls. But they also fear that an appearance of being
heavy-handed with pro-choice Republicans could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have a fair opportunity to try to get their
views expressed,'' said Kevin Keane, Thompson's spokesman. ``It
will be a fair playing field, but the governor was also up front
about strong support for the pro-life plank among delegates too.''
</P>
<P>
   The 107-member Republican Platform Committee meets in
Philadelphia next Friday and Saturday, and the four-day convention
opens two days later. The Platform Committee's Family and Community
Subcommittee will take up the abortion plank, which is likely to be
a carbon copy of the 1996 plank, a Republican National Committee
official said.

WEALTHY YACHTSMAN CHARGED IN DOMESTIC ASSAULT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT AND STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BARNSTABLE, Mass. _ Millionaire yachtsman William I. Koch is
facing criminal charges after he allegedly punched his wife in the
stomach and threatened to kill her and his son with a belt in their
luxurious Osterville home.
</P>
<P>
   Barnstable police were summoned to the sprawling estate in a
gated community around 11 p.m. Monday by Angela Koch, who told
arriving officers of her 60-year-old husband's attack, according to
police. She also told police that Koch threatened ``to beat his
whole family to death with his belt,'' Barnstable Deputy Police
Chief Michael J. Martin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Koch was arrested at the house. He has pleaded not guilty to
charges of domestic assault and battery, and threatening to kill,
and was released on personal recognizance.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Koch, 42, has obtained a restraining order against her
husband under which he must live in the estate's guest house or
beach house while she is in the main house and he cannot be at the
couple's West Palm Beach, Fla. house when she is there.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Koch, whose fortune has been estimated at $650
million, observed: ``Every marriage has its problems and my
marriage to Angela is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my wife and have every confidence that with the help of
competant professionals we will be able to work out our problems
and enjoy a long and happy marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela has been a wonderful wife and mother and has brought me
much happiness,'' said Koch, who won the 1992 America's Cup,
skippering America3 to a victory over Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Koch, who is Koch's second wife, could not be reached for
comment Wednesday. A Koch spokesman, Brad Goldstein, said Wednesday
that Angela Koch has not filed for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said the couple hopes the media will respect their
privacy and allow them to work through their problems quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Koch's vast wealth and history as a playboy -- which was
documented in a bitter legal fight with a former mistress in 1995
in a Boston courtroom -- has made his private life grist for the
media in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Koch has a total of four children from three women, including a
3-year-old son and one-year-old daughter with Angela Koch. Koch's
second oldest child lives with his mother, a former girlfriend of
the yachtsman, in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Koch's oldest child, Wyatt, is from his first marraige to Joan
Granlund. Wyatt is the inspiration for what neighbors here have
dubbed ``Wyatt's World'' -- an amusement-park-like section of the
estate with a paved go-cart track, tennis and basketball courts and
a soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barnstable court records, Koch threatened to kill
Angela and 14-year-old Wyatt during the domestic violence incident.
Goldstein said that neither Angela, Wyatt nor the other two
children required medical attention after Koch was removed by the
Barnstable police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Koch and Angela negotiated a detailed restraining order that
includes language that no part of the agreement can be the basis
for any subsequent divorce or custody action.
</P>
<P>
   One provision bans Koch from drinking alcohol for 24 hours
before he visits with his children, who will be accompanied by
their nannies at that time, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   The order, which is to remain in force until Sept. 11, requires
Koch to stay 100 yards away from Angela. But it also allows Koch to
attend social events or parties they host without Koch being found
in violation of the order, which carries a 2 1/2-year prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it allows the couple to attend therapy together
without violating the order and permits Koch to contact his wife by
telephone or letter. Usually, all forms of communication between
estranged couples are banned by restraining orders.
</P>
<P>
   During last week's Tall Ships events in Boston Koch was
frequently on local television offering commentary on the ships and
sailing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, Koch was probably best known in Boston for his
eviction of his former mistress, Catherine de Castelbajac, from a
$2.5 million condo he owned at the Four Seasons Hotel. The Boston
Housing Court trial featured steamy faxes the couple had exchanged
during their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Koch's arrest for domestic violence stunned Koch's friend,
George Regan, the Boston public relations executive, who said
Wednesday both Koch and Angela Koch are friends of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just really surprised,'' Regan said of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Regan said Koch was devoted to his family and that he showed
that as recently as Sunday when he brought his 2-year-old son to
Boston while he hosted a Tall Ships party and appeared at a
Metropolitan District Commission press event.
</P>
<P>
   Regan said Koch left in the late afternoon because he promised
to be home for dinner with Angela by 5 p.m. Sunday. Koch joked that
if he was late, ``he'd be in hot water.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch is a native of Kansas whose father struck it rich in the
oil business. Over the last decade, Koch has sued two of his
brothers who run the family corporation for a greater share of the
company in court in that state.

NUGENT SCRATCHED FROM CONCERT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``Stranglehold.'' ``Paralyzed.'' ``Homebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Choose your favorite Ted Nugent hit. It seems to describe the
rocker's prospects of opening for KISS at the Cynthia Woods
Mitchell Pavilion in The Woodlands on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Pace Entertainment released a statement saying the concert
promoter and Nugent's management both confirm that the Motor City
Madman will not be playing with KISS in the Houston area this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is the result of Nugent's onstage rant about an
English-language-only America when he played with KISS in Houston
in April.
</P>
<P>
   The decision has left Nugent fuming, the local League of United
Latin American Citizens feeling vindicated and Pace Entertainment
closing the books on the entire matter.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bob Roux, Pace Entertainment regional vice president
of SFX Music, said Nugent could play only if he agreed to sign a
conduct agreement attached to the concert contract. Nugent didn't
sign the agreement, but thought he would be able to play on the
bill just as he had at more than 90 other concerts with KISS since
March.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nugent concedes that is not going to happen. He also hinted
that his dismissal in Houston might not be the end of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It's the) land of the free, home of the brave, 'cept for
white guys, I guess,'' said Nugent in an e-mail to the Houston
Chronicle following the confirmation he would not be playing. ``The
lawyers are hammering as we speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Banker, Nugent's manager of 20 years, said that he had
never been presented with a ``sign to play'' agreement concerning
the Michigan-based rocker. He called the stipulation for Nugent
``unjust and an infringement on his First Amendment rights.'' He
declined to comment on any legal action that Nugent might consider
against Pace, but said Nugent is exploring his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of the fact that they are requiring us to sign (the
agreement), Ted will not play,'' Banker said Wednesday. ``Ted won't
compromise his values and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace Entertainment had no other comment on the matter beyond the
one-sentence statement announcing that Nugent would not be playing.
</P>
<P>
   That statement finished a ``will he or won't he play'' saga that
began June 30 when Pace announced that the KISS farewell tour would
be returning to the Houston area. The tour first passed through
Houston on April 1 with both Nugent and Skid Row opening.
</P>
<P>
   At that show, Nugent, dressed in a Confederate flag T-shirt,
said that people living in the United States should leave if they
don't learn English. He appeared to be addressing Mexicans in
particular by speaking a few words of Spanish, followed by his
thoughts about the ``abusive Mexican government.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks left Woodlands Pavilion officials vowing that Nugent
would never play the venue again and LULAC officials calling for a
boycott of his merchandise and tours. News that Nugent would not be
returning with KISS was met with relief and victory by local LULAC
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with the courageous action taken by The
Woodlands,'' says Johnny Mata, LULAC's District 18 director of
media and communications. ``It shows that a united community can
correct any wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the KISS-Nugent date in April, local LULAC districts
worked with the association's national leaders to organize a
boycott of Nugent's concerts and albums. LULAC is still upholding
that boycott.

CORRALING A HERD OF MUSICAL MAVERICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By RICHARD TARUSKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   SAN FRANCISCO _ The ironies were
thick on the ground. ``AT&AMP;T is the main corporate sponsor of
American Mavericks'' was the sign that hit your eye as you entered
Davies Symphony Hall last month. Then you picked up your program
and read an essay by Alan Rich, ``No Brands, No Labels, No
Boundaries,'' which did little but tack a brand label on the
favored elite and reinforce an implicit boundary that enraged
advocates of the unfavored many. Their postings clogged classical
cyberspace in the weeks leading up to the San Francisco Symphony's
American Mavericks festival and all through it. Everybody, it
seemed, wanted in to the vaunted pack of loners, the in-group of
outsiders, the icons of iconoclasm.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Tilson Thomas, the orchestra's music director and
gatekeeper, worked hard to invest the theme with coherence. He
carefully explained in a newspaper shortly before the festivities
commenced that Elliott Carter, while a ``significant figure'' and
``to be admired,'' was no American Maverick because he was
``Eurocentric'' and ``brainy.'' So was this to be a replay of
Philip Rahv's creaky old attempt to classify American writers as
redskins and palefaces, Walt Whitmans and Henry Jameses, with no
middle ground?
</P>
<P>
   Even John Adams, in a preconcert interview, invoked this stale
bisection, old before he was born, to justify his inclusion among
the mavericks. But Adams (tailed that evening by a PBS camera
crew), while a significant figure and to be admired, is by now the
very model of mainstream success, having earned his place in the
sun by taming the excesses of Minimalism, once a maverick style,
and reconciling it with traditional audience expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Who should turn up in the first program anyway? Milton Babbitt,
the very icon of tenured palefacery. Nor, despite Thomas'
anti-intellectual reassurances, did it turn out to be the Un-Carter
Festival. Ursula Oppens, here to apply her elbows to Henry Cowell's
Piano Concerto (pure-blooded redskin Schlockmaninoff, this),
sneaked four recent Carter pieces into a preconcert feature. Pale
they did seem. In the company he kept that night (Cage, Cowell,
David Del Tredici, Varese), Carter was definitely the odd man out.
In short, a maverick.
</P>
<P>
   Enough loophole-poking. There is more to be said _ seriously _
about the theme and about themes generally; but first some words of
thanks are in order. Never in my concertgoing experience had I
encountered such a catholic barrage of not-to-be-missed
programming: Charles Ives, Morton Feldman, Terry Riley, Carl
Ruggles, Ruth Crawford Seeger, Lukas Foss, Meredith Monk, Duke
Ellington, George Antheil, Lou Harrison, Steve Reich, Earle Brown,
Steven Mackey, Frank Zappa, Conlon Nancarrow and Aaron Copland, to
run down the remaining roster of Thomas' choices in order of first
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The performances had their ups and downs, but even the downs
were mostly good enough, while the ups were amazing. Big summer
audiences (40 percent Symphony subscribers and 27 percent
first-time attendees, according to the marketing department) lapped
it all up. The evening of June 9 will stay forever in my memory for
its sheer generosity. After Ruggles' ``Sun-Treader,'' Crawford
Seeger's Andante for string orchestra, Foss' ``Time Cycle'' and
three choruses from Monk's ``Atlas,'' Ives' Fourth Symphony was
still to come. After all that, hundreds of spectators stayed for
Thomas' postconcert discussion with Foss, Harrison and Monk.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the conductor's energetic largess his only, or even his
most conspicuous, virtue. His energy flagged noticeably, if
understandably, during the last week, which was largely given over
to an, alas, equivocal showcase for his Miami-based training
orchestra, the New World Symphony. With its fatigued maestro at the
helm it gave a dullish concert, ending with a downright disengaged
reading of Ives' Second Symphony that failed to solve, or even
seriously address, the work's notorious balance problems.
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere else the maestro shone. His technique and his
musical scrupulousness are simply beyond praise; in difficult music
he is all business, giving beats and cues of impeccable clarity.
Like Leonard Bernstein, with whom he is so often (and by now, I
believe, justly) compared, he has the gift of vivid shape. The
two-siren wail at the climax of Varese's ``Ameriques'' was so
expertly judged, and the rest of the performance so admirably paced
around it, that it became more than a moment of deafening
exuberance (though it was that, too). It fixed the whole piece, in
all its abounding detail, in a firm, indelible gestalt.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did the maestro seem to put himself before the music,
when he turned Terry Riley's venerable ``In C'' into a
public-relations stunt. Audience members were invited to bring
along their instruments and participate in the performance. The
predictable clambake was made worse when Thomas, in an effort to
keep everyone amused (or keep himself at the center of things),
usurped control over the proceedings, now hushing the parquet to
allow the sounds from the balcony through, now running around the
hall like Jerry Springer with a stick, to encourage (and comically
overconduct) the riffings of individual audience members. Could he
really have so misunderstood Riley's intentions? Or respected them
so little?
</P>
<P>
   A good time was had by all; but the composer, forewarned, had
stayed away. In the end the paying customers were cheated. Had they
heard a real performance of the piece, its magical impersonal
shimmer might have taken hold, and the improbable victory of the
``Minimalist revolution'' _ an avant-garde of harmonious
simplicity, neither redskinned nor palefaced, not yet
conventionalized for mainstream consumption _ might have been
illuminated.
</P>
<P>
   But if an occasional overreach, or a bit of pandering in the
press, is the price of the remarkable trust Thomas has built up
with his audience (and his management), I'm ready to forgive and
forget. His freedom to indulge his passionate predilections must be
the envy of his peers, and it has redounded enormously to the
benefit of the Bay Area's musical life. Put all the kvetching that
follows in the perspective of the overriding debt of gratitude one
owes for being given so much to think and yammer about.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to think and kvetch is of course the great value
_ and the great danger _ of thematic programming. Thomas
acknowledged what he saw as the danger on opening night, when he
confessed himself (or affected) to be ``taken aback'' at the
intensity with which the Mavericks idea _ just a marketing ploy,
after all _ was being debated, implying that we might do better if
we just sat back and listened.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Maestro. No can do. Welcome to the world of discourse (or
buzz, if you're not an academic). Nobody just sits back and
listens. Culture is baggage, and music cannot reach our ears except
through a field of interpretation. The difference between a
thematic program or festival and an ``ordinary'' concert is that an
explicit field of interpretation is being proposed, and we can no
more ignore it than we can follow the friendly alchemist's
sure-fire recipe for turning lead into gold.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   (Ready? Just melt it down and stir for three hours without
thinking of the word rhinoceros.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   This time the theme proposed was fraught with volatile issues
concerning American identity and the place of the arts in an
egalitarian society. The danger is not that thinking about such
things distracts our ears from pure sensuous or ``aesthetic''
engagement. Only Kant could ever be that ``disinterested,'' and
only on a good day. No, the danger is that once the thinking
starts, it cannot be contained. It leads where it will, if we're
mentally alive, and not always to the intended celebration.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Take that wonderful June 9 program. The opening was
breathtaking. The timpanist, bestriding the top of an implied
pyramid on a riser at the orchestra's rear, whacked out his
barbaric yawp at the beginning of Ruggles' ``Sun-Treader'' with
marvelously simulated abandon. Thomas pulled off his patented
trick: never had the piece emerged with such expressive force but
at the same time such lucidity of structure. Never, for all its
redskinned, bear-skinned Americanism, had its line of descent from
the majestic opening of Brahms' First Symphony been more robustly
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was, that very clarity of structure bred unease by
the time the piece was over. It is a sort of rondo organized around
three insistent returns of that opening tattoo. But by the fourth
time around, that insistence, reinforced by the spectacular
placement of the drummer, had become annoying. ``Oh, take it in the
woods with Robert Bly,'' came unbidden to my mind's lips. Yes, it
even crossed my mind that Brahms might belong there, too. It's
rather late in the day to be proclaiming one's Americanness, or
one's musicality, with defiant displays of machismo. Never had
Ruggles seemed so dated. Ditto Ives. Ditto Varese.
</P>
<P>
   The program notes were eloquent about the problems Crawford
Seeger had to endure in her day because of the American
modern-music world's misogyny, and about the impact of Babbittry
(George this time, not Milton) on her style. Her Andante, gentle by
comparison with ``Sun-Treader'' (as, in all fairness, is some of
Ruggles), strongly resembles Samuel Barber's nearly contemporaneous
Adagio for Strings. Both works are arrangements of slow movements
from string quartets, and both follow a trajectory (at once formal
and expressive) from a darkly plaintive low register to a plangent
high.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Crawford Seeger's piece was pervasively
``dissonated'' (to take a word from the vocabulary of Charles
Seeger, her husband and mentor) in obedience to the norms of
maverick manliness, while Barber, a male composer with a solid
conservatory education and good connections, was confident enough
to withstand the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   With Toscanini on his side, he didn't need maverick credentials;
academic credentials would do. But with the institutional victory
of academic modernism after World War II, the shoe went on the
other foot. Now it is Barber who stands in the cold, stigmatized as
weak, derivative, unoriginal, unadventurous, safe (all euphemisms,
of course, for ``sissy''). Thomas' show may not have been an
un-Carter festival, but it certainly was an un-Barber festival.
</P>
<P>
   It would be rash to assume that Crawford Seeger tailored her
style to macho expectations unwillingly. (I remember my mother
walking on air after a truck driver leaned out of his cab and
shouted, ``Lady, you drive just like a man.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the shortness of her career and the paucity of her output
raise questions about the stresses she faced. Pushed to one
extreme, she bounced (as radical conformists will) all the way to
the other, forsaking classical composition for folk-song arranging.
Meredith Monk's music, which avoids extremes and finds a place
somewhere between classical intricacy and imagined folklore,
answered Crawford Seeger's across the decades, hopefully suggesting
that now there is room for a feminine perspective in ``serious''
music _ or, even better, that gender perspectives may no longer be
all-ruling.
</P>
<P>
   What about Ruggles? Was he not warped as well by those gender
stresses? His works, too, were lamentably few, as were Varese's.
Since the publication of Ives' ``Memos'' in the 1970s, we've known
for a documented fact about the toll that male anxiety took on the
maverick of all mavericks. The artificiality with which a lot of
``ultramodern'' American music was spiked up _ sometimes, as in
Ives' well-known case, retroactively, when performances loomed _
may not have been just a response to an ``inevitable'' historical
process. It may also have been a response to a noxious
psychological pressure, one that such music, when uncritically
celebrated, might continue to exert on its listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas put the best face on it. At the postconcert symposium he
offered the suggestion that what makes Ives and Ruggles and
Crawford Seeger so ``wondrous'' (his favorite word) is that for
them dissonance was not ugly but ``affirmative.'' Yes, perhaps, but
just what did it affirm? A passage in Leta E. Miller and Fredric
Lieberman's excellent new biography of the latter-day maverick Lou
Harrison sheds some chilling light on the question.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison began his career as a votary of Ives and Ruggles; but,
as we heard in the late works of his that were played at the
festival, he made a conscious detour, amounting to a repudiation,
from the path of ``affirmative dissonance.'' His biographers
associate that swerve with ``a luncheon at Pennsylvania Station in
New York at which Ruggles blurted out antiblack and anti-Semitic
slurs at the top of his lungs'' to Harrison's acute discomfiture. I
for one am not prepared to assume that all the blurting at the top
of his lungs that fills Ruggles' ``Sun-Treader'' is unrelated to
the animus that appalled his friends, or that his magnificent
artistic creations have played no part in its propagation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas himself furnished a case in point, when he took an
especially blustery and embarrassing leaf from Ives' ``Memos'' to
lend at least some negative coherence to his festival theme. ``What
the mavericks did not do,'' he asserted in the program book, ``was
make nice little pieces to fit comfortably into the nice little
holes of traditional concert life.'' Doesn't he know that ``nice''
was Ives' code word for effeminate, and that it carried overtones
of both misogyny and homophobia? Didn't he feel any hesitation
before seconding Ives' and Ruggles' antiquated rhetoric of fear and
loathing, one that would in all likelihood have applied to Thomas
himself as it would to any Jewish or gay musician?
</P>
<P>
   Placing Harrison alongside his erstwhile mentors, like pitting
Monk against Crawford Seeger, tacitly put the maverick generations
in dialogue. That dialogue was most pointed on the touchy subject
of technology. The official Mavericks line, as put out in San
Francisco, hailed it with unbridled, naive optimism. Technology was
the otherwise improbable Milton Babbitt's ticket of admission to
maverickhood: he was represented by ``Philomel,'' a virtuoso aria
for soprano (sung by Lauren Flanigan _ into her music stand, alas)
with a taped accompaniment produced in 1964 on the room-filling RCA
Mark II Synthesizer, the techiest medium of its day, with a price
tag of $175,000 to prove it. (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Antheil would no doubt have claimed in rebuttal that although
the performance was powerful enough to overheat and disable two of
the Disklaviers, it still did not fulfill his intentions, since, as
Lehrman admitted, even with today's technology Antheil's prescribed
tempos remain out of reach. The ``charm of impossibilities,'' as
Messaien used to call it, still works its cheap magic. But as any
composer (any honest composer) will tell you, to be difficult is
the easiest thing in the world, and to be impossible takes no more
than insouciance. The devoted to-do over Antheil's hoary
charlatanry (though it brought us out in droves to hear it) was
depressing to behold.
</P>
<P>
   It was consistent, however, with the negative reception accorded
the one Mavericks offering that challenged the decrepit futurist
aesthetic. That was ``Hindenburg,'' the first act of ``Three
Tales,'' a documentary video opera in progress by Steve Reich and
Beryl Korot, which delivered an unsubtle but effective sermon on
technology gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The audience hated it. The postconcert discussion was a roast:
no bad thing in itself, in fact a refreshing contrast to the
perfunctory standing ovations most concerts nowadays elicit. But it
was mostly beside the point, as were the fulminations in The San
Francisco Chronicle a couple of days later concerning the wordless
third scene, a fantasy on the Nibelung motif from Wagner's ``Ring''
that accompanied scenes of zeppelin construction. Reich was accused
of drawing a ``causal link'' between Wagner and the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   He did no such thing. The subjugation of the Nibelungs was not
Wagner's doing, after all, but that of Alberich, the Jew capitalist
in Wagner's intended allegory. Reich's point was complicated and
ironic, and it was clear that he had touched a nerve. In so doing,
he earned the only reception that matched the vaunted maverick
legend of uncomprehending rejection.
</P>
<P>
   (But of course the ironies do not end there. They never end.
Shaking a stick at scientific hubris is not exactly the freshest
thing artists can do at the end of the 20th century, especially if
their critique of high technology is mediated by state-of-the-art
amplification and video equipment.)
</P>
<P>
   That one brush with controversy made the concluding Copland
program seem a bit tame and safe, especially to those of us who had
been tantalized by advance publicity promising a rare performance
of ``The Lonesome Train'' by Earl Robinson alongside Copland.
Trouble in obtaining performance material was officially cited as
the reason for the cancellation, as well as the unavailability, I
was told by the orchestra's publicist, of a ``name actor'' for the
narrator's part.
</P>
<P>
   When one recalled that the corny old cantata manages to put a
paraphrase of the concluding line of the ``Communist Manifesto'' in
Abraham Lincoln's mouth, it was hard to shake the suspicion that it
had been dropped for other reasons. Too bad if it was. Like it or
not, popular-front Communists (a category that included Copland)
were genuine political mavericks in America, and the very best
thing this festival could have accomplished would have been to get
some neo-conservative critics yelling. As it was, we had a
brilliantly guided museum tour, but we heard little evidence, Reich
apart, that any real maverick spirit survives in classical music
today.

CLINTON'S DILEMMA: HIS LEGACY VS. A GLOBAL ROLE
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID E. SANGER and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton was a president caught between two
summit meetings Wednesday, one in Camp David dealing with the
oldest and thorniest problems in diplomacy, the other in Japan
approaching the newest and vaguest issues of global inequity.
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East peace talks kept Clinton's attention overtime.
And for him, the meeting in Okinawa, in southern Japan, has less to
recommend itself _ save for the fact that he would be the star and
the issues, from bringing the Internet to developing nations to
funding a global battle against AIDS, resonate with the themes he
has tried to place on the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The other one half a world away on Okinawa, has less to
recommend itself _ save for the fact that Clinton would be the star
and the issues, from bringing the Internet to developing nations to
funding a global battle against AIDS, resonate with the themes he
has tried to place on the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
   With his concentration on Middle East diplomacy, Clinton has yet
to be briefed on his role at the meeting beginning Friday of
leaders of the world's seven largest industrial nations, and with
Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers preceded Clinton to Japan to
warm the president's seat and reassure the Japanese that he would
be there eventually. Traveling with him was the chief person
organizing the U.S. part in the talks, Lael Brainard, who was to
have briefed Clinton on Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we'll wing it,'' said one White House official. ``It won't
be the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meetings of the group are notoriously disjointed, but the agenda
for this session is particularly scattered. Leaders will discuss
the ``digital divide'' between those nations taking advantage of
the information revolution and those that are not; coordinated
approaches to the spread of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; and
even a U.S.-backed proposal to create an international school lunch
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say the issues are unimportant but they are a
laundry list and some of them don't meet my criteria for being the
top global concerns,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the
Institute for International Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, for example, the leaders promised to focus on
remaking the international financial system until safeguards were
in place to prevent another economic crisis like the one that
struck Asia in 1997, from radiating around world markets. But a
recovery shortened the group's collective memory, and while modest
progress has been made, one would have to dig far into the fine
print to find that discussion on this year's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the national security front, the summit meeting will grapple
with more traditional issues _ from terrorism and nonproliferation
to the turmoil in Africa, Chechnya and the Balkans. But those
conversations tend to be as scripted as the meeting's communique,
one reason Clinton appeared far less anxious to meet his fellow
leaders than to play out his role as potential Middle East
peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   That forced Clinton to postpone a one-on-one meeting with
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori in Tokyo, but it should be
noted that Mori's days are considered numbered because of his
party's poor showing in an election last month.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also skipped one of the unique aspects of this
meeting _ a gathering of the leaders of developing countries such
as Algeria, Nigeria, South Africa and Thailand, all of whom have
long complained that they are excluded from the elite club of large
economies. Summers will see them instead, but the smaller nations
are bound to view Clinton's no-show as a snub.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to arrive in time, however, for meetings with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and a session with Putin that is
expected to address Clinton's looming decision on a national
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, I'm sure, will want to take advantage of having
the leaders there to discuss the issues that are facing him and the
decision that he will be making in the coming weeks,'' said James
Steinberg, the deputy national security adviser. ``I think that he
will indicate that he is going to take into account the concerns
that have been addressed and all of the factors that we've
previously identified, the four basic variables of cost, threat,
technical feasibility and the impact on overall security.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's late arrival demonstrates how muc has changed since
he took his first steps on the stage of global diplomacy, also in
Japan. It was July 1993, and other world leaders took turns beating
up on Clinton for the size of the U.S. deficit and Washington's
failure to stabilize the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the U.S. economy reins supreme and Clinton
arrives as the indispensable peacemaker.

BRITAIN'S SHOPKEEPERS DRAG THEIR FEET ON METRIC CONVERSION 
</HEADLINE>
   bY SARAH LYALL  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTHERHAM, England _ Over the years, Keane Fletcher has
dutifully, if unenthusiastically, complied with every new directive
imposed on him by the European Union. A third-generation butcher,
he even agreed to take a course last year in which he was taught,
among other things, how to tell when food is not altogether fresh
(one suggested method: check the expiration date).
</P>
<P>
   But in March, when the local government threatened to seize his
late grandfather's antique porcelain scales because they violated
Europe's metric measurement requirements, Fletcher briefly forgot
that he was a serious-minded family man with his own business and
two sons to raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Make sure you send big men, because as sure as there
are eggs there on that counter, I'll break their jaws,''' recalled
Fletcher, 37, a onetime amateur boxer who keeps the old scales in
his shop, in a housing development in this gritty South Yorkshire
town, for sentimental reasons. ``I said, `You can put me on death
row, but I'm not removing those scales.'''
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that people like Fletcher, who weighs his meat
in pounds and ounces with an electronic scale, have not had ample
warning about the government's metrification program. Britain first
talked about going metric back in the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when it joined the Common Market, the European
Union's predecessor, Britain pledged to replace its old imperial
system, which uses pounds, yards, pints and the like, with the
Europe-wide metric system, based on grams, meters and liters.
</P>
<P>
   Britain duly converted, selling its gasoline in liters and, more
recently, its supermarket goods in grams. But small shopkeepers
like Fletcher remained exempt until Jan. 1 of this year. It was
then that new government regulations took effect, requiring every
seller of loose goods _ things like fruits, vegetables, carpets,
window shades, loose candy and meat _ to begin selling in metric
units.
</P>
<P>
   The point, of course, was to harmonize with the rest of the
European Union, a concept that is dear to the government of Prime
Minister Tony Blair. But a healthy percentage of the country's
96,000 or so small shopkeepers do not feel much like harmonizing,
especially not with the Germans and the French.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been through the war, you don't want French people
telling you what to do,'' said Muriel Kemp, 78, defiantly buying
half a pound of liver at Fletcher's shop. ``I think we're quite all
right on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to say exactly how many shopkeepers have
refused to go metric, but Donna Webb, a spokeswoman for the U.K.
Weighing Federation, which represents scale manufacturers,
estimates that some 30,000 small shopkeepers have not replaced or
converted their imperial-measurement scales.
</P>
<P>
   Webb lays much of the blame on what she called ``this little
problem we're having with the U.K. Independence Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party has three members in the European
Parliament, whose dedication to persuading Britain to leave the
European Union tends to leave them eating alone when everyone
breaks for lunch. But while they have had trouble engaging the
public's imagination in many cases _ it is hard to explain abstruse
European regulations to ordinary Britons and expect them to remain
alert _ they have had no such problem with the metric issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, the English have gone along with the European
stuff, allowing these kinds of idiocies to mount,'' said Tony
Bennett, who is running the party's anti-metrification campaign.
``Finally it's gotten to be too much.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Britain's populist, vehemently anti-Europe press has weighed in
too. The Sun, which uses the word Eurocrat the way others might use
the word Nazi, has started a ``Save Our Scales'' campaign in which
it is regularly features small shopkeepers who have run afoul of
the metrification program.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outshone, The Daily Mail, which has long enjoyed
printing articles about how the European Union is supposedly
forcing Britain to give up things like its traditional toilets (in
fact, the toilets are safe), has named its first ``metric martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   He is Steven Thoburn, a greengrocer who achieved a degree of
fame in the Southwick Market in Sunderland when local officials
came in and noisily confiscated his imperial scales.
</P>
<P>
   While Thoburn faces a $7,500 fine and the destruction of his
scales, in other parts of the country shopkeepers have gotten off
with warnings. The disparity reflects widespread confusion among
local governments, which are supposed to be enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a battle between central government and local
government,'' said Vivian Linacre, director of the British Weights
and Measures Association, which maintains that the British
metrification law is not legally binding. ``Brussels said to
Westminster, `This is the law _ now you've got to enforce it.'
Westminister said to the local government, `This is the law _ now
you've got to enforce it.'''
</P>
<P>
   All this puts the country's 2,500 Trading Standards officers in
an awkward position indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every sympathy with the government,'' said Alan
Charlesworth, chief executive of the Trading Standards Institute,
which helps the Trading Standards officers negotiate the
vicissitudes of their jobs. ``We're harmonizing with Europe and
we've been subject to a lot of directives, and we're doing our best
to comply. For people in the business profession to say that
metrication suddenly happened _ they must have been on another
planet or buried in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is perfectly understandable that his members do not
much want to go door to door threatening people with jail for the
crime of selling half a pound of jelly beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for the offices of various local authorities to get
involved in all that,'' Charlesworth said. ``But we've gone through
a process of education, and the next step of issuing warning
notices, and there comes a stage where you've got to say, OK, if
you're flouting the law, then you need to comply.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave Fletcher and his scales? He was willing to
go metric, Fletcher said _ he had even bought a new set of scales,
for $450 _ until the local government so insulted him that he
changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His customers like the old way too. ``If people want to sell in
pounds and ounces, why shouldn't they?'' said Chris Hartley, 32,
pointing out that Americans do not much want to use the metric
system either, no matter what their politicians say. ``It's not as
if it's an obscure system of weighing things.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An area of rain will brush southeastern New England as low
pressure moves south of Cape Cod. In the wake of the low, mostly
cloudy and cool conditions will linger over much of the Middle
Atlantic states. Farther north, sunshine and clouds will be mixed.
Despite the sun, afternoon temperatures will be several degrees
below average.
</P>
<P>
   Very hot and humid weather will linger over the South. A few
strong thunderstorms will erupt from the eastern Carolinas to the
eastern Gulf Coast, however most of the region will be dry with
ample sun.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of clouds and thundershowers will form in the central
Plains where sultry air is forced to rise over cooler air to the
north. Large hail and strong wind gusts will attend some storms in
Kansas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TWO-FACED JULY
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the temperature touched 100 degrees in Tuscaloosa,
Ala., for the 14th consecutive day as searing heat persists in the
South. Meanwhile, Green Bay, Wis., in the midst of a chilly month
across the Great Lakes and Northeast, set a record for its coolest
July afternoon as the mercury struggled to reach 58 degrees.
Mid-summer temperature trends are often influenced by the
longer-term rainfall patterns that precede them. Damp soil
conditions in the upper Middle West have helped to limit day
temperatures. In the South, the dry ground from recent drought has
been promoting additional heat.

EXPERIMENTAL BEAM EXCEEDS SPEED-OF-LIGHT, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The real world is starting to behave a lot like a science
fiction movie. Traveling much faster than light? No problem. Things
arriving before they depart? Happens all the time.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to fly in the face of one of the few real absolutes in
science, a principle discovered nearly a century ago by physicist
Albert Einstein: According to the theory of special relativity
nothing, absolutely nothing, can ever travel faster than the speed
of light.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report being published Thursday in the respected
scientific journal Nature, scientists at the NEC Research Institute
in Princeton, N.J. say they have succeeded in getting a brief pulse
of laser light to move 310 times as far in a given time as it would
have traveled at the normal, absolute speed of light in a vacuum _
the universe's absolute speed limit, or 186,000 miles per second.
</P>
<P>
   But that limit remains inviolable both for physical objects and
for information of any kind, said the principal researcher, Lijun
Wang. ``You cannot use this kind of phenomenon to send information
faster than the speed of light,'' he said. That would violate the
theory of special relativity, and Wang and his co-authors,
Alexander Kuzmich and Arthur Dogariu, insist that their experiment
does not involve any such violation.
</P>
<P>
   But the light pulse moved so fast, they said in their report,
that the pulse actually began to leave the experimental apparatus
before it went in. And while no object that has any mass at all can
ever exceed the speed of light, Wang said, some of the individual
photons (particles of light) in their experiment, which have no
mass at all, did actually travel faster than the speed of light,
while some moved more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peak of the pulse appears to leave the cell before
entering it,'' the authors wrote in their paper.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre experiment seems to recapitulate an old limerick:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a young lady named Bright
</P>
<P>
   Whose speed was far faster than light
</P>
<P>
   She set out one day
</P>
<P>
   In a relative way
</P>
<P>
   And returned home the previous night
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, the scientists insist, their experiment does not really
violate the principle of causality _ that is, that causes must come
before their effects, not vice versa. (In ordinary life, for
example, houseguests don't usually go out the door before they've
come in). Having a pulse of light leave before it arrives certainly
sounds like a violation of this fundamental rule, but the
researchers say it has to do with properties of light itself,
because of its wave nature, and that it could never apply to
physical objects.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the new experiments could someday have
practical implications for computers or electronics, but Wang said
it is too early to speculate on what such applications might be.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary accompanying the Nature paper, physicist Jon
Marangos of Imperial College, London, wrote that ``even if the
`effect' appears to precede the `cause', you still can't send
useful information _ such as news of an impending accident _ faster
than'' the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is related to one carried out last year at
Harvard University which produced the opposite effect, slowing down
a beam of light so much that it approximated a walking pace. Such
research is aimed at understanding fundamental principles of
physics whose potential practical applications are hard to predict.
Other research has shown movement of microwaves at slightly more
than the speed of light _ in one case, 7 percent faster _ but these
experiments also caused distortions in the shape of the pulses that
made them difficult to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   In the new research, pulses of laser light were sent through a
two-inch cell made of glass coated with paraffin, and containing
cesium gas. It was placed in a magnetic field, and then two laser
beams were trained on the cell. One of these sent pulses through
the gas, which were then recorded by photocells.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, at the speed of light through a vacuum, it should have
taken 0.2 nanoseconds (billionths of a second) for the light to
cross the cell, but the scientists measured the pulse as appearing
62 nanoseconds before it should have. That translates to the pulse
traveling 310 times farther than it should have if it was moving at
the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``This corresponds to the wavepacket leaving the cell 62
nanoseconds before it arrives,'' wrote Marangos, ``in other words,
traveling nearly 20 meters (60 feet) away from the cell before the
incoming pulse enters it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marangos hastens to add that ``although amazing, this type of
superluminal (faster than light) pulse propagation does not violate
the principle of causality.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it differently, there is still no way to travel at
``warp speed,'' _ at least, unless you are a pulse of laser light
in a small glass cell.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Brenda Winegardner has been having a nightmare that is
increasingly familiar to most consumers. In it she wanders between
reality and virtual reality, from voice mail to e-mail messages to
customer service counter, trying to get her computer fixed. But
it's not a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Winegardner, who operates a Web-based gift shop
and mail-order business from her home in Monte Rio, Calif., about
60 miles north of San Francisco, has been battling CompUSA's
customer service department because, she said, the Hewlett-Packard
personal computer she bought there regularly slows down, then
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hives from the stress,'' she said after a recent visit
to the store's real-world customer service counter, pointing to a
telltale splotch on her cheek. She has often lain awake until 3
a.m. The hours she has spent on hold, not just with the store, but
also with CompUSA's corporate headquarters and with
Hewlett-Packard, she said, are too numerous to count.
</P>
<P>
   When she does reach a human, she said, she encounters rudeness,
incompetence or plain indifference. It's the unpleasantly real
version of a well-known sketch from the 1970s British television
show, ``Monty Python's Flying Circus.'' In the skit, a man tries to
return a dead parrot to a pet store and encounters a clerk who
insists that the parrot is ``resting.''
</P>
<P>
   Winegardner has had to struggle to have her complaint heard, she
added, even though she sprang for CompUSA's $349.99 Premium Gold
Service when she bought the computer. The card guaranteed unlimited
access to technical support for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Winegardner's experience is far from unusual, and CompUSA is no
different from many other stores. Customer service that fails to
satisfy is increasingly common. As measured by the American
Customer Satisfaction Index, compiled at the University of
Michigan, customer-service satisfaction has dropped overall since
1994. U.S. consumers are more unhappy with the service they are
receiving for nearly every sector of the economy measured by the
index, including the computer industry, hotels, airlines, telephone
companies and automobile manufacturers. There are many causes, but
one that is widely recognized is technology itself. Phone systems
and Web sites that are supposed to help can turn into infuriating
mazes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rough time for customer service,'' said Bob Chatham,
a Forrester Research analyst who follows customer service.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, he said, may be a general decline in civility, but
he also pointed to technological advances in customer service, or
customer care, as it is known in industry parlance. For example, he
said, automated phone answering systems can send a caller into a
loop, provoking the same explosive anger usually reserved for
tailgaters, slowpokes and that idiot with the cell phone driving in
front of you.
</P>
<P>
   And the Web is often no help. For instance, Chatham said, ``I
got an auto-response e-mail once from AT&AMP;T Wireless that told me to
call the call center.'' ``It's a fascinating paradox,'' said Laurel
Pallock, an investigator who runs the complaint mediation program
in the San Francisco district attorney's office. ``Here we are in
this predicament because of technology, the very thing that is
supposed to keep us from being in this predicament.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Pallock was the host of a weekly television
program on consumers' issues. ``I've gone on the air and said, `You
guys who own these companies, why don't you listen to your own
customer service voice mail and see if you can get through to
yourselves?'''
</P>
<P>
   But even Pallock is not exempt from criticism. She was a guest
on a local radio show recently when a man called in to complain
about the automated phone system in Pallock's office. She
apologized on the air, agreed that the office's phone system was
``horrible,'' called him afterward to give him her direct line and
set about fixing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the phone rage what Chatham describes as still more
dysfunctional aspects of today's customer service systems. More
often than not, he said, customers' records on a company's Web
sites are not linked with those maintained for the agents working
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a self-inflicted phenomenon going on here. Companies
got all excited about this technology, so they put it up without
thinking about how it relates to everything else they do. Once they
opened that Pandora's box, it launched this whole litany of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is another, less technical, explanation for the
decline in service. Chatham cited the overall labor shortage, which
has forced companies to hire less qualified workers for what are
already low-paying, largely thankless jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you look forward to coming to work if you had to spend
the day talking to irate customers?'' he asked.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result, turnover on customer service desks runs as high as
100 percent per year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One author has even suggested that dissatisfaction has to do
with customers' experiences with good service. Dr. Leonard Berry, a
professor of marketing at Texas A&AMP;M University and author of
``Discovering the Soul of Service'' (Free Press, 1999), agreed that
service was not good. ``I give service in America a C minus,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Berry added, people's expectations for
service are rising. ``We want better service even though we think
we'll get worse service,'' he said. ``And part of the reason is
because we have experienced excellent service enough to know that
it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the explanation, there seems to be no dispute about the
reality of the decline. Complaints to the Better Business Bureau
have risen sharply in recent years, said Ron Berry (no relation to
Leonard Berry), senior vice president of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus in Arlington, Va. Even so, Berry added, only a
small percentage of disgruntled customers actually file formal
complaints to bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Barany, an educational consultant in New York, is a
conspicuous exception. In March, she bought a Sony VAIO notebook
computer at Data Vision, a computer retailer in Manhattan, but she
was unable to get the computer to work properly. After several
rounds of phone calls and repeated trips to the store, she sent off
a raft of letters and copies to the Better Business Bureau, Sony,
The New York Times, Data Vision and American Express, whose card
she used to pay for the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last month, Data Vision allowed Barany to exchange her
computer for a less expensive IBM Thinkpad. The difference in price
was issued as a store credit.
</P>
<P>
   But Barany is unhappy with the store credit. She wants a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Every dispute has at least two sides. Jim Garson, a vice
president of Data Vision, said that there was nothing wrong with
Barany's laptop and that all it needed was a software patch for the
internal modem. He said that he had offered to install the software
for her but that she had declined. By allowing her to trade for the
newer computer, he said, he took a loss on the old one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take back a notebook three months later, especially
when there's nothing wrong with it,'' he said. ``How much more
customer service can you give?''
</P>
<P>
   Garson said many of the complaints against his store were
unfounded. One customer called Garson to say she had bought an
Olympus camera a year ago and seldom used it, so she wanted to
return it, he said. ``I said: `Ma'am, there's nothing I can do. Try
to sell it on eBay.''' She complained to the Better Business
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers do not feel satisfied unless they make themselves
heard. Julie Kennedy, a corporate lawyer in San Francisco, is a
customer service maven if ever there was one.
</P>
<P>
   On the phone, she always presses ``0'' immediately to reach a
human. She shops only in stores that will give refunds, and she has
no qualms about firing off a letter if she is dissatisfied. ``I
think there's a social contract that goes beyond courtesy,''
Kennedy said. ``You pay someone money and you expect to be valued.
It ticks me off when I find people so oblivious to that
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy also makes a point of sending a letter when she
stumbles upon excellent service.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Kennedy called United Airlines to reserve a
flight to Ireland, using her free miles. Dodging the thicket of
blackout dates made the task look formidable until she found an
agent as interested in making the trip work as she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying everything,'' she said. ``I was on the phone
with him for over two hours. He tried every date, every time, and I
got to use my free tickets.'' She sent a letter of praise to the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   Another consumer who keeps careful watch over the service he
gets is Jim Hobby. He has a professional interest in the subject as
well: he is vice president of customer client care at Gateway and
has spent 25 years in the customer service business, including time
at American Express and Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids call me the client from hell,'' he said. ``They say
when they're out with me and I get this look, they run, because
they know someone is going to get my lecture on what customer
service should be.''
</P>
<P>
   What customer service should be, he said, is a collection of
thoughtfully placed ``pleases'' and ``thank yous,'' combined with
careful listening. These are known as soft skills. ``It's showing
that you care and you want to work with the customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Service via live chat is growing in popularity, Hobby said, and
so is the use of e-mail for such interactions. Gateway has also
simplified its automated phone system in response to what Hobby
described as a great deal of customer frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining is getting easier in some places. Many companies
that emphasize customer service, like American Express, now let
customers dispute charges on line.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau has seen a rise in the number of
online complaints it gets. And a growing number of sites dedicated
to filing gripes are cropping up online.
</P>
<P>
   One such site, called uGetHeard.com, allows consumers to send
both gripes and praise. Complaints are followed by efforts by
uGetHeard.com to resolve the disputes. The average resolution is
small _ around $50 _ but the gratification for the customer is
beyond measure, said Michael Chen, the site's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said he was inspired to set up the site after a
particularly unpleasant experience he had last spring at a private
mailing center in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he went to mail
a package. After paying, he grew nervous when he saw that no one
was wrapping the package, so he decided to do it himself.
</P>
<P>
   But when an employee demanded that he pay for the sealing tape
he was using, he protested. After a while the manager emerged from
the back. ``She said: `You're really irritating. We're too busy to
deal with you,''' Chen recalled. ``I've never been spoken to like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all the impetus he needed.

 &HT;    EDS: FIXES ROSANNA ARQUETTE
 &HT;    Hit-man comedy wholly satisfying a `The Whole Nine Yards' from
Willis
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a comedy with a body count and familiar mafia premise, but
with enough twists to overcome its familiarity. Bruce Willis stars
as a hit man who moves next door, incognito, to henpecked dentist
Matthew Perry. As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' Willis doesn't seem to
mind playing genial straight man to his cast mates: Perry, Rosanna
Arquette and Kevin Pollack. The movie's high point is Amanda Peet's
giddy performance as a dental technician who wants to make a very
unusual career change.

   &QR;  ``Angela's Ashes'' (R) _ A finely made adaptation of Frank
McCourt's popular memoir of growing up poor in Ireland that's
almost too stately for its own good. Fans of the book will enjoy
seeing their favorite parts re-created onscreen. Others, who don't
have the memory of McCourt's lyrical prose whispering in their

   &QR;  ``Ride With the Devil'' (R) _ Worth the ride. Ang Lee's
fervent, oddly gallant film about the fringes of the Civil War may
be too scattered for some. Like the skirmishes between the
pro-South Bushwackers and the pro-North Jayhawkers, the movie is
random, sprawling and piecemeal, with Quantrill's Raid on Lawrence,
Kan., providing the blood-soaked centerpiece and moral fulcrum. But
others may find it a sublime contemplation on the warring factions
of the American nature _ settling scores vs. settling down. Grade:

<P>
   &QR;  ``The War Zone'' (R) _ Actor-turned-director Tim Roth has
created the most Bergman-esque movie since the great Ingmar Bergman
stopped making movies. On the desolate coast of Devon, a seemingly
normal family is beset by secrets and lies that lead to total
breakdown. The teen son (Freddie Cunliffe) suspects his father (Ray
Winstone) is having sex with his older sister (Lara Belmont). A
brutal, challenging film that asks you to take a risky journey.
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Ninth Gate'' (R) _ This major disappointment from Roman
Polanski stars Johnny Depp in a tale of old books, the devil and a
gateway to satanic powers. Imagine one of those seasonal Halloween
horror houses, but designed by librarians. And what do you get at
the end of the trek? The spectacle of a bunch of rich twits in
black robes, play-acting a satanic mass. Grade: D +
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``What Planet Are You From'' (R) _ It's ``I Married a Stand-Up
From Outer Space.'' A strangely desperate and unfunny comedy about
a galactically equipped alien and his mission to breed with Earth
women. Poor Annette Bening plays one of the women; Garry Shandling,
who also co-wrote and produced this mess, is the R-rated
extraterrestrial. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _Stephen Whitty, Newhouse News Service
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Big Tease'' (R) _ A slight bit of silliness about a
Glasgow hairdresser (Craig Ferguson) who thinks he's been invited
to compete in a stylist competition held in L.A. Ferguson is
pleasant enough, and there's good work by Frances Fisher, Mary
McCormack and David Rasche as L.A. types. But for the most part,
the satire is tepid, and the movie more often than not takes the
low-comedy road. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rosetta'' (R) _ When the grim teenage heroine gets thrown
into a muddy pond in this Belgian flick, you'll want to cheer.
Teenage Emilie Dequenne won the top acting award at Cannes for her
deeply annoying performance as a teenager who will do anything it
takes to get a job and get away from her trailer-park life. It's a
slice-of-life flick that mistakes gloom for artistry. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Isn't She Great'' (R) _ Isn't great. Or even good. Bette
Midler plays ``Valley of the Dolls'' author Jacqueline Susann, but
the movie is neither biography nor burlesque. It can't decide if
its main character is great, or a gargoyle. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Diamonds'' (PG-13) _ Kirk Douglas plays an aging boxer and
stroke survivor who convinces his estranged son (Dan Aykroyd) and
loving grandson to drive to Reno, where he stashed some diamonds 60
years ago. The bonding road trip is excruciating, and a visit to a
brothel (run by Lauren Bacall) is almost unwatchable. But then
there's Douglas, game, courageous and still with a legend's sheen.

AS THE WAIT LENGTHENS, JERUSALEM MULLS THE POSSIBILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a city heavy with possibility and buzzing with
apprehension, Israelis and Palestinians waited for word from Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   After eight days of talks, both sides were left to wonder if an
historic agreement was imminent, or if the two sides would
ultimately fail to bridge their differences, particularly on the
status of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout a long day of waiting, analysts and insiders on
both sides seemed to believe that even if the summit were to fall
short of producing a final agreement, or even a framework for one,
there had nevertheless been an important shift in the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have refused to compromise on its position that
Jerusalem is the ``eternal and indivisible capital'' of the Jewish
state. Reports here said Israeli leaders were willing to grant
Palestinian president Yasser Arafat administrative control over
East Jerusalem, but not full sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have insisted that under the UN Security
Council resolution 242, East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which
were captured by Israel from Jordan during the 1967 Six Day War,
must be turned over to them. They maintain that they would accept
nothing short of full Israeli withdrawal and full Palestinian
sovereignty over the area.
</P>
<P>
   Both Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak know they face
stiff political opposition at home if they abandon these positions,
analysts said, making it quite possible the talks would end without
any resolution of the Jerusalem question despite President
Clinton's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But even if that happens, said Menachem Klein, a senior
researcher for the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies and part
of a team that helped brief the negotiators who accompanied Barak
at the talks, ``What happened over these days is very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak raised the issue of Jerusalem and the sky did not fall
down. That should not be forgotten,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man on the street is talking about details'' of how to
resolve the future of Jerusalem, said Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, director of
the Palestinian Academic Society of the Study of International
Affairs. ``That never happened before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street _ Palestinian and Israeli _ is being prepared for
the possible'' on an issue that until now had been impossible even
to discuss, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties put their cards on the table,'' said Abdul-Hadi.
``Everything is in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the talks, Barak kept his positions on Jerusalem a
tightly held secret even as his government virtually collapsed on
the night of his departure for Camp David with the resignation of
right wing and religious parties in his coalition. saying they
opposed to concessions he might make.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said Barak, a former general known for isolating
information and making decisions without building consensus, ``did
not even allow his ministers to prepare for the possibility on
Jerusalem because he feared there could be a leak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept it as a secret until the last minute, and he wanted
that the details only be discussed in a summit,'' said Klein.
``This was a groundbreaking move he made.''

 &HT;    All work, no play? Rec rooms cure workday blues
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _If Dan Dykstra plans on climbing the ladder at his
company, he'll need to brush up on his office skills.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old mechanical engineer at Radiant Systems, a
technology company, Dykstra isn't sweating about his career: He's
already turned down job offers at bigger, better-known firms,
including Ford Motors.
</P>
<P>
   But Dykstra's pingpong game? That's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   His lackluster serve and choppy backhand have kept him from
ascending the pecking order known as ``the ladder,'' which ranks
the skill level of employees competing in intraoffice tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   So this week, smack-dab in the middle of a workday, Dykstra and
two co-workers spent 15 minutes whacking the ball across the table
in Radiant's downstairs rec room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may look like it, but we're not lollygagging,'' Dykstra
said. ``Sometimes you just have to come down here and forget what
you're doing at your desk. If you're working too hard it becomes
monotonous and you lose interest. Taking a break keeps you fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   And what a break room this is. Besides housing a pingpong table,
it has a tournament-quality dartboard, a '50s-style cafeteria, with
vinyl LPs hanging on the walls and a sprawling fitness center with
a bank of color TVs, that stays open 24 hours a day. And, hidden
behind a sliding panel where Dykstra and his buddies were playing,
is an open space for Radiant's in-house rock band to practice and
perform for employees.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Rec rooms like this are becoming the rage among Internet and
other high-tech firms scrambling to attract young employees for
whom work and play aren't separate worlds. Many of these techies
have grown up with computers, toggling between work and play with
the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms have another purpose as well: Companies are trying to
gain a competitive edge by creating office homes _ places where
employees are encouraged to spend more time with their co-workers,
socializing but also conducting business.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Dave-and-Buster-ization of the workplace. Like
Radiant, companies are investing in arcade games, Foosball tables,
interactive computer games, gas grills, wet bars, Frisbees and
other distractions aimed at keeping their employees entertained _
and productive.
</P>
<P>
   During a post-lunch workout, Radiant executive Carlyle Taylor
was polishing off a set of leg presses in the company's weight
room. ``You never know what's going to drive the next creative
business idea,'' he said. ``Sometimes you hear people in here
talking about business while they're lifting free weights. That's
what we want to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At eTour.com, a personal Web-search service in downtown Atlanta,
employees are still unpacking boxes after moving into their new
offices in Peachtree Center.
</P>
<P>
   Even before they arrived, company executives opened the brightly
colored rec room with a tabletop shuffleboard, two pool tables,
arcade-style games, a tropical aquarium and models of vintage prop
planes hanging from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to our Romper Room,'' said Clare Gordon, a company
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Geltzer, an eTour employee, considers rec rooms a welcome
departure from company-sponsored picnics and softball games
traditionally used to create a sense of camaraderie and loyalty
among employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man in the gray-flannel suit, that's just not who we
are,'' said Geltzer, 29, who works in marketing. ``In this
industry, people are more communal. You can talk about a project
just as much over a Foosball table as you can over a conference
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Geltzer's co-worker Mallory Roth said she got burned out working
in traditional workplaces, ``the world of pantyhose and business
suits'' where employees are judged by how much time they spend in
their cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so unhappy working in stuffy environments, I could never
go back,'' said Roth, 26. ``To be more effective at your job, you
need to play at your job. People expect that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Howe, chief marketing officer at eTour, said in addition to
the rec room, he has earmarked $1,000 of his department's monthly
budget to increase what he called ``the fun and craziness
quotient.'' The marketing staff will decide how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Not all high-tech companies in metro Atlanta are joining the
rec-room boom.
</P>
<P>
   At Hallman Interactive Productions, a Internet-based marketing
and Web-site design firm in Poncey-Highland, the company founder
and CEO isn't a sockless, 30-something Gen-Xer who grew up playing
Quake.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Hallman is 56, graying and wears bifocals. He worries that
some tech companies are going overboard with extravagant
recreational facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no goal to hire a physical-fitness instructor,''
Hallman said. ``As soon as the Internet economy is not hot anymore,
those kinds of perks are going to be the first things to go, and
people will be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Hallman is an all-work-and-no-play kind of
boss. He realizes to attract the workers he wants, he's got to keep
things loose.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting atop a digital scanner is a pump-action Nerf gun. A
closer look reveals that there's at least one toy weapon on
everyone's desk. Some Hallman employees have as many as three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill bought these for us,'' said Rob Mathea, a Web designer
</P>
<P>
   A yellow dart with a sucker attached whizzed past Mathea and
landed on a wall near a co-worker's head. Retaliation was
immediate, and suddenly the narrow office was filled with a volley
of foam projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our business it's more important to make sure having fun is
part of our personality and culture,'' said Hallman. ``You don't
need rec room to do that.''

passed a $1.3 billion aid package for Colombia, but many wonder if
the money will be too
</P>
<P>
   little too late to save a country beset by violence, civil war
and a powerful leftist guerrilla army. Some critics fear the U.S.
is stepping into a Vietnam-style quagmire by sending military
advisors and sleek new helicopters to help battle Colombia's drug
lords, who along with Marxist guerrillas control vast areas in the
countryside. Meanwhile, Colombian President Andres Pastrana is
battling plummeting public support, a deep recession, icy relations

   BRUNSWICK _ BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ When Kendra McCrae stormed into the
Brunswick city manager's office recently and demanded an audience,
it was another sign of the continuing unrest in the coastal city
that has spawned violence, marches and calls for change. McCrae, a
28-year-old secretary, was upset over mistreatment she says she and
other blacks received at the hands of police during a July 4th
altercation. That holiday weekend confrontation, which eventually
turned violent, led to a subsequent protest march on Monday (July
17) with others planned. It has also revealed a wider set of
grievances. A loose coalition of residents and ministers is now
calling for sensitivity training for police, a community-wide forum
to discuss racial differences and better economic opportunities for
the city's black population. We examine the continuing evolution of
a city in transition. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   GROWING PAINS FOR THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Eds: The following two stories, about growing pains for the
Internet in a period of rapid worldwide growth, are suitable for
twinning or use as a series.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-HARDWARE _ WASHINGTON _ Even as the Internet is hailed
for expanding the horizons of millions of users and energizing the
world economy, there's concern it could become the victim of its
own success. Rapid growth of sites and users poses the very real
nightmare that this massive online structure,
</P>
<P>
   representing a $650 billion investment, could come crashing down
in gigantic cyber-traffic jams. (Glass, Cox News Service)

<P>
   INTERNET-SOFTWARE _ WASHINGTON _ WWW.any-site.com. To American
ears, this familiar pattern identifies a World Wide Web site on the
Internet. The system seems simple and settled, but a global battle
is being waged this summer over how addresses will be assigned to
keep pace with rapid Internet growth. The
</P>
<P>
   stakes are enormous. If plans to establish private control over
the Internet's address system founders on technical details and
political disputes, the global
</P>
<P>
   expansion of the online community could become gridlocked. But
if it succeeds, Americans will have to get used to having the
Internet governed by an international body that may be located in
Switzerland (Geewax, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-TAKEN _ Pity the late-arriving entrepreneur who decides

<P>
   VOTERS-SUBURBMOMS _ DATELINE TK _ Four years ago, ``soccer
moms'' gained almost mythical stature as the coveted voting bloc
that would reelect President Clinton or give Republican Bob Dole a
fighting chance. In a close presidential race in 2000 between Al
Gore and George W. Bush, the women's vote is all-important, but
</P>
<P>
   more difficult to define and to attract. So far, polls are
showing that more men are strong supporters of their choice, where
women tend to be more flexible _undecideds or soft supporters of
Gore or Bush. In addition to the gender gap, there is a
particularly large ``marriage'' gap. Clinton led Dole among married
women 53% to 43% in 1996; Gore trails Bush 42 percent to 50
percent. (Holmes, Cox News Service)

   COXNET FOCUS 0722: CHINA CONNECTION _ Once a ``poor, backwards,
uneducated'' speck in the Henan province of China, in the words of
one local official, Sangpo is now a wired outpost. Its 4,800
residents boast private cars, cellular phones, about 100 personal
computers and a bustling Internet cafe. In 20 years, the village
has grown a sheepskin backyard business into a multi-million dollar
niche market. It now processes 5 million sheepskins a year, almost
half of China's total sheepskin imports. Technology has helped fuel
the growth. (Chao, Cox Washington Bureau). Art includes a 4-column

manufacturing industry, particularly two local companies _ Atlantic
Envelope Co. and World Envelope Manufacturing Inc. _ is responding
to the Internet its impact on their bottom lines since consumers
and businesses are moving toward paperless transactions. While the
need for envelopes won't be going away entirely, manufacturers say
they will have to adapt _ i.e., make the envolpes they produce more
technology inclusive as way of remaining competitive. Even the U.S.
Post Office is jumping on the Internet bandwagon, pushing its own
bill paying service and other web-based initiatives to stave off
possible revunue losses from this medium. (Atlanta

   DAYTRADING _ Day trading is still apparently pulling them in in
Atlanta. No stats on trading are available, but six firms are doing
business in the city. The state of Georgia continues its
investigation of the industry, which has been hit with a number of
complaints by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
regulatory arm of the National Association of Securities Dealers.

we'll provide strategies for working with them in the days ahead.

   UPSAIR _ A subsidiary of UPS is testing a new technology that,
proponents say, can drastically reduce or even eliminate mid-air
and runway collisions. The experimental system known as ADS-B (for
Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast) also promises to
unclog aerial gridlock by allowing planes to safely fly closer
together and takeoff and land at shorter intervals. UPS will begin
equipping its own planes with ADS-B this year, and others including
FedEx, Airborne and DHL are likely to follow by the end of 2002
when all cargo planes will be required to carry collision avoidance
equipment. (Hirschman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   SYDNEY _Sydney _ In going from Georgia to Australia, then, the
Olympics have gone from one British penal experiment to another.
This odd kinship of outcasts dawned on me as I was sitting at a
cafe beside Sydney Cove, the aquamarine inlet that sets off the
heart of the city like a jade pendant. Ferry boats were churning
through the whitecaps of crisscrossing wakes. On one side of the
cove, the Opera House roof loomed like the upturned prows of a
dozen giant rowboats. On the other side, blue Australian flags
streamed in the breeze atop the long steel arch of the Harbour
Bridge. It's hard to imagine now, but this postcard spot was where
the First Fleet landed in 1788 with a thousand convicts and
sailors. Ten thousand miles from home, they struggled and almost
starved yet somehow managed to transform their bitter exile into a
city and nation that will soon command the world's attention.

   FAT-SOUTHERNERS _We know that America overall has a weight
problem - by some measures, 50 percent of the population is at
least somewhat overweight. But what's the Southern piece of that
pie? According to a new AJC poll, Southerners are more likely than
people elsewhere in the US to admit to being ``moderately or
seriously'' overweight - even though they set the bar for what
constitutes ``overweight'' higher than residents of other states
do, and given even more latitude to men than they do to women. At
the same time, though, Southerners are more willing to blame their
own bad habits for their weight problems. Includes interviews with
poll respondents and Southern sociologists. With charts, possible
photos. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CAR-TECH _Video games, DVD players and even the PC are moving
out of the home and onto the road, which has made owning a simple
CD or cassette player for your set of wheels last century's news.
Luxuries usually strewn about the family room are becoming popular
gadgets in cars and in roomy SUVs. Ever since Oldsmobile introduced
a videocassette player for its minivans in 1998, car-stereo
enthusiasts have been adding more dazzle to audio systems with the
addition of video. And the automotive world is jumping the
bandwagon; every major manufacturer now offers video in the car.

ARCHITECTURE'S CLAIM ON THE FUTURE: THE BLOB 
</HEADLINE>
 BIENNALE-$ADV23-3TAKES(TRIMS)NYT  
 (Attn: Japan, Austria, Finland, Germany)   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Darwin is in the air. Mark C.
Taylor, a theology professor at Williams College who writes
frequently on architecture, brought this to my attention earlier
this year. I was saying I wanted a break from my Freudian-Marxian
routine. Taylor leaned closer. ``Darwin,'' he said, sounding like a
doctor prescribing a pill.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Adam Phillips, whose DNA strands should be studied by
medical science for the key to higher intelligence, has come out
with ``Darwin's Worms'' (Free Press), a book about the parallels
between Darwin's thinking and Freud's. Add the popularity of
``Survivor,'' top it with the mapping of the human genome, and you
have something more than hula-hoops. You have survival of the
fittest hula-hoops. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology is rapidly changing the environment for
architects as well as for businesses and nations. How are they
adapting to it? In what form will architecture survive?
</P>
<P>
   The Venice Biennale's Seventh International Architecture
Exhibition, which opened last month and runs through Oct. 29, is
right in step with these evolutionary times. It features the latest
strain to emerge in architecture in recent years: ``blob'' design,
so-called, produced with the aid of computer animation software.
Biomorphic and invertebrate, with seldom a trace of the T-squares
most architects long ago abandoned, blobs look like things you
would expect to see rising from an electronic version of the
primordial ooze. As if to signal the origin of a species,
previously lurking in the depths of the Lagoon, the Biennale rounds
up blob projects by Greg Lynn, Lars Spuybroek, Ben van Berkel and
Caroline Bos, Jesse Reiser and Uneko Umamoto, Hani Rashid and Lise
Ann Couture, and other pixel prodigies. Lynn, in particular, was
ubiquitous. It was trilobytes, trilobytes, everywhere you turned.
</P>
<P>
   Venice is an ideal setting for examining architecture in
Darwinian terms. The city is a pageant of survival and adaptation,
of triumphant resistance to climate, conquest and time. Even in
Ruskin's day, Venice was an inhabited skeleton. The city's economic
and military power had mutated into a pink and gray romance. Its
more recent rebirth as a center of art and tourism prefigured the
transformation now taking place in cities throughout the
post-industrial world.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture, too, has lately come to resemble the inhabited
shell of an extinct beast. Architects are heirs to the heroic
tradition of pyramids, temples and cathedrals. Yet many of the most
talented among them are lucky if they are hired to design a loft.
There has never been more building in the world, nor a lower ratio
of architecture to junk. Architects now are day-trippers in their
own domain.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Biennale should lift their spirits. Usually, this
event is the poor, abject cousin of the Art Biennale, the glitzy
career fest with which it alternates. This year feels different.
The European press turned out. The cameras and notepads seemed to
confirm architecture's increasing prominence on the cultural map.
Compared with the Art Biennale, it remains an event where ideas
matter more than dollars. It appears that in the year 2000, a
certain cachet has attached itself to ideas. People may be
awakening to the fact that it takes ideas, as well as money, for
great cities to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Roman architect Massimiliano Fuksas, this
year's Biennale is called ``The City: Less Esthetics, More
Ethics.'' New Yorkers may find it hard to get behind this
proposition. Unless theme park lampposts are your idea of frisky
urban design, it will probably not occur to you that New York is
suffering from aesthetic overload. Fortunately, the show
contradicts its theme at every turn. Congestion, pollution, urban
decay, homelessness, even xenophobia and racial intolerance _
social conscience here gets the high art treatment. Welcome to
Italy, where every fashion editor carries a Marxist membership card
in her Prada purse.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics are wearing bright colors this season. That's the fashion
message at the Italian pavilion, the main attraction in the village
of national pavilions laid out in the Giardini, the city's public
gardens. Visitors enter through a gantlet of monitors displaying
famous talking-head architects shot against vivid pink, orange,
green and blue electronic backgrounds. The heads look so aged
against the pop-up video colors. They must be addressing issues of
great ethical import. Never mind. The volume is too low to hear
them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the Arsenale, the ancient naval yard where Venice
launched the ships that patrolled her maritime empire, there
stretches an immense video wall, two stories high and several
football fields long, representing la Citta. To a snappy
soundtrack, streaming video images hurtle by _ scenes from the
global metropolis projected by cameras stationed in two dozen
cities. Crowds wait at Asian intersections to cross streets bathed
in neon. Trains whoosh past shantytowns. Night falls over a
nameless skyline. Waves crash. Desert dunes billow. Heaven knows
how these natural features got into the city. The idea must be that
the city is getting into them.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Venice with a question in mind. There are now two
generations of architects below the age of 50. Are they developing
new forms of practice?
</P>
<P>
   Ours is not an era when the government, private patrons,
professional organizations or the press can provide architects with
cultural connective tissue or unite them behind common causes. In
the cities, our most talented architects are spinning freely within
professional vacuums of their own devising. Their ethic is that of
shipwrecks: every office for itself. No wonder architects have been
so ineffectual in confronting the pressures of global urbanization.
To reckon with the monoculture, the shape of practices will have to
change more radically than the shape of buildings. Flexible working
relationships must be built across geographic and corporate
borders. At least, I see no other way out of the present moral
impasse.
</P>
<P>
   The national pavilions are signposts pointed in the wrong
direction. It feels so dated, in the era of mass tourism, the
Internet and the EEC, to wander through this display. Fortunately,
nationalism is not a major problem afflicting architecture today.
Jet lag is a bigger issue. Architects spend as much time on planes
as State Department envoys. Their far-flung projects are agents of
cross-cultural fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   This idea was evident throughout the Biennale, but nowhere more
clearly than in the Austrian Pavilion, of all places. Organized by
Hans Hollein, the presentation focused on Vienna but highlighted
recent work by non-Austrian architects, including Zaha Hadid, Greg
Lynn, Peter Cook and Colin Fournier. An elegant installation in
dove gray, white and black, the exhibition included a large map of
project sites. The map conveyed the message that cities can foster
solidarity among architects, not only in matters of style, but also
in resistance to stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   The message was clearly aimed at the nationalists among us. It
was even more explicit in a separate gallery, an ``Area of
Tolerance,'' that presented architect-designed agitprop posters
attacking Austria's Jorg Haider and his anti-immigration policies.
But the main part of the show offered a more lasting polemic. With
graceful understatement, it suggested that city lovers are an
embattled species. We have more in common with one another than
with the rest of our respective nations. The ethical fiber that
binds us is the cosmopolitan belief that the function of a city is
to refuse everything less than the best.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Hollein has contributed a project of his own design.
``Dencity'' is a floating raft that holds a contemplative garden
inspired by Ryoanji, Kyoto's celebrated temple garden of rock and
sand. East and West, war and peace, water and land: these
surrealist juxtapositions compose a haunting meditation on the
architect's role in a shrinking globe.

<P>
   The German show is shocking. The exhibition focuses on Berlin,
logical for the first Biennale held since the government returned
there. The theme is the capital's transformation over the last
catastrophic century. One gallery displays huge black and white
street maps that track the city's development at 10-year intervals.
In the second gallery, we segue smoothly from moral neutrality to
moral equivalency. The wall is hung with photographs of Berlin
landmarks as they are transformed or destroyed, by wars hot and
cold. Captions are limited to name, address and year. This
presentation confuses chronology with history. The result is that
history is brutalized.
</P>
<P>
   If I hadn't known that Arata Isozaki was the Japan Pavilion's
commissioner, I would have thought the project on view there was
the handiwork of Madame Butterfly's marriage broker. Titled ``City
of Girls,'' the project was organized by Kazuko Koike and designed
by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa. The theme is gender.
Specifically, it presents the Japanese adolescent female as a model
of sensibility for the 21st-century city. The architects see her as
a figure not yet fully indoctrinated by cultural tradition. Her
response to beauty and ugliness is visceral.
</P>
<P>
   To Western eyes, the display looks as dubious as it sounds. The
entire pavilion, and a large swath of the garden around it, has
been whitewashed, including the trunks of trees. The floor, on
several levels, is lined with white gravel. It is noisy and hard to
walk on. A square of gravel is planted with rows of tiny plastic
daisies. Very cute. A second square has been excised from the
floor, creating a well you can peer into. People walk around down
there beneath a cantilevered section of the building. Ahh. From the
ceiling hangs an overcoat, titled ``Mother,'' designed by Kosuke
Tsumura for homeless women. Oh! Oh!
</P>
<P>
   But this work does not fit neatly into Western grids of
comprehension. I enjoyed the mixture of sentimentality and
sophistication, but felt that I was missing a lot, as you do when
you travel to any foreign city. In the era of monocultural
familiarity, that sense of strangeness is not only to be savored
but also to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite work is a perfectly straightforward rendition of the
Biennale's theme. Designed by two young Finnish architects, it is a
small floating park set within the cargo hold of a rusting freight
barge. Moored off the quay of the Arsenale, the barge is partly
filled with the city's sludge (the effluent has been treated and
doesn't stink). The sludge is covered with a thick layer of gravel,
from which rises a small stand of oaks. The leaf crowns are partly
visible from the quay, but you can't see the park itself until you
climb a gangway to the deck of the barge. From there, you descend
another gangway into the trees. Benches line the sides of the
barge. A crane, looming above like an enormous sculpture, heightens
the serenity of the place. The key to the project is the
relationship between two exterior spaces, one enclosed by walls,
the second given scale by the crane.
</P>
<P>
   The project retrieves the modern concept of the architect as
problem solver. You can see it as a prototype for a community
garden on an industrial waterfront, but what is mainly on view is
an intelligence that can be applied to different conditions. The
fusion of public space, sustainability and visual imagery can take
many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Heightened awareness can be ethics enough. This is the moral
foundation of Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio's work. They
build on it here with a project displayed at the show of
international work at the Italian pavilion. ``Pageant'' is a
seven-minute computer animation loop on corporate logos. Using
black figures on a white field, the loop lines up the icons of the
usual monocultural suspects: Disney, Nike, Baby Bells, Texaco,
Shell, McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, could be considered an example of blob design, as
each logo morphs into the next, an endlessly mutable contrast in
black and white, signifying nothing. Of course, the power of this
nothingness is immense and growing. What ultimately won't be
branded? It is astounding to recognize how much nothing we now hold
in our heads. The consumerist blob is inside us, competing for
market share.
</P>
<P>
   ArchLab, the offering at the U.S. Pavilion, raises the ghost of
the Ugly American, that figure of Cold War fun. Members of the
European press, among others, have interpreted the show's massive
deployment of computer technology as a flashy display of imperial
power in the post-Cold War era. No doubt computer and military
hardware are equivalent on some plane. But I saw the ArchLab as an
urbanist, not a nationalist manifestation.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Max Hollein, Hans Hollein's son and a senior staff
member of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York, the
project brought together students and faculty from two architecture
schools, Columbia University and UCLA. The two groups were assigned
different wings in the pavilion, a red brick kiosk of Jeffersonian
aspirations, where they worked for four weeks in full public view.
</P>
<P>
   John Hockenberry, the NBC correspondent, was quoted recently in
Sony Style on the difference between real innovation and
technological illusion: ``Innovation changes lives; illusion offers
empty promises.'' Perhaps architecture schools can't afford to
patrol the line between innovation and illusion too fiercely.
Thought cops could inhibit freedom of research. But the laxity
creates an environment in which many illusionists come to believe
that they're actually sawing the lady in half.
</P>
<P>
   Hani Rashid, the team director of the Columbia group, has been
working the hocus-pocus angle for some time. With his partner in
the New York-based Studio Asymptote, Lise Ann Couture, he has
cornered a modest niche as a maker of hybrid designs that
supposedly fuse architecture with computer technology. As I see it,
the only fusion going on here is the old one of smoke and mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   On one monitor, a stick figure gymnast tumbles toward the
viewer, morphing the surrounding space into gray ripples. This is
supposed to signify the advent of Moving Man, a contemporary
replacement of Vitruvian Man, the measure of all things classical.
But what we actually saw was a classical, axial cartoon with
wavy-gravy walls. Computers could be an invaluable tool for
exploring the kinesthetic sense, but this project didn't scratch
the surface. The visuals were sexy but vapid.
</P>
<P>
   Another room contained a giant pipe cleaner construction,
executed in glowing blue wires. You couldn't get inside it. The
wires, which were rigid, were supported by grids of transparent
fishing line. I asked Rashid about the grid. I thought the point of
using this software was to get away from grids. ``This is the grid
in a computer model. It shows what it would be like if you were
inside the screen.'' But in a computer model, the grids are curved.
And if we were inside the screen, we would be inside the model.
``That's a technical limitation.'' Perhaps. But it's a limitation
that others, like the Ocean group from Scandinavia, have got
beyond. Also, this model doesn't move. ``But it does. See? It
vibrates against the blue background. It draws on the tradition of
Op Art.'' Oh. Silly of me not to notice that.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid is a very talented fellow. I don't doubt that one day
we'll all be spending lots of time in virtual space. What's missing
here is a sense of real, historical time. Cities are still social
condensers. Bodies still require bricks and mortar structures. If
they don't concentrate on developing new forms in the material
city, today's architecture students could end up as low-level
technical consultants at Industrial Light and Magic.

   Greg Lynn, who led the UCLA team, is not yet an innovator. He
has still to make the major breakthrough many in the architecture
world are expecting of him. But Lynn's experiments with
software-driven design are more than technological illusion. UCLAs
presentation, titled ``The Embryonic House,'' was the more solid _
and Darwinian _ of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's assignment was simple: be fruitful and multiply. Using
Alias Wavefront's Maya software program, the students produced an
open-ended essay on the theme of abundance. Given guidelines for a
single-family dwelling, their task was to develop variations. The
complex, curvilinear computer images they produced were sent to an
adjacent model shop where a jig-saw cut them into wood and plastic
modules. These were then fashioned into scale models and displayed,
along with the modules and computer renderings, in a gallery. The
purpose of this exercise is to transfer the blob from the still
largely virtual to the physical.
</P>
<P>
   Ruskin would have loved this. So, I suspect, would Paco Rabanne.
One of the designs on view recalls Rabanne's metal disc dresses
from the 1960s. It lacked only a fluorescent Dynel wig and a splash
of Metal to complete the retro ensemble. You didn't have to be told
that it was in the Pop Tart tradition. But this was a Platonic
performance. Ambition was within shouting distance of achievement.
Lynn pushed the students to venture further than he has gone in his
own work.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that despite the emphasis on variation, blob
designs all look the same, and that blob designers haven't fully
reckoned with the realities of construction. I see this work as a
genuine mutation, a natural response to the displacement of bricks
and mortar by virtual space. It is not possible, at this point, to
know where this response might lead. But Lynn is encouraging his
students to emulate nature: to throw a bunch of combinations out
there with the expectation that some of them will survive and
mutate further in an environment that is also rapidly evolving.
</P>
<P>
   ArchLab's format was a mutation itself. I can't recall a
presentation that placed greater emphasis on process, not to
mention one that incorporated architects into the display. I didn't
see the interaction I had hoped for between the East and West Coast
teams. Each kept pretty much to its own game. Still, the latent
competition between Rashid and Lynn underscored the idea that New
York and Los Angeles had volved into the east and west sides of a
single metropolitan condition.
</P>
<P>
   The Biennale's strongest message is that this interurban linkage
will accelerate at the global level. A struggle has already emerged
between large corporate offices and independent ``star''
architects, operating as independent contractors with skeletal
staffs, who are available for hire much like actors or
choreographers. The star system is not going to wither away. There
will be more and more stars. They could become a counterculture to
the monoculture, or they could become the icing on its cake.
Enlightened clients will hire them. What they will bring to the
table is risk. Risk is their brand. Clients will demand the brand
as they recognize that risk is a more valuable commodity than
safety, even in purely commercial terms. The blob may turn out to
be more significant as a metaphor for this development _ a logo for
risk _ than for the formal qualities of blob designs.
</P>
<P>
   That is the first answer to the question I took to Venice. (An
extended treatment of these concepts can be found in Ben Van Berkel
and Caroline Bos' book ``Move,'' a manifesto published last year by
UN Studio and Goose Press.) A second was suggested by a Venetian
friend, Franca Coin. Coin is president of the Venetian Foundation,
the outfit that runs most of the city's major museums. She lives in
the Palazzo Barbaro, a Grand Canal mansion of fabled cosmopolitan
pedigree. Henry James stayed there for five weeks in 1887, and
later used it as the setting for ``The Wings of the Dove.'' I ran
into her a few hours after she'd paid a visit to the U.S. Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're here! They're here!'' she exclaimed, with a look of
delight. I assumed she was referring to the pavilion's new breed of
wired-up, net-surfing artists, more talked about than seen in a
rear-view mirror city like Venice. Coin was talking about that, in
part. But she was more impressed by the ethnic diversity of the
students: not just that one was black, or another Asian, but that
she couldn't tell, just from looking at them, what their racial
ancestry was.
</P>
<P>
   I would have overlooked this if my friend hadn't mentioned it.
New Yorkers are supposed to take racial diversity for granted. We
tend to think it's racist to take note of someone's race. But there
are times when overlooking race amounts to denying reality,
including one's own.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to New York, I ran into Coin at the airport. She was
off to Greece. I noticed that she had taken the names and phone
numbers of some of the students. She said she wanted to invite them
to lunch when she got back. ``We are starved for conversation about
today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So are we, it struck me, as I headed to the gate. In New York,
the conversation about today _ about architecture, about race,
about contemporaneity itself _ has been squelched since the '70s,
never more brutally than in the past seven years, as the
reactionaries have dug in their heels. This has been suicidal as
well as unjust. Diversity is the greatest asset of cities worldwide
as well as the common thread between us. More ethics. More
aesthetics. More genetics. The splicing of these strands will
continue well beyond the Biennale. &QL;

   LAHAINA, Maui _ In the dimly lit dining room of Roy's Kahana
Grill, one of a dozen stylish restaurants overseen by star Hawaii
chef Roy Yamaguchi, we are sitting down to dinner: light, crisp
spring rolls served with black bean sauce and hot-sweet mustard; a
tower of skewered tiger shrimp, fried in coconut batter and
perfectly balanced over a pool of cocktail sauce spiked with hot
Thai chiles.
</P>
<P>
   Next, sea bass crusted with macadamia nuts; seared sea scallops
sided with wasabi mashed potatoes and a champagne mango salsa; a
blackened ahi (yellow-fin tuna) and a lemon grass-crusted shutome
(swordfish) seared but still nearly raw at the center, as tender
and silky as the finest sashimi. Finally, cake glazed with an icing
of deep Hawaiian chocolate, and coffee brewed with rich Kona beans,
grown on the Big Island.
</P>
<P>
   If you come to Hawaii looking for faux-Polynesian fare _ pu-pu
platters, Blue Hawaiians and sweet-'n'-sour pork with pineapple
chunks, served in garish rooms lit by tiki torches _ you're in the
wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a decade after the original dozen chefs created the
concept of Hawaiian Regional Cuisine, the dining scene on the
islands has been altered for good. From the finest restaurants to
tourist-oriented spots to fast-food joints, more chefs are
following the mantra of the original regional-cuisine gurus:
Fresher ingredients. More locally grown produce and meat. More
locally procured or farmed fish and seafood. And a bold fusion of
the cuisines long found on the islands: Japanese, Chinese, Thai and
Filipino, with European flavors and traditional Hawaiian fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here is really an offshoot of what happened in
California and across America, with the whole notion of eating
fresher foods and taking regional flavors and making them more
upscale,'' says Joan Clark, food editor of the daily ``Honolulu
Advertiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's best Hawaiian food features ``the local flavors and
dishes that have been upscaled and refined by chefs who have been
trained, usually elsewhere, in American and French techniques,''
Clark says. ``They've taken these mostly Asian flavors and come up
with some really great food.''
</P>
<P>
   That might mean the ahi katsu _ tuna sushi rolled in Japanese
bread crumbs, flash-deep-fried so it remains rare, and served with
a butter-based sauce _ served by Russell Siu at his trendy 3660 on
the Rise on Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the quesadillas stuffed with kalua pork, or traditional
Hawaiian roast pig, at Alan Wong's eponymous restaurant in
Honolulu, named the most popular on the island in the 2000 edition
of the ``Zagat Survey.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it might be something as simple as a soft taco stuffed with
fresh fish marinated in pineapple, lime juice and local spices, one
of the bestsellers at the Maui Taco fast-food chain, with locations
all over Hawaii and now on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Hawaii, you see all these different cultures,
and along with their culture, they brought their food. As chefs,
we're like kids in a candy shop,'' says chef Sam Choy, a native
Hawaiian who oversees an empire of a dozen restaurants, several
cookbooks and an eponymous line of sauces, salad dressings,
marinades and other prepared foods set to debut in Price Club
stores nationwide this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawaiian food has finally come of age, and what's happened is
that we've taken the local cuisine and taken it out of the
closet.''
</P>
<P>
   The food of Hawaii has always been an interesting polyglot,
shaped by the large immigrant populations from China, Japan,
Thailand, the Philippines, Korea and Portugal, among others. Most
Hawaiians, no matter their ethnic background, grew up eating dishes
found nowhere else, says Clark, a native of Hawaii whose booklet,
``Local Food: What to Eat in Hawai'i'' describes many of those
dishes and ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   This old-school Hawaiian cuisine includes such dishes as
``saimin,'' a Japanese-style broth with Chinese egg noodles, lunch
meat and green onions; ``lomi lomi salmon,'' a salad of raw salted
salmon, tomatoes and sweet onions; ``loco moco,'' a breakfast dish
of white rice topped with brown gravy, hamburger patty and a
sunny-side-up egg; and ``poke,'' morsels of raw fish marinated in
salt, seaweed and ground candlenuts.
</P>
<P>
   Island specialties are widely available in local restaurants.
Even McDonald's serves a Hawaiian version of its Egg McMuffin,
using linguisa, a garlicky Portuguese sausage, instead of Canadian
bacon. But for years, finer restaurants wouldn't think of serving
anything like these dishes.
</P>
<P>
   When John Heckathorn, restaurant critic of ``Honolulu''
magazine, moved to the islands 25 years ago, he found the ``best''
restaurants serving the same kind of heavy, Continental/American
food served on the mainland: steak Diane, chicken Cordon Bleu,
smoked salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the feeling that they had to give the tourists the
kind of food they were used to, on the grounds that local food
didn't have high enough status for them,'' Heckathorn says. ``But
then, 25 years ago, American tastes were not as adventurous as they
are now. Honestly, you couldn't put raw fish in front of people
from the mainland. They just wouldn't eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem was the difficulty in getting fresh
ingredients, says Beverly Gannon, a former Dallas resident who
opened her Haliimaile General Store on Maui in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables and fruits shipped from the mainland were often three
to four weeks old; fresh fish was shipped abroad while Hawaiians
had to make do with frozen products; and local farmers seemed to
send most of their crops to the mainland. So in 1991, Gannon and 11
other Hawaiian chefs formed the Hawaiian Regional Cuisine Council,
which began making deals with local farmers to grow _ and sell to
them _ baby lettuces, eggplants, sweet potatoes and other produce.
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, 80 percent of our produce was imported. Today,
80 percent is produced here,'' Wong says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've really created an awareness of fresher foods, on an
island where a lot of us grew up eating a lot of canned foods and
frozen foods because everything had to be shipped in,'' Clark says.
``Where I grew up eating frozen mahi-mahi, now I'm eating fresh
mahi-mahi, and there's a big difference in flavor and texture.''
</P>
<P>
   Given access to better ingredients, chefs who already understood
local food _ like Yamaguchi and Wong _ were able to create foodie
versions of dishes islanders knew and loved, or tweak other
cuisines with a Hawaiian flavor.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one of Gannon's signature dishes is a towering
sashimi napoleon, featuring smoked salmon, sashimi and ahi tartare,
layered with crisp wontons; Gannon calls it a twist on a fish taco.
</P>
<P>
   Wong's restaurants serve such island-inspired specialties as
``poki-pines'' _ crispy ahi poke balls, served on avocado with
wasabi sauce, and a Hawaiian-style Caesar salad with warm kalua
pig, poi vinaigrette and lomi tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wong's food, like many of the other chefs' fare, defies
categorization. Much Hawaiian cuisine has a strong Asian flavor, in
ingredients and presentation. But Gannon, whose book of Haliimaile
General Store recipes will be published by Ten Speed Press this
fall, sees Hawaiian cuisine shifting again, to a more global
sphere, with more Italian and American and Mexican-style
restaurants coming in vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not losing the (Hawaiian) influence, it's just backing
off a little,'' she says. ``When you come to Hawaii, you really do
have food options now.''
</P>
<P>
   And far better ones than in the days of Steak Diane and the
pu-pu platter.

GOP VP HOPEFUL RIDGE HOPES TO OVERCOME ABORTION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ Governor Thomas Ridge, whose prospects as
George W. Bush's running mate have ricocheted through Republican
politics all year, hunched over a children's computer game
Wednesday with intense interest.
</P>
<P>
   Press ``F'' and a fox appears. ``What do you get down there for
`VP?' '' Ridge asked.
</P>
<P>
   That is indeed the question, and few face it as often as Ridge.
After being the front-runner for the vice presidential slot for
months, Ridge's fortunes have declined in recent weeks as a vocal
group of Republicans have attacked him for supporting abortion
rights. Wednesday, however, Ridge seemed determined to breathe new
life into his chances, seizing upon a survey that showed him as the
top choice among delegates to the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it says that although there are some people that
write about the controversy associated with potentially selecting a
candidate who disagrees with him on the issue of choice, they are
united and at the end of the day and they respect the governor's
decision,'' Ridge said in an interview at a YWCA child care center.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates' willingness to support a running mate who backs
abortion rights gives Bush ``more options, gives him a certain
comfort level,'' Ridge said
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's potential vice presidential candidacy has been opposed
by some who argue it will tear apart the convention and the party.
But Ridge supporters, especially those who back abortion rights,
say his selection would send a positive signal to the many
moderates who will determine the outcome of the election.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by the Associated Press found that half of the
delegates could back a running mate who supports abortion rights,
while 22 percent said they could not, with the rest giving no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, of those who named a preference for vice president,
Ridge was the top choice, favored by 7 percent of the delegates,
followed by Elizabeth Dole with 6.7 percent. Representative John
Kasich was backed by 5.2 percent, Colin Powell got 5 percent and
John McCain had 3.2 percent. Powell and McCain have said they would
not accept the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press conducted a similar survey of Democratic
delegates and found no consensus. The two picks were Senators Evan
Bayh of Indiana and Dianne Feinstein of California, both with 3.5
percent. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts did not appear among
the top five choices identified by the AP.
</P>
<P>
   With increasing speculation that Bush will announce his vice
presidential pick early next week, perhaps five or six days before
the opening of the convention, the Texas governor is clearly
approaching his end game. Ridge said that he has not been informed
of any deadline but said he talks with the Bush campaign on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Both pro- and anti-abortion forces are trying to influence
Bush's decision. This week, groups ranging from the American
Conservative Union to Priests for Life launched efforts to convince
Bush to pick someone who opposes abortion. At the same time, groups
such as Republicans for Choice met Wednesday with Bush campaign
officials in a longshot effort to remove language from the party
platform that calls for a ban on all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by anti-abortion forces clearly has had an impact.
For example, one influential Bush associate who spoke on condition
of anonymity said last week that although he initially favored
Ridge, he has switched to supporting Governor Frank Keating of
Oklahoma. The sole reason for the switch is that Keating opposes
abortion rights. Keating's stock has climbed even though he is not
well-known nationally. Both Ridge and Keating are Catholics, who
represent up to 30 percent of the electorate and are expected to
play a huge role in determining the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, meanwhile, is under increasing pressure within the party.
For example, American Conservative Union chairman David Keene has
written a widely distributed memo that says Ridge is not a really a
conservative. Keene said that when Ridge served in the House from
1983 to 1994, he voted with American Conservative Union only 51
percent of the time. ``Ridge is clearly no conservative, not even
close,'' Keene wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Ridge said the AP survey shows that he or some other
prospect who supports abortion rights is a legitimate contender for
the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the poll shows to me is they are going to support that
decision one way or the other,'' Ridge said. ``It sounds good for
the party, whether it turns out to be good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking to reporters in Austin, said he remains undecided
about his choice, although he has narrowed his list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you all to know I have not made up my mind yet about
who the vice president is going to be,'' Bush said as he unveiled
his campaign's updated Internet site. This weekend, the governor is
expected to reflect on his decision at his ranch in Crawford, just
outside of Waco, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Kranish reported from Harrisburg. Zuckman, traveling with Bush,
reported from Austin.

TURNING A CAMERA, STRESS AND THE WILD INTO A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Va., Australia)   By ALICIA AULT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago Mark Burnett was competing in adventure
races, an experience that led to his life plan: he would bring the
sport to America, which was having a love affair with the outdoors,
sport utility vehicles and extreme sports.
</P>
<P>
   To American athletes and television audiences, Burnett, who had
no previous experience in television, brought the ``Eco-Challenge
Expedition Race,'' a several-hundred-miles-long endurance contest
on foot, kayak and horseback in exotic locales that pits teams of
four against themselves, each other, the whims of nature, and
Burnett. That was only the beginning. Now, as executive producer,
he has brought to television the highly rated ``Survivor,'' his
jungle-theme soap opera/game show. It is the latest in what he
promises will be a stream of adventure-related businesses and
programming combining a blend of drama and reality he calls
``dramality.'' But the aspiring media mogul has left rankled rivals
and colleagues in his wake, even as they applaud him as a master
salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make the mistake of ever underestimating Mark
Burnett,'' said Mike Sears, a Los Angeles adventure filmmaker who
shot the first two ``Eco-Challenges.'' ``He's so tenacious he won't
stop until he gets it done.'' ``Survivor'' is the essence of a
favorite Burnett pastime _ filming people, whether strangers or
teammates, when thrown into stress-producing situations in the
wild. He is fascinated by the group dynamic, observing behaviors as
if his film subjects were part of a high school science project.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has been a paratrooper in the Falkland Islands for the
British Army, he has often said he would not survive on his own TV
island. ``I like to speak my mind,'' he said. ``Even if it ruffles
a few feathers, it's just me, the way I've got to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett does see a bit of himself in his programs. ``It's like
social Darwinism _ how you adapt and evolve to fit into a group.
Everybody wants to be liked. Even me.''
</P>
<P>
   He may not be liked by everybody, but he has certainly survived
the entertainment world. The 40-year-old British native landed in
Los Angeles in 1982 and did not begin his television efforts until
the early 1990s. He has since developed two winning entertainment
vehicles in remarkably little time by Hollywood standards.
</P>
<P>
   The only child of working-class parents, Burnett joined the
military at 18 and served in Northern Ireland and the Falklands as
a member of the British Army Parachute Regiment. Upon discharge, he
mulled over a job as a mercenary, but ended up in Los Angeles,
pursuing his real dream: making a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett moved from au pair work to telemarketing, insurance and
credit card sales, and even a stint at a modeling agency. A Tony
Robbins motivational seminar convinced him he could design his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   After reading about adventure races in New Zealand and the
French Raid Gauloises competition, Burnett was entranced. He
assembled a United States team and did the Raid three times in the
early 1990s, finishing once.
</P>
<P>
   Before he entered his first race, in 1992 in Oman, Burnett
bought with proceeds from his telemarketing business what he
thought were the United States rights to the Raid. After a flurry
of litigation and a settlement, he was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   He still needed more money and was introduced to Brian
Terkelsen, a young investment banker new to the West Coast and in
search of a new venture, preferably entertainment-related. Together
they drummed up interest and money for their new company,
Eco-Challenge Lifestyles, begun in a Santa Monica, Calif., bedroom.
By late 1994 Burnett was talking to MTV executives about airing his
own ``Eco-Challenge'' race. ``Mark had a gut reaction this was
going to be a good sporting event,'' said Terkelsen, whose
partnership with Burnett dissolved in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``In the first year we had to get 50 teams to pay
$10,000 each to come, and they'd never heard of it before. And we
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett's gut was on the money. Endurance athletes were looking
beyond marathons, triathlons and Ironman competitions. The first
Raid was in 1989. A full-fledged expedition race was not held in
the United States until Burnett's event in 1995, when 50 four-man
teams from six countries mountain-biked, rafted and climbed their
way through the red rock country around Moab, Utah. MTV Sports
showed that first ``Eco-Challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Byrnes, vice president and creative director of MTV,
said he bought the concept because Terkelsen and Burnett were
``incredibly good salesmen,'' and because what the racers were
doing ``was extreme and crazy and dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership ended after the first program. ``It wasn't the
MTV crowd out there doing it,'' Byrnes said. Racers usually are in
their '30s, '40s and even '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics admit that Burnett is a persuasive salesman, and he
found other television partners. Over the last five years MTV, ESPN
and the Discovery Channel have spent a total of $100 million, by
his estimate, producing, promoting and airing his ``Eco-Challenge
Expedition Race.'' The competitors ride mountain-bikes through
jungles, ride camels across deserts, summit glacier-capped peaks,
rappel down sheer cliff faces, and kayak through roiling
whitewater, while fighting off hunger, panic, fear, anger,
exhaustion, cold, wet and heat, all in an average of five to seven
days.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS, said
Burnett's dead-on portrayals of human drama and his persuasive
personality convinced him he should buy into ``Survivor.'' ``When
he talks about something, you really believe he can pull it off,''
Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Survivor'' and ``Eco-Challenge,'' Burnett and his
production crew set up obstacles when nature doesn't oblige. The
emphasis is on the TV production _ how a shot will look and sound
on air.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett does not deny this. As for ``Survivor,'' he said, ``It's
not reality, it's a relationship show with non-actors and no
scripts.'' He also said that adventure racing like
``Eco-Challenge'' is ``totally disparate and undefinable. It's not
really a sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments like that irk adventure athletes. But many grudgingly
admit that he has brought attention and sponsorship to what they
consider a sport. They line up hundreds deep each year for
``Eco-Challenge,'' even though it means $10,000 in entry fees and
thousands more on training, equipment and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just walks over all the other races,'' Ian Adamson, one of
the world's top racers and a corporate trainer in Boulder, Colo.,
said of ``Eco-Challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say Burnett is in the sport only for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say he's responsible for the growth of adventure
racing, I would say that's an ancillary benefit of his goals,''
said Gordon Wright, a racer and spokesman for the Beast of the East
World Championship, which has been run as a regional adventure race
but, after trying to expand, was recently canceled when it could
not attract enough television interest or corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Over four years on the Discovery Channel, the ``Eco-Challenge''
averaged a 1.1 to a 1.6 rating (about one million to two million
viewers), said Mike Quattrone, Discovery's executive vice president
and general manager. The program appealed to Discovery's core
audience of 25- to 54-year-olds and was heavily watched by men,
making Discovery happy, he said. Discovery and Burnett parted
amicably, Quattrone said, and next spring the network will televise
the Southern Traverse race, held in New Zealand in November.
</P>
<P>
   USA Network has agreed to subsidize and televise the
``Eco-Challenge'' for the next three years, starting with this
August's race through the Borneo jungles where the CBS survivors
met their fate. Adventure racing has grown to hundreds of events in
the United States, mostly one to three days. It is a perfect
made-for-TV event; the slow pace makes for easy filming of dialogue
and team crack-ups, and for leavening with eye-grabbing scenery.
</P>
<P>
   The sport also innately appeals to couch potatoes, said Duncan
Smith, a former Navy Sealand adventure racer who runs the San
Francisco-based Presidio Adventure Racing School. ``With adventure
racing, people who will never do an adventure race will watch every
minute of four or six hours of coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Eco-Challenge'' is a potent entertainment mix, said Gordon
Beck, senior vice president of sports and production at USA
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not solely who wins the race, it's what are the human
interactions, what are the combination of emotions, mental stamina
and physical limits that all play together within a team, and team
against team,'' Beck said. ``Those are fascinating elements that
draw an audience.'' &QL; 
(MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Burnett's appeal is not universal. He can be full of egotistical
bluster one moment and disarmingly charming the next.
</P>
<P>
   He has been accused of manipulating courses and teams to enhance
the drama, but Bob Shallow, production vice president for Trans
World International, the television division of the sports
marketing company International Management Group, said that as a
producer, ``you want the most compelling character and the most
compelling competition because that's going to draw the audience.''
His company produces the Mild Seven Outdoor Quest, held in China
and seen on the Outdoor Life Network.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett has also been accused of trying to eliminate the
competition by scheduling ``Eco-Challenge'' at the same time as
other adventure races and by luring the best racers by waiving
entry fees.
</P>
<P>
   Don Mann, founder of Odyssey Adventure Racing in Virginia Beach,
Va., and director of the Beast, said ``Eco-Challenge'' killed his
race. He credits Burnett for helping the sport grow, but questions
whether racers are served by less competition.
</P>
<P>
   Citing several instances in which he said Burnett either
negotiated in bad faith or lied to him, Mann said Burnett could not
trusted _ allegations Burnett denied. ``He's like a rattlesnake _
if you're close enough long enough, you're going to get bit,'' Mann
said. Several other race directors and racers made similar remarks,
but none would speak for attribution.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't seem to scare Burnett's new Hollywood associates.
Jon Landau, a partner in Lightstorm Entertainment and a producer of
``Titanic,'' has been shopping around a feature-length film based
on ``Eco-Challenge,'' and said he was enthralled with Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett keeps spinning off related businesses, including
Eco-Challenge Adventure Travel, which gives weekend warriors the
opportunity to paddle in the same outrigger canoes or mountain-bike
down the same trails as real racers, and ``Eco-Challenge''
qualifier races.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Survivor'' paperback _ a Robinson Crusoe-like diary _ will
come out a week after the program's conclusion, and ``Survivor II''
will begin filming in the Australian outback in October, with
substantially more financial backing, and payments to Burnett, from
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Burnett chose the right design for life. ``He went into
business and the business he chose is adventure,'' Sears said,
``and he definitely is the best in the world at it.''

 &HT;    CLINTON WORKING TO SALVAGE MIDEAST SUMMIT TALKS ON BRINK OF
COLLAPSE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Struggling to rescue marathon Mideast peace
talks from the threat of collapse, President Clinton led Israeli
and Palestinian leaders Wednesday through a tumultuous day of
brinkmanship and heated negotiations that ground into the night.
</P>
<P>
   After nine days of talks at nearby Camp David, though, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
spent much of the day threatening to walk out on the summit, while
Clinton shuttled between them and urged them to stay.
</P>
<P>
   With the two sides at loggerheads over the thorny territorial
and security disputes that divide them _ and, in particular, vexing
questions about the future of Jerusalem _ Clinton set a Thursday
morning deadline for Barak and Arafat to break their impasse and
move toward a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, though, White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart
conceded that the prospects for a peace accord hung very much in
the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've obviously reached a pivotal moment in these talks, and I
can't predict how they'll come out,'' a grim Lockhart told
reporters gathered in this town of 4,400, five miles from the
secluded presidential retreat at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is working very hard to see if there's some way we
can get from where we are now to an agreement,'' Lockhart insisted.
``The problem is the structure and the substance of that
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   As the three leaders and their negotiating teams met into the
night, Air Force One was standing by at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington to take Clinton early Thursday to Okinawa,
Japan, where he plans to attend a weekend summit of leaders from
the Group of Eight democratic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had earlier scratched a Tokyo leg of the trip, delaying
his departure by 24 hours, but Lockhart said there was a limit to
how long the president could fruitfully remain at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone understands we don't have an unlimited
time-clock here,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking outside support, Clinton telephoned at least four
Mideast leaders from the Camp David retreat where the summit is
being held, asking them over secure lines to add the weight of
their influence to his own efforts to broker peace between Arafat
and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart would not name the leaders Clinton called, nor would he
say whether those leaders followed up with calls of their own to
Arafat or Barak.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan's state news agency Petra said Clinton telephoned
Jordan's King Abdullah on Wednesday and briefed him on the Camp
David talks. Petra quoted the king as thanking Clinton and his
administration for their efforts to push the Middle East peace
process forward and expressed hope the summit would yield the
results they were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The Reuters new agency also quoted Egyptian presidency sources
that Clinton called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Wednesday to
discuss progress at summit. But the sources said that Clinton did
not ask Mubarak for his help in securing an agreement at the Camp
David talks during their telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   As tensions ran high throughout the day, both Barak and Arafat
delivered letters to Clinton. Lockhart would not comment on their
contents, but Israeli and Palestinian media widely reported that
each side had threatened to quit the talks, blaming the other's
intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians arrived at Camp David lacking a true
commitment, and are not ready to have a substantive discussion
about a lasting peace and to make historic decisions,'' Israel
radio quoted a Hebrew translation of the letter as saying. ``Unless
there are last-minute changes, the Palestinians will have to
envision the tragic consequences of an opportunity they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abdel Rahman, who heads the Palestine Liberation
Organization's office in Washington, told the Associated Press the
Palestinians went to Camp David to achieve a just and lasting peace
that the Israeli and Palestinian people could live with for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Associated Press, Rahman emphasized
that Palestinian control over East Jerusalem was a bottom-line
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no agreement without total Palestinian
sovereignty over East Jerusalem,'' Rahman told the AP. ``This is a
basic condition for achieving peace.''

MARKEY FACES RESIDENCY DECISION

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The death of Representative Edward J. Markey's
father last week was a personal loss for his family, but it also
puts the Massachusetts Democrat in a ticklish political position.
</P>
<P>
   Markey lives with his wife, Dr. Susan J. Blumenthal, in an
$800,000 house in Chevy Chase, Md., but for years he has claimed
his political residency in his childhood bedroom at his parent's
home in Malden.
</P>
<P>
   Markey's mother, Christina, died in 1998, and with the death of
his 89-year-old father, John, last Thursday, the disposition of
their house will fall to Markey; his brother John, who lives in
Belmont, Mass.; his brother Richard, a resident of Charlestown,
Mass.; and his aunt, Marguerite Markey of Stoneham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed intends to continue to maintain his residence at 7 Townsend
St.,'' Markey's spokesman, David Moulton, said Wednesday without
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the house were sold, there is no law that requires
Markey to be a resident in his district, but the issue has been a
nettlesome one for Markey in the past. His failure to own a house
in the 7th Congressional District over his 24 years in Congress
flared up during his 1994 reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are about being a voice for the people we hope to
represent, not a Washington insider that's removed and has no
contact or connection with the district,'' said then-challenger
Brad Bailey, who lost his campaign but later served an appointment
as Middlesex County sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Residency is a prominent issue this year in the US Senate race
between Hillary Rodham Clinton, an Illinois native and longtime
Arkansas resident, and Representative Rick Lazio, a Republican who
was raised on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said recently: ``For me, New York isn't just a mailing
address; it's my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts election law does not require members of Congress
to live in their districts, only that they be an ``inhabitant'' of
the state when elected. The Constitution says only that candidates
live in the state where an election is held.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, members of Congress keep an apartment or share living
quarters in Washington while maintaining a primary residence in the
area they represent. They are paid $141,300 per year, a sum they
often justify because of the expense of keeping two homes.
</P>
<P>
   All other members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation
_ including Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry _ own
property in Massachusetts except for Representative Barney Frank.
The Massachusetts Democrat, who had been living with his widowed
sister the past five years, began renting his own apartment in

   ``It may be an issue for a candidate seeking an open seat or a
candidate who is fighting against a seat held by an incumbent, but
if you are an incumbent who has held the seat for a long time, it's

NEW GENERATION OF REALISTS SCRAPS THE KITCHEN SINK 
</HEADLINE>
   By GRAHAM FULLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I once asked John Schlesinger if he would ever return to
making the kind of small, authentic English films, like ``A Kind of
Loving'' and ``Billy Liar,'' that made his name in the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? We've done all that,'' he growled, speaking for himself
and his fellow so-called kitchen sink realists, and we returned to
talking about what was then Schlesinger's latest film, the slick
American espionage thriller ``The Falcon and the Snowman.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. Artists don't grow if they retrace their steps. The
kitchen sink, too, is no longer a handy symbol for the social
inequities and domestic pressures of British life. Britain has
changed irrevocably in the 40 years since Schlesinger, Lindsay
Anderson, Jack Clayton, Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson, inspired
by the literary example of the Angry Young Men and offended by the
bourgeois values of the staid national cinema, made a brief series
of socially aware films that depicted regional working-class life
in all its grim (and occasionally funny) verisimilitude.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare state has metamorphosed, by way of Margaret
Thatcher's privatization imperatives, into Tony Blair's
post-industrial Cool Britannia. Mobile-phone realism, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   The rhythms of British life, however, do not alter as quickly as
the political landscape, and in the last few years several talented
directors have emerged with pain-infused realist dramas that get to
the heart of working- and middle-class Britain. They include Gary
Oldman's ``Nil by Mouth,'' Tim Roth's ``War Zone,'' Carine Adler's
``Under the Skin'' and two that will open here this fall, Lynne
Ramsay's ``Ratcatcher'' and Shane Meadows' ``Room for Romeo
Brass.'' Another, ``Wonderland,'' directed by Michael Winterbottom,
opens on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   These directors do not belong to any manifesto-issuing group
like the Danish Dogma 95 collective with its back-to-basics agenda,
or, for that matter, the Free Cinema documentarists of the '50s,
whose work led to the kitchen sink movement. Unlike that tireless
agitator Ken Loach, they are driven by polemical concerns only in
passing. Although Winterbottom and Meadows, for example, have shown
they are not limited to particular themes, all the films just
mentioned are linked by a realist or quasi-realist style and a
preoccupation with the psychological legacies of parental abuse or
absence, or, as in the case of ``Wonderland,'' parental warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Loach's work has always rooted the political in the personal,
and it is impossible to ignore the influence of domestic dramas
like his ``Ladybird, Ladybird'' on ``Nil by Mouth'' and ``The War
Zone'' (particularly since the actor Ray Winstone portrayed brutal
father figures in all three). There are traces of ``Ladybird,
Ladybird'' and earlier Loach films like ``Up the Junction'' and
``Family Life'' in ``Wonderland'' and ``Under the Skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether directly or through osmosis, Roth and Oldman are
indebted to Mike Leigh and especially Alan Clarke, directors they
both worked for as actors. After many years as an eloquent
director-for-hire in British television, Clarke capped his career
with a series of pulsating dramas, including ``Scum'' (starring
Winstone and banned by the BBC, which had financed it), ``Made in
Britain'' (with Roth) and ``The Firm'' (with Oldman), that offered
a caustic critique of the British social order. Since Clarke's
death in 1990, his films have grown in critical stature, and he
stands alongside Loach and Leigh as one of the seminal figures of
British social realism.
</P>
<P>
   Winterbottom's ``Wonderland'' unfolds over a November weekend in
contemporary London, which it depicts as a locus of alienation,
loneliness and despair. Laurence Coriat, the film's London-based
writer, was a psychology student in her native France and,
accordingly, her script lent itself to psychological rather than
social realism. It focuses on three sisters and their brother, and
their codependent parents (Kika Markham and Jack Shepherd), whose
wretchedly antagonistic relationship implicitly indicates why their
son is estranged and not one of their daughters seems capable of
forging a relationship based on trust.
</P>
<P>
   Of the sisters, the shy cafe waitress Nadia (Gina McKee, who
played a similar role in Leigh's ``Naked'') dates men from the
personal ads and ends up being seduced and rejected by one of them;
the willfully promiscuous Debbie (Shirley Henderson), a
hairdresser, parks her son on her irresponsible ex-husband, who
promptly loses him; and the pregnant teacher Molly (Molly Parker)
cold-shoulders her live-in boyfriend for quitting his job, causing
him to walk out. Their younger brother, Darren (Enzo Cilenti),
agonizes over whether to call home as he passes through the city
with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Thematically, Winterbottom's films, which also include ``Jude''
and ``Welcome to Sarajevo,'' deal with people who are trapped in
some kind of prison, whether psychological or physical;
stylistically, they have little in common. In ``Wonderland,'' he
adopted a casually observational approach, filming the quotidian
routines and mishaps of his characters with a hand-held camera as
they struggle through the weekend, making a hash of their attempts
to communicate with each other. Winterbottom was loath to
acknowledge specific realist influences on ``Wonderland'' when we
spoke in January at the Sundance Film Festival, where the movie had
its American premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't consciously trying to emulate '60s kitchen sink
realism,'' he said. ``The fact that `Wonderland's' characters
happen to be living mainly in council estates in South London and
struggling economically isn't the heart of the film. I was more
interested in exploring the emotional connections between people in
a family who rarely meet, and in capturing the noise and excitement
of London and the exhaustion of trying to keep your head above
water in a place where you've got seven million people around you
whose lives you don't know. You sit next to them on the tube, live
next door to them in a block of flats and walk past them on the
street, but you never expect to have any connection with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Superficially, ``Wonderland'' resembles Loach's films _ a
``Riff-Raff,'' say, or ``Raining Stones'' _ but a closer
examination reveals that its style is heightened above and beyond
Loachian documentary realism. Like ``Nil by Mouth'' and ``Under the
Skin,'' ``Wonderland'' is carried along by a fly-on-the-wall look,
charged with an unsettling lyricism. Scenes of Debbie's son and his
dad leaving a soccer match, and in Soho, where Nadia and Molly's
boyfriend each gloomily wander, render the metropolis as a
threatening human jungle. It is not entirely faceless: Winterbottom
had Sean Bobbitt, his cinematographer, pick out lonely individuals
in the crowd, making us wonder about their stories. But he did
something Loach would never do: using time-lapse photography, he
turned Soho's hordes into an inhuman tumult moving at warp speed,
overlaid by an alternately plaintive and mournful Michael Nyman
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, a film's realistic if it somehow expresses something
that's truthful,'' Winterbottom said. ``But I don't think there's
an objective way of saying one film is truthful and another isn't.
`Wonderland' is a naturalistic film in most respects. One thing I
wanted to do stylistically was have moments in it where we weren't
just observing details but somehow trying to evoke a sense of the
characters' inner lives, their aspirations and dreams. That's why I
used the time-lapse photography and Michael Nyman's score.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Ramsay's ``Ratcatcher'' is set in and around a decrepit
housing project and a polluted nearby canal in Glasgow in the '70s;
a national refuse workers' strike (also seen in the recent Sex
Pistols documentary ``The Filth and the Fury'') has led to an
infestation of rats in the neighborhood. In the film's first few
minutes, a boy drowns in the canal. The story then follows
12-year-old James (William Eadie), who shoved the boy into the
water. James befriends a hapless teen-ager, Margaret Anne (Leanne
Mullen), who is picked on by a local gang, then he feels betrayed
when he sees her having sex with her persecutors. James' father is
beaten up and takes it out on his wife. James himself jumps into
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   From such human squalor, Ramsay, who grew up in a similar
Glasgow environment, has fashioned a movie that is equal parts
realism and impressionism. Unlike Winterbottom, she sought out and
framed details _ the scab on Margaret Anne's knee, her spectacles
at the bottom of the canal, James protectively pulling his mother's
ripped nylon stocking over her bare toe _ that are stark in their
realness but more than three-dimensional. ``I tried to think of the
emotional core of every shot,'' Ramsay said recently. ``I wanted to
get details that trigger a memory. A lot of people like the scene
in which James looks at Margaret Anne's scab because it's quite
sensual and reminds them of when they constantly had scabs on their
knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Ratcatcher'' often looks and feels like real life,
any notion that it is a ``realistic'' film is confused by the fact
that it appears to operate on two intersecting planes of reality,
the conscious and the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   When James follows his sister out of town on a bus, he drifts
off to a new housing estate situated among wide fields that might
have been photographed in Nebraska: the sequence has the quality of
a reverie. Then later, in a Magritte-style scene, James' family
carries its furniture through the fields to the estate to claim
their little slice of heaven _ but there's a sense that this is
only a visualization of James' futile wish for a life that isn't
brutish and disease-ridden.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the film, council inspectors visit James' family's
untidy flat and deny them a new home _ a typically Loachian
intimation of how the working class is habitually betrayed by the
authorities who are supposed to help them. The runtish James is
also reminiscent of the unloved schoolboy who finds solace in the
company of a kestrel in Loach's ``Kes.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Loach, Ramsay primarily works with nonprofessional actors.
Stylistically, however, the British filmmakers who most affected
her were Bill Douglas (``My Childhood,'' ``My Ain Folk''), Clarke
and Nicolas Roeg, while she also credits the influence of the
American avant-garde director Maya Deren and such European
heavyweights as Fellini, Bergman, Fassbinder and Truffaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think `Ratcatcher' is part of the tradition of British
social realism because of the working-class world in which it's
set,'' she said. ``If it offers an alternative view of British
culture compared with most of the films that are made these days,
then, yeah, it is connected to that kitchen sink tradition, but I
never sat down and said, `I'm going to make a social realist film.'
When I make my films, I go off on a different planet, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay, who previously directed highly regarded shorts (``Small
Deaths'' and ``Gasman''), added that she did not wish to be thought
of as a Scottish filmmaker. The regionalist spirit of the '60s
kitchen sink films, however, survives in the work of Shane Meadows,
whose grass-roots cinema is based in and around the Midlands _ not
that his stories about the vicissitudes of emotionally or
economically disenfranchised teen-agers and young adults aren't
universally applicable. Meadows' films, both jaunty and poignant,
share with Mike Leigh's a fascination for quirks of personality.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows was about to start work on a Welsh western when a
conversation with his writing partner Paul Fraser steered them
toward an autobiographical story about a temporary break in their
long friendship during adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Room for Romeo Brass'' depicts a crisis in the life of
pugnacious 12-year-old Romeo (Andrew Shim). He not only deserts his
next-door-neighbor, Knocks (Ben Marshall), when the latter is
hospitalized but, angered by his itinerant father's decision to
return home, takes up with the 30-ish misfit, Morel (Paddy
Considine), who has been courting his sister.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows' first feature, the black-and-white ``TwentyFourSeven''
(1997), was shot in an uneasy blend of realist and impressionist
styles, but ``Romeo Brass'' returns him to the vibrant naturalism
of his short films, ``Small Time'' and ``Where's the Money
Ronnie?,'' which were shot on video. Of all the films by new
British directors about real-life situations, Meadows' have the
strongest tang of verisimilitude.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Winterbottom and Ramsay, Meadows candidly admits he was
directly influenced by the Loach-Leigh-Clarke era, which achieved
its apotheosis in television drama during the '70s and '80s, a time
when the British film industry was enduring one of its periodic
slumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear Martin Scorsese talking about the first time he went
to see great movies in these huge cinemas in New York,'' Meadows
said, ``but to me a cinema was some seedy place in the back streets
of Stoke-on-Trent where you went twice a year at the most to see
films like `Grease.' Except for the likes of `Chariots of Fire' and
`Absolute Beginners,' there was no cinema culture in England when I
was growing up. And yet I would come in from the youth club on
Thursday night and on the telly there would be a film about a
pregnant woman and the guy who has come round to read the gas meter
and who obviously fancies her, and they'd sit in a room in a block
of flats and not talk. And you'd think, `Who the hell made this?'
You wouldn't know if it was a story or a documentary but you'd sit
there glued to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The one thing I felt was missing from these
incredibly hard-hitting dramas was comedy. They were very real but
they seemed to take themselves too seriously, and I remember that
although life was tough where I grew up, people's humor came
through, and that's what I thought I could bring to my films when I
started making them. You see it in the cruel way the two boys treat
Morel when they think they can take advantage of him in `Romeo
Brass.' Even if a film's based on reality, it doesn't have to be a
depressing state of affairs.''  &QL;

SCHUBERT PLAYS A ROLE IN A CLEVER FILM SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
 - $ADV23-NYT   For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By MICHAEL BECKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   One of the cleverest moments in
the clever score for Istvan Szabo's film ``Sunshine'' occurs toward
the end, when old Uncle Gustave Sonnenschein returns home to
Budapest from abroad. He goes to the piano, ostensibly to play the
opening of Schubert's four-hand Fantasy in F minor, which has
served as the movie's leitmotif. To remind us that he is a
socialist, the tune immediately turns into the ``Marseillaise.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   This kind of thematic metamorphosis is at the core of the music
of ``Sunshine.'' From the first bars, there is something oddly
familiar about the score, and this for a reason. To create the main
theme, the composer Maurice Jarre starts with Schubert's first five
notes, which are just like those of the ``Marseillaise'' except
that the fifth note returns to the first instead of repeating.
Schubert, after a pause, reiterates the ``allons enfant'' pattern
several times before ending the phrase with a seductive dip. Jarre
goes right to the dip, in effect skipping a measure. To this torso
he adds a new, expansive gesture reminiscent of his score for
``Lawrence of Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schubert fantasy is a particularly compelling choice for
``Sunshine.'' Written at the end of the composer's life, it is a
remarkable piece, which goes against the grain. What begins simply
as a kind of Biedermeier serenade turns into a work of great
mystery and astonishing profundity, concluding, like Mozart's
``Jupiter'' Symphony, with a double fugue.
</P>
<P>
   As Mozart did in his F minor Fantasy for mechanical organ,
written 30 years earlier and also arranged for four hands, Schubert
takes the genre into uncharted territory. In tone, his fantasy
shares something with Mozart's 40th Symphony, yet the dotted rhythm
recalls a march, with aspects simultaneously childlike, military
and funereal. The opening is riddled with grace notes, suggesting _
appropriately for the film _ an exotic, Hungarian Gypsy origin. The
phrases are irregular, and the seemingly wistful opening idea is
immediately repeated with an unusual insistence. There is something
inscrutable about this work.
</P>
<P>
   It projects a strangely ominous quality, a component of the film
as well. When two characters perform the piece at the beginning, it
seems to signify refined upper-middle-class contentment. Yet the
paradise of the Sonnenscheins is threatened from inside (a
quasi-incestuous love affair, various character flaws) and out
(world wars, revolutions, anti-Semitism). Maternal curses abound;
china cups break symbolically. Family members change their name
from the German-Jewish Sonnenschein to the Hungarian Sors. (Hmm,
now whose name does that sound like?) The family frolics, fights
and flees for generations, from Franz Joseph's Vienna to Stalinist
Budapest, with various progeny _ all played by Ralph Fiennes _
serving as an imperial court judge, an Olympic gold medalist and an
interrogator for the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is more music than the Schubert fantasy and its
offspring to back all this up. The score brilliantly weaves
together many kinds of sounds. The first third of the film is
particularly rich in musical variety, reflecting _ as Schubert's
work does in microcosm _ the polyglot shimmer of the Hapsburg lands
with a dazzling combination of Gypsy bands, Hungarian patriotic
music, Strauss waltzes, Jewish liturgical chants and, as a kind of
subsidiary theme, a glorious Hungarian love song, ``Spring Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the musical score, there is a subtler blend of
sounds. Chimes ring; clocks tick. Time is a major force in the
movie, and the slightly metronomic aspect of the Schubert fantasy
suggests that it may also be understood as a symbol of fate. In
fact, it is only when the youngest Sonnenschein loses his watch
(and fails to learn the piano) that he can begin his move toward
freedom. At this point, music teachers, we get the major-key
version of Schubert's theme.
</P>
<P>
   The film has a message: to be free, you must be true to who you
really are. This is linked to a pervasive distaste for
assimilation. (A Hungarian officer says to a Sonnenschein: ``I told
you to assimilate. I was wrong.'') Though not itself complex, this
mandate has darker, unexplored implications. On one hand, it seems
entirely positive: stand up for who you are; honor your traditions;
do not give in to changing fashion. On the other hand, in Central
Europe and elsewhere, such attitudes have quickly led to
collections of armed camps with devastating results.
</P>
<P>
   The film, as marvelous as it often is, has no room for such
ambiguities. It is, after all, a Hollywood-style epic, ultimately
more concerned with family drama and fornication than it is with
metaphysical complexity or illuminating the great wash of history.
So, if the untutored cannot really distinguish between the 1953
``doctors' plot'' in Russia and the 1956 Hungarian revolution, that
hardly matters.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the nuances
that have been bleached out of history in ``Sunshine'' have their
perfect counterpart in the missing measure from Schubert's Fantasy
in F minor. In this way, too, the film and the score are
compatible, sharing a tone that tends to favor a certain
sentimentality over more troubling and painful visions.
</P>
<P>
   My coda is just the sort of thing the ``industry'' probably
expects from ivory-tower types, even those who live and work in
Southern California and should know better. We are all aware by now
that the movie business is about fame and illusion, but shouldn't
Schubert get some credit for the score?
</P>
<P>
   Neither the soundtrack album (from BMG/Milan) nor the
15-seconds-of-fame Web zines that have provided reviews of it seem
to know that Jarre's score owes a great debt to a rough
contemporary of the first Sonnenschein we meet (who almost
immediately gets blown up in the family's distillery): a short,
curly-haired composer from the Hapsburg Empire, who had his own
problems. (One data base says that the soundtrack ``starts with a
piano minuet that quickly develops a Beethoven feel.'')
</P>
<P>
   I am rooting for Maurice Jarre to win an Oscar for his terrific
score. But I hope he shares it with Schubert.

The hottest Bush of all, says Elle magazine, which has an eye for

of presidential candidate  &UR; George W. &LR; , was ``my little brown one''
in 1988, when his grandfather introduced him to the public.

<P>
   George P. works as a paralegal and plans to enter law school in
the fall, but he meanwhile helps out in his uncle's campaign, says
Elle, where Bushites realize his `` &UR; Ricky Martin &LR;  appeal gives his
white-bread clan a touch of ethnic chic.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine says that George P. is well aware of his sex appeal
and ``uses his Lothario looks to open doors once closed to Bushes _

Call.

<P>
   Sen.  &UR; Orrin Hatch &LR; , R-Utah, didn't have anything to say about
that precedent, but he wasn't going to let the Dems wear the sole

   QINGDAO, China _ When Stephen Burrows of Anheuser-Busch traveled
here recently to meet the general manager of Tsingtao Brewery, he
saw it as a chance to get acquainted with the boss of China's most
famous beer company. His host, Peng Zuo Yi, saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him why so many foreign brands have failed in China,''
Peng said. ``They can't run their factories in China any longer.
They're all losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch may be the largest brewer in the world, but in
this seaside city where Chinese beer was born, Burrows was treated
more like a vanquished intruder than a fellow beer merchant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have struggled,'' Burrows acknowledged. ``Struggling is
something that happens when you go into a volatile market like
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Peng's solution is an alliance between Anheuser-Busch and
Tsingtao (pronounced CHING-dow), in which the companies would
distribute each other's beer in China and the United States.
Burrows, the chief executive of Anheuser-Busch International,
called it premature to talk about such a deal. But he agreed that
Tsingtao had changed markedly, and for the better, in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tsingtao is a different company,'' he said. ``It seems like
they've got a clearer strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   As China stands nervously on the threshold of World Trade
Organization membership, it will need companies like Tsingtao to
push through the open door. Once a bloated state-owned enterprise,
Tsingtao has transformed itself into a confident competitor. By
learning marketing skills from its foreign rivals and exploiting
its home-field advantages, Tsingtao has managed to stake out a
dominant position in the crowded and chaotic Chinese beer market.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist on the much-feared foreign invasion of China,
Tsingtao is now negotiating to buy three breweries from their
foreign owners.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While a rarity, Tsingtao is not the only Chinese company to make
it in the global economy. The Haier Group, an appliance maker also
based in Qingdao, began exporting refrigerators in 1992. It now has
more than a quarter of the small-refrigerator market in the United
States, and recently built a factory in South Carolina. Almost
bankrupt in 1984, Haier booked $3.2 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that with China's entry into the WTO, Chinese
national industry will be completely destroyed,'' Peng, 55, said.
``I don't think so. I think the success of Tsingtao shows that
competition can make us better.''
</P>
<P>
   Haier's chairman and chief executive, Zhang Ruimin, puts it
somewhat more poetically. ``We decided we didn't want to be eaten
by the wolf,'' he said. ``We wanted to dance with the wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many Chinese companies will be eaten by the wolves,
which is why China's joy at gaining admission to the world's club
of trading nations is tinged with apprehension. In the most
sclerotic state enterprises, the feeling is closer to dread. Yet in
this upwardly mobile port city on China's northern coast, Tsingtao
and Haier are held up as models of how China can pull down the
walls that surround its economy and still keep the predators at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a rich variety of manufacturing companies in this
city,'' said Wang Jiarui, Qingdao's mayor. ``Some will jump into
the world market; others will be edged out of it. But I still think
there are more opportunities than drawbacks to joining the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Qingdao's namesake company, Tsingtao Brewery Ltd., was founded
by the Germans who colonized this city in 1903. (The company
retains the old spelling of the town's name.) The original brewery
sits across the street from a park where German soldiers were once
housed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tsingtao was China's first beer, and it is still highly prized
here. Critics praise the freshness of its water, which is piped
from nearby Laoshan Mountain. Qingdao is steeped in the folkways of
the German beer industry. The company built an ersatz German
village on the outskirts of town for its annual beer festival.
There is also plenty of genuine German architecture.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, as China opened to the outside world again, Beijing
made Tsingtao the country's official export beer. It is now a
staple in Chinese restaurants from Seattle to Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government capitalized on this fame in 1993 by
selecting Tsingtao as one of the very first Chinese companies to
sell shares on the Hong Kong stock market. The initial public
offering was successful, but Tsingtao's state owners ordered it to
give some of the proceeds to other troubled state companies. This
made it an emblem of the dangers of investing in corporate China.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that black eye, the Chinese government decided to
open the beer market. Enticed by the prospect of 1.2 billion
beer-swilling Chinese, more than 60 foreign companies _ including
Budweiser, Foster's and San Miguel _ poured in. Teaming up with
Chinese investors, they bought and built breweries. They also spent
millions on splashy advertising and marketing campaigns, next to
which the Tsingtao name looked faded.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign brewers priced their beers at anywhere from 60 cents
to $1 a bottle, compared to about 40 cents for Tsingtao.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local governments began brewing beers that were even
cheaper than Tsingtao and popular with cash-strapped consumers. For
example, Yintang, a beer brewed in Beijing, sells for only 30 cents
a bottle. Some lesser-known local beers go for as little as 12
cents. After decades of dominance, Tsingtao found itself overtaken
in market share by Yintang.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to its problems, Tsingtao relied on an outdated network
of distributors who did not push the brand hard enough.

THE SLUR AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON

 By DAVID BROCK    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By now, most people have heard the sensational, if
implausible, charge that Hillary Clinton let loose an anti-Semitic
slur against her husband's congressional campaign manager 26 years
ago. The accusation appears in ``State of the Union,'' which
purports to examine the Clintons' marriage and is another in a long
line of books that delight in and profit from bashing the first
couple.
</P>
<P>
   In researching my political biography of Mrs. Clinton in 1995, I
conducted several lengthy interviews with the sources of this
disputed story, Paul Fray and his wife, Mary Lee. While they did
describe in colorful detail a shouting match between Mrs. Clinton
and Fray in campaign headquarters, they never mentioned her alleged
_ and, one has to think, unforgettable _ use of an ugly
anti-Semitic epithet. Apparently, in their dealings with Jerry
Oppenheimer, a former National Enquirer reporter and author of the
new book, the Frays' memory was somehow enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   But this incident is about more than recovered memory; it's
about authors anxious to make news in order to sell their books.
The current flap reminds me of my own difficult experience. My
book, ``The Seduction of Hillary Rodham'' was widely anticipated on
the political right as the October surprise that would swing the
1996 election to the Republicans. Having whetted the appetites of
the Clinton-hating audience with a lurid article about the
president's past sexual infidelities in The American Spectator,
which I now regret, and working under the pressure of justifying a
huge advance, I struggled mightily with giving my readers what I
knew they wanted: Hillary Clinton in leg irons.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't do it. The facts weren't there, nor was I willing any
longer to use innuendo and unverified charges to spice up my
material, which I had done in the past. After the book was
published, I found myself picking up the pieces of a broken career
as a right-wing muckraker, but I was proud of my book even though
it had trouble in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   All authors of big nonfiction books face the arduous task of
generating headlines to spur book sales. Too often, authors succumb
to market pressures by trafficking in rumor, using unreliable
sources or embellishing their material, all in the service of hype
and buzz. Publishing houses are notoriously lax about
fact-checking. Books are rarely retracted or even corrected. Most
authors caught short, and I speak from experience, are able to
bluster their way through the controversies incited by their shaky
work. Sad to say, the controversies themselves are good for
business.
</P>
<P>
   In writing about the Clintons, the phenomenon is magnified
greatly. For one thing, it's incredibly hard to unearth new
revelations about the first couple after a decade of examination by
zealous prosecutors, Republican-led congressional committees and a
feverish press corps.
</P>
<P>
   Serious, respected authors do try to present new material. In
``The Choice'' a book on the 1996 presidential campaign, Bob
Woodward of the Washington Post presented what Mrs. Clinton said
were unremarkable brainstorming sessions with friends into a series
of loopy, imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hillary's Choice,'' Gail Sheehy read immense psychological
significance into Mrs. Clinton's father's absence from her
Wellesley commencement speech. Oops: He was there, according to the
first lady's aides.
</P>
<P>
   Other authors have sought to exploit a peculiar distortion in
the market: anti-Clinton books sell. Gary Aldrich, a former FBI
agent, was the first to tap into this vein in 1996 with ``Unlimited
Access,'' a best seller filled with highly charged allegations that
even the author conceded were ``hypothetical.'' His publisher,
Regnery, then churned out a slew of anti-Clinton books, many of
which contained nothing more than conspiratorial fantasy _ and sold
them mostly through right-wing book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream book publishers soon followed. In just the last year,
three authors _ the biographer Joyce Milton, the Republican
speechwriter Peggy Noonan and Laura Ingraham, a conservative pundit
_ jumped on the Hillary-bashing gravy train.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the self-promotion game is elementary, and Oppenheimer,
whose publisher, HarperCollins, is owned by Rupert Murdoch, seems
to be playing it expertly. In a way, you have to admire the man's
ingenuity. Until now, no one has come close to matching the Starr
report to Congress for shocking Clinton news.
</P>
<P>
   But one leak about the Oppenheimer book to the Drudge Report, an
anti-Clinton Web site, is all it took to reactivate the lucrative,
right-wing talk-show machinery and the New York tabloids. Then came
the down-channel cable talk shows. Now, Oppenheimer's book is
moving up the charts at Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   This is all depressingly predictable: The more implausible the
charge, the more it runs counter to everything we know about the
subject, the more news and sales it generates.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Hillary Clinton has been portrayed (by me,
among countless others) as a bleeding-heart liberal. Now, she's
suddenly a bigot.
</P>
<P>
   I don't buy it. And I hope we've read the last book bashing the
Clintons.

<P>
   It's the wealthiest families in America, a few thousand, who
would benefit most from the estate tax repeal for which the
Republican Congress just voted _ with the support of Gov. George W.
Bush _ as well as from the massive income tax cut that Bush has
proposed. But is it worth it, given the inevitable public backlash
over awarding hundreds of billions of dollars to those who need it
the least?
</P>
<P>
   As a Republican, I ask my party: Is it worth it to be known
increasingly as protector of the rich and powerful, despite the
appreciative response in campaign contributions?
</P>
<P>
   The party risks placing itself out of what my uncle, Nelson
Rockefeller, called the mainstream. At the 1964 GOP convention,
when he was the governor of New York and a presidential candidate,
I watched him issue a warning against extremism in the party. ``You
may not like to hear it,'' he told the crowd trying to silence him
with boos, ``but it's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the truth is this: It's out of the mainstream when the
Republican Congress fails to protect patients' rights, withholds
education funding and makes war on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   It's out of the mainstream _ and at odds with true Republican
principles of fiscal responsibility _ to plunge back into deficit
spending, as Bush has in Texas with big tax cuts for the oil
industry and others. It's out of the mainstream _ and at odds with
traditional Republican standards of liberty _ to put the federal
government between a woman and her doctor in matters of
reproductive choice, as Bush and the party would try to do by
overturning Roe vs. Wade. And it's out of the mainstream _ and at
odds with Republican preference for government closest to the
people _ to override local government efforts to limit sprawl and
protect drinking water, as Bush did by veto, or to side with gun
makers against local attempts to hold them accountable for harm
done.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from the American mainstream _ and at odds with talk
of ``compassion'' _ to withhold medical insurance from 200,000
children, as Bush did for three years in a state that ranks
rock-bottom last in family health coverage; to try to invade
teachers' retirement funds; to oppose a hate crimes law even after
a black man was dragged to death; and to allow concealed guns to be
carried even into church.
</P>
<P>
   What a contrast with the record and values of progressive
Republican governors like New York's Theodore Roosevelt, Nelson
Rockefeller and, yes, George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a mainstream Republican to do in this year's
elections? Think hard _ and act independently.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, after a Florida jury ordered the five leading tobacco
companies to pay $145 billion in punitive damages, the industry's
lawyers reacted calmly, saying the verdict would have ``no
practical impact.'' By contrast, Stanley Rosenblatt, who represents
the plaintiffs in the case, a suit by Florida smokers, seemed
disconcerted by the other side's confidence that it would prevail
on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   This spectacle of cocky losers and a rattled winner was not just
a reversal of expected roles but a dramatic shift from a few months
ago, when it was doubtful whether the tobacco companies would be
able to appeal at all. Then, Florida law would have required them
to post appeal bonds equal to the amount of the award plus 20
percent. With a $145 billion award, the total would have been twice
the $80 billion stock value of the entire industry. Coming up with
that would have been tough, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   But in May, the Florida Legislature came to the industry's
rescue by passing a law that limits appeal bonds to $100 million
per defendant. On the face of it, Florida's sudden concern for the
tobacco industry's welfare is puzzling. After all, this is the same
Legislature that passed an earlier law authorizing the state to sue
cigarette manufacturers for the cost of treating smoking-related
illness under Medicaid. Facing a rigged game, the tobacco companies
agreed to pay the state $13 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now Florida's legislators apparently are eager to protect that
loot. Rather than applauding the class-action suit as another
attempt to punish the tobacco companies, they have protected the
industry's ability to appeal. If allowed to stand, the $145 billion
award would endanger the industry's ability to continue paying the
state, providing money that helps subsidize legislators' favorite
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in the other states are in a similar position. Under
settlements reached in 1997 and 1998, they are supposed to receive
more than $200 billion in tobacco money during the next couple of
decades. Smokers, the supposed victims of Big Tobacco, are picking
up the tab through higher cigarette prices.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement magnifies the government's financial stake in
the cigarette business, which was already bigger than that of the
tobacco companies. As of December, according to a calculation by
Philip Morris, the average state cigarette tax, weighted by sales,
was 40 cents a pack, on top of a 34-cent federal tax (scheduled to
hit 39 cents in 2002). By contrast, Philip Morris was making a
profit of roughly 28 cents on each pack of Marlboros.
</P>
<P>
   Some will protest that there is a moral distinction here. To be
sure: While politicians and tobacco companies both take money from

 QINGDAO, China: hard enough. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Our sales agents tended to focus on fancy restaurants, while
ignoring the needs of the common drinker,'' said Peng, a
plainspoken man who wears short-sleeve shirts and admits that he
does not really like beer.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, 70 percent of China's consumers fit the
definition of common drinker. They make enough money to buy beer,
but will not pay for a premium brand. So Tsingtao was squeezed on
both ends of the market: at the high end by Budweiser and Foster's,
and at the low end by the likes of Yintang.
</P>
<P>
   While China's beer market grew tenfold in the 1990s, Tsingtao's
production increased just 20 percent. From 1994 to 1996, the
company lost money.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Qingdao in 1996, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who
was then a cabinet member, became alarmed that China's flagship
beer seemed to be fading. Qingdao's leaders plucked Peng out of a
successful state-owned food company and sent him on a rescue
mission. Peng promptly got rid of most of the senior managers and
set about overhauling the brewer.
</P>
<P>
   He set up a new sales network, with 45 branch offices, to
promote Tsingtao more aggressively. And he started buying breweries
to produce the flagship brand, as well as lower-cost local brands.
Buying breweries in the hinterland enabled Peng to avoid one of the
pitfalls of the Chinese industry: protectionism by local
authorities who jealously guard their home brew.
</P>
<P>
   Tsingtao, which reclaimed the No. 1 position last year, has
acquired 22 breweries from Shenzhen in the south to Beijing in the
north. Owning more breweries has allowed Peng to bypass China's
clotted distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, he's consolidating the industry,'' said Jack
Perkowski, the chief executive of Asimco, an Asian investment
company that owns two small Beijing beer companies, Five Star and
Three Ring. ``They want to be the first Chinese company to have a
truly national presence.''
</P>
<P>
   While Peng was whipping Tsingtao into shape, the foreigners
began discovering some hard truths about the Chinese market. The
premium segment, in which the non-Chinese producers compete,
accounts for barely 7 percent of overall sales. As price deflation
has rippled through the Chinese economy, consumers have been more
reluctant than ever to pay extra for an upscale brand.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign companies also made heavy upfront investments.
Burrows said Anheuser-Busch paid $52 million for its brewery in the
central city of Wuhan. The company spent millions more to upgrade
the factory, not to mention on advertising and marketing. Although
its main brand, Budweiser, is quite popular here, the sales are too
small and costs are too high to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get enough volume,'' Perkowski said, ``particularly
if you set up a brewery that looks like a brewery in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrows said sales of Budweiser improved this year, after two
lackluster years. He predicted that Anheuser-Busch would turn a
profit in China in five years. Burrows said that with 200 sales
agents in 31 Chinese cities, Anheuser-Busch was determined to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign brands, however, are sounding a retreat. Foster's
of Australia sold two of its Chinese breweries last year, keeping
one in Shanghai. Lion Nathan, a New Zealand brewer, said it may
leave altogether. By the end of August, Tsingtao will announce
three acquisitions of foreign-invested breweries _ two in Beijing
and one in Shanghai. Peng declined to name the companies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Peng, though, is looking beyond the breweries to a partnership
with Anheuser-Busch. He said a deal would cut Anheuser's costs
because it must now transport all its beer from its Wuhan brewery.
It could avoid those long trips by using Tsingtao's plants in
Beijing and Shanghai. In return, Tsingtao would brew its beer in
Anheuser's factories in the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An alliance with Anheuser-Busch would be rich in symbolism. Five
years ago, Anheuser bought a 5 percent stake in Tsingtao, and the
two companies discussed ways to cooperate. But the American company
was put off by the Chinese company's balky managers. Coming back to
the table to make a deal would send a clear signal that Tsingtao is
a global player.
</P>
<P>
   It would also help Peng realize his dream of making Tsingtao one
of the world's top 10 brewers by 2003, its 100th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top leaders of China were worried that Chinese beer would
collapse because of all the competition,'' Peng said. ``But five
years later, it turns out the Tsingtao has succeeded. Our attitude
has changed from fear of the foreigners to driving them out of the
market.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you considered changing jobs lately, chances are good that
you consulted the Internet to explore job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is rapidly changing the way workers search for jobs
and employers recruit workers. The resulting speed and ease of
filling jobs have significant implications for unemployment, pay
and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Internet job boards took off after Monster.com and HotJobs.com
advertised during the 1999 Super Bowl. There are an estimated
30,000 job boards worldwide, ranging from Monster.com, which says
it has 3.9 million resumes and 397,000 job postings, to more
specialized job boards, such as Accounting.Com and utah-jobs.com.
</P>
<P>
   The arcane field of economics known as ``search theory'' is well
suited for considering the economic impact of e-cruiting. The key
concept is the ``matching function,'' which governs the speed at
which workers fill vacancies. Search costs slow down job matching,
which contributes to unemployment and job vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Think of a game of musical chairs. Lower search costs are akin
to playing the music faster, which enables players to find their
chairs sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The typical job board posts help-wanted ads or collects resumes;
some do both. The cost of placing an ad on a job board is about 5
percent as much as it costs to place a classified ad in a major
newspaper for 30 days, and the reach can be as great or greater.
Other advantages of electronic job boards are that ads can be
searched for listings in any desired occupation or location, and
employers can continuously update and edit ads.
</P>
<P>
   Job seekers can often apply for jobs simply by pressing a button
that instantly zaps their resume to prospective employers. Some job
boards match job seekers to job vacancies with computer algorithms,
and automatically notify workers of potential matches via e-mail
messages each morning.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers, such as Sprint, also find it advantageous to
screen job candidates by administering employment tests directly on
line, with the assistance of companies such as eTest.net, a unit of
the Management Psychology Group of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is lower job search costs for both employees and
employers, and less time required to fill a vacancy or find a job _
trends that are expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Job boards are in part substituting for help-wanted ads placed
in newspapers. The number of such ads usually increases when the
unemployment rate declines, yet the Conference Board finds that
newspaper help-wanted advertising fell last year, when unemployment
was the lowest it had been in 30 years. And the volume has been
flat throughout the booming 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployed workers were two-thirds as likely to surf the
Internet to search for work as to look at traditional help-wanted
ads, according to a new study of the December 1998 Current
Population Survey by the economists Peter Kuhn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and Mikal Skuterud of McMaster
University in Hamilton, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Who uses the Internet to search for work? Kuhn and Skuterud
found that 15 percent of unemployed job seekers and 7 percent of
employed workers regularly used the Internet to search for a job.
Among those with access to the Web from home, these numbers swelled
to half of the unemployed and 15 percent of the employed.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found a digital divide: 16 percent of white
unemployed job seekers used the Internet to search for work,
compared with just 7 percent of Hispanics and 9 percent of blacks.
Among those with Internet access, however, blacks and Hispanics are
more likely than whites to use the Internet for job searches.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of professional, managerial and technical
unemployed workers used the Internet to search for work, compared
with only 5 percent of manual workers.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, though the Internet allows for faster and cheaper
job searches, this might not lower unemployment. If workers can
search for jobs more easily, they may become choosier and may
require a higher salary before they will accept a job. Likewise,
employers may become choosier and search until they find a more
productive employee.
</P>
<P>
   Implications for worker turnover are also ambiguous. On the one
hand, many workers will be induced to enter the job market and
switch jobs more frequently. On the other hand, if workers and
employers invest more in learning about each other, presumably the
quality of worker-job matches will improve, and resignations and
firings will decline. Because many job boards are aimed at passive
job seekers _ those who are not sure they want to move and who are
not actively looking _ the former effect is likely to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   One prediction is unambiguous: Productivity should increase as a
result of lower search costs. This is good news because the labor
market is dynamic, with more than 30 million workers and jobs
turning over each year. The increased productivity would be divided
by employees and employers in the form of higher pay and profit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although average pay is expected to rise, not all paychecks are
expected to rise equally. Workers who settled for jobs paying less
than they could get elsewhere should get a raise. Also, greater
access to salary information over the Web should lead to more
uniformity in pay. But Daron Acemoglu, an economics professor at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, expects that a wider
electronic job market will enable employers to replace less skilled
workers who previously were hired because it was too costly to
search for more qualified workers.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn raises another concern: lower search costs could reduce the
prevalence of long-term implicit contracts, which tend to spread
risks and reduce wage dispersion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, those who lack access to the Internet
job bazaar will suffer restricted job opportunities. The digital
divide has been hard to bridge, and efforts to provide such access
and search assistance are increasingly critical. One new effort
that may play a valuable role is America's One-Stop Career Center
System, the central focus of the Labor Department's employment and
training network.

HOLOCAUST RESTITUTION GROUP PLANS TO PRESS AUSTRIA

 By EDWARD WONG   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An international organization that seeks compensation
for Holocaust survivors said Wednesday that it planned to pressure
the Austrian government to acknowledge complicity during the Nazi
regime and to improve financial reparations to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty delegates at a two-day annual meeting of the Claims
Conference in New York voted unanimously to approach the Austrian
government with three requests: to acknowledge that it had a role
in the Holocaust; that it make payments to survivors even before a
final accounting report is completed, and that it make some sort of
restitution for property taken from Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've solved so many issues except for the Austrian issue that
it sticks out like a sore thumb,'' said Israel Singer, chief
negotiator for the group. ``This is an obligation on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Claims Conference, which started in the 1950s,
distributed $239 million to survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The group, officially known as the Conference on Jewish Material
Claims Against Germany, was instrumental in pressuring the German
government and companies to create a $5 billion fund for Nazi-era
slave laborers and forced laborers. That agreement came to fruition
in March. Since its founding, the group has helped to get Germany
to set aside $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The group also lobbied the Swiss banks that decided in 1998 to
pay $1.5 billion to survivors because the banks were storing money
that Nazis had seized from Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Austrian government agreed to give 70,000
schillings, just under $5,000 today, each to Jews from Austria who
survived the war.
</P>
<P>
   It is also completing an agreement to make reparations for slave
and forced laborers, in exchange for the United States' dropping
all lawsuits filed on behalf of those victims. But the Claims
Conference said Wednesday that it disapproved of that agreement
because it did not address the issue of seized property.
</P>
<P>
   The group estimates that 70,000 apartments and up to 30,000
businesses were taken from Jews living in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   When Germany took over Austria in 1938, scholars say, about
180,000 Jews lived in the country. About 50,000 were sent to
concentration camps, mostly in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more than a financial problem, it is a psychological
problem,'' said Moshe H. Jahoda, the group's representative in
Austria. Jahoda said 23 members of his family were killed in camps,
including his parents and younger sister. Their apartment and
printing business were taken from them, he said, and all he has
received is the 70,000 schillings.
</P>
<P>
   George Kilzer, an Austrian consul in New York, said that his
government had not heard of Wednesday's vote by the Claims
Conference. ``We know, of course, these are issues, but so far it
has not been brought officially toward us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the slave labor reparations, he said that ``is more or
less settled already.''
</P>
<P>
   Austria has long said it was a victim of German aggression. But
the government's agreement in 1990 to pay $200 million in benefits
to Jews who suffered there during the Nazi era suggested to some
Jewish groups that Austria had begun to accept responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel of Austria sent a
letter to Singer expressing his interest in settling quickly on
reparations. ``I fully understand the concern that in view of the
age of the Holocaust survivors quick solutions are asked for,''
Schussel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Austrian officials appointed a special envoy,
Ernst Sucharipa, to negotiate with the Claims Conference on
speedier reparations and property restitution. Sucharipa is
officially unaffiliated with the coalition government, because the
Claims Conference has refused to negotiate with a government that
includes Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   So far, representatives from both sides have met only once,
indicating Austria's reluctance to negotiate, Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Austrians just keep trying to delay the issue,'' Singer
said. ``They just need the willingness to deal with this.''

MARKEY FACES RESIDENCY DECISION

 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The death of Representative Edward J. Markey's
father last week was a personal loss for his family, but it also
puts the Massachusetts Democrat in a ticklish political position.
</P>
<P>
   Markey lives with his wife, Dr. Susan J. Blumenthal, in an
$800,000 house in Chevy Chase, Md., but for years he has claimed
his political residency in his childhood bedroom at his parent's
home in Malden.
</P>
<P>
   Markey's mother, Christina, died in 1998, and with the death of
his 89-year-old father, John, last Thursday, the disposition of
their house will fall to Markey; his brother John, who lives in
Belmont, Mass.; his brother Richard, a resident of Charlestown,
Mass.; and his aunt, Marguerite Markey of Stoneham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed intends to continue to maintain his residence at 7 Townsend
St.,'' Markey's spokesman, David Moulton, said Wednesday without
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the house were sold, there is no law that requires
Markey to be a resident in his district, but the issue has been a
nettlesome one for Markey in the past. His failure to own a house
in the 7th Congressional District over his 24 years in Congress
flared up during his 1994 reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are about being a voice for the people we hope to
represent, not a Washington insider that's removed and has no
contact or connection with the district,'' said then-challenger
Brad Bailey, who lost his campaign but later served an appointment
as Middlesex County sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Residency is a prominent issue this year in the US Senate race
between Hillary Rodham Clinton, an Illinois native and longtime
Arkansas resident, and Representative Rick Lazio, a Republican who
was raised on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said recently: ``For me, New York isn't just a mailing
address; it's my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts election law does not require members of Congress
to live in their districts, only that they be an ``inhabitant'' of
the state when elected. The Constitution says only that candidates
live in the state where an election is held.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, members of Congress keep an apartment or share living
quarters in Washington while maintaining a primary residence in the
area they represent. They are paid $141,300 per year, a sum they
often justify because of the expense of keeping two homes.
</P>
<P>
   All other members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation
_ including Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry _ own
property in Massachusetts except for Representative Barney Frank.
The Massachusetts Democrat, who had been living with his widowed
sister the past five years, began renting his own apartment in
Newton, Mass. in May.

   Representative Jim McGovern, who serves the Worcester area in
Congress, bought a house there two years ago. He also has a home on
Capitol Hill with his wife, Lisa, an employee of the federal
General Services Administration, and their 2-year-old son, Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's up in Worcester, that's where they stay,'' said
McGovern spokesman Michael Mershon, referring to the family's house
on Burncoat Street. ``When Congress is in session, they live
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Watanabe, a political science professor at the University
of Massachusetts at Boston, said any effect of such residency
criticism depends on the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think on these kind of issues, one can't talk about them in
the abstract. They are more of a problem for some candidates and
not for others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be an issue for a candidate seeking an open seat or a
candidate who is fighting against a seat held by an incumbent, but
if you are an incumbent who has held the seat for a long time, it's
not a problem,'' Watanabe added. ``In Markey's case, it's an
irritant for some, but it's not enough to change the outcome of an
election.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Markey is unopposed for reelection this fall.

COMMON TEST FOR CANCER MISSES TOO MANY GROWTHS, STUDIES FIND

<TEXT>
<P>
   The test most commonly recommended to screen healthy adults for
colorectal cancer misses too many precancerous growths and should
be replaced by a more extensive procedure that examines the entire
colon, doctors are reporting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both tests require inserting long tubes equipped with cameras
into the rectum to search for abnormal tissue. The difference lies
in how far the tubes go.
</P>
<P>
   The more common test, sigmoidoscopy, reaches only about 2 feet
into the colon and is generally used to screen people 50 and older
with an average risk of colon cancer. The more thorough procedure,
colonoscopy, probes the full length of the colon, 4 to 5 feet, and
is usually reserved for people with a higher risk, such as those
with blood in their stool, a history of intestinal polyps or a
family history of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmoidoscopy, which is cheaper and easier to perform, has been
used for screening on the optimistic theory that if no
abnormalities were seen in the lower colon, none were likely to be
found higher up.
</P>
<P>
   But that theory is contradicted by two studies being published
Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine that included a
total of more than 5,000 healthy people screened by colonoscopy.
One study, with more than 3,000 patients, is the largest study to
date of the procedure. Both studies show that it is not safe to
assume that the upper colon is healthy just because the lower third
looks normal. On the contrary, the studies found that half the
patients who had precancerous lesions in the upper colon had
nothing abnormal lower down. If those patients had had only
sigmoidoscopy, they would have mistakenly been given a clean bill
of health and left with dangerous, undetected growths high in the
colon.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies confirm many doctors' suspicions about
sigmoidoscopy, said Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky, chief of
gastroenterology at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wrote an
editorial that accompanied the two articles. Podolsky said many
experts think sigmoidoscopy makes about as much sense as screening
women for breast cancer by doing mammograms on only one breast. He
urged that doctors recommend a colonoscopy to all patients 50 and
older, and that insurers pay for the more thorough procedure. He
also said that when the difference between the tests is explained
to them, many patients prefer a colonoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Medicare and most insurers do not cover colonoscopy
as a screening test, and pay for it only for high-risk patients. A
sigmoidoscopy costs about $200, a colonoscopy $1,200 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the insurance industry, Dr. Donald Young,
medical director of the Health Insurance Association of America,
said that the new findings mean that current guidelines for
coverage should be re-examined, but that it would be premature to
change the rules until medical experts can assess all the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David A. Lieberman, director of one of the studies and chief
of gastroenterology at Oregon Health Sciences University in
Portland, said, ``I think these data do support offering
colonoscopy as a screening option.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American
Cancer Society, said that patients should consider the new findings
about colonoscopy. But, he added, ``quite a lot more needs to be
learned about implementing it at the community level in terms of
cost, safety and acceptability before we could recommend it as
routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barnett Kramer, senior medical scientist in the division of
cancer prevention at the National Cancer Institute, said, ``This is
important enough information from both of these studies that it
should be incorporated into the discussion with people who are
pursuing their options about screening.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kramer also cautioned against offering a blanket
recommendation that everyone 50 and over have the test. For one
thing, he said, the studies were not designed to determine whether
colonoscopy actually prevented deaths from colorectal cancer. In
addition, colonoscopy has a low but slightly higher risk than
sigmoidoscopy of causing bleeding or injuring the colon, he said.
In Lieberman's study, 10 patients out of 3,121 (0.3 percent) had
serious complications, including six cases of bleeding and one
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, colonoscopy, unlike sigmoidoscopy, often requires
sedation, which can have side effects of its own and which means
that patients cannot drive themselves home after the procedure.
Nonetheless, some people, given the nature of the test, prefer
sedation.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer also said that it would not be possible now to offer
colonoscopy to everyone 50 and older, because the test has to be
performed by a specialist in gastroenterology, and there are not
enough specialists to go around. Smith agreed, and added that it
was important to ensure that specialists were available to perform
the test on high-risk patients who need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy can be done by a family
practitioner, internist or nurse practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   Colorectal cancer kills 56,000 Americans a year, and is the
second leading cause of cancer death, after lung cancer. Doctors
say many of the deaths could be prevented by screenings. Unlike the
tests for breast and prostate cancer, which find cancers that have
already formed, procedures that examine the colon can actually
detect abnormal tissue and remove it before it turns cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their potential to save lives, the screening tests
for colon cancer are not popular: All adults 50 and older are
candidates for a screening, but fewer than a third actually are
tested. Given that many people already shun sigmoidoscopy, there
may not be great enthusiasm for an even more invasive test.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the unpleasant aspects of the tests themselves,
most patients dread the preparation, which involves cleaning out
the colon. Sigmoidoscopy requires enemas, and colonoscopy requires
a liquid diet for one to three days until the night before the
test, when patients must drink about a gallon and a half of a
powerful laxative solution that purges the colon. For that phase,
Lieberman said, he tells his patients to take a good book or a TV
set into the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics on compliance with colon cancer screening
represent a tragedy,'' Lieberman said. ``They are much lower than
for breast and cervical cancer, and yet colon cancer kills far more
people and is far more preventable. But we don't like conversations
about our bowels. There's been a problem with patients requesting
screening and with physicians offering it. A Gallup poll of the
public last year said that 80 to 90 percent said their doctors had
not talked to them about colon cancer screening.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and his team conducted their study at 13 Veterans
Affairs medical centers, performing colonoscopies on 3,121 patients
ages 50 to 75, with an average age of 62.9 years; 96.8 percent were
male, and 83.6 percent were white. One percent of the patients had
cancer, and 10 percent had growths in the colon that Lieberman
called ``serious,'' meaning abnormalities that could turn
cancerous. Patients with growths in the lower part of the colon _
the part reached by sigmoidoscopy _ were more likely than those
with no growths in that region to have abnormalities higher up in
the colon as well. But some with healthy tissue below had dangerous
growths above, and if those patients had been given only
sigmoidoscopy, more than 60 precancerous lesions would have gone
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Findings were similar in the second study, directed by Dr.
Thomas F. Imperiale, of the Indiana University Medical Center in
Indianapolis. That study included nearly 2,000 healthy men and
women screened by colonoscopy.

AT HOME WITH ARIANNA HUFFINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By    RUSS BAKER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Political insiders may debate the motivations
behind the latest evolutionary twist in the remarkable life of
Arianna Huffington, but one thing is certain: Huffington
understands the element of surprise. She stood by her desk in her
elegant, sun-dappled home office on a perfect Southern California
morning early this week, talking about her latest and indisputably
biggest adventure. Up on a landing a library wall panel swung open,
revealing a hidden room. A young woman popped out, and then a
second entered from another part of the house, climbed the spiral
staircase and disappeared behind the bookcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people can you fit in a Volkswagen?'' Huffington
cracked delightedly in her Greek-with-a-touch-of-London accent, as
she settled into a gold brocade sofa. Huffington explained that she
had converted a guest bedroom off the landing into an office for
the two staff members and the handful of paid interns helping her
and a coalition of citizens' groups stage a happening certain to
give fits to Al Gore and George W. Bush _ a milestone of sorts on
Huffington's dizzying political journey from right to left.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, as the Republican and Democratic parties hold their
national conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, respectively,
shadow conventions will convene nearby, providing a running
commentary and critique, with teach-ins, reform politicians and
stand-up comedians. The goal of Huffington and the Internet
impresario Peter Hirshberg is to ``give voice to millions of
Americans currently shut out of the national debate.'' Perhaps
coincidentally, Huffington has managed to harness herself and her
unusual ability to generate buzz on three issues whose solutions
have eluded Democrats and Republicans alike: the tainted campaign
finance system, the growing income gap and the costly war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington has proven expert at getting attention for causes _
including herself _ during a varied career as socialite,
politician's wife, author and columnist. To publicize the shadow
conventions, she called on media favorites like Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.) and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. She joined with citizen
advocacy groups like Common Cause, and tapped her friends,
including the actors Warren Beatty and Ron Silver and the comedian
Bill Maher. She helped raise $400,000 in seed money from such
disparate sources as the billionaire philanthropist George Soros'
nonprofit Open Society Institute and the Pew Charitable Trust, and
got promises of ice cream from Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's providing fresh and new ideas in a very thoughtful and
very provocative way,'' McCain said. ``I find her to be adding a
lot to the national debate on the issues,'' but, he added wryly,
``I told her, `I'm going to come and tell you why you should vote
for Governor Bush.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical. ``It's easy for someone who has maids
making her beds to talk about voiceless Americans,'' said Bob
Mulholland, a California Democratic Party official. ``Most
Americans get a kick out of somebody like her preaching to the rest
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   People may argue about why a former right-wing conservative, who
once counted herself among Newt Gingrich's most loyal friends and
admirers, is now encouraging her troops to lob grenades at the
establishment. But no one can dispute that this is one determined
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she took a red-eye to New York for a shadow
convention planning luncheon, flew to Athens to pick up her two
daughters, rocketed back to Santa Barbara for a weekend drug policy
retreat (and her 50th birthday dinner) then went back to Los
Angeles for the party she held on Monday for Norman Mailer's wife,
Norris Church, who was celebrating the publication of her first
novel, ``Windchill Summer'' (Random House).
</P>
<P>
   Liberals are often willing to put aside political differences
when dinner and a little glamour are at stake. Fine wines and
lovely surroundings (including a portrait of Huffington by
Francoise Gilot, Picasso's mistress) don't hurt. Which may explain
why about 80 people came to the event, including Marla Maples (who
is marrying Norman Mailer's son) and Beatty, who showed up late.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington swept down her spiral staircase in a flowing,
graphite-colored, pinstriped linen pantsuit, seemingly eager that
everything be perfect and everyone have a grand time. The guests
seemed equally concerned that they flatter her sufficiently for a
return invitation.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included Huffington's extensive supporting cast,
including her wardrobe designer and the Los Angeles celebrity chef
Hans Rockenwagner, who is preparing the food for the shadow
convention, Huffington announced. Then she pointed out Antonio
Villaraigosa, the former speaker of the California Assembly and a
current Los Angeles mayoral candidate, whom she had urged to be a
presenter at the event. ``I'm trying to get the shadow convention
into every conversation,'' she said conspiratorially.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington's life has been one of constant motion, and _ in the
spirit of her nemesis, Al Gore _ regular reinvention. Born Arianna
Stassinopoulos, she grew up in modest circumstances in and around
Athens, became a stellar debater at Cambridge and soon wrote her
first book, a critique of feminism, and a second, prescribing a
spiritual revolution as an antidote to an empty, materialistic
society. She landed in New York in 1980, and wrote a controversial
best seller about the opera legend Maria Callas and then a harsh
denunciation of Picasso. While living in California, she was
introduced by the socialite Ann Getty to Michael Huffington, the
shy son of a self-made oil millionaire, and they married and
settled in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although dismissed by some as a gold digger, Huffington showed
resourcefulness when it became apparent that Michael's income as an
arms-control negotiator for President George Bush was insufficient
to support their lifestyle and that his real worth was bound up in
stock in the family firm. She went on the lecture circuit to pay
the bills for their Georgetown home and staff.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Michael Huffington won a seat in the House from Santa
Barbara. Within two years, he had made a bid for the Senate,
spending nearly $30 million of his own money. The seemingly
reticent candidate often seemed overshadowed by his dynamic wife,
who virtually directed the vitriolic campaign. He lost by 2
percentage points. Arianna Huffington turned her attention to her
column, cheerleading for the conservative Contract With America and
becoming a power hostess, Tina Brown with a Melina Mercouri accent.
</P>
<P>
   Television beckoned. Between frequent spots on ``Politically
Incorrect,'' she started her own think tank, the Center for
Effective Compassion. It stressed private charity, rather than
government aid, for helping the poor. The group fizzled, and so did
her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   She confided that she is seeing no one special right now and
would not discuss her divorce settlement or any details of her
marriage to Huffington, who revealed his homosexuality in a 1999
Esquire profile.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Huffingtons relocated to separate houses in
Los Angeles. Reluctant at first to leave Washington, Huffington
nevertheless found her perfect roost, in the Brentwood section of
Los Angeles, an affluent but understated area near the ocean. The
house is a yellow Italianate, built in the 1920s, with four
bedrooms, a foyer with an arched Romanesque ceiling, a French
garden hidden behind dense foliage and plenty of room to entertain.
``I didn't want anything big and pretentious, you know, some of
these big Beverly Hills homes,'' she said. (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In California, her views shifted leftward. Soon, as in
Washington, her home became a salon. The Capitol Hill and think
tank types were replaced by Beatty; Pat Caddell, a Jimmy Carter
pollster and now a consultant for television's ``West Wing''; and
Richard Walden, head of Operation USA, a humanitarian-relief group
that uses its Hollywood connections to get aid into atypical
recipient countries, including Cuba. Her columns seemed to
gradually uncouple from the conservative express.
</P>
<P>
   She is now the host of about one book party a month, as well as
frequent dinners. The writer Christopher Hitchens noted that
Huffington had held a party for the release of his book on
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the salon of Los Angeles,'' said Michael Jackson, a
popular Los Angeles radio talk show host who attended Huffington's
party on Monday night for Norris Church. ``There's nobody who can
attract the variety and caliber that she does.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffington can play the wonk: She's full of statistics about
poverty and racial disparities in drug convictions, gleaned from
her correspondents and assembled by her research assistant. But
when asked to compare her current and former allies, she turns pure
politico: ``I think these distinctions are completely obsolete. A
lot of my friends are just as disenchanted with the Democratic
Party as I am with the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, her new crowd is a whole lot more left, filled,
for example, with correspondents for the Nation magazine, who have
been openly squabbling with colleagues over whether Huffington's
change of heart is to be trusted. One convert is Hitchens, who had
ridiculed her in print. Recalling Huffington's dalliance with New
Age cults and the subsequent Gingrich era, he said, ``Maybe she's
finally found a safe harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Her unsuccessful efforts to assist poverty-fighting groups
helped change her political leanings. ``I saw how much harder it
was to raise money for them than it was to raise money for the
opera or a fashionable museum,'' she said. ``So I have definitely
shifted my view on the role of government funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffington also lost patience with her conservative allies and
their promises of attacking poverty their way. ``It's now six years
since the Republican takeover of Congress, and none of these things
have been accomplished,'' she said. ``There was not a collective
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Scheer, the liberal Los Angeles Times columnist who has
been a regular sparring partner of Huffington in print and on radio
for years, said: ``If Arianna were a man, there would be no attacks
on her whatsoever. Sure, she's shifted her views. Sure, she's
inconsistent. Sure, she likes to be on TV. But I find her one of
the brightest, most decent and hardest-working people involved in
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with her column, which appears in more than 100 newspapers
and on two Web sites, she has a recent book, ``How to Overthrow the
Government'' (Regan Books), a citizens' primer on the corrosive
effect of money in politics and what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   As with many nascent revolutions, the one Huffington wants to
ignite is comfortable behind the barricades. Surrounded by a
buzzing, chirping and whirring cacophony of phones, intercoms and
fax machines, she maintains a sunny calm, like a queen in a
madhouse. Helping her keep a Martha Stewart-like grip on life are a
nanny, a housekeeper and a house manager, who doubles as her
driver.
</P>
<P>
   Light streams into her high-ceilinged home office through a
cathedral window. The walls are covered with paintings by her
daughters (9 and 11), who provide the main diversion from her
work-centered existence. She especially likes taking them on
Saturday hikes in the nearby mountains. Huffington's 78-year-old
mother occupies a separate wing and until a recent illness did all
the cooking, even forcing her Greek specialties on the FedEx man.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington likes to work East Coast hours. She's up early,
phoning her contacts on Capitol Hill or in New York, then gets her
children ready for school. Her husband frequently chauffeurs them.
</P>
<P>
   The yard, where she stages events for her children's private
school, has a pool, a cage with rabbits and a hillside space where
her daughters have their vegetable garden.
</P>
<P>
   As the tour ended, she led a visitor into her daughters'
playroom, where a staff worker, looking quintessentially Southern
California with a sort of Gypsy-style hairdo and dual earrings in
each ear, was typing on a laptop amid the toys. ``Reliving his
childhood,'' Huffington said, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs on the landing, the panel covering the hidden room was
again nearly closed. Atop it was a mischievous 15th-century
painting, showing two laughing cardinals horsing around over a game
of cards. It was titled ``The Winning Hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Down below, at her desk, Huffington could be overheard on a
conference call, declaring triumphantly, ``Will they help? Of
course, darling.''

 &HT;    Stakes are high in race for open seat
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Rep. John Lewis' expression of interest Wednesday in
the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the death of Paul Coverdell was the
earliest, but it certainly won't be the last we can expect in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting the memory of Coverdell's taciturn nature, some of the
other possibilities are waiting until after the funeral to make any
public comment.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, several of those who might figure in this unexpected
Senate race are men of Coverdell's generation, who are genuinely
mourning the man they knew and perhaps taking stock of the length
of their own days.
</P>
<P>
   But with only four months before the November election, next
week should be a fast-paced period of decision, with the capacity
for not a few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The interests of the two national parties will strongly
influence how things play out. The race could change the chemistry
of the presidential contest in Georgia, which gives Al Gore an
interest in Barnes' choice.
</P>
<P>
   With a few Republican-held seats already in jeopardy, this race
also presents the Democrats with the opportunity to significantly
narrow the GOP's 55-45 Senate majority this year and have a
realistic chance of winning back the majority another election down
the line.
</P>
<P>
   So there isn't going to be any sentiment from Washington for
Barnes to appoint a caretaker for the next four months. The
Democrats want a candidate who can win and hold this seat.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of national Democrats would like to see former Gov. Zell
Miller, a name they associate with success, express interest in the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Either Lewis or former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young also would
spark national interest because of their potential to increase
black Democratic turnout this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Moving down the generational ladder, Michael Coles could make an
argument for the job based on his showing against Coverdell in
1998, and former Secretary of State Lewis Massey might have an
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes likes and has confidence in current Secretary of State
Cathy Cox _ but the interesting question here might be whether he
wants to risk a promising protege in what could be a difficult
race, depending on what shapes up among the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's the big name to watch on the Democratic side, although
the likelihood that he will make himself available isn't great.
Among the Republicans, it's the man Miller beat in the 1990
governor's race, Rep. Johnny Isakson.
</P>
<P>
   If Isakson _ now the best-known and most experienced Republican
holding office in the state _ shows a strong interest in
challenging the Democratic appointee this November, the GOP
struggle could be short and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, the next name that comes to mind is Rep. Jack
Kingston, who has gone to some trouble to get his name known
outside his coastal district and has the youth and ambition to go
for the job.
</P>
<P>
   But more names come to mind only shortly after his. Five of the
eight Republican House members have war chests over $600,000, and
one who doesn't, Mac Collins, has resources he might put into play.
Then there's Newt Gingrich and Guy Millner, but that's blue-sky
speculation http://www.coxnews.com/2000.

AMID SUMMIT CROSSFIRE, CLINTON REACHES OUT TO MIDEAST LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Taking ``every step imaginable'' to rescue
Middle East peace negotiations as they carried on well past the
original deadline, President Clinton contacted the leaders of
several key Middle East nations late Wednesday, struggling to reach
a compromise before leaving early this morning for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials denied that the Israeli-Palestinian talks
were in crisis, or that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was on
the verge of walking out, despite a letter Barak issued accusing
his opponents of ``squandering an opportunity.'' Trying to sound a
note of optimism, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday
the parties had ``reached a pivotal moment in these talks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked very hard to find a path to an agreement. At
this point in time, we have not reached that,'' Lockhart said
shortly after 5:30 p.m. ``But the priority for the president right
now is to make sure every possible avenue toward an agreement is
explored.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant a ninth long day of meetings among the negotiators,
including two between Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
inside the rain-drenched confines of the Camp David retreat.
Clinton also spoke via telephone with several Mideast leaders _
including Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, King Abdullah II of
Jordan, and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia _ in what US
officials said was an effort to place pressure on the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   One US official who has been involved in previous talks said the
calls appeared to be aimed at encouraging Barak and Arafat, but
particularly Arafat, to show the courage and fortitude to find a
compromise. It may also have been an effort to get Arafat to step
back from the September 13 deadline he has set to unilaterally
declare Palestinian statehood, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, meanwhile, said the calls were simply ``to give them
(the other leaders) some sense of where we are in this process and
where it stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusations flew throughout the day, with news of a breakdown
ricocheting from Camp David to the Middle East and back again in a
series of phone calls. Amid reports that Barak was leaving and had
sent a letter to Clinton accusing the Palestinians of negotiating
in bad faith, a Palestinian official thousands of miles away
charged the Israeli leader with exploiting the talks for political
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak did not go to the summit to make peace,'' said
Palestinian cabinet minister Freih Abu Meddein. ``He went there to
prove to his people that he could stick to Israeli red lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, whose coalition government fractured before he left,
faced criticism from hawkish conservatives that he was willing to
cede too much. He had hoped to return home with an agreement that
he could then sell directly to the Israeli people, who according to
polls support a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides arrived at the negotiating table focused on four
core issues: The fate of Palestinian refugees; territory and
borders; Israeli security; and control over Jerusalem, the holy
city that both sides claim as their capital. The issues were so
intractable, and, in the case of Jerusalem, so freighted with
symbolism, that Israeli and Palestinians had previously avoided
discussing them through seven years of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, the increasingly hostile remarks by
officials on all sides seemed to reflect the mood inside the
presidential retreat, where a week of cautious optimism rapidly
deteriorated in the summit's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of possible failure followed fast on the heels of
Clinton's decision to postpone his trip to Japan, which he
announced shortly after midnight Wednesday. By morning, Israeli
officials were telling reporters traveling with the prime minister
to pack their bags and prepare to go.
</P>
<P>
   Barak informed Clinton of his decision via letter, angrily
writing that the Palestinians were negotiating in bad faith. It was
interpreted as brinkmanship at first; Abu Mazen, a senior
Palestinian negotiator who left Camp David Wednesday morning to
attend his son's wedding in Ramallah, said as he left the country
that ``serious talks'' were continuing into the early afternoon,
suggesting Barak had not given up right away.
</P>
<P>
   But the verbal crossfire outside the talks suggested that both
sides had hardened their positions. Some critics began questioning
whether either leader had been willing to make concessions at all.
The harshest words came from Barak, who began making his
displeasure public just 12 hours before the talks were supposed to
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my sorrow, I have come to the conclusion that the
Palestinian side is conducting negotiations insincerely and is not
willing to negotiate in a serious and practical manner for a
permanent peace between us,'' Barak's letter said, according to
Israel's Army radio, which broadcast the declaration soon after it
was sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians will witness the tragic consequences of
squandering an opportunity,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs taken the night before showed a weary Clinton
sitting on an outdoor patio with Barak, who was taking notes on a
legal pad. Another picture from Tuesday night, of Clinton and
Arafat deep in conversation, contrasted starkly with many shots
taken the previous week, in which the leaders were seen smiling and
strolling through the surrounding woods.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to leave sometime after midnight Thursday for
Japan, where the G-8 summit of industrialized nations begins
Friday. He delayed the trip early Wednesday, postponing a meeting
with the Japanese prime minister until later in the week. And
according to one US official, the decision to press beyond the
original deadline made sense, given the personalities Clinton was
working with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Middle East is the land of miracles,'' the US official
said Wednesday. ``You never say die. You don't know what's going to
happen before (Thursday) morning.''

ROMAN COLOSSEUM COMES ALIVE AGAIN, WITH A MORE DIGNIFIED ROAR OF
THE CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Colosseum, the infamous arena of combat and
slaughter, is back in business for the first time in 1,500 years.
Only instead of cheering for gladiators and hungry lions,
contemporary Romans are paying to see a more ancient and somewhat
more high-minded form of entertainment, ``Oedipus Rex.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's world premiere, a new production of the
Sophocles tragedy performed by the National Theater of Greece, was
a daring experiment in putting Rome's most famous ancient monument
in the service of culture. Just building a stage over the yawning
pit of ruins required five years of study and restoration work by
an international team of archaeologists and engineers, who
reconstructed a wood floor over a portion of the ruined corridors
and underground tunnels where gladiators, stagehands and caged
beasts once waited for the show to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment also required a leap of faith by Greek actors,
accustomed to performing in smaller, more accommodating and
acoustically correct theaters. ``The Colosseum was a place designed
to kill people,'' said Grigoris Valtinos, the actor who plays
Oedipus, somewhat nervously before Tuesday's dress rehearsal. ``And
now it is killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, however, the actors were clearly audible and
visible Wednesday night on a stage and narrow wooden crossing set
like a bridge along the length of the Colosseum. But the VIP
audience had more difficulty. The lighting was too dim for the
audience to read the Italian translation that was distributed. A
few hardy souls fired up cigarette lighters in an effort to follow
the plot. But just being inside the ghostly walls provided its own
theatrical thrill.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of staging a performance at the Colosseum during 2000,
a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church, came from Italy's
Istituto Nazionale del Dramma Antico, an organization dedicated to
staging classic works in ancient settings, including plays,
translated into Italian and staged in the Greek theater of Syracuse
in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sophocles,'' performed in modern Greek, is not the usual
summer fare, however. ``We wanted to break away from the usual and
stage something that would represent the voyage of mankind,''
explained Walter Le Moli, president of the institute. When he and
his colleagues first talked of using the Colosseum, they didn't
know its floor was being restored, serendipity that made Wednesday
night's performance possible.
</P>
<P>
   For Italy's millennium celebrations, the institute selected what
it calls the ``Sophocles Project,'' a series of plays by the Greek
playwright starting with ``Oedipus Rex,'' which runs through
Friday. Le Moli said it made thematic sense to have a Greek company
perform what he described as ``man's search for identity _ the
first play from which all other drama descends.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be followed by ``Antigone,'' to be performed in late
July by an Iranian theater company, the Dramatic Arts Center of
Tehran. The play stresses, as Le Moli put it, ``the conflict
between religious and civil authority.'' The cycle ends in August
with ``Oedipus at Colonus,'' an operatic version of Sophocles' play
with music by Mendelssohn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oedipus at Colonus,'' a play that deals with Oedipus' death in
exile, was originally supposed to be performed by the Kameri
Theater of Tel Aviv. The organizers hoped to link the play's theme
with the Jews' search for a promised land. Those ambitious
cross-cultural notions ran aground, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government resisted committing to the project,
apparently unwilling to have its players perform if Israelis were
included in the program. The point became moot, however, after the
Israeli company was forced to pull out because of translation
delays and scheduling conflicts. Instead, Italian actors,
accompanied by an Italian orchestra and chorus, will perform the
play.
</P>
<P>
   The National Theater of Greece, which in past years has brought
``Medea'' and ``Electra'' to New York, will take ``Oedipus Rex'' to
City Center in Manhattan in October. There, instead of relying on
translations printed in librettos, audiences will be able to follow
the play by reading English supertitles. That concession to
American convenience puzzles some of the performers. ``Like a pop
music show,'' said Jenny Gaitanapoulou, who plays Jocasta, the
mother of Oedipus. ``Only I am not Celine Dion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaitanapoulou, who usually works at the National Theater of
Cyprus, nevertheless displayed a shrewd sense of contemporary
American culture. To prepare for her role as a powerful and at
times ruthless matriarch, the actress explained, ``I based my
interpretation of Jocasta on Elizabeth I, Queen Gertrude in
`Hamlet' and Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage, set atop the new wood flooring that covers only
one-seventh of the Colosseum's arena, is small and dwarfed by the
vast marble and brick curves of the ruins beyond it. The
archaeologists' concerns limited seating to 300 people. Another 400
spectators were allowed to stand. The set will come down at the end
of the summer, but the floor will stay, and there is the
possibility of staging more small cultural events. Government
officials, however, rule out a large rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's performance was a theatrical debut for the
Colosseum, which was begun under Emperor Vespasian in A.D. 72 and
finished under Titus in A.D. 80, built to awe and entertain more
than 50,000 spectators. The Colosseum last saw a Roman-style
spectacle _ wild animals being slaughtered _ in A.D. 523.
(Gladiator fights were ended in 407.) A series of earthquakes badly
damaged the building, and at times it was used as a quarry, , its
stones carried off to build Renaissance palaces and churches. In
the 18th century Pope Benedict XIV, who had a conservationist
streak, put an end to such scavenging by consecrating the Colosseum
to the passion of Jesus, which helped feed the legends of the
Colosseum as a site of Christian martyrdom. Even now, the pope, on
Good Friday, reenacts the last passion of Christ at its walls,
starting inside.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say there is no evidence that early Christians were
martyred there, let alone fed to the lions. Many, however, are
reluctant to rule it out. ``It was a prime place for public
executions, and there is no reason to believe Christians were
excluded from the slaughter,'' explained Adriano La Regina, Rome's
superintendent of archaeology, who oversaw the reconstruction work.
``It may not show up in the texts because Romans took it for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago the restoration unearthed a marble plaque with an
inscription that had been covered over centuries ago. Scholars
discovered that the plaque originally explained that the
construction was paid for with booty taken from the sack of
Jerusalem in A.D. 70.
</P>
<P>
   Vassilis Papavasiliou, the director, said that while it was
challenging to stage ``Oedipus Rex'' in the Colosseum, it was also
oddly fitting. ``Oedipus is a deeply human story, the story of all
of us, and we are all children of this society,'' he said. ``The
Colosseum used combat as entertainment. Our chosen form of combat
here is Sophocles, an effort to restore meaning to entertainment.''

 &HT;    Wednesday heat hits summer high
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ These are the times that fry men's soles.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature hit 99 degrees at Hartsfield International
Airport about 3 p.m. Wednesday, according to the National Weather
Service. It's Atlanta's hottest temperature this year, matching the
high on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the sidewalks have been sizzling all month, reaching 92
or better for 18 consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures today are expected to climb to the high 90s in
South Georgia, the low 90s in the mountains, and somewhere in
between in metro Atlanta, according to Robert Beasley, a Weather
Service meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday or Monday, Atlantans could enjoy highs that only reach
the upper 80s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in a cooling trend by then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the state could see a few scattered showers in the
next several days, Beasley said.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures up, Atlanta's air quality is down.
</P>
<P>
   Today has been declared a Code Orange smog alert day by the
Partnership for a Smog-Free Ga., meaning ozone levels will be
``unhealthy for sensitive groups.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the demand for electricity prompted Georgia Power
Co., for the second time this year, to order power curtailed to 160
large industrial customers.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses, mostly manufacturing plants, purchase
electricity under reduced rates year-round with the provision that
the utility can ask them to reduce consumption when demand soars.
However hot it is here, it's even hotter farther west.
</P>
<P>
   Heat has been blamed for 12 deaths in Texas; five more deaths
are being investigated in Louisiana as possibly heat-related.

COALITION FORMS TO OPPOSE GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS
</HEADLINE>
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A coalition of consumer and environmental groups
announced on Wednesday what they hope will be the biggest and most
organized effort yet in the United States to pressure food
companies into abandoning the use of genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the Campbell Soup Co., the coalition said it would
target well-known food companies and try to generate thousands of
consumer letters, phone calls and signatures on petitions urging
the companies to stop using genetically modified foods until more
testing is done and to label products that contain such
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, food companies have largely abandoned use of such
ingredients because of consumer opposition fanned by aggressive
opposition. But in the United States, consumers have expressed
little concern about genetically modified foods and many are not
even aware that such foods are being sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the first sort of sustained effort on the
European model,'' said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National
Environmental Trust, one of the groups in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, the Genetically Engineered Food Alert, could
spend $1 million, or more, he said. That is still considerably less
than the $50 million a group of agricultural biotechnology
companies committed in April to spend over several years on
television advertising and other measures to defend their products.
</P>
<P>
   The group has not yet named other targets besides Campbell. But
Jean Halloran of Consumers Union, which is cooperating with the
coalition but is not a member, said the coalition would choose
``corporations that have food products that Americans really regard
as staples of their kitchen, that they feed to their kids.'' In
addition to soup, Campbell makes Pepperidge Farm cookies, V8 juice,
Prego pasta sauce and Godiva chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   John Faulkner, a spokesman for Campbell, said the company saw no
need to eliminate genetically engineered ingredients because they
were ``equally nutritious and equally safe'' as nonmodified ones.
He said that fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of calls to the
Campbell's consumer hotline concern genetic engineering. And even
if Campbell wanted to eliminate such ingredients, he said, it could
not, because a large percentage of the corn and soybeans grown in
the United States is genetically altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't control the supply chain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of
America, a trade group representing food companies, said the
companies were obeying the law in not labeling genetically modified
ingredients. ``If the activists have an issue it's not with the
food companies but with the federal government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, pressuring food companies could be effective. Already,
companies like McDonald's, Gerber and Frito-Lay are reducing or
eliminating genetically modified ingredients, not because they
think the products are unsafe but because they are worried about
consumer reaction.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that anyone has been harmed by eating the
genetically engineered corn, soy, potatoes or other foods now on
the market. But critics say the foods have not been tested
adequately. And they say labeling such foods would give consumers a
chance to avoid them. Food companies oppose mandatory labeling,
saying it would scare consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration maintains that labels should
pertain to the quality of the food, not to how it is made. The
genetic engineered foods so far have the same nutritional value and
safety as other foods, it says, so the use of genetic engineering
per se should not be on the label.
</P>
<P>
   The other groups in the coalition are the Center for Food
Safety, Friends of the Earth, the Institute for Agriculture and
Trade Policy, Organic Consumers Association, Pesticide Action
Network North America and the State Public Interest Research
Groups.  &QL;

`GAY VAGUE' ADVERTISING: WHEN INTENTIONS FALL BETWEEN THE LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Are the billboards in New York advertising the Grand
Can, a swivel-top, orange-pop-colored trash can, a boast about the
sophistication of its design or of its buyers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Swings Both Ways,'' the ad states. It should know. It does,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex innuendo is showing up more and more in national
advertising, and in more consumer categories, including
automobiles, beer and soft drinks and home furnishings, once as
lifeless in their advertised image as a period room.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the license taken by fashion advertisers, ``gay
vague'' advertising, as marketers call it (designed to reach both
gay and mainstream audiences), has become the leading edge, many in
the industry say. And conveniently, where mainstream audiences see
ambiguity, gay audiences see a direct sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In Mitchell Gold furniture ads running in national magazines
now, two smiling young men sit on a white sofa, with a little blond
girl between them on a child's chair. They are an attractive
couple. The girl is their daughter Dorothy. And you aren't in
Kansas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The muscleman in the tight, short-sleeved business shirt
pressing his knuckles into a desk, in advertisements in newspapers
and telephone kiosks for Dallak office furniture, is Dallak's
targeted customer: young, active, sexy, fit. And an identifiable
icon for urban gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intended to be inclusive,'' said Neil Schwartzberg,
president of Dallek. ``A new, unsedentary image of offices,
hard-bodied furniture for hard-bodied people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay vague advertising aims at what many companies believe is an
affluent gay market, while also displaying a casual, inclusive
attitude toward same-sex issues that advertisers hope will capture
younger, hip mainstream consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream entertainment has paved the way. Two young male
characters shared a romantic kiss on ``Dawson's Creek,'' which is
aimed at a teen-age audience. On HBO's ``Sex and the City,''
Carrie, its leading character, played by Sarah Jessica Parker,
dates a 26-year-old bisexual man in an episode titled ``Boy, Girl,
Boy, Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone, Parker's character asks herself, ``Has the opposite sex
become obsolete?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Draznin, an executive vice president at Lowe Lintas, an
advertising agency in New York, said the industry is using the
pop-cultural climate as leverage in a new sales approach. ``The
advertising landscape has changed dramatically in the last year,''
he said. ``It's not only inclusionary, but advertisers themselves
are less uptight about being seen as same-sex inclusionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe Lintas created ``The Male Bonding Incident,'' a television
spot now appearing for Heineken beer, in which two men watching
sports on a living room sofa touch (and briefly hold) hands while
exchanging a bottle of beer, before bouncing apart. Draznin
described the ad as a humorous spoof of heterosexual nervousness
over the intent of a same-sex contact. The ad might be gay vague,
but the comic relief is explicit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands to reason that a trend is under way, and companies
are jumping on the bandwagon,'' said Rogier van Bakel, editor of Ad
Age's Creativity, an industry publication. But, he continued, the
gay imagery ``is often implied, and leaves a lot of us guessing,
`What are they really trying to say?'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps viewers don't want it spelled out. Tyler Brule, the
editorial director of Wallpaper, a home furnishings and fashion
magazine, said readers and colleagues in their 20s ``seem less
inclined to find themselves at a young age, gay or straight.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Genderation inspecific' is the marketing term we've coined,''
he said. ``They don't want to label themselves.'' Brule depicts the
ambiguity in his magazine, in stories like one in June about a
beach barbecue, in which two men serenade each other while women
look on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our imagery is all inclusive,'' Brule said. ``Boys and girls,
boys and boys, girls and girls _ whether these people end up in bed
with each other at the end of the story, we never answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Magazines like Wallpaper explore the idea that home furnishings
can be presented as lifestyle, with the sexual appeal of fashion or
beauty products.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Saget, the publisher of House &AMP; Garden, said
home-furnishing advertisers now ``realize the success that fashion
and beauty have had in appealing to people on a personal level, by
being provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to appeal to people's senses,'' she said. ``Your
Sub-Zero is as exciting as your BMW and your Rolex.'' Younger
audiences, she said, ``are choosing to go the sexy, fun route _
embracing all lifestyles and points of view.'' To reach them, she
explained, marketers will have to be more broad-minded.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wilke, a media historian who has studied gay marketing,
coined the term ``gay vague'' for ads like Mitchell Gold's and
Dallek's that target both gay and mainstream audiences. Wilke, a
reporter at Ad Age magazine for four years and now a columnist at
GFN, a financial services Web site, also expressed reservations.
``It has to be the right product with the right demographic. You're
not going to see Procter &AMP; Gamble advertising Tide this way. But a
young demographic, like Ikea's or Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch's, is more
open to this kind of imagery, because it's considered cool.''
</P>
<P>
   After dismissing various heterosexual scenarios as too familiar,
Thomas Lenthal, a creative director working with Christian Dior,
helped create Dior's spring and summer advertising campaign, which
pictures two women in a series of sexually charged embraces,
inspired in part by images discovered in German lesbian
publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing sick or strange or weird,'' Lenthal said of
the ads. ``It's two really beautiful girls enjoying themselves,
lesbian or not. Dior has to enter the 21st century with an image
that's very young, very alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the home-furnishings industry's conservative image, it
was the first to show a gay couple shopping together, in a
television ad for Ikea in 1994. The spot was pulled after several
months. The 11-segment campaign itself stayed on the air for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay couple got so much national press,'' said Linda
Sawyer, the general manager at Deutsch Inc., the agency that
created the ads. ``It had received far greater than its fair share
of media weight.'' Sawyer noted that the couple depicted were
``regular guys,'' not stereotypical beefcake models.
</P>
<P>
   Waterford Wedgwood began advertising in Out magazine, the gay
monthly, in 1996. The campaign's generic image, two men and a woman
strolling with Champagne flutes in their hands, was _ only in gay
publications _ accompanied by copy that made the ad's intention
clear: ``It's time your crystal came out of the closet as well.'' A
mainstream version ran without the knowing overline.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Brady, vice president of marketing at Waterford, said the
demographics of Out magazine readers were appealing to her company.
``They're affluent,'' she said. ``They enjoy the home, fine
entertaining, the quality of the product. We wanted to show them
that Waterford was serious about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream advertising in gay and lesbian publications like Out
increased by 29 percent, to $155.3 million, in 1999 over 1998,
according to the Gay Press Report, a survey sponsored by Rivendell
Marketing, a gay and lesbian media marketing company. The increase
was led by the retail category, which was up 70 percent, and
included new faces like Banana Republic and Calvin Klein. Home
furnishings fell behind, with a decrease from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Bachman, senior vice president and creative director at
Calvin Klein, said budgets dictated its decisions. Home furnishings
represent 5 percent of global sales, and its advertising budget is
tiny in comparison with fashion's. Home furnishings, she said, were
best presented in the traditional home design magazines: the
connection to fashion could be accomplished without showing people
in the ads or using overtly sexual images.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really want to focus on the product,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Moore, the president of Mike, a San Francisco furniture
manufacturer and retailer with $20 million in sales last year,
disagreed. Moore, who is gay, published a magazine-style catalog in
April that included models, including same-sex couples, in various
stages of undress in sparely furnished rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 6,000 catalogs were returned with letters
complaining that the content was offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of ``gay vague'' advertising has come from expected
quarters, including the Christian Action Network in Forest, Va.,
with 250,000 members, which is concerned that the phenomenon is on
the rise, and that its vagueness will be increasingly explicit,
especially on television.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mitchell Gold has had criticism from his gay
audience, saying that he is aiming stereotypes at them, like
beefcake nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he remains convinced that such ads work. ``How do you get
the most bang for your buck, creating ads that people will talk
about, on a $40,000 annual advertising budget?'' he asked. Gold
projects sales of $70 million this year, a 30 percent increase over
last year. He also accused the industry, in particular the High
Point, N.C., core of American furniture manufacturers, of being
timid _ and homophobic _ in refusing to acknowledge a significant
part of their audience. He lives nearby in Conover, N.C., with his
partner, Bob Williams, the company's executive vice president and
director of design.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Reardon, the president of Hickory Chair in North Carolina
and a colleague of Gold's, took issue and offense with his
observation. Reardon said neither the customer's sex nor his
orientation was important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focus our marketing efforts towards people who want to
beautify their homes,'' he said.

ANALYSIS: ONCE AGAIN, A STANDOFF ON TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In early January, House Speaker Dennis Hastert told
the Republican leadership to abandon its effort to pass a single,
hugely expensive tax-cut package in the face of unyielding
opposition from President Clinton. Instead, he ordered up a series
of narrowly drawn tax measures that could rise or fall not on their
pricetags but on their political appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understand these in individual bites,'' Hastert said in
an interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense his strategy has played out as well as he could
have hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of the House, the Senate has passed the two
biggest of this year's tax bills in the past few days, one that
would repeal the federal estate tax and another that would provide
a tax reduction to nearly all married couples. And on Wednesday,
the House overwhelmingly passed a measure that would increase the
allowable level of tax-deductible contributions to individual
retirement accounts and 401(k) retirement programs.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the measures have attracted significant support
from Democrats, who at this point are arguing not about whether tax
cuts are justified, only about how big they should be.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with legislative success, and bolstered by sharp upward
revisions in the projected federal budget surplus, Republicans said
Hastert's strategy has proven that tax cuts still pack a
considerable political punch.
</P>
<P>
   But in another sense, Hastert's strategy has led nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception _ legislation that removed the limit on how
much retirees could earn before losing part of their Social
Security benefit _ Clinton has refused to go along, and in recent
days the administration has unleashed a sharp attack on the
Republican tax cuts as a fiscally irresponsible giveaway to the
wealthy at the expense of working people. Vetoes are almost certain
for the estate tax and marriage tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a continuation of the ideological standoff that
has defined fiscal policy since the Republicans took control of
Congress in 1994. And it has led both parties to bet that the
political benefits of conflict in this election year will outweigh
the risks of any backlash from voters who might prefer to see
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans seem confident that they will get credit from
voters for having passed the tax cuts. They say Democrats in
Congress and Clinton, and by extension Vice President Al Gore, will
come off as obstructionist, out of step with the politics of
prosperity and on the side of the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans increasingly see the tax code as unfair or even
stupid,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``The context
that Republicans are trying to set up is that if George W. Bush is
elected president, there will be no marriage penalty, no death tax
and that fill-in-the-blank tax will no longer exist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans, including Hastert, are concerned that the
party not be seen as totally unwilling to compromise in order to
get some of its legislation signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   As the House and Senate prepare to hash out the differences
between the bills they passed to cut taxes for married couples,
Hastert is pushing for the final legislation to look more like the
House bill, which is less expensive and does less for upper-income
taxpayers than the Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to give the president any excuse not to sign
it,'' Hastert said. ``It's not good enough to pass a bill and send
it to the president's desk and have him veto it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts go even farther and say that the Republicans have
missed a great opportunity to get all they could realistically hope
to accomplish on tax cuts, and to neutralize the charge that they
are running a do-nothing Congress. They say that Democrats,
increasingly nervous about being caught on the wrong side of the
rapidly changing politics of taxation, have offered alternatives
that should have been very attractive to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In debating tax cuts for couples, Democrats in the Senate
offered a plan to all but eliminate the marriage penalty paid by
many two-income couples, albeit only for couples earning less than
$150,000. Democrats in the House and Senate both offered plans to
reduce the estate tax substantially. But Republicans brushed those
offers aside.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``won't take yes for an answer,'' said Bruce
Bartlett, an economist at the National Center for Policy Analysis,
a conservative research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats have moved a long way in the direction of the
Republican agenda,'' Bartlett said. ``But Republicans seem to have
made their plans six months ago and bulled their way through
without taking into account any change in circumstances. The
makings of a deal are there, but they seem to be rejecting it in
favor of an all or nothing approach, which is pig headed.''
</P>
<P>
   The calculation from the Democratic side is that voters will see
that the individual tax bills passed or in the pipeline this year
add up to the same big package that Republicans abandoned last year
without even sending to the White House for a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Taking their cue from the White House, Democrats in Congress are
seeking to portray Republicans as working on behalf of a thin slice
of the wealthiest taxpayers and ignoring the concerns of lower- and
middle-income people who need tax breaks for pressing issues like
child care, health care and college tuition costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their base is that rich two percent, our base is the rest, and
that will be the fight,'' the Democratic leader in the Senate, Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, told a news conference this week.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Democrats are siding with Republicans,
reflecting both the growing surplus and the fact that their base in
the middle class is seeing its tax bill rise as it becomes
increasingly affluent. Some Democrats are worried about being
tarred by the old complaint that they are too prone to tax and
spend.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy bipartisan vote in the House Wednesday on expanding
tax breaks for retirement savings _ a measure opposed by the White
House _ was only the latest example of how Democrats in Congress
are acting to keep themselves from ending up on the wrong side of a
rapidly shifting political dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats who voted for both the estate tax repeal and
the Republican tax cut four couples was Sen. Robert Torricelli of
New Jersey, a state where taxes have been a critical political
issue. Torricelli said on Wednesday that he was interested in
running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Torricelli believes that tax cutting is not the sole
domain of the Republican party,'' said Richard McGrath, the
senator's spokesman. ``Contemporary economic reality is that
middle-class families with two incomes still have to struggle to
pay basic expenses and should be given a break if the resources are
available.''

A TINTORETTO REAPPEARS IN RURAL PENNSYLVANIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By KEN SHULMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WERNERSVILLE, Pa. _ The Jesuit
Center here stands in a lush, rolling, Gainsborough-like landscape
some seven miles west of Reading. Opened in 1930 as a novitiate,
the imposing, slightly incongruous red brick building now serves as
a Jesuit retirement home. As in most small, contained communities,
the residents are not accustomed to seeing strangers. When the
elderly priests look up from their dinners to watch the Rev. J.A.
Panuska, who directs the Jesuit residence, lead a visitor into the
refectory, they already know what has brought the outsider here.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You're here for the Tintoretto,'' says an unshaven priest
leaning on a cane. The stranger nods. ``It stinks,'' the cleric
says. ``The scripture tells how Jesus was repulsed by Lazarus'
rotting flesh, how Jesus withdrew before the sight of death. The
passage foreshadows his own death, and his triumph over death. Here
Tintoretto gives us a milky white Lazarus, a muscular movie star
whose nudity is covered by a paltry little cloth. He got it all
wrong. All wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting under discussion is ``The Raising of Lazarus,'' one
of seven existing Tintoretto treatments of the subject. In 1998,
the 42-by-58-inch oil painting was rediscovered during a general
inventory at the Wernersville residence. At the time, it was
hanging, unlighted and unlabeled, in a first-floor corridor across
from the chapel entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when they came from the museum to examine it with
their special lighting,'' said Father Panuska, who was a novice at
the residence from 1948 through 1950 and has been the superior
since 1998. He also recalls seeing the Tintoretto over the entrance
to the third-floor library during his novitiate. ``I said, `Oh my
Lord, what is this that we have?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jacopo Robusti Tintoretto (1518-94) was one of the great
painters of the late Italian Renaissance. ``The Raising of
Lazarus'' is a staged tableau done primarily in soft reds, pinks
and flesh tones. In it, a placid Jesus resuscitates a nude,
athletic-looking Lazarus. Mary and Martha, Lazarus' sisters, and a
third witness kneel rapt and spellbound before Jesus, their heads
pitched to the right in a gesture of adoration.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, five additional witnesses, their faces concealed
behind handkerchiefs or rendered in hidden profile, stand in an
almost conspiratorial huddle beneath the now blackened leaves of an
olive tree. An idealized view of Jerusalem from the hills of
Bethany in the upper left section of the painting completes the
composition.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt about the painting's authenticity. ``The
Raising of Lazarus'' is listed in Rodolfo Pallucchino's 1982
Tintoretto catalog, the most authoritative source on the Venetian
artist. The entry lists it as ``missing.'' Sarah Lidsey, the
old-master specialist at Christie's in New York, expressed no doubt
about the painting's authenticity after she was invited to inspect
it last year. Tentatively dated 1556-57, ``The Raising of Lazarus''
is an early Tintoretto in excellent condition. Franco Mormando, a
Jesuit and professor of Italian literature at Boston College who
did extensive archival research on the painting, said it was
probably commissioned as an ex-voto during a minor outbreak of the
plague in Venice.
</P>
<P>
   From an art-historical standpoint, the discovery of the
Tintoretto in Wernersville is not quite as significant as the
discovery of Caravaggio's ``Taking of Christ'' in a Jesuit
residence in Dublin in 1990. Yet the story of the Tintoretto
painting is intriguing and involves several figures of
ecclesiastical and historical prominence.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest document that mentions ``The Raising of Lazarus''
places the painting in Nottingham, England, in 1872. It
subsequently traveled to Munich, Berlin and then to Rome, where
Nicholas and Genevieve Brady, a pair of wealthy and devout American
Roman Catholics, saw the work in the collection of Pietro
Galleazzi. Galleazzi was a close confidant and aide to Cardinal
Eugenio Pacelli, who served as papal nuncio in Berlin in the second
decade of the 20th century and later became Pope Pius XII.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bradys spent their winters in Rome,'' Mormando said.
``They were part of that elite social ecclesiastical circle that
would meet frequently in Rome and at the Vatican.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, Nicholas Brady purchased the Tintoretto from Galleazzi
for $35,000, a high price for an artwork at that time. The bill of
sale was witnessed by Frank Spellman, a young priest from Whitman,
Mass., who had fallen out of favor with his local archdiocese and
gone to test the ecclesiastical waters in Rome. He would later
become Cardinal Francis Spellman, archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, who had expanded a considerable family fortune through
utility-company mergers, died in 1930. That same year, his wife
donated the Tintoretto and 94 other artworks to the newly opened
Wernersville novitiate, which had been paid for entirely by Brady
at a cost of more than a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradys were not collectors; they purchased the artworks as
objects of contemplation for the novices and teachers at the
novitiate. Their gift was of uneven quality. It included a
miniature watercolor copy of Pinturicchio's Madonna and Child
fresco in the Vatican and a small oil copy of Luca Signorelli's
``Overthrow of the Anti-Christ'' in the Duomo at Orvieto, along
with several religious paintings by unknown 19th- and 20th-century
painters and portraits of the Bradys. There was also a splendid
Arts and Crafts Movement needlepoint series depicting the stations
of the cross by Lilly Yeats (sister of the poet W.B. Yeats),
several medieval ivory statues and a terra cotta angel head
attributed to the school of Luca della Robbia. Still, the
Tintoretto is the only work of real note.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Raising of Lazarus'' hung in the Jesuit Center from 1930
onward, first in the upstairs library and then in a corridor
outside the main chapel. ``I believe that the Jesuits simply forgot
about it,'' Mormando said. ``Or that they thought the attribution
was a sort of wishful thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Since last December, just after the discovery of the painting
became public, it has hung in the European gallery on the third
floor of the Reading Public Museum and Art Gallery. The museum was
founded in 1904 in the classroom of Dr. Levi Mengel, a Reading
educator and explorer who participated in Admiral Perry's 1891
expedition to the Antarctic. Its core collection consists of 1,700
natural-history specimens that Mengel acquired for his classroom at
the 1903 St. Louis World Exposition. On the second floor of the
museum, a life-size plastic replica of Mengel inspecting a
butterfly through a magnifying lens sits behind his desk,
surrounded by specimen bottles and neatly organized wooden
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Before the arrival of the Tintoretto, the museum's top
attractions were the armor of a Samurai warrior, three shrunken
heads from the Jivaro people of Ecuador, a mummified Egyptian
female from 550 B.C. and, upstairs, a large 19th-century landscape
painting by Julien Dupre titled ``The Balloon.''

   ``We really have nothing of this quality in the entire museum,''
Robert Metzger, the director, says of the Tintoretto. ``We have
some great masterpieces from several periods. But having a work
from one of the great masters of the Italian Renaissance is of
tremendous importance to us. We are very fortunate that the Jesuit
center saw fit to loan it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The Tintoretto has attracted visitors from New York, the West
Coast and Europe. Panuska and Mormando are currently examining
proposals from conservators for a minor restoration. After the
conservation, the painting will travel selectively for several
years. Although ``The Raising of Lazarus'' has been valued as high
as $2 million _ a smaller version of the same subject by Tintoretto
sold at Sotheby's for $950,000 in 1994 _ the Jesuits have no
intention of selling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is that if something is given to an institution,
they should use it for that purpose,'' Panuska said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That purpose now is sharing this beautiful painting with the
world, and with our local community,'' he continued. ``I'd like for
this museum to be its home base. Then I would like to see it
travel, but to smaller museums, perhaps near other Jesuit
communities, where it would really be something special. So many
museums are so gifted with wonderful paintings. I'd like this
painting to travel to places where people would want to come and
look at it.''

 &HT;    Larkin feels asking price is fair
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Anybody can get traded.
</P>
<P>
   They traded Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   They traded Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   They traded Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cincinnati Reds are likely to trade Barry Larkin. Soon.
The dodgy question remains, though. Will Larkin accept a trade and
are there more than subtle hints from his camp that he won't. When
it was suggested Wednesday that general manager Jim Bowden might be
requesting approval on a trade with the New York Mets in the next
48 hours, Larkin smiled and said, ``He can save his breath.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yankee-like package may be offered to the Reds by the Mets,
some minor-league prospects similar to the three minor-leaguers the
Bronx Bombers sent to the Reds for pitcher Denny Neagle. The Mets
might part with 20-year-old Class AA pitcher Pat Strange, their No.
2 draft pick in 1998, plus 23-year-old pitcher Grant Roberts and
21-year-old outfielder Alex Escobar.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Operating Officer John Allen said Wednesday that the Reds
want Larkin to finish his career in Cincinnati, become one of the
few modern-day players to stay his entire career with one team, but
that Larkin's non-negotiable, three-year, $27.9 million asking
price was too steep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not tell Barry that we were not interested in keeping
him in Cincinnati,'' Allen said. ``I simply informed him that we
were not able to sign him for the amount of money he has
demanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin agreed that what Allen said is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did tell me he wanted me to stay in Cincinnati and I don't
want to get into a war of words,'' Larkin said. ``All I'm asking
from Cincinnati right now is to be paid at below fair market.
Below. That's simply it. They've informed me they can't do that.
That's it. I asked John about deferring money, the way they did for
Junior Griffey, but that was not an issue because they said we are
too far apart, not even in the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Far apart is $18 million over three years, which the Reds might
be willing to kick up to $20 million, but because Larkin and his
agent, Eric Goldschmidt, believe $27.9 million is below the going
rate, they aren't in a negotiating mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for them to take care of me because I signed
for less money when I signed my contracts in the past,'' Larkin
said. ``I caught a lot of grief from guys around the league and
other agents for signing for under value. And I'm not trying to
recoup that now. It's just I'm asking for fair market value and
that's it. I'm not asking for them to bend over backwards or do me
any favors. I could see it if my game has deteriorated, but it has
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin began Wednesday night's game against Houston with a .327
batting average with nine homers and 33 RBIs. Defensively, he
remains more than competent, although he is tied for the club lead
with 10 errors, same as Gold Glove second baseman Pokey Reese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a realist, man,'' Larkin added. ``I deal with good news
and I deal with bad news. This is just one of those things _ a
business decision . . . and that's the first thing Allen said to
me. He told me it was nothing personal and they appreciated
everything I've done. He did use the past tense. It's unfortunate
and I'm disappointed by it, but my career is not over by any
stretch of anybody's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go somewhere else if the Reds choose not to sign me. The
COO said they aren't going to sign me, so I'm looking at it like
they aren't going to sign me. I haven't talked to the GM (Bowden)
and I'm surprised by that. If he is working on anything, he needs
my approval and I have not yet talked to him and I find that odd.
They are running out of time (July 31 trade deadline).''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Larkin will accept a trade. He could refuse
all trades and stay the rest of the year, then declare free agency,
making certain the Reds get little in return for him.
</P>
<P>
   Why would he stay when he isn't wanted? It is Cincinnati, where
he has played his entire career, where he was born, where he went
to school. One of the reasons Griffey signed with the Reds is
Larkin, and they are close.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ugly mess out of which can come no winners.

CLOONEY BRINGS BRAZIL BACK TO THE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By SANDRA BARRERA 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
When Rosemary Clooney set out to tackle the wistful bossa nova
ballads of Antonio Carlos Jobim on her latest CD, ``Brazil,'' it
wasn't as easy as she thought it would be.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she admits it was the hardest music she ever had to
learn. And that's really saying something coming from Clooney, who
at 72 is regarded as one of the greatest jazz practitioners of
American popular song.
</P>
<P>
   She knows tough.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of her lifetime, Clooney has suffered through the
infidelities of her first husband, actor Jose Ferrer _ a marriage
that later ended in divorce. She's been a mother five times over.
She's lost friends and her lover. She's survived a nervous
breakdown, which landed her in the hospital. And she's known what
it's like to conquer the demons of prescription drug addiction,
with the help of her family and friends, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the difficulties she has encountered in her life,
Clooney has always managed to overcome those tough times. That's a
little something she picked up in the early days of her career,
when she was just another one of the boys to the group known as the
Rat Pack.
</P>
<P>
   Singing alongside her pals Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, way
back, was tough, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bing and I could pick keys for each other because our voices
were really in the same range,'' she says. ``But Frank was really
more of a tenor. So if there had to be someone making a concession
because of the song, it would have to be a dramatic concession, and
I hated that, because we had to change the gender or something in
the lyric of the song just because I couldn't sing it as high as it
obviously went for Frank to be comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to Brazilian music, as she came to learn
during the making of the CD ``Brazil,'' the bossa nova is much
different from the American classics that Clooney _ who will be
performing with Michael Feinstein and the Los Angeles Philharmonic
on Friday and Saturday at the Hollywood Bowl _ has spent nearly a
lifetime singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time signatures are so difficult,'' Clooney says by phone
from her home in Los Angeles. ``Also, it can be very rangy. The
musical interludes may not be as simple as the ones that I'm used
to recording, even with somebody like Cole Porter, who didn't
consider the human voice at all when he wrote melodies.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of guitarist John Pizzarelli, whom she
lovingly refers to as Johnny, and singer Diana Krall, who duets
with the legendary crooner on ``Boy From Ipanema,'' it's not
surprising that Clooney manages to pull it all together in much the
same way as she has her life.
</P>
<P>
   After her nervous breakdown, Clooney worked her way back to the
concert stage, playing any gig she could get. Sometimes only a
handful of people would show. But that's not true anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney just got back from San Francisco, where she performed
with the San Francisco Symphony. And Friday, she does a show of
popular American songs from the last 100 years at the Hollywood
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, she even plans to do a tour in support of her
album ``Brazil.'' But she's still working out all the details.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney says no matter what, she wants to bring along
Pizzarelli. He is one of the two people, after all, who helped get
her through one of the toughest lessons in her singing life _
performing bossa nova on her first- ever Brazilian album the way it
was intended to be performed.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an album of songs _ ``Corcovado (Quiet Nights),''
``Desafinado'' and ``Waters Of March'' _ from a country that still
pulses in her memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't there very long,'' Clooney says. ``But it was so
indelible, the memory of it was so bright, and it didn't fade
through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, who did a three-week concert tour of Brazil in 1968,
recalls the country as a place filled with beautiful people, music
and lots of color. Since she traveled the country by car _ she
hates flying _ Clooney got to experience Brazil firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are beautiful, of course,'' she says. ``But the
music is constant. It's in every little place that you go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a three-stool cantina, they've got a jazz group
with five rhythm instruments. The whole place seems to be set to
music. It was just an enormously moving experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the liner notes of ``Brazil,'' Clooney recalls her memory of
looking out of her hotel room and seeing the mountains and sea
bathed in a lavender light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just terribly impressed with it,'' she says. ``And it's
funny because I want to go back, but I don't want to go back. I
don't want to spoil the memory of it. It's so perfect. Perhaps,
it's too perfect.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bolshoi Ballet has returned to New York after an
absence of 10 years, the same but different. Except for Nina
Ananiashvili, who may never have been better than she was in
Vladimir Vasiliev's superbly danced new staging of ``Giselle'' on
Tuesday night, the current principals are unfamiliar to local
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their Western look, the dancers had the old Bolshoi
verve, invigorated by the coherent style seen last month during the
company's five-city national tour. New York will not see the
Bolshoi's scintillating performances of ``Don Quixote,'' as those
cities did. But even the brief run the Lincoln Center Festival 2000
is presenting, with two programs through Sunday (the second is a
mixed bill), is better than none.
</P>
<P>
   By any cultural standard the return of the Bolshoi, which made
its historic New York debut in 1959, is a major event. The
engagement is sold out: the company's mystique remains intact. It
is no secret, however, that the Bolshoi has had its ups and downs.
Not only do aesthetics change, but reality intrudes as well. More
than 20 years of turmoil within the company, a turnover in
directors and an adjustment to a society itself in turmoil will
take its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the metaphor for the Bolshoi Ballet today could well be the
theme of ``Giselle'': remorse and regeneration. There is obviously
a spirited effort to pull the company together. This ``Giselle'' is
persuasive, although not profound. At this performance, it was
difficult to be moved but easy to be dazzled by the excellence of
the dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Vasiliev, 60, was appointed in 1995 to a new double post as
artistic director and general director of the entire Bolshoi
Theater, which includes the opera and ballet troupes. Aleksei
Fadeyechev, 40, was named artistic director of the ballet company
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will claim that the company's dramatic profundity and
bravura still exist as they did when Vasiliev and his wife,
Yekaterina Maksimova, danced alongside great stars like Galina
Ulanova, Maya Plisetskaya and Nikolai Fadeyechev, Aleksei
Fadeyechev's father. But in 1975, when the Bolshoi presented Leonid
Lavrovsky's landmark 1944 production of ``Giselle'' in New York,
the full passion of the Bolshoi's traditional mix of realism and
romanticism could still explode from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Vasiliev's new staging (1997) is a surprise. Where one could
expect the robust realism he expressed so brilliantly while
performing the Lavrovsky ``Giselle,'' there is an emphasis on dance
rather than characterization.
</P>
<P>
   The entire production has a point of view, which the eroded
``Giselle'' of the Kirov did not have here last year. Nonetheless,
dramatic motivation is not given free rein in this version.
</P>
<P>
   But Giselle's mime is retained, and Ananiashvili was especially
vibrant, playful and childlike in Act I, while vigorous as a Wili,
or ghost, in Act II. Her big solo, usually danced earlier in the
same act, was here danced for Bathilde, the fiancee of Albrecht,
the aristocrat who seduces Giselle. Rarely has technique been as
flawless in this solo, complete with full double turns in attitude
and strong hops on toe. Ananiashvili's beautiful arabesques in Act
II were clearly etched upon the eye.
</P>
<P>
   More than strong support in Act II came from the Queen of the
Wilis, the young Maria Alexandrova, a statuesque dancer in the
grand, expressive Bolshoi style, with a contemporary sleekness. She
was stern but exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi corps of Wilis had an admirable discipline, and yet
the contrast between the second act and the first was deliberately
muted. Here, Vasiliev is on risky ground.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of a Romantic ballet like ``Giselle'' is the
dichotomy between its realistic first act and the supernatural
world of its second act. But Vasiliev opts to unite both as a
fantasy expressed through the decor. The main innovation in Sergei
Barkhin's set is a tasseled curtain that blends into the sepia
landscape of Act I and the foliage of Act II.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the scenery works on its own terms; this is not
true of the overwrought costumes by the French fashion designer
Hubert de Givenchy. The squire, in Act I, looks like a fugitive
from a Shriners' convention and wears a peacock feather in his fez.
</P>
<P>
   With an emphasis on dancing rather than mime, and a swift tempo
kept up in the pit by the conductor Alexander Sotnikov, there is
little room to delineate a character fully. Sergei Filin, as
Albrecht, was neither a cad nor a tender lover. He was, above all,
a fine classical dancer (three double turns in the air with arms
up, landing in the right position). One never found out what was
behind his cardboard facade.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that Vasiliev shifts his focus to Hilarion, the
gamekeeper who is a rival for Giselle's love. Lavrovsky injected a
dose of class drama, making this potential villain into a good man
because he was a man of the people. But in this version, Hilarion
is like Albrecht, neither good nor bad. When he should be brooding,
he bursts into exuberant bravura. The new choreography for him was
executed with demi-caractere polish by Aleksander Petukhov.
</P>
<P>
   Hilarion is not Rothbart, the evil magician in ``Swan Lake.'' To
give him as much time as Giselle and Albrecht is to detract from
the essence of ``Giselle.'' Choreographically, it is a ballerina's
ballet in true 19th-century Romantic style. But the narrative
concerns the epitome of the Romantic hero, the man who sins and
undergoes spiritual regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Vasiliev wanted to give Giselle a choice of two suitors. But the
point is that they are not equal: the Romantic hero is Albrecht,
because he sins knowingly, while Hilarion does not.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Vasiliev's choreographic additions,
especially a classical showcase for four couples in place of the
Peasant Pas de Deux, have a vibrant polish. In the end, wonderful
dancing carries the day. &QL;

TITO'S GRANDDAUGHTER BATTLES HATREDS THAT WRECKED YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Svetlana Broz stands out in the
lobby of Sarajevo's hotel, an elegant blonde woman out of place
amid the men in suits, members of the hard-line nationalist
Croatian party who are here for a party conference.
</P>
<P>
   Few appear to recognize her, but they would instantly recognize
her name, for everyone in the former Yugoslavia knows her
grandfather, Josip Broz, who as Tito was the Communist leader of
Yugoslavia for 35 years, from the end of World War II until his
death in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Broz, a confident, educated woman of 45, a cardiologist and a
divorced mother of two, grew up in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade,
and worked at the Military Medical Academy. But in 1993, when war
was tearing Bosnia apart, she began a personal crusade against the
nationalism that has destroyed the country her grandfather created.
</P>
<P>
   She left her home in Belgrade, and with her teen-age daughter
drove into Bosnia to offer her services in hospitals and clinics in
the Serb-controlled areas. ``I went because I refused to accept the
indifference in Belgrade to what was happening in Bosnia, and
because I could not accept that the Bosnians were another people,''
she said in one of two recent interviews with the New York Times.
``The people in Bosnia-Herzegovina were my people and I had to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days she would treat up to 100 people in a day, and she
found that many of her patients wanted to tell her stories, not so
much of the horrors they had experienced but of the gestures of
goodness from people who were often on opposing sides in the war.
These were tales little broadcast at the time, mainly because the
media of all sides were so nationalistic, but also because even
small deeds that could be construed as helpful to one's ethnic foes
put individual good Samaritans in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for some moments I put away my cardiological instruments
and took up my dictaphone, and I started collecting stories,'' she
said. ``I started in 1993 at the most aggressive time when people
were killing each other, yet people were prepared to talk of
goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   She published the stories in a book, ``Dobri Ljudi u Vremenu
Zla'' (Good People in Times of Evil), printed in the town of Banja
Luka in Bosnia's Serbian entity in 1999. Already on its second
print run of 5,000, it tells stories of the war from Serbs, Croats
and Muslims equally. It remains unavailable in Serbia and Croatia,
although she plans readings in Croatian resorts this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A Croatian doctor helps Muslim prisoners of his own army, and
later must flee when Muslims overrun his town. A Serbian taxi
driver in Sarajevo risks his life to ferry people around and bring
food to those living under the siege by Serbian forces. The mixed
village where Serbian and Muslim neighbors protected each other, as
they did in World War II, and survived unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a message, that even in the worst period, every
individual could make a choice and that there were a lot of people
who remained human in such a time,'' Broz said. ``People paid with
their lives but did not accept the brutal behavior of their own
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now living in Sarajevo and working on another book, this one
about mixed marriages that still occurred during the war, Broz said
she wanted to create a park in the Bosnian capital, once famed for
its multiethnic diversity. Inspired by the Yad Vashem park in
Jerusalem, this one would be dedicated to those unsung heroes of
the war, those who risked their lives to help people from the
opposing side.
</P>
<P>
   For Broz, the issue is fundamental. She acknowledges with a
smile that she has no place to call home and is hard put to say
which country she is from. Her father, Zarko Broz, was the eldest
surviving son of Tito's first marriage to Pelagia Belousova, a
Russian he met in Siberia during World War I. Tito himself was half
Croatian and half Slovenian.
</P>
<P>
   Her father fought in Russia in World War II, lost his right arm
defending Moscow, and then came to Belgrade the day after it was
liberated from Nazi forces in 1944. He accompanied his father to
meetings with Churchill. He then joined the Yugoslav Interior
Ministry, where he worked for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Broz was the only child of his third marriage to a Czech doctor
whose family came originally from Bosnia. ``My answer is I am a
cosmopolitan, and I call myself European since Yugoslavia
disappeared,'' she says. She adds that she feels no affinity to
today's Yugoslavia _ consisting of Serbia and, increasingly
nominally, Montenegro, and ruled by Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally and psychologically the whole of the former
territory of Yugoslavia is my country, and no one can take that
away from me, however many borders they put up in between,'' she
said. She still has her home in Belgrade, and both her children are
studying there, but she is now building a house on land that
belongs to her mother's family, in Hadzici, a village 12 miles
outside Sarajevo where she often spent holidays as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people of her generation, she looks back on the years
before war destroyed the old Yugoslavia as halcyon days of harmony
and prosperity, and she gives the credit to her grandfather, Tito.
``I lived for 35 years in a country that was magical,'' she said.
``So I believe in what I think was fundamental to his policies,
that was living together.''
</P>
<P>
   She rejects the argument that the Communist slogans of
brotherhood and unity were false or that suppressing ethnic
differences prepared the ground for a nationalist explosion. She
attributes the wars of the last decade rather to the calculated
moves by politicians who used nationalism to break up the country.
</P>
<P>
   She does, however, condemn the suppression of political freedom
under Tito _ who killed and imprisoned opponents and stamped out
even slight expressions of what was deemed to be nationalism. As a
democrat, Broz said, she cannot agree with the persecution of
people for their ideas. Yet in the same breath, she wondered if it
would not have been better if some dissidents, who became leading
nationalist politicians, had remained behind bars. ``I am against
political persecution, but when you look back, you can see that
those people led to the evil that happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She retains her harshest words for the intellectuals of
Yugoslavia and members of her own medical profession who joined and
even led the nationalist charge, like the Bosnian Serb leader Dr.
Radovan Karadzic, a former psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   She described a dangerous confrontation during the Bosnian war
with one of Karadzic's close associates, the head doctor of a
hospital who ordered her arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I should write about the evil, not the good,'' she
said. ``He said there was no good Croat except a dead Croat, and no
good Muslim except a dead one. I told him he was inhuman, and a
fascist and I was ashamed to be carrying the same diploma as him _
we graduated from the same medical school.''
</P>
<P>
   When a warrant went out for her arrest, she turned herself in,
but the policeman told her to carry on working. ``It showed a
policeman wasn't as bad as a doctor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She rules out a life in politics for herself. ``I am a humanist,
and my profession is completely different from politics,'' she
said. ``And anyway, there has been enough of that in my family.''

O.J. SIMPSON PROMOTES NEW WEB   SITE: ASKOJ.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson will appear on a series of television programs next
week, including ``Today'' on NBC and ``The View'' on ABC, to
publicize a Web site on which he will take questions from the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews will be rare television appearances for Simpson,
who, in the years since his acquittal on murder charges in 1994,
has been extensively interviewed only on Black Entertainment
Television in 1996 and on ESPN in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Simpson will be interviewed on ``Today'' by the
anchor Matt Lauer. On Wednesday he will appear on the ABC daytime
program ``The View,'' talking mainly with Barbara Walters and Star
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Wednesday he will be seen in an afternoon segment on
the Fox News Channel, and that night he will appear on the same
channel on the program ``The Edge'' with Paula Zahn.
</P>
<P>
   In all the appearances, Simpson will discuss the start-up of the
Web site AskOJ.com, established by the Entertainment Network, a
company that operates adult-oriented Web sites. Internet users, who
will be able to direct questions to him, will be charged a $9.95
fee to register for the site, said Brian Barry, a spokesman for the
company and Simpson. They will also be able to purchase what Barry
called ``O.J. memorabilia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. will be donating all his potential earnings from the Web
site to charity,'' Barry said, but he did not provide details of
the financial arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of ``Today,'' said Simpson
was doing the interviews to ``publicize the start of this Web
site.'' But both Zucker and Bill Geddie, the executive producer of
``The View,'' said no conditions had been placed on the interviews.
Zucker said Lauer would ``ask the questions you'd expect him to be
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker gave some examples: ``How is he supporting himself? How
are people treating him? How is he dealing with the financial
judgment against him?''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson lost a civil lawsuit over the deaths of his wife,
Nicole, and her friend Ron Goldman in 1997. He was ordered to pay
Simpson's and Goldman's families financial judgments totaling $33.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Geddie emphasized that ``The View'' is ``an opinion program''
and said, ``The image of O.J. sitting in the center of our panel of
women was too powerful to resist.'' He added, ``I think he knows
he's going to be sitting with people who believe he's a murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said he expected some viewers to be unhappy that
``Today'' was giving Simpson a forum to discuss his Web site, but
said, ``It's certainly a newsworthy interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Geddie said Simpson had originally contacted Walters about doing
an interview for her ABC News program, ``20/20,'' but said,
``Barbara did not want to interview him on that show.''
</P>
<P>
   Geddie added that the scheduled NBC appearance influenced his
decision to book the interview. ``Having him on the `Today' show
helped me,'' he said. ``I don't know if we would have gone out on a
limb to be the first to put him on. Being on `Today' gives it some
legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry said the Entertainment Network was based in Tampa, Fla. He
described it as a ``company that creates voyeuristic Web sites.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENTIANE, Laos _ The Asian economic crisis has claimed this
tiny communist nation as its last, its poorest and its most obscure
victim, and _ perhaps as a result _ Laos has suddenly been hit by
an unaccustomed shudder of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   A series of unexplained bomb blasts, an improbable cross-border
raid by a hapless band of insurgents and a brief political
demonstration _ the first in decades _ have raised the political
temperature in this quiet and tightly controlled nation.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in the one place the Indochina war never ended, reports
have surfaced that Vietnamese security forces have become active
again, if only in a supporting role, in tamping down a flare-up of
fighting by ethnic rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In this land of secrets and strongmen, no one outside the inner
circle seems to know what is going on, and indeed there may be no
one explanation for this troubled moment.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say that, as in some other Asian nations, the
economic squeeze may have heightened a variety of grievances. Last
year inflation hit 150 percent and the currency, the kip, fell to a
tenth of its value, the steepest collapse in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The exception may be the ethnic insurgency, which never quite
died after the communist victories in Indochina in 1975. It mostly
involves the Hmong hill tribesmen, descendants of the
anti-communist fighters who helped carry out America's ``secret
war'' in Laos, still stirred to action by local grievances as well
as by wartime commanders who fled to the United States two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Hmong (pronounced mung) still operate in the mountains of
northern Laos, where the North Vietnamese built most of their
supply line, the Ho Chi Minh trail, and where U.S. bombers dropped
more tonnage than in all of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a leftover of the Indochina war, which everyone tries
to forget,'' said Dr. Sunai Phasuk, a Thai expert on Laos at
Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. ``There are those who left for
foreign countries who still have their relatives in Laos and are
supporting them with every possible means.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports of Vietnamese military involvement are sketchy,
unconfirmed and hotly debated by analysts here and abroad. But they
are supported by eyewitness accounts from foreigners who work in
the mountains that border Vietnam, along with official reports of
stepped-up government and military contacts between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese are currently building a military hospital in the
area of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Sunai said military analysts in neighboring Thailand estimated
that a Vietnamese troop presence rose to 10,000 or more late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlyle A. Thayer, an Australian expert on the Vietnamese
military, said any Vietnamese presence probably involves a
long-standing deployment of troops from the Interior Ministry
rather than an incursion by the armed forces. ``At most it is
advice and supplies and equipment and people on the ground to
observe and report back to Vietnam,'' he said, noting that Vietnam
has its own concerns in keeping its mountain tribes quiet along the
porous border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since late last year, or earlier, the Hmong armed groups have
been giving the Lao army hell,'' he said. ``They've raided and
grabbed payrolls and grabbed weapons. They've ambushed columns and
shot down a helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Laotian government also blames the Hmong for at least five
small explosions here in Vientiane and elsewhere _ at a restaurant,
a bus station, a marketplace, a hotel and on a bus _ that caused a
number of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But most foreign analysts doubt that the Hmong were involved,
seeing the recent unrest as diffuse and without central
coordination. No one has claimed responsibility for any of the
bombs, and some of them may be copycat affairs involving personal
or business disputes.
</P>
<P>
   One event reported by an Asian diplomat did seem intended to
send a message. Gunmen are said to have stopped a rural bus,
removed its passengers, set it alight, photographed it and
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   A cross-border raid a earlier this month seemed to be the
clearest attempt to capitalize on the political uncertainties of
the moment. About 60 rebels armed with assault rifles and grenade
launchers crossed the border from Thailand, attacked a customs
post, took hostages, released them and were gunned down by
government forces. At least 5 were killed and 28 were captured when
they retreated into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thai reports, the raiders had a document linking
them to Crown Prince Soulivong Savang, the heir to the now-defunct
Laotian throne, who fled across the Mekong River after the
communist victory and is now lobbying for support in the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that this was an attempt to exploit the general
level of unhappiness in Laos,'' said Martin Stuart-Fox, a professor
of history at the University of Queensland in Australia who has
written a history of Laos. ``It's the old network of resistance
that was being supported by the Thai military and by an expatriate
Lao network in the United States and France and Australia and is
trying to resuscitate itself.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More than 250,000 Hmong now live in the United States, as well
as tens of thousands of lowland Lao.
</P>
<P>
   If the economic crisis is the underlying theme to the recent
violence, it may have sharpened a variety of agendas.
</P>
<P>
   According to one theory, the bomb blasts could be an attempt by
a faction of the ruling clique to discredit another in advance of a
party congress expected early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that anyone with a point to make may want to
be heard before Dec. 2, which is the 25th anniversary of the end of
the war in Laos and the takeover by the communist Pathet Lao
government.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That relatively low-key end to the war _ the U.S. Embassy shut
down for just one day _ came less than eight months after the
traumatic communist victories in Vietnam and Cambodia in April
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Laos has since reverted to its role as a buffer state between
communist Vietnam and China and the surging capitalist economies of
Southeast Asia. If Laos becomes unstable, one diplomat said, ``the
most frightening thing would be the reviving of some Cold War
traditions, with China and Vietnam backing Vientiane, hoping to
keep away the stronger influence of the Thais.''
</P>
<P>
   Laos, one of the world's 10 poorest countries, has become a
little brother to Vietnam, following its failed Communist policies
for a decade and then, like Vietnam, opening up its economy at the
start of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   When the economic crisis struck the region in 1997, Laos was at
first insulated by its isolation and poverty. But with its economy
heavily dependent on Thailand, it soon lost most of the investment
and markets it did have.
</P>
<P>
   Just about the time Thailand was beginning to recover, Laos
crashed. The 80 percent of its 5 million people who live on the
edge of poverty in the countryside remained relatively untouched _
as poor as ever.
</P>
<P>
   But civil servants, like teachers, nurses and bureaucrats, saw
their pay shrink to almost nothing and many abandoned their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Among these people, said a European diplomat, ``there is growing
unhappiness. There were hopes a couple of years ago that people's
lives were going to improve and that their children would have a
better future. That's just not here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading foreign expert on Laos saw this as the major source of
potential unrest and, possibly, of change. ``There was a social
contract in the early '90s,'' he said. ``That contract depended on
people's lives getting better. I think the theme is what I call the
undoing of the social contract, and the question is whether the
government can knit it back together, and it doesn't look as though
they're doing a very good job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``When there is an economic contraction like this, and
the pie at the top starts getting smaller, the possibility is that
members of the elite start getting fed up. The only way things will
come apart is when particular groups get squeezed out of the
action.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside the power structure, the European diplomat said,
``there is nothing here to take its place, no civil society, no
democratic opposition, nothing. This country is totally
repressed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thus, to diplomats and aid workers who live in Laos, the most
astonishing _ and poignant _ event was an aborted demonstration
last October that involved at least 50 university students and
teachers, of whom at least five remain in detention.
</P>
<P>
   This was the one echo Laos has seen of the pro-democracy
movements that have swept the region. In an open letter, the
protesters called for respect for human rights, the release of
political prisoners, a multiparty political system and elections
for a new National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Little more is known about the demonstrators or their fate. More
than in any other Communist nation, even the Soviet Union of the
past, diplomats here throw up their hands in confusion over the
nation they are observing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still vague and murky,'' said one of them. ``That's my
best assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a peculiar headline last week, the government newspaper
Vientiane Times seemed to be similarly mystified. ``The truth is
out there . . .'' read the headline, and stopped. The article
beneath it offered little clue.

 -COX &HT;    Auto icon Iacocca has his thumb in another pie
 &HT;    By Paul Owers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Asking Lee Iacocca what kind of car he drives is like
asking a priest about the prayers he prefers.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Iacocca, the dean of the American auto industry,
skips around town in several models, but DaimlerChrysler's new PT
Cruiser might be his favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very practical,'' he said Wednesday from the second-floor
study of his suite at the Hotel Inter-Continental in downtown
Miami. ``And it's cute as a bug.''
</P>
<P>
   As in insect _ not VW, which he quickly dismisses for lack of
room. You'll see Jeeps and minivans in Iacocca's Bel Air, Calif.,
garage, along with a mint condition MG.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of great specialty cars out there,'' said the
man who gave us the Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   Iacocca, former head of Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., was
in South Florida briefly this week to promote Olivio Premium
Products, a Boston-based company that has been one of his many
business interests since leaving the top post at Chrysler in 1992.
He also has been involved with electric bicycles, casinos, and
investment banking ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Olivio makes Olivio Premium Spread, a butter substitute made
with olive and canola oils. The salty spread is cholesterol-free
and contains 85 percent less saturated fat than butter, the company
said. Health magazine has named the spread one of its 10 tastiest
low-fat foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people think of Lee Iacocca, they think of cars,'' Olivio
spokeswoman Karren Walsh said. ``But what most people don't know is
that his lifelong passion is food.''
</P>
<P>
   Iacocca, 75, the son of Italian immigrants, developed the idea
for a butter substitute more than 10 years ago when he and his
son-in-law, Ned Hentz, were taking an after-dinner stroll on
Iacocca's 25-acre estate in Tuscany. Iacocca, who cooks frequently,
wanted a spread that was healthy and began to hire food experts.
The spread first went to market in 1995 in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Hentz, a former advertising executive married to Iacocca's
daughter, Kathi, is president and chief executive of Olivio Premium
Products. The company's chief operating officer is Vincent Auty,
who helped create the ``I Can't Believe It's Not Butter'' brand of
margarine.
</P>
<P>
   Hentz and nutritionist Dr. Walter Willett are developing other
good-for-you products and are planning to roll out Olivio
mayonnaise and cooking and salad oils.
</P>
<P>
   The Olivio spread is manufactured in Baltimore by a division of
European food giant Unilever, which this year bought Slim-Fast
Foods Co. of West Palm Beach for $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The spread generated about $3 million in sales last year _ a
decent number considering it's available in only about 20 percent
of the nation, Hentz said. Publix, Albertson's and Wal-Mart are
among the retailers that now carry the spread in Florida, with
one-pound containers selling for $1.69.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you gave 10 people the product, I can't imagine fewer than
four would not make it their brand,'' Hentz said. ``It's really
about sampling. It's getting there. It's starting to round the
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at his Miami hotel suite overlooking Biscayne Bay, Iacocca,
who owned a house in Boca Raton for 21 years, touched on other
topics before catching a flight back to California to continue his
semi-retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't mind America's reliance on technology _ as
long as it works. He opposed air bags in cars because he said they
initially were unsafe. But once the feature was perfected, he
embraced it and was the first to put air bags on the passenger
side.
</P>
<P>
   As for the looming presidential election, Iacocca said he's
unsure what will happen. An independent who was asked to run in the
1988 presidential race, he said he has never met candidates George
W. Bush or Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's for what anymore,'' Iacocca said. ``Whoever
comes across as the most human will win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why (President) Clinton has done so well. He thinks
fast on his feet, plus he was in the right place at the right
time.''

   BRITAIN: IRISH BOMB SNARLS LONDON
</P>
<P>
   A bomb planted by dissident Irish republicans on a suburban rail
line brought traffic gridlock to London. Northern Ireland Secretary
Peter Mandelson said the bombers used a known code word in
telephone warning calls from Dublin. The police shut down the rail
line and safely detonated the bomb. Renegade groups have pledged a
bombing campaign to protest the cooperation of the Irish Republican
Army and its political party, Sinn Fein, in the Northern Ireland
peace pact.

<P>
   GERMANY: FALLING POPULATION
</P>
<P>
   An expected 20 percent drop in the population by 2050 could only
be made up for by raising the retirement age and importing millions
of immigrant workers, a study by the Federal Statistics Office
said. The population is expected to drop by 17 million from 82
million now, even if 100,000 more people move to Germany each year
than leave. In 1950 there were twice as many people under 20 as
over 60, a ratio that will be reversed by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: BASQUE OFFENSIVE CONTINUES
</P>
<P>
   Armed Basque separatists continued an offensive with the bombing
of a shopping center in Vitoria, the capital of the Basque region,
and a failed bid to blow up a politician's car in Malaga as he took
his wife and daughter shopping. There were no injuries in either
incident, the fourth and fifth in a week tied to the ETA group.

   ARGENTINA: FALKLAND SUIT THROWN OUT
</P>
<P>
   The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, has
ruled that it is too late for relatives of Argentine sailors killed
in the Falkland war to seek compensation from Britain. The court
said a claim by relatives of two of the 323 sailors killed in the
sinking of the Argentine Navy cruiser General Belgrano, should have
been made their claims within six months of the sailors' deaths in
1982. No appeal is possible.

<P>
   MEXICO: POLICE CRACKDOWN
</P>
<P>
   Concluding an investigation into the embezzlement of $121
million budgeted for police salaries, the Mexico City auditor
barred several dozen current and former police commanders from
holding public jobs in the future. The sanctions virtually
decapitated the Auxiliary Police, a 40,000-officer force that
serves private companies and government agencies.

<P>
   SOUTH AFRICA: AIRPORT ALERT
</P>
<P>
   Security forces have increased patrols at the country's airports
after a small bomb exploded outside a terminal at Cape Town
International. No one was injured, but it was another blow to the
image of the city, a leading tourist destination. In the last two
years, Cape Town has been hit by a string of bombings carried out,
the police suspect, by a vigilante group.
</P>
<P>
   KENYA: ANONYMOUS CORRUPTION
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of rowdy debate, an investigative report on
corruption in Parliament was diluted as members voted to delete
names of top officials and their relatives involved in the theft of
hundreds of millions of public dollars. The report was known in
Kenya as the ``List of Shame'' because it made allegations by name,
including the vice president, George Saitoti; Trade and Tourism
Minister Nicholas Biwott; a son of President Daniel arap Moi, and
nearly a dozen cabinet members.

<P>
   The South Korean government proposed high-level talks with the
North Korean government in Seoul July 27-29 to discuss how to carry
out the accord reached in the summit meeting between the two
leaders of the divided peninsula last month. President Kim Dae Jung
of South Korea agreed with Kim Jong Il of the North to work toward
reconciliation. The follow-up talks would be the first governmental
talks between the two sides in Seoul in nine years.

   INDIA: 3 AIDES QUIT
</P>
<P>
   Three government ministers handed in their resignations in
protest at a decision to arrest Bal Thackeray, the leader of their
hard-line Hindu party, Shiv Sena. But Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee refused to accept them, a spokesman said. The Maharashtra
state government gave the police permission to prosecute Thackeray
for his writings in a party newspaper during 1992-93 religious
clashes that left thousands dead.

   CHINA: FALUN GONG ARRESTS
</P>
<P>
   Armed policemen rounded up more Falun Gong followers in
Tiananmen Square on the eve of the first anniversary of the
government's crackdown on the spiritual group. Plainclothes
officers converged on a man who tried to unfurl a banner, bustling
him into one of the many police vans that are parked around the
clock on the square. Dozens of others were rounded up and the
square cleared for a visit by President Vladimir Putin of Russia.

<P>
   Xerox, Memorex, Betamax , Napster?
</P>
<P>
   If the company behind the file-sharing software wants some
comfort, it could consider its multitude of lawsuits a sort of
badge of honor. After all, like the copy machine, recordable
audiotape and the VCR, Napster makes information sharing easier.
It's just that a lot of that shared information happens to be
copyrighted.
</P>
<P>
   So, the entertainment industry has turned to lawsuits. Trouble
is, Napster has created the potential for millions of people to
break the law, and even if it's shut down, there are similar
programs out there that would gladly take its place. So, the
industry is left with some scenarios:
</P>
<P>
   Adapt to the new technology - Traditionally, this has taken the
entertainment industry the longest to do. The most famous example
is Hollywood's lawsuit to ban Sony's Betamax, the VCR's precursor.
Sony won, and the movie industry went on to make billions off
videotape sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a new product is introduced, it seems the
entertainment industry has fought it,'' says Mike Blevins, a
spokesman for the Home Recording Rights Coalition in Washington,
D.C. ``It's mind-boggling when you consider how different our lives
might be if the VCR weren't here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Figure out ways to discourage the making of illegal copies -
This could be done by either making encryption so complicated that
it's not worth the time to hack, or by providing content in an
equally easy, yet legal, way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are getting easy access to a good product at a fair
price with no hassles in getting that product, then the vast
majority of people will choose legal content,'' says Geordie
Wilson, consumer-products manager for the Windows Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   Hope the ambiguity of current digital copyright law swings in
favor of the copyright holder - So far, it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the high-water mark for programs like
Napster,'' says Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of the
Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School.
``It's not going to be a free-for-all years from now. Those who are
gnashing their teeth and saying, `God, the only way I'm going to
get on the Internet is if I'm giving stuff away,' I think it's
going to be a very different landscape soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Clarke, a 23-year-old e-commerce consultant from London,
sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, he completed work on Freenet, a file-sharing
program designed to give its users anonymity. Ideally, it would be
used in such countries as China or Saudi Arabia, where free speech
is prohibited. The program, however, is blind to the type of
information shared, meaning that copyrighted material could be
traded as easily as recipes.
</P>
<P>
   In Clarke's world, all information eventually will be free,
effectively nullifying the entire concept of copyright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that as communications technology improves, it will
become increasingly difficult to restrict the sharing of
information,'' he says. ``Freenet makes it extra-difficult, if not
impossible, to restrict the sharing of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, that's far from happening, and the entertainment
industry is doing everything it can to make sure it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, the recording industry and technology
companies teamed up to form the Secure Digital Music Initiative to
devise a framework for the playing, storing and distribution of
material. Meanwhile, lawsuits, many involving interpretations of
1998's Digital Millennium Copyright Act, continue to shape the law.
</P>
<P>
   If history repeats itself, then this is merely the industry's
growing pains. That's the belief of Leonardo Chiariglione, the
Italian engineer who in 1988 helped form the Moving Picture Experts
Group, a team of international experts in audio and video. The
group created a standard for compressing large audio files, called
MPEG-1, Layer 3, or MP3, the popularity of which has led to the
trading of digital music and, eventually, Napster's success.
</P>
<P>
   So, the recording industry turned to Chiariglione for help,
asking him to head the Secure Digital Music Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   As he puts it, ``New technologies, new possibilities, new
threats and new technologies to cope with the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiariglione said he sees that threat spreading to movies,
electronic books and video games.
</P>
<P>
   In film, that's happening already. A compression format called
DivX - sharing the name of the failed Circuit City plan for
pay-per-view DVDs - that combines elements of MPEG technology has
steadily gained popularity on the Web. For now, the factors
limiting DivX - besides the fact that much of the content is in
violation of copyright laws - are that files are about 100 times
larger than MP3s, the selection of films is minimal and its success
depends on whether people want to watch movies on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the success of MP3s has shown, the market for
downloadable content is there. Although the music industry has to
play catch-up, film companies and book publishers have some time to
prepare. That's where the burgeoning field of digital-rights
management comes in.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how such companies work, in June the
digital-rights management firm Reciprocal offered a secure download
of the trailer for Adam Sandler's upcoming film (beginitalic)Little
Nicky(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Users download the trailer from the film's Web site. Upon the
first viewing, a users must connect to Reciprocal's Web site and
enter his or her e-mail address and ZIP code, after which the user
will receive a certificate that's stored on his or her computer.
</P>
<P>
   The file can be traded with other users, but each subsequent
person must apply for the certificate upon the initial viewing. The
(beginitalic)Little Nicky (enditalic)trailer is free; in the case
of, say, a new Britney Spears single, a person could have to pay
for the file before listening to it the first time; each other
person to whom the file was sent also would have to pay. That
defeats the notion of one person paying for the song and putting it
on Napster for everyone else to have.
</P>
<P>
   The key is making it simple. The more complicated the process,
the less likely a person is to go through it. But the less secure
the process, the less likely a company will be to make content
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balance that has yet to be achieved in the
marketplace,'' says Larry Miller, president of Reciprocal's music
division. ``Content providers have to be confident enough to make
it available for consumers to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side, you have to make it seamless. You don't
want the technical solution to override the consumer's need to make
it a seamless, maybe even fun, experience.''

   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ At what price can someone regain honor
and peace of mind?
</P>
<P>
   After quarterback Randall Cunningham accepted the 1998 most
valuable player trophy as the NFL's best player, he wasn't worth a
case of beer last year in Minnesota. He became a forgotten man
early in the season, booed by fans, treated like yesterday's
newspaper by teammates. The best way to save face was to get out of
town before the snow melted.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic he would land with the Dallas Cowboys, the team he
hated most during his first 10 seasons in the NFL. Yet Dallas
offers Cunningham an opportunity to complete his career on his
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good situation for me, playing with the best in
front of you,'' said Cunningham, towering over a group of visitors
after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy's the best. Who's still playing in the league who has won
three Super Bowls?''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham was referring to Troy Aikman, of course, who has no
plans to let the newest Cowboy play this year. That's what makes
the acquisition of Cunningham so intriguing. Why would someone who
has been a hallmark player for 14 years want to be someone's caddy?
A three-year, $3 million deal makes the former Viking and Eagle an
expensive understudy.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but team owner Jerry Jones saw something in Cunningham when
they met early this year. Jones is convinced Cunningham's skill
level is closer to his 1998 season than 1999's meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happened to Troy, we'd have a player who not only
could protect us from losing the game, but someone whose unique
skills could win the game,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   A QUICK DOWNFALL
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham won a lot of games in 1998, the year Minnesota
practically rewrote the NFL record book. He played target practice
with Cris Carter and a young man named Randy Moss, the runaway
choice for Rookie of the Year honors. Despite missing the first two
games of the season, Cunningham threw an amazing 34 touchdown
passes, averaging 270 yards passing a game.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham was the toast of Minneapolis after the Vikings came
within one field goal of representing the NFC in the Super Bowl.
That hardly diminished the stature of the Vikings' leader, who
resurrected a career that had many peaks and few valleys during 10
seasons in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   If 1998 was an indication, 1999 would certainly bring more
fortune to Minnesota and more fame to Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings broke from the gate at 2-4, with Cunningham
struggling. He was benched after Minnesota was shut out in the
first half of the seventh game, and would never return. With Jeff
George playing well in the second half of the season, Cunningham
was left to kick Gatorade cups on the stadium floor, quietly
pondering what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Why was the MVP pulled so quickly?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still searching for the answer to that,'' Cunningham said
during a 103-degree afternoon. ``I just think maybe it was God's
will for me to be in Dallas. I can go out and ask (Vikings coach)
Dennis (Green), but he might not have the solution or the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, 37, speaks with a calm, soothing tone when he
reflects on those troubling times. He says he holds no animosity,
but his piercing eyes suggest there are unsettled issues that might
never be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Again, what happened last year?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, offensive coordinator and Cunningham favorite
Brian Billick left Minnesota to become the head coach of the
Baltimore Ravens. When the ship began to sink in '99, no one wanted
to save him from drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, I think if Brian had been there with me last
year, I don't think I'd have been sitting down,'' Cunningham told
the Minneapolis Star Tribune last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finger got pointed a lot of ways,'' he said this week.
``I'm sure some of it was my fault since so much was expected of
our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BEST FIT
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham had no intention of retiring this year, not after his
MVP trophy had been blemished with humility. Detroit and Tampa Bay
called him. Detroit's Charlie Batch is injured, and Tampa Bay
quarterback Shaun King remains an NFL neophyte who has not proven
himself during a full season. Certainly someone of Cunningham's
caliber would look good in a Lions or Buccaneers jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He said no to both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, he said, has a better chance to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has great coaches, first of all,'' Cunningham said.
``They have a great owner. Jerry wants to win. That the No. 1 thing
for him. It's not the money thing. He just wants to be successful
at whatever he does. That flows down from him to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only can Dallas be a playoff contender again, Cunningham
believes the Cowboys are comparable to the 1998 Vikings who were
considered the best team in football before falling to Atlanta in
the NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have had the most powerful offense in the history of
the league, but this team has a more rounded offense,'' he said.
``Every position here is stacked. It makes a big difference because
when backups have to play, they have to go in and get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham enters camp as the No. 2 quarterback, an insurance
policy for Aikman, whose history of concussions makes him
vulnerable for another. In Aikman's 11 seasons, he has played in
all 16 games just three times.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman still gets the majority of snaps in practice and aims for
starting wideouts Joey Galloway and Rocket Ismail. Cunningham,
whose improvisational skills makes him ill-suited for the Cowboys'
timing-based offense, has thrown to the likes of Chris Brazzell and
Jeff Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cunningham is an icon to many of the young faces in Cowboys
camp. Many of the current players remember him as one of the
league's most exciting players, someone whose daring moves became
the rage of the league. Someone who was MVP just two years ago must
have something left in the tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Randall steps into the huddle, he automatically deserves
respect because of what he's accomplished,'' said Cowboys assistant
Bill Bates, who played against Cunningham many times during his
15-year career in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what Randall has done against us,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Cunningham is with the Cowboys. Dallas is one
city where his desire and talent were never questioned.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ian Clarke's vision is the entertainment industry's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In developing a program called Freenet, designed to allow the
anonymous, free trade of information, Clarke was hoping to help
further the notion that free speech is fundamental by giving
residents of restrictive countries a tool to speak their minds
without fear of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   It is a decentralized network - no one controls it, so no one
can shut it down. Napster is centralized; shut it down, and the
network goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Like other file-sharing programs, Freenet (available at
freenet.sourceforge.net) lacks the ability to distinguish between a
top-secret CIA file and a dog photo. This means that if users want
to exploit Freenet by trading copyrighted material (or even child
pornography), they can. No one controls Freenet; no one can stop
them.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke says that it wasn't designed for that, but that he can't
do anything about it. After all, Freenet was built to resist
attempts to remove information from it. But it also was designed so
that the most requested information remains in the network.
Information few are interested in - say, an anonymous missive about
your controlling boss - will die out, replaced by other files.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the entertainment industry suffers, Clarke fails
to sound that broken up about it. His opinion is that technology
will improve to the point that it will be impossible to control
what kind of information is shared. All information will be free;
nothing will be copyrighted.
</P>
<P>
   Absurd? Perhaps. But look at Napster: Even though such irate
bands as Metallica have identified users who trade copyrighted
files, its popularity persists, despite the threat - however remote
- of legal action. Gnutella, a less-popular program that, like
Freenet, is decentralized, offers near-anonymity. So what happens
when a program achieves perfect anonymity?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be that the idea that you can kind of prevent
people from copying and sharing information will just seem
ridiculous,'' Clarke says from his London home.
</P>
<P>
   Censorship is a hot topic for Clarke, especially now that the
British government is considering laws allowing police to view
private e-mails. As countries attempt to legislate the Internet,
Freenet could be a way to skirt those laws.
</P>
<P>
   But although Freenet allows for anonymity, such technology as
digital signatures could allow for some type of accountability. It
would be comparable to receiving a series of anonymous letters all
in distinguishable handwriting; the person is recognizable, but not
identifiable. That's important in differentiating between a dingbat
and Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody posts allegations without any kind of support,
then anyone who believes it is really kind of an idiot,'' Clarke
says. ``Why not let the people reading it decide what's the truth?
You can't really trust any information that is completely
anonymous.''

   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ On a hectic Friday morning, the first stop
for the white plumbing van was . . . the beach. ``Sometimes it
helps to pay a visit to the waves before I start dealing with the
people,'' said Bob Donohue, one of a handful of veteran
air-conditioner repairmen in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   But on this particular morning, Donohue found no time for
reflection.
</P>
<P>
   There was a knock on the van's door.

   ``Excuse me, but are you a plumber?'' asked a kind-looking
middle-aged man, out walking his springer spaniel. ``I'm having a
problem with the _ what do you call it? _ thermostat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, this must be summer. And in the summer here, it is not the
homeowners who reign. Underpinning almost every house is a network
of people, a veritable phalanx of well-paid but indefatigable
workers. These are the heroes of the Hamptons: the air-conditioning
workers, the electricians, the rose pruners, the hedge trimmers,
the house watchers and the rest of the men and women who keep every
weathered shingled cottage _ owned or rented _ ticking away like a
gold Rolex.
</P>
<P>
   Tree man, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a tree guy,'' said Jeffrey Fisher, the
homeowner who knocked on Donohue's van door. ``Then there's the
hot-pot person _ the one who plants your pots on the terrace. Now,
who else do we have? The plumber, the boiler man, the house
watcher, the house cleaner, the pest control guy, the lawn mower
guy, the turf guy, the irrigation guy, the pool person and the pool
heater person.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher questions the competence of a plumbing company that did
recent work, but he's afraid to say anything negative. The savvy
homeowners know that money can't buy everything, even in the
Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   ``One very well-known man arrived here to find his air
conditioning wasn't working,'' said Diane Saatchi, a local real
estate broker. ``He called up the air-conditioning man and started
screaming. When he stopped, the repairman, without raising his
voice, said: `Listen, pal, there are hundreds of millionaires like
you out here. There are only two air-conditioning repairmen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then the repairman hung up, she said. ``He didn't need the
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Nan Noel, a jacqueline-of-all-trades, often turns down clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this week, someone called who had been referred by
someone else and asked if I could come over,'' said Noel, who
arranges for house cleaning, car washing, dog grooming and just
about anything a lord or lady of the manor could need. ``These
people wanted me to stay there _ right then _ while the movers
came.'' She declined the job. ``I could see in advance what they
would expect. These people had no boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, however, she provides a big chunk of the good life.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman is an editor in New York and she doesn't get here
until 2 or 3 in the morning; she likes to sleep until 11:30
Saturday morning so I never disturb her,'' said Noel, who, among
other things, boards the editor's dog during the week. ``But on
Saturday afternoon, I arrive with her dog, her newspaper _ and her
strawberry muffins.''
</P>
<P>
   Noel charges $35 an hour for her own time, and works mainly with
regular clients. Then she passes on the charges of the maintenance
people she employs. Hamptonites like their grass to be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   One oceanfront cottage was surrounded by swaths of ferns and
naturalistic plantings. But there was something odd _ too perfect _
about the lawn on the hillside. ``It's all sod,'' said Craig Socia,
a garden designer, who supervises the maintenance of 33 houses in
the Hamptons. ``We had it laid this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Just mowing the lawn on the most palatial of these estates can
run $500 a week, Socia said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory P. Kirwan, a partner in Casual Water, charges $49.95 a
week to service an average pool. ``When I visit my parents in
Florida, my relatives in Arizona, I check out the prices,'' he
said. ``For what we charge for one week here, they can get a whole
month of service there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, after the quick stop to look at the waves, Donohue,
an avid surfer, headed for his first service call.
</P>
<P>
   There, up a curving gravel driveway, stood the shingled home of
Steve and Diane Jacobson. Steve Jacobson came out of the side door
to greet Donohue, who works for Schenck Fuels here. Donohue bustled
into the basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a problem in the basement and I was trying to find the
fuse box,'' Jacobson explained. ``And I walked through some water.
A puddle, on the floor.'' He laughed. ``There's no way the city
slicker can do without these guys. It'd be better to sell the house
and buy a condominium. This company responds right away, but most
of the time, they say, `See you in two weeks.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the basement, Donohue adjusted the thermostat on the boiler,
which someone had turned up to 240 degrees. ``It wasn't me,''
Jacobson insisted, with a laugh. ``There are spider webs down
there; it's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, eight Hamptons houses sold for $2 million to $3
million in the first three months, according to Cook Pony Farm Real
Estate. In the first three months of 2000, 20 sold in that price
range.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new homeowners are first-time owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so young,'' Noel said. ``One woman said: `What do I
know about a house? The last place I lived was a dorm.'''
</P>
<P>
   What was the problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a fly in her refrigerator,'' Noel said.
</P>
<P>
   The young homeowner _ she just closed on her house last week _
was anxious. ``She also was saying her fiance couldn't sleep in the
bedroom because it was bright. Well, any hardware store sells
blackout blinds. But how would she know that?'' Noel said. ``I
asked her where the entrance to the basement was and she said: `I
don't know. Is there a basement?'''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the maintenance people dislike is homeowners who try
to do their pools _ or anything else _ themselves. ``One client
tried to do it himself,'' Noel said. ``And he stored all these
chlorine tablets in the basement; it says right on the bucket
you're supposed to store it outside.''
</P>
<P>
   After struggling with possibly toxic fumes and an unopenable
plastic bucket, she gave up and told him to hire a pool service.
``It's people like him who give customers a bad name,'' she said.
``Here he is trying to save $1.50 on this multimillion home.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirwan, the pool man, said he gets most of his angriest calls
when new homeowners receive their first bill. ``They call up
screaming, because they've gotten a bill for $500 to open their
pool,'' he said. ``They don't realize how many chemicals we use.
They think we're making money on all these chemicals and they don't
really need them.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a cup of coffee at the Golden Pear here, Rodney Herrlin and
Christopher Schenck, whose great-grandfather started Schenck Fuels,
assessed the ways things have changed. ``It used to be that we knew
a lot of our customers, 25 or 30 years,'' Schenck said. ``Now, it's
two or three years, they're selling their homes and moving; they
aren't setting their roots. It used to be, you'd say, `You need a
new furnace,' and they didn't ask why and run around getting other
estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's customers are apt to be more impatient, too. ``It gets a
little vicious,'' Herrlin said. ``Especially in the midst of the
summer. People just keep calling: `I called 25 minutes ago and
nobody's here yet.'''
</P>
<P>
   But those people may be cutting their own throats,
maintenance-wise.
</P>
<P>
   They may not know that it takes several seasons to cultivate a
crew. ``Until the tradespeople know you're going to pay the bills
and not be abusive to their staff,'' Saatchi, the real estate
agent, explained, ``they may be a little tough to find out here.''

COMMENTARY: THE CRIME FIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An important but frequently overlooked factor in the nationwide
decline in crime over the past few years has been the corresponding
decline in the unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive policing and long prison sentences get most of the
attention. Credit is also belatedly being given to the often heroic
and usually unheralded crime-fighting efforts of local groups and
individuals in poor neighborhoods, and to the many young people who
have stepped back from the lure of drugs and antisocial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a study by a pair of Washington economists that
appears to confirm a point that has seemed like common sense to a
lot of people, but that politicians have never pushed vehemently
enough: A job is one of the most effective weapons in the nation's
crime-fighting arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just common sense but longstanding economic theory that
suggests a link between lower rates of joblessness and lower rates
of crime. The new study by the Economic Policy Institute looked at
crime rates and employment statistics in several regions of the
country between 1989 and 1998 and found evidence to support that
theory.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, ``An examination of unemployment, wages,
and crime rates by region shows unemployment and crime rates
falling together, and rising wages and crime rates moving apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking specifically at unemployment rates for young men, the
study found that since 1992 the jobless rate had fallen by at least
four percentage points in each region, with the largest decline in
the Northeast, which is also where crime rates fell most quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study, Jared Bernstein and Ellen Houston,
wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor market conditions are not, of course, the only or even
necessarily the prime determinant of crime rates. Over the 1990s,
the U.S. sharply increased its expenditures on prisons,
incarcerating a growing number of the population and passing `get
tough' crime prevention legislation. These interventions have
undoubtedly played a large role in lowering crime rates. But the
link between crime and labor market opportunity is too often
ignored in the current policy debate over crime, which focuses
almost solely on longer sentences and prison expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The people at highest risk for engaging in crime are young men,
primarily from ethnic minority groups, ``with low levels of
education and a weak attachment to the labor market,'' the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overwhelming employment obstacles faced by
individuals in that group, many have found work as a result of the
current long-running economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, in an interview, said, ``As unemployment fell below the
level of 5 percent over the last couple of years, you can see that
real economic opportunities are being expanded for those who are
probably the most disadvantaged low-wage workers in society.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a hunger among Americans everywhere, including the poor
and the otherwise disadvantaged, for meaningful employment. The
benefits to be gained from putting people to work are endless, and
one of those benefits is a safer society.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, Houston and Bernstein felt it was important
when looking at the problem of crime to pay more attention to labor
market policies and the value of employment.
</P>
<P>
   They say in the study, ``The Federal Reserve can play a decisive
role here by focusing on its full-employment mandate with at least
the same fervor it devotes to interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are other issues _ for example, the importance in a
time of unprecedented prosperity of approving a boost in the
minimum wage; and the need for no-nonsense education and training
for low-wage workers, and for ex-criminal offenders, many of whom
are released into communities across America each and every day.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider the factors crucial to building a safe and
secure society, employment is right there at the top. The idea is
to get as many people working for a decent wage as is humanly
possible, rather than searching for excuses as to why this person
can't be paid a living wage and that person can't be allowed to
work at all.

NORTH KOREA REPORTED OPEN TO HALTING MISSILE PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In an announcement intended to remove the prime
rationale for a U.S. missile defense plan, Russia's president,
Vladimir Putin, said on Wednesday that North Korea had offered to
abandon its missile program if other nations would provide it with
rockets for launching satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Putin announced the offer after a meeting in Pyongyang, the
North Korean capital, with that country's leader, Kim Jong Il. The
visit was a first for a Russian president and was part of an
intensive round of Asian diplomacy aimed at mobilizing opposition
to the American antimissile plan. On Tuesday, Putin signed a joint
statement with the Chinese denouncing U.S. plans for a missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has responded by saying it hoped to clarify
the North Korean offer when Putin meets Western leaders at a
meeting of the world's leading industrial countries in Okinawa,
Japan, starting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said Washington could not agree to the
offer if it meant putting Western missile technology in North
Korean hands. But he said the United States would be willing to
explore an arrangement in which North Korea's satellites would be
brought to other nations for launching into space.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Kim, Putin implied that North Korea had
offered to give up the testing, development and production of
missiles. What North Korea is seeking in return was not entirely
clear, but Putin suggested that it was not just launching services
but foreign rocket boosters that would be brought to North Korea so
that it could send satellites into space.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Putin put it, the North Korean leader ``voiced an idea
under which North Korea is even prepared to use exclusively the
rocket equipment of other countries for peaceful space research if
they offered it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One should expect that countries that assert the D.P.R.K.
poses a threat to them would support this project,'' Putin added,
using the abbreviation for the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, the formal name of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has repeatedly urged North Korea to stop the
development, production and sale of missiles. North Korea has
halted flight tests as part of an understanding with Washington,
but has not previously suggested that it might stop making
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Leon V. Sigal, a specialist on northeast Asia at the Social
Science Research Council in New York, said the North Korean offer
signaled a willingness to reach an accommodation. ``North Korea's
basic strategy is to use its missile program to move its
relationship with the United States away from one of hostility,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's offer, Sigal said, appeared to be an echo of the
nuclear deal North Korea had struck previously with the Clinton
administration. Under that arrangement, North Korea agreed to shut
down its plutonium-producing reactor at Yongbyon, which had been a
major worry for Western experts who feared the plutonium was being
used for nuclear bombs. In return, the West agreed to provide two
light-water nuclear reactors, which would supply electricity but
are far less useful for making nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Kurt Campbell, a former senior Pentagon official with
responsibility for Asia and the Pacific, doubted the West would
provide rocket boosters to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology would be transferable,'' Campbell said. ``Japan
would be anxious, and there is still much that we don't understand
about what is going on in North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean offer comes at a critical time. The United
States is nearing a decision on whether to build a missile defense
system. It is engaged in sensitive talks with Pyongyang about its
missile program. And relations have begun to thaw on the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in recent talks between the United States and
North Korea was businesslike, although there was no breakthrough.
The Clinton administration has sought to persuade North Korea to
abandon its sale of missile technology, offering assistance in
agriculture and public health in return.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, in contrast, has demanded $1 billion a year for
stopping missile exports. And it has insisted that it will continue
to develop missiles for its own defense, a stance that seemed at
variance with the proposal announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States became especially concerned about North Korea
after Pyongyang tried launching a satellite in August 1998 using a
three-stage Taepo Dong-1 missile. Though the satellite never went
into orbit, North Korea's use of a three-stage missile caught U.S.
intelligence officials by surprise. It was a sign that North
Korea's missile program was moving along more quickly than U.S.
officials had suspected.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, North Korea has abandoned work on the Taepo
Dong-1 in favor of a newer Taepo Dong-2 missile. U.S. intelligence
has judged that if North Korea did violate the test moratorium it
might be able to develop in a matter of months a rudimentary
missile capable of reaching the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper issue is what North Korea might do with such a
weapon. Some experts fear that North Korea could use it to threaten
the United States. North Korea is believed to have nuclear material
for two warheads at most, compared with 6,000 for the United
States. The experts argue that North Korea is so unpredictable that
it might threaten a strike anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Other specialists, however, say North Korea has shown a healthy
respect for U.S. military might. It has concluded an accord to
freeze its nuclear program and has suspended missile test flights.
Now, they say, it may be willing to bargain away its missile
program, albeit for the right price.

THE RISE AND FALL OF RUSSIA'S NOBLEST FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 
 EDS: Accompanies STROGANOFF-EXHIBITION  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By WAYNE LEE GAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were at center stage of Russian life for nearly five
centuries, always willing to devote their immense wealth and
political clout to the Russian Empire. From generation to
generation, right up to the revolution in 1917, the Stroganoffs had
a knack for betting on the winning horse, staying on the good side
of the czar and sensing historical trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were earthy people,'' says the Baroness Helene de
Ludinghausen, the surviving scion of the centuries-old dynasty.
``The most important thing is, they knew how to move and diversify.
... And they helped people who needed it. Every time they built a
village, there was always a school, a church and a hospital,'' she
said in a recent telephone interview with the Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Like many great families, the Stroganoffs had rough-and-tumble
beginnings. Some sources say they originated in the Moscow region,
but other historians suggest that the Stroganoffs descended from
the semibarbaric Asiatic tribes of eastern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its genesis, the family showed a talent for wheeling
and dealing as early as the 1300s, and it rose to political
prominence in 1445 when Luka Stroganoff paid the ransom for Prince
Vassily the Dark, who had been captured by the Tatars.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th century _ about the same time Henry VIII was wading
through his marital difficulties in England _ the Stroganoffs,
savvy and tough, diversified the fortune they had made with
saltworks in northern Russia into ironworks, fur-trading, fishing
and agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
   The Stroganoffs translated their financial clout into political
power by paying for the Russian Empire's first forays into Siberia
_ hiring the infamous bandit Yermak to organize an army of
mercenaries to fight their Tatar cousins _ and in the process
gaining the gratitude of Czar Ivan the Terrible. By 1600, what
would today be called ``Stroganoff Family Enterprises,'' employed
6,000 workers and owned almost everything of value in Russian
Siberia, including 8.5 million acres, held tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th century brought a new heyday for the family. Realizing
that the new capital city of St. Petersburg was where things were
happening and that Russia was becoming more Eurocentric, the
Stroganoffs shed their rural ways, learned French (with the rest of
the Russian upper crust), built a palace and settled into court
life. This was when a clever chef invented a mixture of beef and
spices in a rich sauce and named it for Count Pavel Stroganoff,
ensuring the immortality of the family name in cookbooks and on
menus worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Stroganoffs traveled to Western Europe, where one
temporarily wayward son of the dynasty shocked Catherine the Great
by joining the French Revolution. She called him back to Russia,
where he and his family, the revolutionary bug cured, continued to
build palaces and churches and to collect great art through the
19th century. Despite such opulent living, they were known for
their piety, and for a tendency to urge reform and modernization of
the political system while remaining firmly entrenched in the power
structure.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stroganoff luck finally ran out, as did the luck of the
entire imperial ruling class, when the guns of revolution swept
across Russia in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their friend the czar and his family, who were fatally
shot in a basement in Siberia, the Stroganoffs managed to escape
Russia with their lives and a few items that could fit in
suitcases, leaving behind their vast land holdings, the palaces and
churches they had built and their fabulous art collection in St.
Petersburg, which the communist government dispersed in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Baroness Ludinghausen's mother, Xenia, fled from St. Petersburg
by train in 1919 at age 7 with her mother, Princess Sonia, and
escaped from southern Russia in a boat supplied by the queen of
Italy. As with most Russian aristocrats, there was no secret Swiss
bank account. ``Former generals ended up working as chauffeurs,''
the baroness says.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the heirs of one of the world's great dynasties, stripped
of their wealth and privilege, did what they had always done: They
moved ahead, and went to work. Born in Paris in 1942, during the
German occupation, Baroness Ludinghausen spent much of her
childhood in Brazil, where her father worked for an American
company. She graduated from a high school in Denver, and currently
works as director of salons at Yves Saint Laurent Couture in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, with the tables once again turned in Russia and
communism toppled, Baroness Ludinghausen founded the Stroganoff
Foundation for the reunification and preservation of the Stroganoff
artistic legacy. She raised the money for the foundation not from
any family fortune, which is gone forever, but from leading tours
to St. Petersburg and from donations. Because of her efforts, the
name Stroganoff once again means more in the cultural lexicon than
noodles and beef. &QL;

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DORA GALITZKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Sporting Chance
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a 20-year-old euonymus plant whose leaves are green
with an off-white border. Recently I found three branches with
solid green leaves _ and no border. What is the explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no particular cause; it's just a matter of odds. If
you grow enough variegated plants long enough, you're bound to see
it happen sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves on the ancestor of your euonymus were solid green. At
the growing point of every branch are three well-organized cell
layers that contribute to the growth of leaves, stems and fruit. A
random genetic mutation in the middle layer, which controls
production of chlorophyll, resulted in a sport _ a branch that
differs from the rest of the plant. An observant plant breeder took
cuttings and propagated the branch, resulting in a variegated
euonymus.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the new sport, showing a reversion to all green,
isn't the result of another mutation. Dennis Werner, a
plant-breeding expert at North Carolina State University in
Raleigh, said that occasionally in a branch, the lower-cell layer,
with normal genes, swaps places with the middle layer and the
leaves go back to being all green.  &QL; 
Salting the Roses
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read somewhere about putting Epsom salts around rosebushes.
Is this a good idea and if so, how much should I use, how often and
when during the year?
</P>
<P>
   A. While Epsom salts belong on every gardener's shelf, their
primary use is in the bath after a hard day bending and digging.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many gardeners swear by it for their roses or spinach. And
perhaps it does help sometimes, because Epsom salts contain
magnesium and sulfur, two essential micronutrients. Magnesium is
found in chlorophyll, which helps plants turn sunshine into food,
and sulfur is used to make several proteins. If your soil was
deficient in one of these elements, Epsom salts might do some good,
but most plant nutritionists say that average garden soil contains
enough sulfur and magnesium in forms that are readily available to
the plants to keep everyone happy and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A Bud off the Old Block
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have a large crab-apple tree with white flowers and tiny
apples in late summer. Pictures show that it was already mature in
1944, but I think it is not in good health now. Last summer a large
bough died and the bark on the trunk doesn't look good. If it dies
I've no way to order a new one, since I've no idea what variety it
is. I wonder if I can propagate a new small tree to replace it.
Could you suggest how I might do it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Call your local county Cooperative Extension to find someone
familiar with propagating roses or fruit trees, where bud grafting
is common, to do it for you. That would be the best method, said
Tom Simpson, whose Simpson Nursery in Vincennes, Ind., has bred
some favorite crab apples, including Indian Magic, Brandywine and
Centurion. Starting a cutting from a branch would be difficult at
best, requiring a greenhouse, misting system and luck. Many
varieties just won't root, and without knowing what you have,
Simpson said, trying would not be worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Bud grafting takes practice. A leaf bud (the small tissue
structure from which a leaf grows) is carefully cut away and then
inserted just under the bark on the trunk of a closely related
tree, such as another crab apple or an apple. This tree, called the
rootstock, is chosen for its hardiness, and provides support and a
root system for the grafted bud, which grows up to be just like
your original crab apple.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Stroganoff school technique.
</P>
<P>
   Icons are not the only vestiges of the Stroganoffs' religious
interior design to shine in the exhibit. What one might dismiss as
prosaic, mid-17th-century embroidered textiles in fact encapsulate
a luxuriant style of gold and silken interlocking threads forming
distinctive geometric shapes. Deserving close attention is ``The
Entombment,'' a shroud dating from 1592 that measures 6 feet long
and is a model of highly involved needlework. And as for overt
luxury in the unexpected guise of a textile, little can compare
with the bejeweled ``Our Lady of Kazan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stroganoffs' collection of religious objects is hardly
restricted to those reflecting the Orthodox church. Mining the
medieval periods of France and Italy, the Stroganoffs emerged with
such startling works as a casket-shaped, 12th-century Limoges
``reliquary chasse'' to hold and display religious relics, with its
carefully engraved metalwork and Romanesque relief. These Limoges
works are easily matched in quality by two Italian objects, one a
13th-century crook of ivory, carved into the shape of a ferocious
dragon's head, and the other a 15th-century gilt and rock-crystal
cross that would have led any procession proudly. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a preface to the Stroganoffs' impressive holdings of
masterpiece paintings, many of which once formed the central focus
of the Stroganoff Palace interior in St. Petersburg, the exhibit
offers a series of paintings depicting the palace's picture
gallery. Many of the watercolor works, done by the famed architect
and interior designer Andrei Voronikhin and others, are something
of a letdown, in part because of their surfeit of detail.
</P>
<P>
   What the watercolors do accomplish is to whet one's appetite for
the real masterworks of the exhibition. This is ``Stroganoff'' at
its most inspiring. The two portraits by Anthony Van Dyck hypnotize
through their capture of personality. ``Portrait of a Young Man''
grasps the innocent glint in the eye of what may be a Spanish
aristocrat, his lacy collar spread like a butterfly's diaphanous
wing over his black coat. But it is Van Dyck's ``Portrait of
Nicolaas Rockox'' that is a miniapotheosis of Flemish portraiture.
Van Dyck has planted a slightly perturbed expression on the
subject's otherwise implacable face, framed by the classic
accordion ruffle of a high collar over a jet-black tunic imbued
with a velvet texture.
</P>
<P>
   In Luca Giordano's ``The Battle of Lapiths and Centaurs,'' the
exhibit has a master canvas that all but leaps off the wall with
its melee pitting salvation against perdition. Acquired by
Alexander Stroganoff, this 17th-century work roils humanity with
mythic centaurs whose sense of anarchy must be quelled by arriving
deities. The painting splits a viewer's attention, forcing one to
stare at the brawl on Earth even as one looks skyward toward the
celestial intervention riding on a chariot of clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sergeievich Stroganoff (1823-1911) felt an inexorable tug
toward two works by Sandro Botticelli, completed in 1500, that
personify so much of the painter's ecclesiastic leanings. ``Saint
Jerome'' and ``Saint Dominic'' are both models of moral rectitude,
with one penitently kneeling, his roseate robe gathered in one
hand, while the other subject's gaze is aimed at the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Alexander Stroganoff's predilection for 17th-century
French masterworks, the exhibition also contains some powerfully
expansive canvases from Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin.
Lorrain's ``Landscape With Dancers'' spins a buoyant mood among
friends set against a pastoral setting rendered with surgical
precision. Poussin's ``Rest on the Flight Into Egypt'' bursts with
biblical symbolism set against a meticulously stage-managed
classical backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   As a welcome relief from the mammoth stage sets of these French
works, ``Stroganoff'' presents Antoine Watteau's ``La Boudeuse,''
with its pointillist accumulation of filigreed detail devoted to a
silken gown and veined leaves. Another subtle treat for the eyes is
the delicately fetching ``Self-Portrait'' by Marie-Louise Elisabeth
Vigee-Lebrun, one of the art world's most groundbreaking female
painters and a specially appointed Stroganoff family portraitist. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the exhibit's examples of classical
antiquities, collected by the peripatetic Alexander Stroganoff on
his travels to Italy, some tend more toward models of accomplished
restoration than unique examples of classical art. However, the
Stroganoff's fifth- and sixth-century terra-cotta Etruscan works
are exceptional, with one sixth-century vase cover notable for its
carefully engraved headdress and the expression of bonhomie on the
good citizen's visage.
</P>
<P>
   Showing little geographic parochialism, the Stroganoffs played
an active role in the emerging popularity of pre-Columbian art in
the mid-1800s. The collection thus includes an exceptional Mexican
jade mask dating from somewhere between the fifth and the eighth
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Not stopping at Mexican art, the Stroganoffs felt drawn to the
adroit use of enamel in Chinese art. The collection includes a
series of robin's-egg-blue vases dating from the early 16th
century, all festooned in red and white blossoms and gilt. Although
a tad redundant, this style of Chinese decorative arts was
certainly versatile, as it was also applied to an altar set and the
everyday hat stand.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, it may be the relatively underexplored work of the
French artist Hubert Robert that serves as the best summation of
the Stroganoff exhibit's representation of the family role as
patron, cultural taste arbiter, and integrator of monumental art
into a domestic setting. Alexander Stroganoff commissioned not one
but six architectural landscapes from Robert. The result is a
series of works transporting the viewer to St. Peter's in Rome, to
an obelisk encircled by a classical sculptural arcade, and to
verdant and rocky vistas featuring cypresses and waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Each one of Robert's windows into a classical past is 10 feet
tall. Each one is an ultimate example of how great art could
elevate a palace interior to near-mythic levels of refinement. It
was the way the Stroganoffs habitually decorated their lives and
the cultural landscape of their homeland.

KIMBELL EXHIBIT RECALLS THE GLORY DAYS OF A FABLED RUSSIAN FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 
 EDS: Has a sidebar, STROGANOFF-THEFAMILY  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ANDREW MARTON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A curious little paradox resides at the core
of the Kimbell Art Museum's latest exhibition, ``Stroganoff: The
Palace and Collections of a Russian Noble Family.'' Massive in
scope, even daunting in the variety of works displayed,
``Stroganoff'' still generates an improbable glow of domestic
approachability.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, the ``home'' of this collection is
definitely a palace. How could it not be, considering that 2,000
works were whittled down to the 230 on display for the exhibit,
which will end October 1. And considering that those pieces include
icons and textiles, Greek and Roman antiquities, palace
furnishings, old-master paintings, Middle Eastern silver, medieval
crosses from Italy, pre-Columbian objects from Mexico and examples
of Chinese decorative works?
</P>
<P>
   Such varied art objects accomplish two distinct goals for the
exhibit. On the one hand, by dint of their almost uniformly
superior quality (many of them justify that shopworn descriptive,
``masterwork''), the Stroganoff pieces are marvels of their
mediums. In addition, the exhibit stands as a lavishly decorated
scrapbook, recounting the Stroganoffs' involved family history, one
filled with a nonpareil legacy of wealth, collecting and
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   History must linger over any tour of this family's riches. The
Stroganoffs were the Medicis of Russia, spending 500 years
accumulating individual fortunes based on that most primary of
minerals _ salt _ only to translate that business acumen into a
private collection of such vast, eclectic taste that it easily
competed with that of the czars. But perhaps the exhibit's ultimate
mark is that it demonstrates how a single family can become
synonymous with what it accumulated, and how this family and this
vast store of art helped mold the cultural development of an
empire.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, visitors are immediately greeted by twin
portraits of Catherine and Peter the Great, along with a delicately
etched tea service and a heavily inlaid wooden chest. This
introductory gallery sets the tone of the entire exhibit,
attempting to mitigate the staidness of a museum by replicating a
vestibule to a private residence.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit makes it all but unavoidable to receive a crash
course in Russian imperial politics and Stroganoff family lore.
This is either fascinating or tedious, depending upon one's level
of curiosity. Although it's tantalizing to inspect the minute
Cyrillic script that forms an exceptionally rare charter signed by
Ivan the Terrible, the subsequent painting of the Cossack leader
Yermak, and the spiked helmet Yermak presumably wore, pale as
arresting works of art.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic furnishings will soon bring you back to life,
however; little can top two works that act as robust homages to the
baroque ideal. The Stroganoffs selected from the French atelier of
Jean-Francois Dubut a desk that seems to erupt in floral detail.
Mother-of-pearl and ivory of varying pigments frolic among the
various shadings of wood inlay as polychromatic flora sprout along
the desk's front.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``secretary'' seems monastically ascetic compared with
a nearby cabinet that is all baroque flourishes. An amalgam of
tortoiseshell and tiny sculptures wrought from pliant silver, the
cabinet is painted the kind of Caribbean green that immediately
distinguishes it from its Danish counterparts of the same epoch.
</P>
<P>
   The Stroganoff exhibit successfully links not just the
masterworks but even the smallest home objects to the family's
storied history of collecting. Alexander Sergeievich Stroganoff's
(1733-1811) tastes, for example, occasionally ran to delicate
beauty over clunky, if pragmatic, form. Some of his favorite
snuffboxes are thus layered in enamel and pearls and frame
Lilliputian glass-covered gouache paintings. One Parisian snuffbox
even has his involved plans to renovate many of his family's
properties incorporated into its design.
</P>
<P>
   On a larger scale are the exhibit's palace tabletop designs,
specifically its decorative stonework; the subtle and the dramatic
live side-by-side. One can bypass the uninspiring gray jasper tray
and vodka cups and fixate on the selection of lapis lazuli
``perfume burners,'' a cushion shape of purple-flecked
cobalt-colored stone cradled by golden dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   But easily one of the most extraordinary examples of stonework
acting as mesmerizing domestic decoration is the ``coupe'' or basin
formed from the emerald-green and black-veined malachite, widely
considered to be Russia's most coveted stone. This great bowl rests
on a tripod of three heavily gilded angels, their feet digging into
an equally imposing bronze stand. This malachite creation remains a
grand piece of decorative art, a felicitous marriage of art and
engineering.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the Stroganoffs devoted enormous time and
energy to building churches and monasteries almost everywhere they
settled. These places of worship demanded a plethora of
iconography. The exhibit allows one to wade into the gradual
progression of Russian icon artistry, such as the 16th century's
``The Virgin Hodegetria of Smolensk'', a clear precursor to the
Russian iconic style. One can then appreciate the arrival of the
Stroganoff school of icon painting, marked by its groundbreaking
attention to detail, especially of the face and hands. This
burgeoning Stroganoff school is amply represented in a portrait of
``Saint Dmitry the Tsarevich,'' the son of Ivan the Terrible.
Though 5 feet tall, this grand icon doesn't forgo careful
rendering, making it more human, less ideally conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful not to let size considerations influence which pieces
of iconography to examine. The Kimbell should signal its visitors
that four of its smaller icons, ``The Baptism,'' ``The Raising of
Lazarus,'' ``The Entry Into Jerusalem'' and ``The Descent Into
Limbo,'' are exceptional demonstrations of Stroganoff school
technique. MORE &QL;

TENNESSEE WHISTLE-BLOWER WORRIES ABOUT HER FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.J., Ore., Ill.)  (Eds.: Buuck in 2nd graf if 2nd take is cq) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The whistle-blower finds comfort in her
office these days, surrounded by books about Renaissance drama, her
speciality. So long as Linda Bensel-Meyers can keep her mind in the
past, she can forget about the lawsuits against her, the damage to
her marriage, the anger of University of Tennessee officials and
coaches, the threats by local fans who curse her as a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   But she is reminded of the present by the fat leather briefcase
leaning against a leg of her desk. It is stuffed with what she
calls her evidence, the paper trails that always lead back to the
altered grades, ``friendly'' courses and plagiarized papers that
she says the athletic department uses to keep varsity players
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the evidence is being used against her; one suit
implies she has publicly released confidential student information,
which she denies. After some five years of being ignored by the
administration, she talked to ESPN last September after it began
its own investigation of the athletic tutoring system.
</P>
<P>
   Four football players were suspended for a game pending the
school's investigation, and Bensel-Meyers became a well-known
pariah on campus. Students taunt her, teachers turn away. She says
her office has been broken into, mostly as intimidation, she
thinks. She is sitting now with her back to the office window that
overlooks the 107,000-seat football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never feel sorry for myself,'' she says, just a bit too
stoutly, ``because I am responsible for my own decisions. I am not
a victim. I hate it when people look at me with pity. Sometimes,
however, I despair.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the righteousness of this 47-year-old Methodist church
organist pops up. ``It is hard for one good person to live among
those who are not good, and to try to make the right choices,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers is not alone these days as the American
Association of University Professors and another national group of
faculty members convened last year at Drake University in Iowa and
considered reforms in intercollegiate sports. The Drake Group, in
particular, has declared that big-time college sports is basically
a corrupting influence on the academic mission of the university.
And the Rutgers 1000, a group of professors and students, is
calling for that university to divest itself of varsity sports.
</P>
<P>
   At Tennessee, a 44,000-student university, most members of the
administration and the athletic department who speak on the record
say Bensel-Meyers has made all the wrong choices, attacking a
source of state pride. The Volunteers were national football
champions two seasons ago. And, as officials point out, the NCAA
conducted an investigation for months on her charges and found no
violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campus is just weary of reading about all her charges,''
said the university president, J. Wade Gilley. ``We've had nine, 10
investigations in the 11 months I've been here, by the faculty
senate, the conference, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, the Federal Bureau of Investigation _ what have I left
out? _ and nothing was found that violated rules or laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilley says he thinks Bensel-Meyers may have an agenda, a ``big,
pregnant idea,'' about de-emphasizing college sports. If that's it,
he chuckles, then there's no better place to start than at a place
that ``epitomizes the system, like Notre Dame or Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice is low. ``This is not my cause,'' she says. She talks
into her hand. Her eyes rarely make contact. ``I'm a company
person. I thought I'd be here forever. I went through channels. But
my options have been limited because no one would listen to what
I've been saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when they did hear me, the attitude was, just fail the
athlete who plagiarized. How can I do that, when the plagiarism was
institutional, when the athlete thinks he's supposed to turn in a
paper written by one of the hired tutors? How can I sacrifice some
poor guy who bought into the dream just like me, to get off the
farm.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers left the family chicken farm in Pendleton, Ore.,
30 years ago for a scholarship to the University of Chicago. She
always loved sports, she says, the third of four children who all
became teachers. She roughhoused with her brothers. She ran track
in high school and continued to play basketball and volleyball at
the University of Oregon, where her Ph.D. dissertation was on ``The
Duchess of Malfi,'' a bloodthirsty revenge tragedy, written by John
Webster circa 1613.
</P>
<P>
   At Tennessee, where she began her first tenure-track teaching
job in 1986, she says she has rarely missed a Volunteers football
game on television. But she has never taken her three teen-age sons
to the stadium because she is afraid of crowds and heights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, she became director of composition, a job she loved,
she said, because the required first-year writing course gave her a
chance to shape a curriculum that would teach critical thinking and
``empower'' the many ``provincial, religious, concrete thinkers,''
who, as she had been, were the first generation in their families
to attend college. She borrowed from the great books courses
created at Chicago and from her own scholarship. She sees parallels
between the Age of Gutenberg, when the printing press helped
replace ethical reasoning with scientific thought, and the Age of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among her early tasks was hiring and training the tutors who
would help athletes, particularly male football and basketball
players. Slowly, over the years, she began to realize, she says,
that the athletes were being exploited by a system that did not
deliver a real education in return for the millions of dollars the
university made from their time and energy. Tutors came back with
stories of being sexually harassed by athletes, not to mention
having to write their term papers.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers, with access to transcripts, began to notice
patterns of grades being altered, of clusters of unusually high
grades for athletes in certain courses, of special privileges. She
thought there was abuse in the labeling of certain athletes as
having disabilities, which could excuse them from having to read or
write. She began to send memos to her superiors. She was ignored.
She began sending e-mail messages, first to foreign colleagues whom
she had met at Renaissance conferences, then with almost anyone who
seemed to understand and would respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda is naive, a straight arrow who never understood the
power she came up against,'' says Jeffrey Kovac, a 51-year-old
chemistry professor and one of Bensel-Meyers' few public supporters
at Tennessee. Last week, he quietly announced a legal defense fund
to which faculty could contribute anonymously.

ROAD SCHOLARS TAKE ON ST. ANDREWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ The search begins not at the first hole,
but at the 17th tee, for that is where the soul of St. Andrews
lives most fiercely. The Road Hole, it is called. You know that the
infamous road bunker awaits two shots away, but standing there,
your only thought is of the building that stands no more than 100
yards from the tee, blocking your view of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   What is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Old sheds,'' said the marshal. ``Used to be for the machines,
but now they are offices.''
</P>
<P>
   So players have to drive over the building?
</P>
<P>
   ``Aye. At least, they're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   You mean some don't?
</P>
<P>
   ``Aye, a player yesterday hit the building. A local qualifier.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the public plays? They have to hit over, too?
</P>
<P>
   The marshal nodded yes and smiled. ``Aye, why do you think there
are no windows on that side?''
</P>
<P>
   Aye, indeed. The 129th British Open has once again taken us to
St. Andrews, which has no equal simply because it has never tried
to be anything but what it is. Sitting in the shadows of history
that are so daunting they are measured in centuries, not decades,
St. Andrews remains the world's most beloved golf course,
withstanding not only the fury of Mother Nature but the wrath of
disgruntled players through the years.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he played here, Bobby Jones tore up his scorecard
and stormed off. Sam Snead in 1946 described it as looking like
``an abandoned golf course,'' and in recent years players such as
Scott Hoch and Lee Westwood have expressed their displeasure with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not enjoyed it so much,'' said Westwood, who once told
Mark James that St. Andrews wasn't in his Top 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Scotland?'' asked James.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Fife,'' snapped Westwood, who concedes that his only visits
to the birthplace of golf have come in October, when it has been
cold and wet. In the days leading up to the British Open, it has
been warm and dry, so perhaps there is hope, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand what the former champions around here say,
Seve (Ballesteros) and Tom Watson, people like that,'' said
Westwood. ``The first time (they came here) they didn't
particularly like it, but it has grown on them. I can see that
happening to me.''
</P>
<P>
   If it does, Westwood will join a fraternity that surely numbers
in the millions, for St. Andrews elicits more passion than any
other golf course. Just being here is a sacred experience, these
people will tell you, and you are on a golf course that is like no
other you have seen.
</P>
<P>
   Bless them, for they are right.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When St. Andrews was designed in about 1400, the architect did
not subscribe to the theory that golf should be fair. The
architect, of course, was Mother Nature, and caretakers of this
revered piece of property _ most especially Old Tom Morris from
1865-1903 _ have taken great care not to alter what she had
intended.
</P>
<P>
   Morris widened some fairways, built the first and 18th greens as
they are today, and was responsible for adding sand to help grow
the links grasses and fescue that is dominant here. The layout,
however, was dictated by nature and is quite simplistic _ nine
holes out, nine holes in.
</P>
<P>
   What you find along the way, however, is perhaps the most
challenging test the game of golf will ever provide.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, there are 112 bunkers. Deep, nasty pot bunkers,
with steep walls and fluffy sand. They are hidden well, holes in
the ground, really, with steep faces that will make some players
consider hitting out sideways or even taking an unplayable lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a mine field,'' said Bob Estes, who first saw St.
Andrews with his college golf team in 1985. ``The pot bunkers are
the mines. You just don't want to go in them. They're like
miniature water hazards, where, if you go in them you'll lose one
or maybe two shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the greens, all of them with undulation that will
easily roll approaches so far off line, players will face lag putts
upwards of 100 feet. There are just four free-standing greens _ the
first, ninth, 17th, and 18th. The rest of them are double-greens
and it's easy to remember which ones they are, for the combination
adds up to 18. Thus, the second green is also the 16th; the third
also the 15th; the fourth and 14th; the fifth and 13th; the sixth
and 12th; the seventh and 11th; the eighth and 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Where to hit? You can't aim down the tree line because there are
no trees. Rough line? There's no rough to speak of. Aim at the
bunkers? Sure, though many times you can't see them. So what?
</P>
<P>
   Well, players this week, they are in luck. It's the British
Open, a huge attraction to spectators and a TV bonanza. Which means
construction objects. ``If you had to play this golf course without
having the TV towers and bleachers, you'd have no idea where to hit
it,'' said Tom Scherrer, who is making his British Open debut and
saw St. Andrews for the first time Monday. ``Half of us wouldn't
have any idea where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, they will know when to go, because hidden from view
on many of the holes are marshals who obediently pop into action
from out of the gorse and heather at certain points on the golf
course. They will wave red flags to tell you the group ahead is
still in range, green flags to advise that all is clear.
</P>
<P>
   On his first visit to St. Andrews, in 1970, Tom Weiskopf looked
around and wondered what he had gotten himself into.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, this is so different. I had read about it, heard
about it, and I wanted to experience it, but I didn't know. I
didn't dislike it, but I said to myself, `I don't have the game for
this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When he got to the 18th, he turned to his caddie and asked for a
sight line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father time,'' said his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me?'' said Weiskopf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father time,'' said the caddie, pointing down the fairway,
more than 350 yards away to a building with a clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to aim for the clock, and so I did,'' said Weiskopf,
who soon fell in love with St. Andrews and links golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never played this kind of golf, but I was gonna learn
how to play it. And it made me a better player.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rock-hard fairways and wind. ``It's the only defense the course
has,'' said Peter Thomson, who won his five British Opens on
different venues, including St. Andrews in 1956. He adores the
place, embraces its tradition, and understands that it will test a
player's nerve as much as his skill.
</P>
<P>
   That St. Andrews has changed so little over the years makes
Thomson happy. When players go in a bunker here, they are
penalized, which, he reasons, is what a bunker should do. There are
times when you will get a bad bounce, other times when you get a
good bounce, and isn't that the glory of golf, he further reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, John Daly won here during a week in which the wind
howled at various times. He shot 6-under 282, which was the highest
winning score in a British Open in nearly 10 years. In 1990, when
the wind was down, Nick Faldo posted 18-under 270, still a record
for the 24 British Opens that have been held here.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Estes, is the appeal to the place. ``They let nature
dictate the course conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no manipulation, no changing the elements. It is what it
is.
</P>
<P>
   That means at least four par 4s _ including the 357-yard 18th _
will be driven by a host of players. That means if your ball comes
to rest against the lip of a pot bunker, you may have to just slam
it into the wall and hope it bounces out. That means, if you end up
on the road behind the 17th green, you need to play it where it
lies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it means that the building in front of the 17th is
in play. Seriously, you have to drive over it to a fairway you
can't see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's greatest par 4 in the world. Without a doubt,''
said Weiskopf, whose love affair with this tournament paid off with
a victory in 1973 at Royal Troon. He has become one of the world's
most sought-after course architects, but never could he draw up
something where you hit over a building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great, isn't it? That's part of it. What's wrong with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. Not a thing. Just as long as you pick out the correct
line. Which is? Well, caddies offer varying advice, though commonly
they will tell you to look at the big, white words ``Old Course
Hotel,'' take aim at the letter `C,' and have a little fade on the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Estes laughed. ``I'm not that good that I can aim at a letter. I
aim at a word.''

   ``Most faculty are cynical about sports,'' Kovac said.
``Athletes get away with murder, so what, just let me concentrate
on neutron scattering. But I've also been a professional soccer
referee for 20 years, and I've always thought, all we have is our
integrity and a whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovac's fund-raising is welcome news to David L. Buuck, a
graduate of Tennessee and its law school who finds himself shunned,
as well as underpaid, while defending Bensel-Meyers. The libel suit
against ESPN.com and a former head of the tutoring service, by a
former player and a former tutor, does not even name Bensel-Meyers,
but she had promised to pay for any of her teachers who were sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't let them be punished because someone's trying to get
at me,'' she said. ``I worry about my seven doctoral students,
working on dissertations, mostly on the Renaissance. What if after
all this, my letters of recommendation are poison?''
</P>
<P>
   An injunction to keep his records private was filed by Spencer
Riley, the center on last year's football team who is now trying
out for the Buffalo Bills. The university's failure to defend her
along with itself sent a chill through the faculty; would this be a
precedent to punish anyone out of favor who became a target of
litigation?
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers finds herself more and more isolated, with fewer
responsibilities. She thinks she may be fired. She is afraid of
going to her car at night in the campus underground garage. Her
children hear remarks about her at school. Her husband, who thinks
she is hurting the family, rarely talks to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for my kids to see what I'm doing,'' she
says, not sounding absolutely certain. ``Or it will be someday. We
can't teach people abuse of the law and not expect it will lead to
more crime. We're losing values in this country, and the university
may be the only place left to preserve these values.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to teach kids there's a reason to be on earth and it's
not just grabbing off pleasure. I believe if people have all the
information they'll choose the right thing. That's why I talk to
the media, why I send out all these e-mails. But then I have this
image of myself doing cartwheels along the edge of a cliff,
blindfolded. I think I'll be all right as long as I don't see where
I'm going.''

 &HT;    Davidian trial attorney unwilling to attend hearing on gunfire
issue
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A hearing date next month on the remaining issue in
the Branch Davidians' wrongful-death lawsuit against the
government, namely whether FBI agents shot at the Davidians,
appears shaky.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco scheduled a
hearing for Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But Houston attorney Mike Caddell, the lead attorney for the
plaintiffs, reaffirmed his statement last week that he will not
attend a hearing on the gunfire issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what purpose it would serve,'' Caddell said. ``I
think it is clear, or it should be clear, that Judge Smith has made
up his mind about this case. I have no desire to simply go through
the motions. I'm not willing to participate in something that's not
real. I feel like that's what I did for four weeks. Having done it
once, I'm not willing to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   A five-member advisory jury found last week that the government
was not guilty of negligence at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   They considered four issues: whether agents for the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms fired indiscriminately during a Feb.
28, 1993 raid; whether the FBI prematurely demolished part of Mount
Carmel in violation of U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno's
instructions; whether the FBI helped start or spread the fire that
killed David Koresh and 75 followers; and whether the FBI was
negligent by not having a firefighting plan.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will consider the advisory jury's opinion in reaching a
final decision on those issues. A gunfire hearing would be held
without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   A clerk in Waco's federal court, however, described the gunfire
hearing as being ``up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Caddell nor the other attorneys for the plaintiffs,
Ramsey Clark and James Brannon, had notified the court by Wednesday
afternoon regarding whether they plan to attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the former U.S. attorney general representing many of the
longtime Davidians, told the Tribune-Herald he wants to pursue the
gunfire issue.
</P>
<P>
   However, he may not be in Waco if there is a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he (Caddell) does, we'll persevere,'' Clark said.
``We'll have someone there. At the moment, it doesn't seem possible
for me to be there personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he doesn't think Caddell's boycotting of a gunfire
hearing should cause its cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, the case is virtually complete,'' Clark said.
``All the affidavits are in. The prior depositions from Vector
(Data Research) are in. All that is missing is one person's
testimony. What that can add to the Vector report would be fairly
modest presumably.''
</P>
<P>
   Vector is the company chosen by Smith and Special Counsel John
Danforth, who is investigating the FBI's actions at Mount Carmel
for Reno, to determine whether the flashes on the FBI's April 19,
1993 infrared video were gunfire. Its chief infrared expert, David
Oxlee, has been unavailable for questioning because of surgery.
That led Smith to separate the gunfire issue from the other four
issues in the Davidians' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell has attacked Vector's re-creation of the final day at
Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a helicopter at Fort Hood with an infrared camera flew
over a debris field and men firing weapons known to be in the FBI's
arsenal seven years ago. The infrared video produced was compared
with the FBI's 1993 infrared video that contained numerous flashes,
which the plaintiffs argue were government gunfire in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   However, Vector determined the flashes came from debris and not
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell filed a motion arguing that Vector employees testified
in depositions that the debris field at Fort Hood produced no
multiple flashes _ which are seen at various points in the FBI's
infrared video.
</P>
<P>
   Vector's Oxlee has apparently recovered enough from recent
surgery to attend an August hearing on the gunfire issue.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Caddell said he will let his gunfire arguments rest
on the motions already filed in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think this issue is weaker than the other issues,''
Caddell said. ``That doesn't mean I don't think we're right. But
it's weaker in the sense there's no eyewitness testimony. And
there's the supposed independent expert. Although I believe we've
thoroughly discredited them, a lot of people will look at them,
Danforth's independent expert, and say there was no gunfire. I
think this was the issue the court was least likely to be persuaded
by to begin with. Given what happened at the trial, I think it's
even less likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he won't prevent Clark or Brannon from calling his
designated infrared experts _ Edward Allard, Ferdinand Zegel and
Carroll Lucas _ to testify at a gunfire hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Both Allard and Zegel have stated they believe the FBI's
infrared tape captured agents firing at the Davidians. Lucas filed
a report disputing the accuracy of Vector's test results from the
Mount Carmel re-creation. Among other things, Lucas noted the
different flight characteristics of a helicopter and the FBI's
Night Stalker airplane, from which the Mount Carmel infrared video
was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't control them,'' Caddell said. ``It's a free country.
They can do whatever they want.''

SNAKE RIVER DAMS WILL STAY FOR AT LEAST A DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE and ROBERT McCLURE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Wednesday that four
large dams on the Lower Snake River would remain untouched for at
least a decade because science does not support tearing them down
to restore salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, federal officials will spend the next several years
trying to coax the endangered fish back to a sustainable population
by improving hatchery operations, limiting harvests and increasing
stream flows. If those efforts fail, breaching the dams could
re-emerge as an option, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dam breaching is one step among many others that holds promise
for helping restore Snake River stocks,'' said George Frampton,
acting chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality
and President's Clinton's highest-ranking advisor on environmental
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaching clearly would help those fish. It may or may not
prove to be necessary to achieve their recovery. But the science is
clear that breaching is not the solution itself for Snake River
stocks,'' Frampton said in remarks prepared for a Senate committee
hearing. The hearing was cancelled because of an unrelated matter,
but Frampton's remarks were released.
</P>
<P>
   If the fish populations haven't recovered sufficiently in eight
years, the government would again consider breaching the dams. But
even if they decided then to do so, it would take at least another
two years to accomplish that, said Will Stelle, Northwest regional
director of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement drew sharp criticism from all sides, relfecting
the passion the issue invokes among politicians, environmentalists,
fishing interests and others.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters elaborating on Frampton's
testimony, Stelle said it is wrong to focus exclusively on dam
removal as the only solution to a complex problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as there are multiple causes (for the decline of salmon),
there must be multiple solutions,'' he said. ``There is no single
bullet here to fix the salmon problem in the Columbia basin. We
will be focusing on actions that give us the biggest bang for the
buck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us resist the temptation to focus on removal of the four
Snake River dams alone as a silver bullet because removal alone is
not the answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the dams, for example, would do nothing to recover
imperiled salmon in the Columbia River downstream, some of which
are at a greater risk than the Snake River stocks, Frampton said in
his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to stop the decline of salmon, and
specifically whether that answer includes removing the four dams,
has been one of the Northwest's most politically volatile questions
over the past five years. It involves such combustible issues as
property and water rights, tribal treaties, and environmental
protection as well as powerful interests on both sides. All of it
is mixed with inconclusive science.
</P>
<P>
   The matter bubbled into the presidential race Wednesday.
Republican George W. Bush, who opposes removing the dams,
criticized Democrat Al Gore for not taking a position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore should take a stand,'' Bush said in statement. ``I say
we can use technology to save the salmon, without leaving the door
open to destroying these dams.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded by saying he would base a decision on the best
science available and not allow political considerations to
influence it. ``We must save the salmon and build the economy of
the Pacific Northwest. The way to achieve these ends is through an
objective, science-based process _ not by rushing to rash
judgments,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the go-slow approach on dam removal, Republicans from
the Northwest said they were concerned because Frampton said
planning for removal would proceed. Frampton said that step was
being taken so that if the science later calls for breaching the
dams, there would be no unnecessary delay.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies ``are masking their true intentions,'' said Sen.
Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a vocal critic of dam removal. ``Their
agenda is clear and they want to keep the door open on dam removal
even in the face of incredible runs of spring chinook. This spring,
over 200,000 spring chinook salmon and 38,000 steelhead passed
through Bonneville Dam. But I want to be clear: there will be no
money for dam removal studies on my watch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from the other side was equally blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shocked and disappointed by the lack of vision evident
in the administration's decision to oppose breaching the lower
Snake River dams,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the National
Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is telling Congress it's okay to let the fuse
keep burning on the extinction bomb instead of stopping it while
there's still time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Curtis, western conservation director of Trout Unlimited,
characterized the administration position as ``We're going to be
aggressive, but not aggressive on dam breaching.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're saying is that dam breaching, they're not going
to go that way,'' he said. ``This is essentially a five-year
delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists had hoped for what they called an ``off-ramp''
approach in which the administration would presume the breaching
was needed, but would leave an option open to ``get off the
highway'' if the fish rebound because of other measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew for some time they were moving in this direction, but
we thought there was some hope they would come out and say `We're
going toward dam breaching, but we're doing a whole bunch of other
things, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing says, no, we're going to do a whole bunch of other
things and in five years we're going to look at this again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   What he hoped they would say: ``We fully intend to keep planning
for the prospect that the Snake River dams need to be breached. We
think dam breaching is necessary to save these fish, we're going to
start on this and, if those other things don't work, we'll
continue.''

FORD BLAMES ONE-TIME CHARGES FOR QUARTERLY LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ The Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday that brisk
sales of luxury cars and sport utility vehicles and growing profits
from auto loans and leases lifted its operating earnings in the
second quarter, but a pair of one-time charges caused the automaker
to post its first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the one-time charges, which were announced last week,
Ford's after-tax earnings from operations rose 8.5 percent, to
$2.69 billion. Earnings per share rose 10 percent, to $2.20,
beating by 12 cents the consensus forecast of financial analysts,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   After relying heavily on profit from sport utility vehicle sales
in the United States over the last several years, Ford managed a
somewhat more diverse blend of earnings in the second quarter.
Strong sales of the Focus small car, the Taurus and Mercury Sable
midsize sedans and the Mercury Grand Marquis large sedan meant that
cars accounted for a growing percentage of overall profit, said
Henry Wallace, the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Credit, a wholly owned subsidiary that issues auto loans
and leases, posted a 16 percent gain in profit, to $388 million,
continuing a turnaround that began late last year. And Ford's
results improved in Latin America and East Asia, although profit
eroded at the company's European operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong operating earnings were more than offset by
one-time charges totaling $3.27 billion. Ford took a $1.02 billion
charge for writing down the value of many factories and buildings
in Europe to reflect their actual value and for covering the cost
of early retirement incentives and other programs to reduce
employment in Europe, where Ford's market share has been falling.
Ford also took a one-time charge of $2.25 billion for the spin-off
on June 28 of the Visteon Corp., its auto parts division, because
Visteon's parts factories had been carried on Ford's books at a far
greater value than the market value of the division when it became
an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace contended that the Visteon charge was purely a
bookkeeping change that did not reflect on the company's financial
health and had no cash implications. ``The Visteon thing is just a
paperwork exercise to get our books in order,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Including the one-time charges, Ford reported a loss of $577
million, compared with a profit of $2.34 billion a year earlier,
when Ford's only one-time charge was $146 million related to the
acquisition of Volvo Car.
</P>
<P>
   Ford shares rose 50 cents Wednesday to close at $47.438, even as
broad market measures fell.
</P>
<P>
   The company is wallowing in cash, reporting that it had $25.56
billion in cash and marketable securities. It plans to distribute
$10 billion of that cash to shareholders next month in a complex
recapitalization of the company. Though some institutional
investors have suggested that the plan is more advantageous to the
Ford family, which holds a special class of stock, than to other
shareholders, Wallace rejected the criticism, saying that the plan
was fair and would not be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   The robust results announced on Wednesday by Ford Credit
confirmed the growing perception in Detroit that the lending
division has recovered from its difficulties two years ago, when
decades of profit growth came to an abrupt halt. Ford Credit, like
many other companies in the auto-leasing business, overestimated in
the mid-1990s how much money it could make by selling vehicles
returned by customers at the end of their leases.
</P>
<P>
   In response, it created its own system for predicting the value
of automobiles at the end of their leases, instead of relying on
published figures. The lending subsidiary's executives said in
interviews Wednesday that the problems of the mid-1990s had been
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a lot more than we did then,'' said Elizabeth Acton,
the chief financial officer of Ford Credit. ``We have developed
much more sophisticated computer modeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lapidus, an auto analyst at Goldman Sachs, said that the
Federal Reserve's repeated increases in short-term interest rates
over the last year had hurt other auto lenders, making Ford
Credit's improvement particularly impressive. ``It was a good
result, especially with rates going up,'' he said.

AN `ANTIGONE' FROM AFRICA, BY WAY OF FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 23) 
 By AMY SERAFIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The French choreographer Mathilde Monnier thrives on the
unexpected. Her version of the Greek tragedy ``Antigone,'' for
example, unfolds on a minimalist African landscape with a car seat
and corrugated-tin siding as decor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment bores me,'' Monnier said in an interview between
trains at Les Deux Magots here. ``I like what troubles and
challenges; when you feel that someone has tried something new, not
just a pretty picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pour Antigone,'' which Monnier, who is 41, created seven years
ago (and which she is presenting at the Lincoln Center Festival on
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday), marks a turning point in her
career, the first time she cast away her aesthetic preconceptions
and plunged into the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   She started studying dance late, in her mid-teens, but by 19 was
dancing professionally. She worked with the American choreographer
Viola Farber in France, then left for the United States to study
with Merce Cunningham. It was in New York that she first tried her
hand at choreography, and she continued, to positive reviews, on
her return to France.
</P>
<P>
   But Monnier was frustrated. ``I was looking for a style without
a purpose in mind,'' she said. ``My work was a bad copy. I hadn't
taken any risks.'' She decided to create a piece around Sophocles'
play, in which a young woman risks her life to bury her dead
brother against the wishes of her uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I reread the story and it knocked me off my feet,''
Monnier said. ``Maybe I identified with this young woman. And this
very physical act of burying someone, that pleased me. I liked that
the tragedy was spurred by a gesture _ covering the body.''
</P>
<P>
   She went for inspiration to the last place one might associate
with Greek mythology, Africa. The continent's dance was still
relatively unexplored in the West, and this intrigued her, too. She
held auditions and hired one dancer from Mali and four from Burkina
Faso, including a 12-year-old girl. She also hired a percussionist
who came from a famous family of griots, or musician-storytellers,
in Mali.
</P>
<P>
   Monnier did not expect the Africans to know the story of
Antigone, but she was wrong: in Burkina Faso, not only did they
know it, they had lived it. In 1987 the country's young president,
Thomas Sankara, was assassinated and his body secretly disposed of
without the burial rites normally accorded a head of state. Soon
after, a theater company tried to stage ``Antigone,'' but it was
forbidden. ``In our culture, those who die must have a good place
to lie in the earth,'' explained Salia Sanou, one of the Burkina
Faso dancers chosen by Monnier. ``The dead live among the living.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Africans could relate to the tragedy of Antigone,
in the early 1990s they knew practically nothing about contemporary
dance. Sanou was studying law in Ouagadougou, the country's
capital, and dancing in a traditional company for fun. He
auditioned for Monnier out of curiosity and suddenly he found
himself packing for Brittany, where her company was based.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to France I didn't dare tell my family what I was
doing,'' Sanou said. ``Africans go to France to become lawyers,
diplomats _ but to dance! _ they would have laughed. Six months
later I started telling the truth, though I said I was doing
choreography. They weren't sure what that meant, so it went over
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Monnier created her ``Antigone'' using the African dancers and
those in her own company, but she kept the two groups separate for
most of the rehearsal period so that each person would ``dance his
own language.'' The culture shock was tremendous on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed the Africans to improvise from their ritualized
steps, often in silence. She laughs as she recalls: ``One dancer
said: `I can't work like this. There's no music. I can't dance.' I
said, `Try.' After a moment I heard this strange noise; they were
making sound for themselves. So I kept it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Africans, used to expressing their grief physically, toss
their heads and thrust their torsos, dancing with a loose-limbed,
unbridled vitality that contrasts with the clean, controlled
gestures and the restrained pain of the Westerners. The company
does not offer a classic telling of the Antigone tale but a feeling
of tension and gravity, folly and bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   The experience changed several of its collaborators' lives.
Sanou and another African dancer stayed in France to continue
working with Monnier and have since formed their own contemporary
dance company, based in Montpellier, France, and in Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the debut of ``Pour Antigone,'' Monnier was invited
to head the Centre Choregraphique National de Montpellier, a
government-financed center for dance situated in a beautifully
renovated, sun-filled, 16th- and 17th-century convent with thick
limestone walls and vaulted arches.
</P>
<P>
   She does not, however, allow the sunny ambience to affect the
troubled quality of her creations. Since her arrival in Montpellier
she has continued to explore the themes of isolation and
relationships and has worked extensively with autistic patients,
observing their unconventional body language to help her
``deconstruct the movements of contemporary dance.'' These lessons
are applied to her latest piece, ``Les Lieux de La,'' which, with
its writhing heap of bodies on the ground, was compared by one
critic to ``a worm cut in pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   As hard as Monnier strives to put hurdles in her own career
path, she has succeeded in becoming one of France's major dance
figures. ``I'm working in one of the most beautiful places in
Europe, I have money, I do what I want,'' she said. In two years,
when her contract with Montpellier runs out, she says she will
probably move on, just to avoid getting too comfortable.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The death of Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., gives
Democrats an unexpected chance to pick up a crucial seat in their
uphill fight to seize control of the Senate this fall, political
analysts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a genius to see this is a very competitive
two-party state, and that this race will be very competitive,''
said Chuck Clay, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia, a Democrat, is expected to appoint a
temporary successor after Coverdell's funeral on Saturday, ensuring
that a Democrat will hold the seat until a special election on Nov.
7. That will at least temporarily cut the Republican majority in
the Senate to 54-46. .
</P>
<P>
   State and national party officials said it would be unseemly to
publicly handicap the special election less than 24 hours after
Coverdell's death from a stroke on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, politicians were already jockeying, however
respectfully, for what Democrats and Republicans agree will be one
of the nation's most hotly contested races. The term runs through
2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hearing from a lot of mourners,'' said one Georgia
Democratic Party aide. ``The phones are ringing off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican strategists said that with less than
four months to campaign, a candidate must have deep pockets or good
fund-raising skills, statewide name recognition and experience
running a statewide campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious choice for Democrats is the popular former governor,
Zell Miller. But Miller rebuffed repeated entreaties by Democrats,
including President Clinton, to run against Coverdell in 1998.
Democratic aides said Barnes and others will try again to persuade
Miller, who is 68, to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' short list is said also to include Michael Coles, a
cookie mogul who lost to Coverdell in 1998; former Rep. Buddy
Darden, a close friend of Barnes; Rep. Cynthia A. McKinney; Charles
Walker, majority leader of the state Senate; Thurbert Baker, the
Georgia attorney general; and Cathy Cox, the Georgia secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, at least three House members are
potential candidates: Reps. Jack Kingston, Saxby Chambliss and
Johnny Isakson. Isakson, who took Newt Gingrich's House seat when
he stepped down as speaker last year, would seem to be the early
favorite, having run competitive races for Senate and governor in
the 1990s. But he supports abortion rights, and is likely to draw
opposition from the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Waving off speculation that he would run, Isakson said, ``Now is
the time to pay tribute to Paul, not talk about this other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss and Kingston also have potential problems, because
Democrats have a good shot at winning their House seats, Chambliss'
in particular, if they were to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party holds a majority in Georgia, which is a
battleground state in this year's presidential election. In recent
years, Georgia has been leaning Republican, but Democrats say they
believe they have stanched Republican in-roads, particularly in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats control the governor's mansion, both chambers of the
Legislature and one Senate seat, Max Cleland's. But Republicans
hold 8 of the state's 11 seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said that Democrats would rally behind
Barnes' choice, but that state Republicans are more fractured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Republicans is that they don't have a
structure of leadership to unite around a candidate,'' said Merle
Black, a professor of politics at Emory University. ``Democrats may
be able to unite around a single candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Georgia election laws, the winner of a special election
must garner 50 percent of the vote, said the Georgia secretary of
state's office. If no candidate reaches that level, there would be
a runoff shortly after the special election.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and Atlanta on Wednesday, flags flew at half-staff
at the Capitol buildings. Lawmakers from both parties paid tribute
to Coverdell, and Barnes said that Coverdell's body would lie in
state at the Georgia Capitol on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Wednesday, Phil Gramm, R-Texas, recalled
going to help Coverdell in his first Senate race in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing an event in this dingy old steel mill about
industrial renewal,'' said Gramm, who broke down in tears several
times during his tribute. ``I got up and spoke, and
}Y%9!%M!9MM &QC; %QI%Q &QC; 1% Q1e]!%screened by colonoscopy. One study, with
more than 3,000 patients, is the largest study to date of the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Both studies show that it is not safe to assume that the upper
colon is healthy just because the lower third looks normal. On the
contrary, the studies found that half the patients who had
precancerous lesions in the upper colon had nothing abnormal lower
down. If those patients had had only sigmoidoscopy, they would have
mistakenly been given a clean bill of health and left with
dangerous, undetected growths high in the colon.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies confirm many doctors' suspicions about
sigmoidoscopy, said Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky, chief of
gastroenterology at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wrote an
editorial that accompanied the two articles. Podolsky said many
experts think sigmoidoscopy makes about as much sense as screening
women for breast cancer by doing mammograms on only one breast. He
urged that doctors recommend a colonoscopy to all patients 50 and
older, and that insurers pay for the more thorough procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Medicare and most insurers do not cover colonoscopy
as a screening test, and pay for it only for high-risk patients. A
sigmoidoscopy costs about $200, a colonoscopy $1,200 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the insurance industry, Dr. Donald Young,
medical director of the Health Insurance Association of America,
said that the new findings mean that current guidelines for
coverage should be re-examined, but that it would be premature to
change the rules until medical experts can assess all the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Colorectal cancer kills 56,000 Americans a year, and is the
second leading cause of cancer death, after lung cancer. But
despite their potential to save lives, the screening tests for
colon cancer are not popular: All adults 50 and older are
candidates for a screening, but fewer than a third actually are
tested.

FINALLY, A LITTLE STYLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From way, way out of Nowheresville comes a kicky little indie
item that should warm the heart of any true movie buff. ``The Woman
Chaser'' is a film noir spoof done with real cockeyed commitment to
its eccentric premise, wit that won't quit and a surprisingly
sophisticated understanding of psychosis, Hollywood-style.
</P>
<P>
   That's Hollywood 1960 style, to be precise. Not only set in
tailfin era Tinseltown but shot (in scruffy black-and-white) like
it was actually made then, this satiric adaptation of a hardboiled
novel by Charles Willeford (``Miami Blues'') boasts precise
approximations of the bad acting, loony behavior and hothouse
sexuality B movies of the period traded on, getting the wacky
details down right to the Yma Sumac number on its great retro
soundtrack. The difference is that adapter-director Robinson Devor
is thoroughly conscious of his movie's cheesiness; he actively
aestheticizes it here, while missing no opportunity to let the
audience in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   That we come to really identify with, and in some ways even
admire, the story's cracked, misanthropic protagonist is perhaps
the best evidence that Devor, who makes his feature film debut with
this project, has a gift for storytelling that's as prodigious as
his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the filmmaker is incalculably aided by his star,
Patrick Warburton. The actor does a more soulful variation on the
impacted, inelegant hostility that made him so funny as
``Seinfeld's'' Puddy, and it's a marvelous fit for the character.
Richard Hudson is a crooked used car salesman and mother-fixated
misogynist who, suddenly desperate to give his life meaning,
decides to write and direct a movie about a renegade, child-killing
truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Richard has no filmmaking experience barely daunts
him (there's some coy business about writer's block, amusingly
overcome). After all, Mom's umpteenth husband Leo (Paul Malevitz)
is a washed-up director, and Richard's ego and piggishness know no
bounds, so what have those other guys got that he doesn't? What's
really funny is, he apparently has talent, too; we're not shown
much of the movie within the movie, but everyone who sees it thinks
it's quite effectively disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, even, too effective that way. When studio guys start
suggesting ways to make the project more commercial, the
uncompromising artist in Richard comes out.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Auteur is just one of the character's many unattractive
aspects that Warburton fearlessly displays. Whether browbeating car
lot underlings, oafishly practicing ballet with his teasing mom
(Lynette Bennett) or seducing and abandoning females as diverse as
his teen-age stepsister and a widowed Salvation Army officer,
Warburton lets no shame slip past his mask of deadpan earnest, yet
is somehow convincing when he cries, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Richard is also narrating the story for us, and Devor
and Warburton do a masterful job of camouflaging the extent of his
unreliability until the very last scene.
</P>
<P>
   Made for a reported $800,000, ``The Woman Chaser'' did the film
festival circuit before landing the limited commercial release
that's brought it to the Nuart for a week. But don't confuse the
project's modest circumstances with limited achievement or
entertainment value; it's as accomplished a first film as we're
likely to see all year.
</P>
<P>
   And it should certainly be the kookiest. &QL;

IN POLITICS, AS IN EVERYTHING ELSE, BUSH PLACES PREMIUM ON
LOYALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Walk through Gov. George W. Bush's campaign
headquarters here and you encounter a remarkable sight: virtually
the same lineup of senior advisers that he had a year ago and, at
the uppermost echelon of the operation, an inner circle of trusted
friends that is wholly intact from the days when Bush won his first
race for Texas governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to these advisers and you hear something equally
arresting: unvarying, self-effacing odes to the governor's talents
that attribute all credit for the campaign's successes to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly acknowledged disagreements? Leaks? These are almost
nonexistent in Bush world, because most of the people who are
allowed to enter it have declared or demonstrated their loyalty, an
ethos as precious to Bush as any other, the coin of his political
realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loyalty is the No. 1 criterion for him,'' said one Republican
official who has known Bush for more than a decade. ``He would have
loyalty over any other skill or characteristic in the people around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush, the de facto Republican presidential nominee, nears the
announcement of who his running mate will be, unanswered questions
continue to swirl around what type of political and professional
pedigree that person will have. But Bush and his advisers have made
clear that one of the litmus tests the person will have passed is
that he or she can be utterly faithful to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, most Republican operatives chalk up Sen. John
McCain or Arizona, a political maverick who loves the spotlight, as
an improbable selection, even if his publicly stated lack of
interest could be overcome and even though his presence on the
ticket could be a powerful lure for independent and swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma has maintained his
position as one of the most-talked-about contenders largely because
his mild mann
</P>
<P>
   After Bush struggled in the primaries to turn back the
insurgency of McCain, some analysts speculated that he would turn
to a conventionally seasoned political operative to supplement the
so-called iron triangle _ Rove, Hughes and Joe Allbaugh, the
campaign manager _ who had also guided Bush's career in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush asked one of his best and oldest friends, Donald
L. Evans, an oil and gas company executive, to be the campaign
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The tightness and endurance of Bush's advisers stand in contrast
to the gyrations in Vice President Al Gore's operation, which Bush
has monitored with a disapproving eye. During a taping of the
television news program ``Hardball with Chris Matthews'' a month
and a half ago, Bush predicted that Gore's campaign chairman, Tony
Coelho, would not survive Gore's persistent disadvantage in most
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to dump him,'' Bush told Matthews during a
commercial break. ``Mark my words. Oh, they'll dump him. There's no
loyalty in those guys.'' (Coelho later stepped down after being
hospitalized with an inflamed colon.)
</P>
<P>
   The unity of the Bush team differs as well from the revolving
door that afflicted Bob Dole's presidential campaign four years
ago, and it has enabled Bush to keep the news coverage of his
campaign focused on the policies he is unveiling or the voters he
is courting.
</P>
<P>
   It also reflects Bush's lingering ire over the behavior of some
aides and allies during his father's failed re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that when the going got tough, ``I saw them jumping
out the windows in 1992, looking for the next campaign. And that
influenced me. Yeah, that influenced me. I worry that some may be
wanting to be involved in my campaign to enhance their consulting
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that Bush also learned to value loyalty from the
example of his father, who swallowed ideological differences with
Ronald Reagan to serve as his vice president from 1980 to 1988. In
1988, after his father was elected to the presidency, George W.
Bush was asked to hed a committee with the task of making sure that
people who had helped his father win were not overlooked for jobs
in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. opened the meeting by saying, `The purpose of this
occasion is not to punish our enemies but to identify our
friends,''' recalled Chase Untermeyer, who became the director of
personnel in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And friends are not being forgotten _ or forgetting the Bushes.
Condoleezza Rice, a Russia specialist on the National Security
Council during the Bush administration, is George W. Bush's chief
foreign policy adviser. Richard B. Cheney, the defense secretary
under former President Bush, is supervising the process by which
his son selects a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Texas governor discusses these teammates, the words
loyal or loyalty are bound to pop up, as they do even when he talks
about the less political people in his life.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview about his wife, Laura, Bush said:
``The other thing about Laura is that she's fiercely loyal. She's
loyal to me. She's loyal to my dad. She's loyal to her children.''
It was clear, in the tone of his voice, that there was no praise
any higher. &QL;

 &HT;    Sorenstam hopes to have the right numbers for the Open
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, ILL. _ A self-proclaimed ``statistical nerd,'' Annika
Sorenstam has all of her scores on a computer. She keeps track of
fairway hits, greens in regulation and putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's just the way I play,'' said Sorenstam, who will
shoot for her third U.S. Women's Open title today at the Merit Club
outside Chicago. ``I have a feeling in my game, but I don't play
with my heart. I don't just go out there and rip the driver hoping
it's going to be okay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish star keeps track of Karrie Webb, too, checking the
Australian's scores. Webb's success spurred her to practice more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think that she's one of the best,'' Sorenstam said,
``and if you want to be the best, you've got to beat the best.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Sorenstam has won five tournaments, including
the last two on the LPGA Tour. Webb won four of the first five.
Webb leads the point standings, 197 to 175.93, while Sorenstam is
tops on the money list, $985,635 to $963,742. Sorenstam won
back-to-back Opens in 1995-96; Webb's best finish is fourth in four
tries.
</P>
<P>
   So who has the edge at the 55th U.S. Women's Open? It could be a
matter of which way the wind blows. The Merit Club, which at 6,540
yards is the longest U.S. Women's Open course, is notoriously wide
open. And the wind often changes direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as suiting my game,'' Webb said, ``I tend to enjoy
playing in the wind and I think that's going to be a big factor
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, who is working on her patience, said wind makes the
players concentrate more. ``I think when you have perfect
conditions, you sometimes tend to lose your creativity,'' she said,
``but when it is windy, you really have to think about things.''
</P>
<P>
   In the back of their minds is the largest purse in women's
history, $2.75 million, with $500,000 going to the champion.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam said money doesn't add any extra pressure. In fact,
she's feeling extremely relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the confidence, I have the game, so I'm looking for a
good outcome,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nancy Lopez is still seeking the Women's Open title
that has eluded her, defending champion Juli Inkster thinks another
Georgian, Atlanta's Rosie Jones, could do well here.
</P>
<P>
   Jones agrees. She said that the U.S. Golf Association's methods
of toughening the course by growing the rough, tightening the
fairways and hardening the greens is ``almost like punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``It's right up my alley. The harder the golf
course, the better I play.''

APPLE TRIES TO KEEP ITS REVIVAL GOING
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Apple Computer Inc. introduced several new products
on Wednesday from a restyled mouse to an overhaul of its popular
iMac desktop computers, whose sales have stagnated in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has enjoyed a remarkable corporate revival in the last
three years under the leadership of Steven P. Jobs, who returned to
take the helm of the company he helped found in 1975. But lately,
industry analysts have pointed to signs that Apple's momentum may
be slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported strong quarterly
profits on Tuesday on a 17 percent increase in revenues, though the
increase in sales was less than Wall Street had anticipated. And
sales of its iMac consumer desktops slipped to 450,000 machines in
the June quarter, down from 487,000 in the year-earlier quarter,
according to analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question some people have had about Apple is, Can we keep
it up?'' Jobs, the chief executive, said. ``Well, we've answered
that question here today. Innovation keeps coming from Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements at the company's biannual Macworld exhibition,
which began on Wednesday in New York, continue the game plan Apple
has followed since Jobs took over in 1997: to combine arresting
industrial design, homegrown hardware and software technology,
competitive pricing and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's software engineers focus not only on the Macintosh
operating system, but also video imaging software. Apple introduced
a version of its iMovie software, which enables people to import
and edit home digital video clips on an iMac or a Power Mac.
</P>
<P>
   During his two-hour presentation, Jobs pointed to iMovie as an
indication of the company's direction and of ``Apple's DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, he said, is ``not just about making spreadsheets
run faster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Apple to stand at the intersection of art and
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most visually striking innovation was a new line of
Power Macintosh called the G4 Cube. The new model packs the power
of Macintosh machines used by graphics artists and Web designers
into a white plastic cube, eight inches on a side, or about
one-fourth the space of most similarly powered computers.
</P>
<P>
   Apple hopes that the G4 Cube will both expand its sales among
media and arts professionals, as well as encourage home users who
have Apple's more expensive line of iMac to trade up to the G4
Cube.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac line has been refurbished with more aggressive pricing,
faster processors, more storage capacity and new colors including a
white machine _ a color Apple calls ``snow.'' The least expensive
iMac will be priced at $799, or $200 less than the previous
entry-level machine.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also introduced a line of Power Mac desktop machines with
two microprocessors. The dual-processor machines are Apple's
response to concerns that the company could not keep pace with
industry-standard PC's using Intel microprocessors. Apple
demonstrated that its machines far exceeded the performance of the
fastest Intel machines, whose processors have higher raw
calculating speeds measured in megahertz, as both machines did the
same multimedia editing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just megahertz, it's the architecture,'' Jobs
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Apple introduced new versions of all its desktop
machines, which represent 75 percent of its sales. And all of them
will come with a redesigned keyboard and a new elongated computer
mouse, designed by Apple, which uses optical technology for
positioning and requires no mouse pad.
</P>
<P>
   The new mouse's entire housing depresses to click, dispensing
with the traditional mouse button. It replaces the round Apple
mouse, which was derided by reviewers variously as ``an ergonomic
nightmare'' and a ``hockey puck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our failings at Apple, but we do listen to
customers,'' Jobs observed.

FINALLY, A LITTLE STYLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From way, way out of Nowheresville comes a kicky little indie
item that should warm the heart of any true movie buff. ``The Woman
Chaser'' is a film noir spoof done with real cockeyed commitment to
its eccentric premise, wit that won't quit and a surprisingly
sophisticated understanding of psychosis, Hollywood-style.
</P>
<P>
   That's Hollywood 1960 style, to be precise. Not only set in
tailfin era Tinseltown but shot (in scruffy black-and-white) like
it was actually made then, this satiric adaptation of a hardboiled
novel by Charles Willeford (``Miami Blues'') boasts precise
approximations of the bad acting, loony behavior and hothouse
sexuality B movies of the period traded on, getting the wacky
details down right to the Yma Sumac number on its great retro
soundtrack. The difference is that adapter-director Robinson Devor
is thoroughly conscious of his movie's cheesiness; he actively
aestheticizes it here, while missing no opportunity to let the
audience in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   That we come to really identify with, and in some ways even
admire, the story's cracked, misanthropic protagonist is perhaps
the best evidence that Devor, who makes his feature film debut with
this project, has a gift for storytelling that's as prodigious as
his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the filmmaker is incalculably aided by his star,
Patrick Warburton. The actor does a more soulful variation on the
impacted, inelegant hostility that made him so funny as
``Seinfeld's'' Puddy, and it's a marvelous fit for the character.
Richard Hudson is a crooked used car salesman and mother-fixated
misogynist who, suddenly desperate to give his life meaning,
decides to write and direct a movie about a renegade, child-killing
truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Richard has no filmmaking experience barely daunts
him (there's some coy business about writer's block, amusingly
overcome). After all, Mom's umpteenth husband Leo (Paul Malevitz)
is a washed-up director, and Richard's ego and piggishness know no
bounds, so what have those other guys got that he doesn't? What's
really funny is, he apparently has talent, too; we're not shown
much of the movie within the movie, but everyone who sees it thinks
it's quite effectively disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, even, too effective that way. When studio guys start
suggesting ways to make the project more commercial, the
uncompromising artist in Richard comes out.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Auteur is just one of the character's many unattractive
aspects that Warburton fearlessly displays. Whether browbeating car
lot underlings, oafishly practicing ballet with his teasing mom
(Lynette Bennett) or seducing and abandoning females as diverse as
his teen-age stepsister and a widowed Salvation Army officer,
Warburton lets no shame slip past his mask of deadpan earnest, yet
is somehow convincing when he cries, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Richard is also narrating the story for us, and Devor
and Warburton do a masterful job of camouflaging the extent of his
unreliability until the very last scene.
</P>
<P>
   Made for a reported $800,000, ``The Woman Chaser'' did the film
festival circuit before landing the limited commercial release
that's brought it to the Nuart for a week. But don't confuse the
project's modest circumstances with limited achievement or
entertainment value; it's as accomplished a first film as we're
likely to see all year.
</P>
<P>
   And it should certainly be the kookiest. &QL;

 SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S TIME FOR CAPTAIN McENROE 
By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTANDER, Spain _ With daylong sun to stoke his fire and a
coastal breeze to cool his jets, John McEnroe's decision to deploy
himself as a Davis Cup doubles player remains a point in progress,
a mental rally in which his brazen side is attempting to reach the
net for a winning volley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closer to 50-50, maybe a little more,'' McEnroe rated his
chances Wednesday of teaming with somebody, anybody, for Saturday's
doubles against heavily favored Spain, smack dab in the middle of
the Davis Cup semifinals in this beach-endowed resort city.
</P>
<P>
   For the third leg of his maiden voyage as skipper of the
U.S.team, McEnroe finds himself in a typically tormented place,
only without the enviable options to hit his way out. He has no
Pete Sampras, no Andre Agassi and no fountain of youth from which
to drink.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be The Perfect Storm that Captain McEnroe finds
himself in. It could be worse, much less dramatic, a topspin
torture under a broiling sun on thick, red clay. It could be death
by indifference, with only Ma and Pa McEnroe, and maybe brother
Patrick, caring enough to watch back home.
</P>
<P>
   From the U.S. point of interest in sporting events playing out
in Europe this week, this Davis Cup event can rate no better than
third, behind the unparalleled golfer and the inspirational biker.
McEnroe surely won't change that from a courtside chair and
probably not from a doubles alley either.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is against the man's nature to compete in anything less
than a cacophonous state and, for the life of him, he hasn't been
able to think of two better U.S. doubles players or one good reason
he absolutely should not put himself in.
</P>
<P>
   When McEnroe played four sets of doubles with three different
partners Tuesday evening at the beachfront club alongside the
temporary stadium that looks like a giant erector set, he won three
and the other was called at five-all.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the practice drew fans away from the nearby
Spaniards, a diverse crowd of sunbathers and celebrity worshipers
who rabidly supported every angled winner off McEnroe's racquet.
</P>
<P>
   Even Juan Balcells, one of the Spanish doubles players, said it
would be ``great, a thrill'' to play against the cranky legend.
Never the most artful ambassador, McEnroe was unfortunately on
record already regarding the quality of the likely doubles
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, doubles are our best bet, on paper,'' he said. ``I'm
not saying we'll do it but if we win the doubles and lose 4-1, I
don't consider that a victory just because I stepped on the court
and beat Balcells and, you know, somebody. I mean, who the hell is
Balcells?''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever he is, Balcells and his probable partner, the rock-solid
Alex Corretja, will be about 15 years younger and likely to make
McEnroe miserable with those heavy ground strokes that are the
foundation of the clay court game.
</P>
<P>
   When McEnroe looks in the mirror, he still sees the
serve-and-volley genius, the short-point artist, more than the
gray-haired 41-year-old who in his prime bragged about a
conditioning program that began with his self-titled ``Haagen-Dazs
diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he would only have half the court to cover; points in
doubles are shorter and the Spaniards are not going to serve and
volley anyone off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what he saw of McEnroe on Monday night, Todd Martin,
the most experienced U.S. singles player here, said: ``The only
thing keeping him from being a real viable candidate to play is his
second serve. His first serve is still very effective and his play
at the net is superb. But you have to make your second serve
penetrate on clay and I don't think that was easy for him even in
his prime.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wimbledon, Martin said he did not think McEnroe should vacate
his captain's chair but Wednesday admitted that he had to
``hedge,'' now that Sampras and Agassi are injured and out, putting
Martin in a position to play two singles matches.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is 30 and has fought off various ailments the last few
years. To play doubles with Jan-Michael Gambill would mean three
straight days in the sun, on the clay.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe might have brought another doubles player, an Alex
O'Brien, a Jared Palmer, but he played it straight in Zimbabwe and
Los Angeles, resisted the temptation to nominate himself and lost
the doubles in both events.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, with a career 18-2 record in the Davis Cup doubles,
can't do any worse and there is nobody to make a case for who is
certain to do better.
</P>
<P>
   When he assumed the captaincy, McEnroe's stated goal was to
raise the visibility of the Davis Cup, which he has done to a
degree. On the other hand, he already sounds frustrated by the
bailouts of the stars and he knows that, with the possible
exception of Gambill, there are none on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   He holds the job on a year-to-year basis, and said that he would
have to assess his availability for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not worked out the way I planned it but I still
believe that Davis Cup is an event worth fighting for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He should take the fight to the court, one more time. He should
put himself in, go to the net, strike a few winners for the sport
that he loves. If he drowns under a tidal wave of topspin, well,
disasters sell at the box office, too.

 &HT;    Huffins laments lost shot at rival
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, CALIF. _ Protocol has its place, and no event on the
track has a deeper sense of tradition than the decathlon. It is
considered the cathedral of sporting perseverance, the Olympic
stage its altar. Ruled by high priests down through the years like
Bill Toomey, Rafer Johnson, Bruce Jenner and, most recently, Dan
O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Huffins has waited four years for the chance to formally
unseat O'Brien as the country's best all-around athlete. But as the
Olympic trials resume this afternoon with first-day competition in
the decathlon, Huffins is left chasing a ghost of a rival _ with
O'Brien returning to his desert haunt in Scottsdale, Ariz., to
nurse a bruised heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been preparing a long time for this day, hoping the best
decathlete in world would be at his best and we'd go at it,'' said
Huffins, dejected by the absence of O'Brien. ``It stinks. It's like
reading a book and the ending is stupid. Everything is building
towards this magnificent crescendo and it doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This neatly captures Huffins' personality _ blunt, eloquent and
honest. He carries an air of supreme confidence, alongside fierce
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   While other competitors pay homage to O'Brien, Huffins speaks
openly of beating him. O'Brien still owns the American record of
8,891 points; Huffins has a personal best of 8,694. But with
O'Brien competing just once since the Atlanta Olympics, Huffins won
the last two U.S. championships and a bronze medal at last summer's
World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, Huffins evolved into America's best decathlete while
O'Brien lived off his Atlanta glory. That's why he wanted O'Brien
and no excuses in the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't think the victor will be any different
than it was going to be before,'' said Huffins, sporting a gold
Georgia Tech visor.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins, 30, expects to be the last man standing when the
10-event decathlon ends Friday. Then, he'll head off to a second
Olympic Games and, if all goes well, return to Atlanta with a medal
and perhaps the title of the world's greatest athlete.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 1, Huffins went on the Georgia Tech payroll as an
assistant track coach. Head coach Grover Hinsdale, however, made
the hire knowing Huffins might be involved with the Olympics until
the early fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK, we'd be glad to have an Olympic medalist on our
staff,'' Hinsdale said.
</P>
<P>
   After adopting the decathlon in 1992, and even leading the
trials competion in New Orleans later that summer after the first
day, Huffins finds himself now at the peak and a serious threat to
Czech star Tomas Dvorak for an Olympic gold medal. Huffins says
he's at the point O'Brien was between 1992-95, searching for
consistency in all events.
</P>
<P>
   He excels in the 100 meters (10.22 seconds) and long jump (26-5
3/4), which explains why he scores well the first day. Ever so
steadily, Huffins has improved in the other eight events and has
managed to conquer his fear of the event-closing 1,500 meters in
his pursuit of a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins, a California/Berkeley graduate, first knows he has to
earn his way onto the U.S. team, cognizant of steamy temperatures,
dicey pole vault conditons and other pitfalls that could be ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, no regrets,'' he said. ``I only wanted track
to pay for my college. I'm a '96 Olympian and on the cusp of
another team.''

Seventh International Architecture Exhibition features the latest

``The Girl on the Bridge'' to reach the United States, he has
completed one feature _ the period piece ``The Widow of
Saint-Pierre,'' with Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil _ and is
filming ``Felix et Lola'' with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Philippe
Torreton. In his spare time, he makes commercials. ``The Girl on

``All films are love stories,'' he says in an interview in Paris.

   FILM-BRITISH-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ The kitchen sink is no longer
a handy symbol for the social inequities and domestic pressures of
British life and the so-called kitchen-sink filmmakers of the '60s
have gone on to other projects. But in the last few years several
talented British directors have emerged with pain-infused realist
dramas that get to the heart of working- and middle-class Britain.
Lynne Ramsay's ``Ratcatcher'' and Shane Meadows' ``Room for Romeo
Brass'' open in New York this fall. ``Wonderland,'' directed by
Michael Winterbottom, opens on Friday. Graham Fuller interviews the

   MUSIC-JARRE-FILM (Undated) _ Michael Beckerman says he is
rooting for Maurice Jarre to win an Oscar for his brilliant score
of ``Sunshine.'' Then, Beckerman says, he hopes Jarre gives it to
Schubert. To create the main musical theme, Jarre has played the
first phrase of the Schubert Fantasy in F Minor without notes 6-15,
then added a new expansive phrase. The Schubert fantasy is a
particularly compelling choice for ``Sunshine'' because the opening
suggests a Hungarian Gypsy origin, appropriate for the film set
over three generations of one family in Hungary.

   MUSIC-MAVERICKS (San Francisco) _ So what if some of the
participants were not really mavericks; more like an in-group of

were amazing and the downs were mostly good enough at the
``American Mavericks'' festival at the San Francisco Orchestra last
month. Richard Taruskin writes that he had never heard such a
catholic barrage of not-to-be-missed programming. Also not to be
missed in this unusually colorful music story was the sight and
sound of Michael Tilson Thomas directing the audience, who had been
invited to bring instruments. Taruskin says he looked like Jerry

century was a special moment of creative boom in Dutch history. In
other parts of Europe, art was still reflecting the power of kings

mercantile society. With still lifes decorating every
self-respecting home, it was an enviable time to be an artist.

seven existing treatments of the subject by Jacopo Robusti
Tintoretto, one of the great painters of the late Italian
Renaissance. There is little doubt about its provenance. The story
traces its travels to England to Berlin and back to Italy where it
was purchased for $35,000 in 1928 by an American couple. The sale
had an exceptionally credible witness, Frank Spellman, a young

   TV-COPS-RUSSIA (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ In the last two years,
St. Petersburg has become the hottest location for the hottest
trend on Russian television: gritty, tell-it-like-it-is cop shows.
The boom began in early 1998 with ``The Street of Broken
Streetlights,'' a St. Petersburg version of ``Hill Street Blues.''
Now, in its wake, half a dozen mini-series are being shot or are on
the drawing boards in St. Petersburg, starring counter-intelligence
agents, mafia dons, tough female investigators and other heroes and
villains. The choice of St. Petersburg echoes real life. In recent
years, the city has become infamous for a string of contract
killings. By Celestine Bohlen.

   TV-BURNETT-SURVIVOR (Undated) _ Mark Burnett may not be liked by
everybody, but he has survived the entertainment world. The
40-year-old British native landed in Los Angeles in 1982, moved
from au pair work to telemarketing, insurance and credit card sales
before being inspired by a Tony Robbins motivational seminar and
turning to television. He has since developed two winning
entertainment vehicles in remarkably little time by Hollywood
standards, the ``Eco-Challenge Expedition Race,'' and now
``Survivor.'' ``Survivor'' is the latest in what he promises will
be a stream of adventure-related businesses and programming
combining a blend of drama and reality. Burnett calls it
``dramality.'' By Alica Ault.

<P>
   TRAVEL-JERUSALEM-HOTELS (Jerusalem) _ Jerusalem is not an
ordinary city and this is not an ordinary guide to hotels there.
William Orme Jr. makes discerning recommendations in a 3,000-word
piece full of details about decor, history, service and discounts.
The hotels visited included: the Olive Tree, a Holy Land theme inn;
the American Colony, an 84-room compound developed from a
19th-century pasha's manse; and the King David, which for true
self-indulgence, he concludes, is Jerusalem's best luxury hotel. He
even recommends the hotel's promotional film in which employees
recall everything from the 1946 bombing of its west wing to the
pyramid cake they baked for Anwar Sadat in 1977. With photo.

   TRAVEL-BRAZIL-SOCCER (Undated) _ How you play the game of soccer
does matter. So Annasue McCleave Wilson accompanied her 14-year-old
son, John, to Florianopolis, Brazil, for training sessions and
matches planned by his coach, Paulo Barreto. In between games, John
and his teammates had time for sandboarding and exchanging e-mail
addresses with Brazilian teenagers and parents had time for
enjoying lime drinks on the hotel veranda, ecological walks and
watching games played on sand as white as baby powder.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-TEENS (Undated) _ Based on first-hand experience from
five trips, Jill Abramson has advice for parents traveling with
teen-agers. In London, avoid the British Museum and Parliament, but
visit the Tower of London and war rooms because teen-agers like
gory stuff and they have seen enough World War II movies to make
Whitehall interesting. In Paris, she reports that her daughter took
in the Louvre in less than two hours, but loved going to a movie
without a chaperone. Other advice: rent a ``sweet'' car, don't
share rooms with teen-agers because vacation for them means not
being neat and finally, don't insist on little adults, be a big kid
instead.
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) How young is too young for a child
to fly? It depends on whom you ask. Continental will not accept an
infant younger than 7 days. American Airlines sets a 3-day limit,
but in fact, a spokesman says the airline doesn't ``inspect''
babies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
recommends 6 weeks. Another expert asks if a postpartum mother is
ready for a long trip and still another says a good criteria might
be, Is this trip really necessary? By Betsy Wade. &QL;

<P>
   TRAVEL-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Joseph Siano answers questions about the
Grand Prix in Monaco; behind-the-scenes tours of English Cathedrals

<P>
   TRAVEL-CUBA (Undated) _ Cuba has been off-limits for American
tourists for almost 40 years and unless President Clinton changes
his mind, the ban on United States tourist travel to Cuba is likely
to be tightened this summer. Meanwhile, travel from the United
States to Cuba increases. Edwin McDowell reports that there are

and entrepreneurs take American tourists to Cuba without running
afoul of U.S. authorities.

 &HT;    Bad headaches a warning sign, neurologists say
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The type of stroke that killed U.S. Sen. Paul
Coverdell presented doctors at Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital with two
major challenges: It is very rare and highly fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's senior senator died Tuesday evening in Piedmont's
neurological intensive care unit of a massive intracerebral
hemorrhage. He had been brought in by ambulance Saturday night
complaining of a severe headache.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the 61-year-old lifelong politician died as a
result of bleeding from a vein in the left side of his brain that
led to uncontrollable swelling and pressure on areas vital to
breathing and consciousness. Surgery was performed Monday morning
to remove a blood clot and relieve the pressure. His wife, Nancy,
and other family members made the decision to remove him from life
support when tests showed no brain activity, a Piedmont spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's family has instructed the hospital to release no
further information on the specifics on the senator's death, said
Nina Montanaro, director of public affairs, so the exact kind of
hemorrhage he suffered was not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said he had been complaining of bad headaches recently.
</P>
<P>
   Cerebral hemorrhages, or bleeding into the brain, comprise about
20 percent of the 750,000 strokes that occur every year across the
country. They can be caused by a sudden rupture or slow leakage of
a blood vessel, or a weakening of the wall of an artery that forms
into an aneurysm, a balloon-like collection of blood that can clot
or rupture.
</P>
<P>
   The most common strokes _ and the ones that can be treated with
new clot-busting drugs called tissue plasminogen activators _ are
called ischemic and are caused by a lack of blood getting to the
brain. These are commonly triggered by high blood pressure and
atherosclerosis, or fatty deposits in the arteries that break off
and cause clots that block blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   While getting immediate treatment for any kind of stroke is
vital, people suffering ischemic strokes have a higher survival
rate than those stricken by the hemorrhagic variety.
</P>
<P>
   Treating a cerebral hemorrhage depends on which type of bleeding
is occurring and where it is occurring. Brain hemorrhages generally
fall into three categories: venus thrombosis, where the major vein
in the brain clots and then blood backs up into the brain, causing
a hemorrhage and potentially fatal pressure on the brain stem; an
aneurysm, which is a bulging out from a weakened wall in an artery
in the brain; or a hemorrhage within an artery of the brain that is
usually caused by high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   A brain scan is the standard first test done to see if a
disturbance is occurring and which type, said Dr. Keith Sanders, a
neurologist and director of the Stroke Center at Saint Joseph's
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have said Coverdell did not suffer from high blood
pressure, and Montanaro said he was not diagnosed with an aneurysm.
Piedmont Hospital is known for its successful treatment of brain
aneurysms using a nonsurgical technique called interventional
radiology, which uses X-ray imaging and balloon angioplasty to plug
the bleeding with small hair-thin wires.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping bleeding within the brain that is caused by a ruptured
vein is considered one of the most difficult types of stroke to
treat, doctors said. It also is listed as having the highest
mortality rate among all the possible stroke events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've had an hemorrhage in the brain, you're really tied
as to what you can do,'' said Dr. Lou Jacobs, a Piedmont
radiologist who specializes in treating brain aneurysms with
interventional radiology. ``If the hemorrhage is on the venus side,
surgery is limited and you have to be extremely careful in what is
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Local neurologists said patients suffering from venus thrombosis
probably account for less than 1 percent of their stroke patients.
While hemorrhagic stroke victims have a 50 percent chance of dying
_ and a great chance of some type of disability if they survive _
catching the bleeding in the brain before irreparable damage occurs
is key, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who experience sudden, severe headaches need to get to
a hospital immediately,'' advised Dr. Michael Frankel, chief of
neurology at Grady Health System and an Emory School of Medicine
associate professor of neurology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors have a acronym for them _ WHOL _ worst headache of
their life. Obviously, the vast majority of headaches are not due
to stroke symptoms, but they can be a warning sign that shouldn't
be ignored.''

 AUSTIN, Texas: right reason.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Bush struggled in the primaries to turn back the
insurgency of McCain, some analysts speculated that he would turn
to a conventionally seasoned political operative to supplement the
so-called iron triangle _ Rove, Hughes and Joe Allbaugh, the
campaign manager _ who had also guided Bush's career in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush asked one of his best and oldest friends, Donald
L. Evans, an oil and gas company executive, to be the campaign
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The tightness and endurance of Bush's advisers stand in contrast
to the gyrations in Vice President Al Gore's operation, which Bush
has monitored with a disapproving eye. During a taping of the
television news program ``Hardball with Chris Matthews'' a month
and a half ago, Bush predicted that Gore's campaign chairman, Tony
Coelho, would not survive Gore's persistent disadvantage in most
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to dump him,'' Bush told Matthews during a
commercial break. ``Mark my words. Oh, they'll dump him. There's no
loyalty in those guys.'' (Coelho later stepped down after being
hospitalized with an inflamed colon.)
</P>
<P>
   The unity of the Bush team differs as well from the revolving
door that afflicted Bob Dole's presidential campaign four years
ago, and it has enabled Bush to keep the news coverage of his
campaign focused on the policies he is unveiling or the voters he
is courting.
</P>
<P>
   It also reflects Bush's lingering ire over the behavior of some
aides and allies during his father's failed re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that when the going got tough, ``I saw them jumping
out the windows in 1992, looking for the next campaign. And that
influenced me. Yeah, that influenced me. I worry that some may be
wanting to be involved in my campaign to enhance their consulting
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that Bush also learned to value loyalty from the
example of his father, who swallowed ideological differences with
Ronald Reagan to serve as his vice president from 1980 to 1988. In
1988, after his father was elected to the presidency, George W.
Bush was asked to head a committee wth the task of making sure that
people who had helped his father win were not overlooked for jobs
in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. opened the meeting by saying, `The purpose of this
occasion is not to punish our enemies but to identify our
friends,''' recalled Chase Untermeyer, who became the director of
personnel in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And friends are not being forgotten _ or forgetting the Bushes.
Condoleezza Rice, a Russia specialist on the National Security
Council during the Bush administration, is George W. Bush's chief
foreign policy adviser. Richard B. Cheney, the defense secretary
under former President Bush, is supervising the process by which
his son selects a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Texas governor discusses these teammates, the words
loyal or loyalty are bound to pop up, as they do even when he talks
about the less political people in his life.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview about his wife, Laura, Bush said:
``The other thing about Laura is that she's fiercely loyal. She's
loyal to me. She's loyal to my dad. She's loyal to her children.''
It was clear, in the tone of his voice, that there was no praise
any higher. &QL;

WHEN YOU JUST CAN'T BEAR TO DIE, CHEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE HUTSKO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am not a cheater by nature, but when my life depended on it,
for the 20th time, I caved in. I cheated. The game that caused me
to cross over to the dark side was the aptly named Perfect Dark,
for the Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   I had fairly, honestly and exhaustedly reached the final level,
where my alter ego, Joanna Dark, was instructed to blow up an alien
temple's target system, activate an access bridge and assassinate
the diabolical space invader responsible for wreaking so much
interplanetary havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. After multiple defeats at the scabrous
claws of the so-called final boss, I gave in. I used a Game Shark,
a piece of hardware the size of a Nintendo 64 cartridge that plugs
into the cartridge port on the top of the console.
</P>
<P>
   The device lets players choose built-in codes that give them
special powers on existing games or add codes for new games, using
the controller pad to tap in alphanumeric sequences that can be
saved to the console's memory.
</P>
<P>
   The cheat I used fooled Perfect Dark into believing that I had
played the game all the way through, which unlocked the elusive
infinite life code. I took out not only the big boss, but also his
minions, with nary a virtual scratch.
</P>
<P>
   After it was over, my feelings were mixed. I felt both good and
bad. But mostly, I felt guilty. Or, as the game itself, which
recognizes whether you played honestly or not, reported in the
final level's summary screen: ``Disgraced.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheating is not new. Programmers have always built in ways to
cheat because testers need to play every level hundreds of times to
make sure the game works.
</P>
<P>
   With so many variables besides just beating the bad guys _ level
design, conversations with other characters, how the bullet holes
look when they pierce the wall _ testers install cheats that allow
them to bypass certain phases. The programmers sometimes leave the
cheats in the finished game or forget to take them out.
</P>
<P>
   The cheats are not always easy to discover. So many gaming sites
and magazines try to cull cheats from inside sources and beta
testers, or by experimenting with games. Many video games have
basic cheats that can be activated, without a Game Shark, by
pressing an often thumb-numbing series of buttons on the console's
controller.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a cheat involves nothing more than typing in a secret
password to a certain level, instead of the password the game gives
you after completing the level fairly. In either case, once the
cheat or cheats are in place, the game becomes easier to play,
whether it is because you have better and stronger weapons and
ammunition or, in the case of Perfect Dark, unlimited life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other games, Perfect Dark assigns the ``Disgraced''
status to make sure you do not forget that while you may have
conquered the level, you went about it dishonestly, according to
the game's code of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the subject of video game cheats, for me and other
gamers discussing them online, seems to frequently revolve around
the issue of saving games.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike PC games, which often let you save your game at any
point, video games, also called console games, do not.
</P>
<P>
   So in games like Perfect Dark, dying means you must start the
level over. But in games like Unreal and Quake II for the PC, you
can save your game as you go, and should you get mowed down around
the next turn, you can return to the spot you saved.
</P>
<P>
   But that has been changing. Last year, when Fox Interactive
released Alien vs. Predator for the PC, players cried foul when
they discovered that the game could be saved only after completing
a level.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, the company released a fix that allowed
limited saves. The recently released PC shooter game Soldier of
Fortune offers the best of both worlds: an easy setting, for
unlimited saves at any time in a level, or a more difficult setting
that limits the number of saves per level.
</P>
<P>
   Another game, Daikatana for Windows PCs, takes a slightly
different approach, by requiring the player to collect ``save
crystals'' to save the game's progress. The catch is that only
three save crystals can be carried at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Players can get around some of the game's challenges by
activating many of its not-so-secret cheats, revealed on popular
gaming sites like Gamespot.com and DailyRadar.com. The most common
cheat for shooter games is the so-called God cheat, which, as in
Daikatana, makes your alter ego invincible.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not into playing God; I only want to be able to save at any
point. So it's only a matter of time before Daikatana's maker
presumably releases a patch that lets a player do that. Even so,
since Daikatana has received several scathing reviews, it is not
likely to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a game is so good _ and available only for video game
consoles _ that it is worth playing, despite the many deaths you'll
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation is one. A spy game in which
stealth is always preferred to shooting, the game casts the player
in the role of a secret agent with a mandate to _ what else? _ save
the world. Considered ancient in video game years (it was released
in 1998), the game continues to appeal to PlayStation users.
</P>
<P>
   As with Perfect Dark, Metal Gear Solid's inability to save the
game at any point can be frustrating. So a little cheating to slip
on a bulletproof vest and load up with unlimited ammunition got me
through a few levels.
</P>
<P>
   But then I stopped cheating and put the game aside because a
more appealing alternative is waiting: a higher-resolution version
of the game for Windows that will be published this summer by
Microsoft. It will let you save the game anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Will I ever cheat again? I'm sure I will, as long as the game
doesn't allow me to save at any time. I'd rather live (infinitely)
as a disgraced agent than forever die trying.

 &HT;    Hospital defends Coverdell
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera and Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The confusion surrounding initial reports Tuesday
evening of Sen. Paul Coverdell's death weren't intentional, says a
Piedmont Hospital spokeswoman whose comments caused some
broadcasters to retract reports that later were proven to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most difficult time I've ever had dealing with the
media. But I told the truth as I knew it to be,'' Nina Montanaro,
director of public affairs at Piedmont Hospital, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers, listeners and reporters were still wondering Wednesday
how reports of Coverdell's death, which occurred in the middle of
the evening news, could get so confused.
</P>
<P>
   WXIA and WSB as well as radio stations WGST (640 AM and 105.7
FM) and WSB (750 AM and B98.5 FM) reported shortly after 6:15 p.m.
that Coverdell had died. A few minutes later, Montanaro _during a
briefing _ said such reports were ``false.'' Some stations
immediately retracted their stories while others reported
Montanaro's conflicting statement.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:55 p.m., the hospital announced the state's senior senator
had died at 6:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Montanaro, a 25-year Piedmont veteran, said she was with about
15 of Coverdell's relatives and longtime staff members in a
hospital conference room watching TV reports shortly after 6 p.m.
The conference room is near the intensive care unit room where
Coverdell was with his wife, Nancy, Senate Chaplain Lloyd Ogilvie,
other relatives and ICU staff, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know he was dead. The family members I was with did
not know he was dead,'' Montanaro said. ``They said to me, `Would
you do something? It's not correct.' So I did that. I went
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   After denying the reports to the media, Montanaro went back to
the ICU conference room. A few minutes later _ at 6:35 or 6:40 p.m.
_ Nancy Coverdell came out of her husband's room to say the senator
had died, Montanaro said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital then prepared a written statement that was
distributed to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Montanaro said she did not intentionally lie when she denied
those first reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, the senator had passed, and it had been 20 minutes
since he had passed, when I said he had not. But I told the truth
as I knew it to be,'' she said. ``There were minute-by-minute
decisions being made in the patient's room that I was not privy to,
or the rest of the family outside the room were privy to.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, she says she probably denied the reports too
strongly _ she really did not know whether they were true _ but
that the only way to confirm the information was to interrupt the
family in the ICU room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not appropriate, in my opinion,'' Montanaro said. ``They told
me they would let me know as soon as they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the hospital's view, even though an individual's clinical
death may occur at a particular time, the family has the
prerogative to pronounce the death publicly according to their own
timetable, regardless of whether you are a public figure or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Events show how tricky things can be for a hospital spokesperson
charged with respecting a family's privacy while providing a
competitive media with information during a sensitive time. So was
it a rare instance of everyone trying to do the right thing, only
to have things go completely wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a right or wrong answer to this,'' says Tom
Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism in
Washington, D.C. ``Journalism is all about weighing different
values: the right to privacy versus the right to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's better not to confuse people _ you should be
authoritative when you declare someone dead,'' he added. ``Either
someone is dead or not dead _ you can't be a little bit dead. These
are interesting issues that show just how tricky journalism can
be.''

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM OFFERS TO BUY VOICESTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move that advances the ambitions of Europe's
largest telephone company in the United States, Deutsche Telekom
has offered to acquire the VoiceStream Wireless Corp. in a deal
that values the U.S. company at about $53 billion, according to a
person close to the bid.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom this week offered an exchange ratio of 3.2
shares of its stock plus $30 a share in cash, for a valuation of
about $205.60 a share for VoiceStream. With other large
telecommunications interested in VoiceStream, including Nippon
Telegraph &AMP; Telephone of Japan, the offer raises the stakes for
control of the wireless carrier based in Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   While global telecommunications players need to make
acquisitions to provide a complete array of services for clients,
Deutsche Telekom's valuation of VoiceStream is sure to raise
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   If the bid is accepted, it would value VoiceStream at more than
$20,000 per subscriber, or more than three times the average for
wireless carriers. Verizon, the largest wireless carrier in the
United States, is valued at about $4,000 per subscriber, while a
smaller, but faster-growing carrier like Sprint PCS, the wireless
unit of the Sprint Corp., is valued at about $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very expensive,'' said Frederick Moran, a
telecommunications analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``You have to ask how
they would get a return on an investment like that.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Deutsche Telekom is betting on the potential for
growth by pushing to acquire VoiceStream, a company which has been
on an acquisition tear of its own. Last year VoiceStream bought two
wireless carriers, Omnipoint and Aerial Communications, for a
combined $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuations are extremely difficult to quantify when a company
knows it has to grow and have pockets deep enough to do so,'' said
Steven Yanis, an analyst at Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of VoiceStream rose 93.75 cents on Wednesday, to $145.50,
while American depository receipts of Deutsche Telekom fell 87.5
cents, to $54.875.
</P>
<P>
   Operating on the GSM standard, for global system for mobile
telecommunications, the same standard in use in Europe where
Deutsche Telekom is a power, VoiceStream has ample room to grow in
the United States, with licenses to cover roughly three-quarters of
the population, or more than 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   For other carriers, the possible merger of VoiceStream into
Deutsche Telekom's empire would give them greater incentive to
arrive at similar deals. Sprint's wireless arm, which has been a
target for Deutsche Telekom, is left particularly vulnerable after
its parent company's $115 billion merger with WorldCom unraveled
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good side and a bad side to deals like this,'' said
Jeffrey Kagan, an independent analyst. ``At least it means that the
psychology involved makes the deal ahead more expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is the possibility that Deutsche Telekom may
not stop if it succeeds in acquiring VoiceStream. The German
company has previously tried to buy Qwest Communications of Denver,
and might do so again. Or it could be eyeing Sprint PCS, the
fourth-largest wireless carrier, as some analysts have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Deutsche Telekom will probably face a fight in any
large acquisition it attempts in the United States after opposition
emerged in Congress to the acquisition of American
telecommunications by companies controlled by foreign governments.
The German government owns more than 50 percent of Deutsche
Telekom.

ADMINISTRATION TO POSTPONE PLANS TO BREACH SNAKE RIVER DAMS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a decision highly sensitive in the Pacific
Northwest, the Clinton administration will postpone by at least
five years a plan that could have led to the breaching of four
major Snake River dams for the benefit of wild salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the administration will propose a menu of smaller steps
intended to protect the salmon and other fish that comprise a dozen
endangered species, in part by placing logs along riverbeds to
provide the fish with an illusion of home.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is to be made public next week, was outlined
Wednesday by senior administration officials. It was portrayed as
an alternative to more severe measures that face strong opposition
by elected officials in the Northwest. But the new proposal will
also reverberate across the politically important region.
</P>
<P>
   The dams, in Washington state, are part of a cluster on the
Snake and Columbia river that interrupt the fishes' migratory flow.
But they also generate enormous quantities of electricity, and in
the debate over their fate, the potential cost to consumers of
electricity in the Pacific Northwest has weighed heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee, had already declared his opposition to any
breaching of the dams. By contrast, Vice President Al Gore, the
presumed Democratic nominee, has refused to comment directly about
the issue, despite repeated questions about it during campaign
stops in the region.
</P>
<P>
   An administration move to put off any decision about breaching
the dams could insulate Gore from criticism from environmentalists,
who have argued that more needs to be done sooner to repair the
damage to the habitat of the endangered fish.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions about the fate of the dams are being weighed by a
collection of federal agencies, including the Army Corps of
Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, with the ultimate decision
being made by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has cast himself as an environmentalist, but
a decision made in the name of federal agencies might help to
shield him from attack by those who might seek to portray the
administration as an enemy of economic development.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday morning about the administration's decision,
Gore told reporters in Missouri that he was ``going to bring all of
the parties together to come up with a solution that respects the
environment and does not cause an upheaval in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he agreed with the administration's decision, Gore
side-stepped the issue. ``I'm going to review it carefully. I think
that what's needed is to bring all of the stakeholders together.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, the Gore campaign released a statement from the
vice president that said, in part, ``I feel it provides a solid
foundation for restoring the salmon while strengthening the economy
of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also says that ``if sufficient progress toward
recovery is not being made, we may then have no choice but to
pursue options such as dam breaching. But we must first exhaust all
reasonable alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, news of the postponement prompted concern from Ralph
Nader, the Green Party nominee, who is running well in Washington,
Oregon and other Pacific Northwest states where polls have
indicated a tight race between Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Nader made clear that he was eager to
join the debate. ``Everybody knows the dams cannot be removed
overnight, but you have to move toward that goal,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to postpone any breaching of the Northwest dams was
reported in Wednesday's editions of USA Today. Details were
discussed by administration officials who cited testimony that was
to have been delivered before Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for those sessions, which were postponed,
George Frampton, chairman of the White House Council on
Environmental Quality, tried to explain why the administration had
elected not to recommend that the dams be breached as soon as
possible. Frampton said such efforts ``may not be essential'' to
recovering salmon habitat ``and may not be sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, at least for now, the proposal by the White
House calls for several other measures, including steps aimed at
making it easier for fish to overcome the Snake River dams.
</P>
<P>
   Under the strategy, the progress made by the salmon and other
fish toward recovery is to be monitored over the next five years.
If it is not sufficient to remove the fish from the list of
endangered species, other actions would have to be taken, including
a renewed review of whether to breach the dams.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for American Rivers, an environmental advocacy
group, said it would be watching closely to see whether the
administration's final plan provides adequate guarantees both now
and in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science shows that the dams need to be removed to save
salmon,'' said the spokesman, Justin Hayes. ``And if we delay too
long, salmon runs, and even extinction, are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, administration officials have signaled that a
preferred course might have been a move that would have directed
that the dams be breached.
</P>
<P>
   But such a step would require the approval of Congress,
including members of the Northwest delegations who have been
steadfastly opposed to such an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Without such support, administration officials said Wednesday, a
plan to push forward now with breaching would have been politically
foolish, and could have resulted in years of legislative battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to decide, `let's breach,' you would be setting
yourself up for an enormous fight. So isn't it better to focus your
energy on concrete measures that will have real benefits in the
near term?'' asked an administration official who has played a key
role in the decision-making process.

 &HT;    Services scheduled to mark the passing of Sen. Coverdell
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The body of Sen. Paul Coverdell, who died Tuesday of a
cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 61, will lie in state at the
Georgia Capitol on Friday, his family said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell will be memorialized Saturday at Atlanta's Peachtree
Road United Methodist Church in a ceremony that will draw many of
his Senate colleagues, dignitaries from around the country and much
of the state's political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell will be cremated after Friday's public viewing and his
ashes laid to rest in a private family ceremony after Saturday's
memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after his death, members of Congress eulogized
Coverdell in both the House and the Senate in an outpouring of
remembrance and grief.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate chamber, the sergeant at arms draped a black cloth
over Coverdell's desk and placed a bouquet of white roses, lilies
and freesia on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a heavy cloud hanging over the Senate chamber
today,'' said a somber Arlen Specter (R-Penn.).
</P>
<P>
   And the flood of condolences continued. Peace Corps Director
Mark Schneider called Coverdell one of the agency's finest
directors. ``We thank him for service to our country and his
immeasurable contributions to the cause of peace and freedom around
the world,'' said Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, state flags flew at half-staff. Officials at Georgia
College &AMP; State University in Milledgeville erected a small
memorial to Coverdell at the entrance to the library, where
Coverdell's official papers are housed.
</P>
<P>
   And at the University of Georgia and Morehouse School of
Medicine, officials praised the state's senior senator for his help
in securing federal grants for their institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeying for Coverdell's Senate seat also began behind the
scenes Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans scrambled to develop
short lists of viable candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, who offered the Capitol to Coverdell's family
for the public viewing, declined comment on whom he might name to
succeed Coverdell pending a Nov. 7 special election.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Sen. Richard Russell lay in state at the Capitol
after his death in 1971 and former secretary of state Ben Fortson
was the last person so honored, in 1979.

MARKETPLACE: BANK ONE'S QUARTERLY LOSS FAILS TO SCARE AWAY
INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill.)  By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A quarterly loss of much more than $1 billion was not enough to
scare investors away from the stock of the Bank One Corp.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they bought shares of the bank, which is based in
Chicago, after its new chief executive, James L. Dimon, announced a
$1.91 billion restructuring charge that wiped out the company's
second-quarter profit and left it with a loss of $1.27 billion, or
$1.11 a diluted share. The bank also slashed its dividend in half.
</P>
<P>
   Though the charge was much bigger than analysts had predicted,
Bank One's stock rose $2.625, or 8.8 percent, to $32.625, in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 12 million shares
of Bank One changed hands, making it one of the most active issues
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   After a briefing by Dimon, several analysts increased their
estimates of the bank's future earnings and some raised their
ratings on the stock. Most of them expressed confidence in Dimon's
ability to turn around the troubled bank he took over earlier this
year after he was forced out of the No. 2 job at Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody was convinced. Michael Mayo, an analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston who has been advising clients to sell
Bank One's stock, did not change his rating Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie Dimon gave a good presentation today,'' Mayo said. ``But
you have to realize that this is a battleship to turn around and
Jamie Dimon is not Hercules.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayo raised his estimate of how much Bank One would earn next
year by about 4 percent, to $2.90 a share. At Wednesday's closing
price, that translates to a price-earnings ratio of 11.2.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Chase Manhattan, a consistently profitable and
growing financial-services company, trades for about the same
price-earnings ratio, 11.34. That contrast shows that ``Bank One's
gotten a little ahead of itself,'' Mayo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'd like to see is that the smart ideas that start from
the top translate into progress from the business lines,'' he said.
``The best laid plans don't always translate into sustainable
earnings growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dimon said he had taken the first step toward a
turnaround by writing down the value of some of the bank's assets
and setting aside money to cover future losses. Before taxes, the
charge amounts to $2.94 billion, with $777 million attributed to
the bank's First USA credit card division.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon said he was ``pretty confident'' that the bank would not
have to take more charges to cover the costs of the restructuring,
``but it's not a promise yet.'' He added: ``I've only been here for
three or four months. But I really do feel confident that we
scrubbed pretty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimon said he did not anticipate having to lay off significant
numbers of the bank's 82,500 employees, nor did he intend to sell
the credit card business or Wingspan.com, an Internet-based bank.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon said the bank would reduce employment mainly through
attrition and would focus on reducing nonemployment expenses. He
said the bank hoped to cut those costs by about $500 million a
year. He also announced plans to conserve cash by cutting the
quarterly dividend by 50 percent, to 21 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The bank will try to combine the resources of Wingspan, which it
has run as a freestanding unit, with the online operations of Bank
One and ``try to grow both of them aggressively,'' Dimon said. He
believes Wingspan ``can be positioned differently'' to take better
advantage of Bank One's branch network and other resources, but ``I
can't tell you that strategy will definitely work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Flannigan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said she
had always thought Bank One should hang onto First USA because it
was such a big player in the credit card business and because there
were synergies between it and the bank's other consumer businesses.
``I think Wingspan is a bigger question mark,'' she said,
expressing doubt about the wisdom of having two bank brands on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Flannigan, who kept a ``near term neutral'' rating on the stock,
said Dimon and his team had taken steps that should ensure smooth
profitability in the short run. ``Certainly big upfront charges
have the ability to pave the way for a nice bounce,'' she said.
``But in the long run, can they position this company to be a
standout in an industry that is increasingly competitive?''
</P>
<P>
   May added: ``They face a long haul in getting there. Investors
better be ready for more bumps in the road.''

CLINTON'S TRIP DELAY ANNOYING TO JAPAN 
 

</HEADLINE>
 TRIP-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's decision to cut short a planned
trip to Japan to stay on at the Camp David peace talks will bolster
sentiments this administration does not take its Asian ally
seriously, Japan watchers say.
</P>
<P>
   And by shuffling his schedule at the last minute, Clinton is
doing little to help the political fortunes of his Japanese host,
embattled Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton originally was scheduled to fly to Tokyo Wednesday to
confer with Mori today ahead of Friday's meeting of the Group of
Eight, the seven major industrial powers and Russia on the southern
island of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also was slated to meet in Tokyo with leaders from a
group of Third World nations to discuss issues such as poverty,
AIDS and access to computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   But with peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians at a
critical juncture, Clinton chose to remain at Camp David _ at least
for a day.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers filled in for Clinton
at the economic session with the developing nations. And the White
House announced the session with Mori would be rescheduled during
the summit in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made a judgment that the issues here are
important enough, and the stakes are high enough, that he would
take the extra day to see what additional work could be done,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult decision, because he had an important day
planned in Tokyo,'' Lockhart said. But he noted: ``I think those
who are involved in international affairs in a way like the
Japanese are, as a leader of the world, understand the
responsibilities that international leaders take upon themselves
and the difficult decisions that sometimes have to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the Japanese Embassy in Washington declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, the delay generated some comments in Japan, the
Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before the summit has begun, it feels like we are being
swept aside'' by the United States, complained Fuji Television.
``It is clear where (Clinton's) priority lies,'' TV Asahi added,
noting Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori ``has been studying hard for the
summit. He is disheartened at the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Few outside observers ever expected the summit in Japan would
produce an agreement of truly great consequence. Camp David,
meanwhile, has the potential for lasting import.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Japanese and U.S. trade negotiators reached a deal
to lower the connections American and other foreign telephone
companies would have to pay to compete in the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to hammer Clinton on a
U.S. proposal to build a missile defense system, but the
administration is not ready to negotiate a final deal on that
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the modest expectations, there has been great interest
in the summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese take these summits much more seriously than we
do,'' said Michael Green, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations in Washington and an expert on Japan. ``They don't have
as many areas to present their diplomatic prowess as we do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The general impression in Japan is the Clinton administration
does not take Japan seriously as an ally,'' Green said. ``And the
Japanese are at least half right.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton irked many Japanese in 1998 when he made an extended
trip to China but failed to stop in Japan, while U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright failed to attend a Group of Eight foreign
ministers meeting earlier this month in Miyazaki, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese press has dubbed the phenomenon ``Japan passing,''
Green said. Clinton, however, did manage to assuage Japanese
sensibilities somewhat in June, when he attended the funeral of
former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution here
in Washington, said there has been some friction between Japan and
the Clinton administration. But, he believes ``the relations are in
reasonably good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's successor _ Mori _ is now fighting for his political
life.
</P>
<P>
   With public approval ratings in the single digits, Mori is
widely viewed as a caretaker prime minister, only holding onto
power until after the summit, Mann noted.

SPORTS COLUMN: OPEN TIP FROM A SAGE ... NOT TIGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ He is 68 now. He doesn't caddie anymore,
but every day shortly before noon he is in the Dunvegan Hotel bar,
perched next to the door. With a mischievous smile, he said, ``I
try to get here eight days a week,'' and behind him was a small
brass plate attesting to his stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This chair,'' it read, ``reserved for Tip and his friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of James (Tip) Anderson was a glass of dark rum and a
glass of beer. He sipped each occasionally as he talked about the
Old Course at St. Andrews, where he caddied since he was a lad and
where the 129th British Open begins on Thursday with Tiger Woods a
9-to-4 favorite in the local Ladbrokes betting parlor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Tiger will win,'' this sage of St. Andrews said.
``It's precision here. If you go in the boonker, it's bye-bye
Delilah.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go into some of the 167 boonkers, you have to blast out
sideways, if not backward. And for all his talent, Woods will be
vulnerable to the most dreaded bunkers _ the Coffins on the 13th
hole, the Beardies and the Hell on the 14th, the Principal's Nose
on the 16th, and the Road bunker, shaped like a mine shaft, on the
17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger should keep the driver in the locker room,'' the sage
said. ``He only needs it at 5, 14 and 17. If you drive it too far,
you run out of fairway and you're in the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   When Woods was asked later where he will spurn his driver, he
said: ``It's dependent on the wind. If the wind is blowing on the
first hole dead in your face, I'm going to go driver. Other times
I've hit a chip 3-iron down there and a little sand wedge to the
green.'' And the first, like the 18th, doesn't have even one
boonker.
</P>
<P>
   Tip Anderson, whose nickname was handed down from his father,
Tipper, who put tips on snooker cues, subscribes to the Scottish
tenet, ``If it's nae wind, it's nae golf.'' And it's seldom nae
wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wind is from the east off the North Sea, the course
is more difficult,'' the sage said. ``When it's from the west, it
makes the course easier because then the back nine is downwind.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' caddie, Steve Williams, has been here before, usually
with Raymond Floyd, for both the British Open and the Dunhill Cup
matches. He knows the course. But none of the touring pros' caddies
know it like Tip Anderson, who has collaborated with Desmond
Muirhead to write ``How to Play the Old Course'' (Mainstream,
$23.50).
</P>
<P>
   Anderson caddied in the British Open for 36 years, notably here
for Arnold Palmer in 1960, when Palmer lost to Australia's Kel
Nagle by one stroke, and also when Palmer won at Royal Birkdale in
1961 and Royal Troon in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be another Arnold Palmer,'' the sage said.
``He listened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Old Course's sixth green during a 1960 practice round,
Palmer had a five-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `It's one ball on the right, sir,''' the sage
recalled. ``He missed and said, `Throw it back, Tip.' He missed
again. `Throw it back, Tip.' He missed again. He said, `You gave me
the wrong line, Tip.' I said, `It took me 28 years to find that
out.' He said, `There's no way I'll beat you, Tip,' and I said,
`You got that right.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Palmer didn't enter the 1964 British Open here, he told
Tony Lema to hire Tip, and Lema won.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Tip Anderson, with a tiny Arnold Palmer
umbrella pin on his white Dunvegan Hotel cap, was inducted into the
Professional Caddies Association Hall of Fame at a dinner,
fittingly, at Rusacks Hotel overlooking the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived in St. Andrews all my life except I didn't remember
the first two weeks,'' he said with that smile. ``I forgot to
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he doesn't think Tiger Woods will win here this week, who
will be able to master the Old Course's wind and boonkers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick Price,'' he said. ``He's a very consistent golfer. He
hits the ball far enough and if he holes a few putts, which
everyone's got to do, he'll win. That's just a matter of opinion,
of course.''
</P>
<P>
   The Old Course is only a block away from the Dunvegan, but Tip
Anderson will watch the Open on the telly there from his chair in
the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've seen enough golf,'' he said. ``It took me a long
time to know all this and I still don't know what I'm talking
about, but I can read all the putts on the telly. The third green
is the fastest.''

 &HT;    Services scheduled to mark the passing of Sen. Coverdell
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The body of Sen. Paul Coverdell, who died Tuesday of a
cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 61, will lie in state at the
Georgia Capitol on Friday, his family said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell will be memorialized Saturday at Atlanta's Peachtree
Road United Methodist Church in a ceremony that will draw many of
his Senate colleagues, dignitaries from around the country and much
of the state's political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell will be cremated after Friday's public viewing and his
ashes laid to rest in a private family ceremony after Saturday's
memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after his death, members of Congress eulogized
Coverdell in both the House and the Senate in an outpouring of
remembrance and grief.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate chamber, the sergeant at arms draped a black cloth
over Coverdell's desk and placed a bouquet of white roses, lilies
and freesia on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a heavy cloud hanging over the Senate chamber
today,'' said a somber Arlen Specter (R-Penn.).
</P>
<P>
   And the flood of condolences continued. Peace Corps Director
Mark Schneider called Coverdell one of the agency's finest
directors. ``We thank him for service to our country and his
immeasurable contributions to the cause of peace and freedom around
the world,'' said Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, state flags flew at half-staff. Officials at Georgia
College &AMP; State University in Milledgeville erected a small
memorial to Coverdell at the entrance to the library, where
Coverdell's official papers are housed.
</P>
<P>
   And at the University of Georgia and Morehouse School of
Medicine, officials praised the state's senior senator for his help
in securing federal grants for their institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeying for Coverdell's Senate seat also began behind the
scenes Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans scrambled to develop
short lists of viable candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, who offered the Capitol to Coverdell's family
for the public viewing, declined comment on whom he might name to
succeed Coverdell pending a Nov. 7 special election.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Sen. Richard Russell lay in state at the Capitol
after his death in 1971 and former secretary of state Ben Fortson
was the last person so honored, in 1979.

CNET TO BUY ZIFF-DAVIS FOR $1.6 BILLION IN STOCK

 By GREG WINTER and ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ CNET Networks said Wednesday that it would acquire
Ziff-Davis Inc., a trailblazer in the technology magazine industry,
and its Internet subsidiary, ZDNet, for $1.6 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both companies characterized the deal as an
outgrowth of their ``shared common vision'' to provide online
consumers with critiques of the latest technology, a niche CNET has
exploited to become one of the more profitable Internet companies.
The combined company is expected to be the Internet's
eighth-largest property, with 16.6 million users, roughly 22
percent of the U.S. audience.
</P>
<P>
   The deal signals the degree to which CNET, an upstart in the
days when Ziff-Davis was a formidable presence in the technology
industry, has managed to surpass its main rival, from which it took
many of its cues.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis, the one-time owner of PC Magazine and MacWorld, had
an online presence a decade before CNET. In 1985, long before most
Americans started going online, PC Magazine introduced an
interactive reader service, which evolved into ZDNet by the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   CNET, by contrast, began with a television program on USA
Networks in 1995, followed by its first foray onto the Web a few
months later. But the company quickly went public in 1996, becoming
one of the first Internet companies to do so and beating ZDNet by
three years.
</P>
<P>
   That early offering, analysts say, helped CNET raise the money
to buy 10 companies over the last year alone, including the $700
million purchase in January of MySimon.com, an online
comparison-shopping company.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring ZDNet would give CNET a way to increase its audience
at a time when the Internet is fast approaching saturation,
analysts say. In addition to a widely recognized name, ZDNet is a
leading technology portal in Europe, especially in France, Germany
and Britain, where CNET wants to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're buying additional customers rather than trying to
steal them away,'' said Robert Martin, senior Internet analyst at
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co. ``It's a good way of extending
their lead in market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, CNET would exchange 0.3397 of a share for each
share of Ziff-Davis and 0.5932 of a share for each share of ZDNet,
a separately traded company in which Ziff-Davis is the majority
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis was particularly ripe for acquisition, having become
a shell of the company known for magazines like PC Magazine and
MacWorld, and for putting on Comdex, the computer trade show. Last
year, Softbank, the Japanese investment group that owns a majority
stake in Ziff-Davis, said it intended to sell or spin off the
company's non-Internet components, pursuing its strategy to become
the world's largest Internet investor.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a piecemeal breakup of Ziff-Davis has ensued,
starting with the $204 million sale of its cable television
channel, ZDTV, in November. One month later, the company announced
the sale of its magazine division to Willis Stein &AMP; Partners LP for
$780 million. Then, in March, Ziff-Davis executives disclosed plans
to spin off the company's trade show business in an initial public
offering scheduled for August.
</P>
<P>
   If the offering goes through, Ziff-Davis' remaining assets would
include ZDNet; two technology magazines, Computer Shopper and a
stake in Red Herring; and a Web site, SmartPlanet, all of which
would be included in the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Because many investors see ZDNet and CNET as both catering to
computer consumers, the deal raised concerns that advertisers would
have less incentive to buy space on two Web sites owned by the same
company. Advertising represents about two-thirds of CNET's revenue
and more than 70 percent of ZDNet's income.
</P>
<P>
   The companies tried to assuage these concerns by pointing out
that only 25 percent of their top advertisers overlapped and that
they shared a relatively small percentage of the same users.
Whereas ZDNet provides product information to technology-savvy
computer users, CNET caters to a less sophisticated audience that
is often uncomfortable with highly technical terms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts raised objections to what appeared to be a
deviation from CNET's effort to wean itself of conventional
advertising, like banner ads, a staple in ZDNet's revenue stream.
In recent years, CNET has focused on building its capacity to link
its customers directly to sales of the products it reviews, an
income strategy that many regard as integral to its future, but one
that ZDNet has been slow to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, Ziff-Davis was what CNET was trying to get away
from,'' said Matthew Finick, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners
LLC. ``They're taking a step backward right now.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential sticking point on the deal is content for ZDNet.
When Willis Stein &AMP; Partners bought the magazine division, which
then became Ziff-Davis Media Inc., the companies negotiated a
three-year contract through which the magazines supply content for
ZDNet exclusively. But Wednesday, executives for Ziff-Davis Media,
the sixth-largest magazine publisher in the United States, said
they were still in the dark on what provisions had been made to
extend that contract to CNET once it takes over.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Estroff, a spokeswoman for Ziff-Davis Media, said:
``We have not seen the details of the deal and so it is difficult
to comment about specifics right now. But for now, it's go forward,
business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   But James D. Dunning Jr., one of the partners in the acquisition
of the Ziff-Davis magazines, said, ``We had no contact in this
transaction.'' He added that Dan Rosenzweig, the chief executive of
ZDNet, who will become CNET's president, and Shelby Bonnie, the
chief executive of CNET, both called him Wednesday and had asked
for a meeting to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis executives said they expected Dunning, who has a
reputation as a tough negotiator, to press the two executives for a
better deal. Ziff-Davis Media will receive at least $7 million this
year for letting ZDNet use its content, at least $9 million next
year and at least $11 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Ziff-Davis Media executives said they must sign
off on the final agreement between CNET and ZDNet, so their
satisfaction with the terms is vital to the deal's closing.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of CNET fell $2.5625, or 8 percent, to $29.625 on
Wednesday. Ziff-Davis rose $2.0625, or 18 percent, to $13.4375,
while ZDNet climbed $4, or 31 percent, to $16.875.

HOUSE VOTES TO RAISE LIMITS ON RETIREMENT-PLAN SAVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a surprisingly lopsided margin, the House voted
Wednesday to strengthen retirement savings plans by permitting
larger contributions to them and making it easier to transfer
savings in employer-sponsored plans from job to job.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, passed by 401-25, is intended to encourage
Americans to save more for retirement. Many Democrats objected to
it, saying it would benefit high-income employees but do little to
help low-income workers. Still, just 24 Democrats voted against the
measure, an indication of its broad appeal to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's future appears uncertain, though. For one thing, it
is unclear whether the Senate will have time to take it up before
the end of the current Congress. And the Clinton administration,
sharing the concerns of House Democrats, strongly opposes it. The
administration instead wants legislation that would help those of
more modest income _ many of whom are among the 75 million
Americans not covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans _
rather than those financially able to make contributions above the
current limits.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the House bill, which has the strong backing of some
trade unions, said they hoped its resounding approval Wednesday
would better its chances both in the Senate and at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly I didn't expect such a strong vote,'' said Rep. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio, who co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Benjamin L.
Cardin, D-Md. ``That was an extraordinary vote of confidence. A
strong message is being sent to the Senate and the president that
this House is committed, on a bipartisan basis, to provide more
retirement security this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would raise the amount of money that workers can
contribute to 401(k)'s, individual retirement accounts and other
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, workers can set aside no more than $2,000 a
year in individual retirement accounts. That amount, applying to
both the traditional IRA and the newer Roth IRA, would rise to
$5,000, in phases, by 2003. An exception would be made for those
older than 50, who would be permitted to make a $5,000 contribution
beginning next year. The exception is meant as a catch-up tool for
older workers who may not have saved enough for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In 401(k) plans, which permit workers to set aside savings from
their pay and allow employers to take tax deductions for adding to
those amounts, the annual limit on employee contributions would
rise in phases to $15,000 by 2005, from the current maximum of
$10,500. Again an exception would be made for those older, who
would be permitted to save an extra $5,000 a year. And employers
could contribute as much as 20 percent of a worker's salary, up
from 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of frequent job-hopping, the legislation would also
make it easier for workers to transfer their savings in
employer-sponsored plans from one job to the next. One provision,
for example, would speed employees' ability to become fully vested
in 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill would address a longtime concern of
carpenters, plumbers and other trade workers, whose wages often
fluctuate from year to year, leaving many with less in pension
benefits than they would otherwise receive. Under a 1974 law,
multiple-employer pension plans for trade workers calculate
benefits on the basis of the three consecutive years of highest
pay; the bill would change the basis to the three highest-paid
years, regardless of whether consecutive.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the broader legislation are a desire to spur an
American savings rate that is now at Depression-era lows, and
lawmakers' concern that more needs to be done to supplement Social
Security benefits, particularly since only half of all workers in
the private sector have pensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we must save Social Security, we must remember that
Social Security was never intended to meet all the financial needs
of retirement,'' Cardin said Wednesday. ``Employees need to
understand that they need to take greater responsibility in saving
for retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats, even those who support some aspects of the
bill, complained during the debate that the legislation should do
more to help low- and moderate-income workers. They are the ones
who have the hardest time setting money aside for the future,
Democrats said. As it is, few workers with IRA's and 401(k)'s save
the maximum permitted by law, a point Democrats used to illustrate
that the bill favored the affluent.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing that concern, Democrats offered an amendment, based
on a White House initiative, to provide tax credits to workers of
modest income. For every $2,000 those workers saved, the government
would match it with $1,000. That proposal was rejected Wednesday on
a vote of 221-200.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they also worried that the increased contribution
limits could prompt small businesses to abandon their pension
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is significant data that indicates that the
problem with IRA's is they tend to reward those who already have
the ability to save for retirement,'' said Rep. Richard E. Neal,
D-Mass. ``We want to extend this benefit to low- and
moderate-income workers.''

CUBAN SLUGGER MAKES IT TO U.S. ON SECOND TRY
</HEADLINE>
   (also moving in `a' news file) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Andy Morales, a standout with the Cuban national
baseball team, has succeeded in his second attempt to flee Cuba for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Morales was being interviewed by federal authorities here
Wednesday night after being smuggled with eight others to the
Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Morales is a 25-year-old third baseman who hit a three-run home
run in the Cuban national team's victory over the host Baltimore
Orioles last year. Last month, he was refused asylum along with 30
others after they were intercepted at sea by the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Morales, seven other men and a 16-year-old girl
reached the Marquesas, a group of islands west of Key West. Under
federal rules, Cuban refugees who actually reach U.S. soil are
usually allowed to stay, while those intercepted at sea are
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it to U.S. territory,'' a Border Patrol spokesman,
Joe Mellia, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol interviewed each of the Cubans separately in
its Pembroke Pines, Fla., office, Mellia said, and several said
that they had paid $5,000 each to be smuggled here.
</P>
<P>
   After being interviewed by the Border Patrol, the nine were
taken to a detention center here for questioning by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Guim, a spokesman for Morales' agent, Gus Dominguiz of Los
Angeles, said Morales had been harassed and beaten after he was
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuban security people were following him everywhere,'' Guim
said. Guim said that a week ago, Morales got into ``a little push
and shove'' with three security personnel. ``They pushed him in an
alley and beat the heck out of him,'' Guim said. ``I think that's
probably what broke the camel's back.''

 &HT;    John Lewis quits majority whip race
 &HT;    By Melanie Eversley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Georgia Congressman John Lewis announced Wednesday
night that he is dropping out of the race for majority whip and
acknowledged that he would accept an appointment _ if offered _ to
the Senate seat vacated by Tuesday's death of Sen. Paul Coverdell
(R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   It is up to Gov. Roy Barnes to appoint Coverdell's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who led the Georgia House delegation in emotional
remembrances Wednesday on the floor about Coverdell, stressed that
his announcement about the whip race and his interest in the Senate
appointment were not related. Lewis, in fact, stressed that he and
other members of Congress were still reeling from the sudden loss
of their colleague, who had suffered a stroke over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But, when asked whether he would accept an appointment to the
Senate post, Lewis responded that he would do so ``gladly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who emerged as an icon during the civil rights struggles
of the South and whose seven terms in Congress have made him dean
of the Georgia House delegation, broke the news of his withdrawal
from the whip race in a letter sent to House Democratic colleagues
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout my life, from my earliest days growing up on a farm
outside of Troy, Alabama, to my days and my service in the civil
rights movement through the present day and my service in Congress,
I have always tried to be true to myself. Regardless of the odds, I
have always done what I believe in my heart to be right, to be
just, and to be fair,'' Lewis wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``After several months of campaigning for the post of majority
whip, I have concluded that the votes are simply not there for me.
Therefore, I am writing to inform you of my decision to withdraw
from the contest,'' the two-page letter continued.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Lewis said he had made the decision
several days ago to withdraw from the race and had planned to make
his formal announcement today as a House Democratic Caucus meeting
had been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was in the common good,'' Lewis said, explaining he
did not have the votes to win the race. ``I felt that I should get
out of the race and concentrate on helping take back the House,''
he said of democrats' hopes to regain a majority in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the whip race, Lewis said he would instead place his
support behind candidate Steny Hoyer, a Democratic congressman from
Maryland. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), also is running. Hoyer
could not be reached Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he believed that he and Pelosi took votes from each
other, both sharing many of the same philosophies, and that Pelosi
simply entered the race earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said she was gratified that Lewis would say they both
share the same philosophies because she respects Lewis, and she
predicted that many of his supporters would now stand behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Lewis is highly respected in the Congress, so well-liked,
he was a worthy contender and I wish I had his support,'' Pelosi
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats took back control of the House in the November
general election, the majority whip would be the third in command
in the House, behind the Speaker and the majority leader. It is the
whip's job to round up votes for legislation being pushed by the
majority party.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis were appointed to the Senate, he would become only the
fifth African-American Senator in U.S. history and only the third
in recent history. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts served in the
Senate from 1967 to 1979 and Carol Mosely Braun of Illinois served
one term, from 1993 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, when pressed about the possibility that he could become
one of the few African-American senators in history, said it would
be high time for someone - even if not him - to serve in such a
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time long passed for there to be an
African-American in that body,'' Lewis said. ``The body is 99 white
and one Native American and I think that the time has long passed
for this country to have some African Americans in the U.S.
Senate.''

 &HT;    Members of Congress shaken by Coverdell's death
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ With tears and heavy hearts, members of Congress
mourned Sen. Paul Coverdell on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate business came to a virtual standstill for most of the day
as senator after senator _ some struggling to compose themselves _
took the floor to praise their deceased colleague.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, members adopted a resolution eulogizing
Coverdell's nearly 30 years of public service after delivering
speeches recalling his life, dedication and friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate today is a very sad place, and it's a shaken place
because of the suddenness of Paul's death,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman (D-Conn.), capturing the mood of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's death is the second death of a senator in less then
a year after the passing of Republican John Chafee of Rhode Island
in October, and many senators appeared to take Coverdell's sudden
demise especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   Normally polished speakers suddenly found themselves struggling
for words or choking back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often feel something about people _ we often love people _
but _ but we don't often tell them that,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm
(R-Texas), his eyes red with tears. ``It's especially hard for men
to tell other men that they love them. But what I am happy about _
I can't quite get to it _ is . . . that I realized over a year ago
that Paul Coverdell had become an indispensable member of the
Senate, that he was the greatest senator from Georgia since Richard
Russell. And so I always went to great lengths to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate colleagues praised Coverdell for his civility, his
boundless enthusiasm, his skill at helping move complex bills to
passage and his ability to mediate disputes in a body of 100
oversized egos. Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) said Coverdell reached out
to help him when he joined the Senate in 1997, just as they had
tried to help each other when serving together in the state Senate
nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on different sides of the aisle, different sides of
the issues, but he helped me learn,'' Cleland said. ``He helped me
because he was a good man and a great friend, and because he knew
what was good for Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats praised Georgia's senior senator for the courtesy and
good will that he extended to them during the many difficult
political battles they faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of too many times he and I found ourselves on
the same side of a debate,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.), ``but I can't think of a single time that he was
not fair, that he was not decent, and that he was not honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said Coverdell possessed the rare
quality of being able to disagree ``without being disagreeable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time when we see our legislative branches becoming more
and more partisan, more and more separated by imaginary aisles that
separate, we can think back and remember that Paul Coverdell was a
person who was willing to work with anyone who was willing to work
with him in order to accomplish legislation that was in the
interest of this whole country,'' said Sen. John Breaux (D-La.).
</P>
<P>
   Senators quoted Scripture, the Romantic poets, former presidents
and statesmen as they searched for ways to express their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) said he preferred to visualize
Coverdell on Cloud Nine, standing with St. Peter: ``So, Paul, if
that's you who I think I'm looking at on Cloud Nine, you know that
we're missing you and that we are so dearly grateful for the years
that we had to enjoy working with you. I have a notion that the
Lord will be blessing you for being his good and faithful servant
while you were amongst us.''

CUBAN SLUGGER MAKES IT TO U.S. ON SECOND TRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (also moving in `s' news file) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Andy Morales, a standout with the Cuban national
baseball team, has succeeded in his second attempt to flee Cuba for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Morales was being interviewed by federal authorities here
Wednesday night after being smuggled with eight others to the
Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Morales is a 25-year-old third baseman who hit a three-run home
run in the Cuban national team's victory over the host Baltimore
Orioles last year. Last month, he was refused asylum along with 30
others after they were intercepted at sea by the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Morales, seven other men and a 16-year-old girl
reached the Marquesas, a group of islands west of Key West. Under
federal rules, Cuban refugees who actually reach U.S. soil are
usually allowed to stay, while those intercepted at sea are
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it to U.S. territory,'' a Border Patrol spokesman,
Joe Mellia, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol interviewed each of the Cubans separately in
its Pembroke Pines, Fla., office, Mellia said, and several said
that they had paid $5,000 each to be smuggled here.
</P>
<P>
   After being interviewed by the Border Patrol, the nine were
taken to a detention center here for questioning by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Guim, a spokesman for Morales' agent, Gus Dominguiz of Los
Angeles, said Morales had been harassed and beaten after he was
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuban security people were following him everywhere,'' Guim
said. Guim said that a week ago, Morales got into ``a little push
and shove'' with three security personnel. ``They pushed him in an
alley and beat the heck out of him,'' Guim said. ``I think that's
probably what broke the camel's back.''

WILLIAM WHYTE, A GANG SOCIOLOGIST, DIES AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Mass.)  (Eds: Spelling Davydd in fifth graf is cq.) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William F. Whyte, a sociologist with a passion for reform who
wrote ``Street Corner Society,'' the trailblazing 1943 study of
Italian-American gangs in the North End of Boston, died Sunday in
Ithaca, N.Y. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte was a professor emeritus of sociology at Cornell
University. In all, he wrote 20 influential books. But his first,
``Street Corner Society,'' was the keystone of his career.
Translated into Chinese, Japanese, German, French, Italian and
Spanish, the book sold more than 270,000 copies, making it one of
the best-selling sociology books in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street Corner Society'' and the unusual methods that Whyte
used to research it established his reputation as an innovative
sociologist. He spent more than a year living with an
Italian-American family in the North End slums and hanging out with
gang members, watching them gamble, fight and flirt. He also guided
them to organize demonstrations to get City Hall to pump more money
into the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte championed this methodology, which he called
``participatory action research,'' asserting that he could maintain
his objectivity while sometimes nudging his subject in the
direction of reform. But many academics questioned his methods,
calling for more passive, more objective observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``His practice of social science was really aimed at social
reform and social change,'' said Davydd Greenwood, a professor of
anthropology at Cornell. ``He never accepted the notion that social
science should be a purely academic profession.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Whyte was hired as one of the first professors at the
new Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
Over the next three decades, until he took emeritus status in 1979,
Whyte was one of the school's most influential faculty members, an
outspoken liberal who frequently called for empowering the
disenfranchised and narrowing the gap between the rich and the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   With his unusual methodology, highly personalized writing and
political tilt, Whyte had a major influence on sociologists,
anthropologists, social psychologists and professors of industrial
relations. He wrote a widely followed how-to text for social
science researchers called ``Learning From the Field: A Guide From
Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   His other books focused on areas as diverse as restaurants in
Chicago, oil fields in Oklahoma, peasant villages in Peru and
worker-owned cooperatives in Mondragon, a town in the Basque
country of Spain. Whyte usually analyzed the connections betweeen
social organization and work performance, often collaborating with
economists and political scientists.
</P>
<P>
   William Foote Whyte was born on June 27, 1914, in Springfield,
Mass., the only child of John Whyte, a professor of German, and
Caroline Van Sickle. He grew up in the Bronx, Caldwell, N.J., and
Bronxville, N.Y. He showed an early proclivity for research while
still in high school in Bronxville, reporting for The Bronxville
Press and writing numerous columns on the town's elementary
schools.
</P>
<P>
   After spending a year in Germany with his father, he enrolled in
Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, where he majored in economics,
graduating in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year he became a junior fellow at Harvard University,
enabling him to take any course he wanted there. In his
autobiography, ``Participant Observer,'' he expressed ambivalence
about Harvard's academic ambience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis on science and scholarship did not offend me, but
I was struck by the absence of any reference to an obligation to
make our learning useful to society,'' he wrote. ``I said nothing,
but I continued to wrestle over a way to reconcile my research
interests with my social welfare concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1937, while at Harvard, Whyte began research on the
book that would make his name, renting a third-story room in the
North End, then one of the city's worst slums. He stayed with the
Orlandi family, who ran the Capri Restaurant, and he grew friendly
with one gang member who become his entree into gang society. By
going to pool halls and gambling clubs, Whyte learned about the
skills needed to become a gang leader.
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded Harvard to give a $100 grant to a high school
dropout and gang member, Angelo ``Ralph'' Orlandella, who served as
his research assistant.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Whyte tells of taking a North End girl to
a church dance one evening and then accompanying her home, a move
that in neighborhood tradition meant he intended to marry her. He
vowed never to do that again.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1938 he married a longtime acquaintance, Kathleen King,
and they soon moved into a renovated apartment in the North End,
where he completed research for ``Street Corner Society.'' His
wife, a commercial artist, edited several of his books and was
co-author of his book on worker cooperatives in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street Corner Society'' served as Whyte's thesis at the
University of Chicago, where he obtained a doctorate in sociology.
The book, first published by the University of Chicago Press, was
little noticed at first, but sales of the second edition, published
in 1950, took off, partly because it contained many frank details
previously left out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Whyte began teaching sociology at the University of
Oklahoma, and the next year Harvard offered him a position teaching
Army veterans and doing further research on Italian-American
community life. But that job never materialized because he
contracted polio in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   He, his wife and two young children spent a year at the Warm
Springs Foundation in Georgia, where he learned to walk with a
cane. He spent many years in leg braces and later did his field
work with the aid of crutches or a cane.
</P>
<P>
   From 1944 to 1948 he taught at the University of Chicago, and
then moved to Ithaca to spend the rest of his teaching career at
Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Whyte is survived by two daughters, Joyce Wiza
of Manchester, N.H., and Lucy Whyte Ferguson of Taos, N.M.; two
sons, Martin King Whyte of Silver Spring, Md., and John Whyte of
Philadelphia; 12 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.

IN POLITICS, AS IN EVERYTHING ELSE, BUSH PLACES PREMIUM ON
LOYALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Walk through Gov. George W. Bush's campaign
headquarters here and you encounter a remarkable sight: virtually
the same lineup of senior advisers that he had a year ago and, at
the uppermost echelon of the operation, an inner circle of trusted
friends that is wholly intact from the days when Bush won his first
race for Texas governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to these advisers and you hear something equally
arresting: unvarying, self-effacing odes to the governor's talents
that attribute all credit for the campaign's successes to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly acknowledged disagreements? Leaks? These are almost
nonexistent in Bush world, because most of the people who are
allowed to enter it have declared or demonstrated their loyalty, an
ethos as precious to Bush as any other, the coin of his political
realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loyalty is the No. 1 criterion for him,'' said one Republican
official who has known Bush for more than a decade. ``He would have
loyalty over any other skill or characteristic in the people around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush, the de facto Republican presidential nominee, nears the
announcement of who his running mate will be, unanswered questions
continue to swirl around what type of political and professional
pedigree that person will have. But Bush and his advisers have made
clear that one of the litmus tests the person will have passed is
that he or she can be utterly faithful to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, most Republican operatives chalk up Sen. John
McCain or Arizona, a political maverick who loves the spotlight, as
an improbable selection, even if his publicly stated lack of
interest could be overcome and even though his presence on the
ticket could be a powerful lure for independent and swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma has maintained his
position as one of the most-talked-about contenders largely because
his mild manner and long friendship with Bush suggest that he would
never try to contradict, usurp or eclipse the Texas governor,
Republican officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the standards of politics, where discretion is always
desired, Bush places an extremely high premium on loyalty, and it
drives many of his important decisions, helping to determine who
gets his ear, who gets the top jobs around him and the terms of
their relationships with him. Many of the senior people in his
campaign had proven their commitment to Bush by forswearing other
political allegiances or taking low salaries. Others had long
histories with the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   At Bush's request, his chief strategist, Karl Rove, sold his
independent consulting business so that his attention to the
candidate would be undivided. Maverick Media, the advertising firm
that produces Bush's television commercials, was brought into
existence solely for the purpose of the Bush campaign and has no
clients other than Bush, an unusual arrangement in presidential
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview aboard his campaign plane on Tuesday, Bush said
that what he had tried to do was build an efficient team, and that
loyalty was its glue, binding people together so that they could
focus on common goals without fear that colleagues would work
against their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disloyal person in the wrong position can undermine an
administration,'' said Bush, seemingly alluding to the lessons that
his friends and advisers said he learned from watching his father,
former President George Bush, prevail when the lieutenants around
him were true and struggle when they were not.
</P>
<P>
   But several political analysts said that there was a potential
downside to Bush's penchant for loyalists. One Republican
strategist questioned whether Bush received advice that was tough
and critical enough and whether he exposed himself to a wide enough
range of opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a single decision made by this campaign that
looked to me like they had to force the candidate to do it,'' said
the strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``That's not
necessarily a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican official, describing Bush's closest advisers,
observed: ``I've never seen a campaign where people don't sit
around and psychoanalyze the guy. They never do that, even if
you're having a drink with them. They never call him anything other
than governor, and they never say anything even remotely close to
disparaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say that their united public front should never
be mistaken for a private acquiescence to his wants and whims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel absolutely free to disagree with him,'' said Karen P.
Hughes, the campaign's director of communications. Other advisers
said that they, too, spoke their minds around Bush, but that the
vigorous debates behind closed doors stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes and other advisers said that Bush had earned their
loyalty, supporting them as strongly as they support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lost New Hampshire by 20 points,'' Hughes said,
referring to the Republican primary, ``the easy thing for him to
do, to silence the critics, would have been to give them a
sacrificial lamb. He didn't do that. He said, `We're in this
together.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters aboard his campaign plane recently, Bush
said, ``There was never any question in my mind'' about replacing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are friends,'' he said. ``I know they're there for the
right reason.''

 AUSTIN, Texas: right reason.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Bush struggled in the primaries to turn back the
insurgency of McCain, some analysts speculated that he would turn
to a conventionally seasoned political operative to supplement the
so-called iron triangle _ Rove, Hughes and Joe Allbaugh, the
campaign manager _ who had also guided Bush's career in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush asked one of his best and oldest friends, Donald
L. Evans, an oil and gas company executive, to be the campaign
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The tightness and endurance of Bush's advisers stand in contrast
to the gyrations in Vice President Al Gore's operation, which Bush
has monitored with a disapproving eye. During a taping of the
television news program ``Hardball with Chris Matthews'' a month
and a half ago, Bush predicted that Gore's campaign chairman, Tony
Coelho, would not survive Gore's persistent disadvantage in most
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to dump him,'' Bush told Matthews during a
commercial break. ``Mark my words. Oh, they'll dump him. There's no
loyalty in those guys.'' (Coelho later stepped down after being
hospitalized with an inflamed colon.)
</P>
<P>
   The unity of the Bush team differs as well from the revolving
door that afflicted Bob Dole's presidential campaign four years
ago, and it has enabled Bush to keep the news coverage of his
campaign focused on the policies he is unveiling or the voters he
is courting.
</P>
<P>
   It also reflects Bush's lingering ire over the behavior of some
aides and allies during his father's failed re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that when the going got tough, ``I saw them jumping
out the windows in 1992, looking for the next campaign. And that
influenced me. Yeah, that influenced me. I worry that some may be
wanting to be involved in my campaign to enhance their consulting
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that Bush also learned to value loyalty from the
example of his father, who swallowed ideological differences with
Ronald Reagan to serve as his vice president from 1980 to 1988. In
1988, after his father was elected to the presidency, George W.
Bush was asked to head a committee with the task of making sure
that people who had helped his father win were not overlooked for
jobs in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. opened the meeting by saying, `The purpose of this
occasion is not to punish our enemies but to identify our
friends,''' recalled Chase Untermeyer, who became the director of
personnel in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And friends are not being forgotten _ or forgetting the Bushes.
Condoleezza Rice, a Russia specialist on the National Security
Council during the Bush administration, is George W. Bush's chief
foreign policy adviser. Richard B. Cheney, the defense secretary
under former President Bush, is supervising the process by which
his son selects a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Texas governor discusses these teammates, the words
loyal or loyalty are bound to pop up, as they do even when he talks
about the less political people in his life.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview about his wife, Laura, Bush said:
``The other thing about Laura is that she's fiercely loyal. She's
loyal to me. She's loyal to my dad. She's loyal to her children.''
It was clear, in the tone of his voice, that there was no praise
any higher. &QL;

SAKS FIFTH AVENUE SPLITS FROM PARENT
</HEADLINE>
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The answer to the question of whether a country
peasant can marry a Park Avenue swell and live happily ever after
appears to be no.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Inc., previously called Proffitt's, with headquarters in
Birmingham, Ala., announced late Wednesday that less than two years
after it acquired Saks Fifth Avenue and renamed itself, its board
had approved a plan to split again into two separate public
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The spun-off entity will be called Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises
Inc. and will include the luxury-oriented stores of Saks Fifth
Avenue; the Saks Direct, which includes catalog and Internet
operations; and Saks Off Fifth, its upscale outlet business. Saks
Inc. will retain the rest of the department store business _
including regional department stores like Proffitt's, McRae's and
Parisan _ and will eventually be renamed. Shareholders are expected
to receive one share of Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises common stock
for every three shares of Saks Inc. stock they own.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Proffitt's-Saks merger in September 1998, skepticism
abounded about the logic of combining mid-market department stores,
which rely on staple brands like Liz Claiborne and Levi's, and the
tony retailer, best known for such offerings as Prada and Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts and consultants argued that the businesses were
too dissimilar to produce real benefits and accused the company
chairman, R. Brad Martin, of being blinded by his desire to own a
upscale property _ with the opportunities to hobnob with socialites
and celebrity designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake to buy Saks Fifth Avenue,'' said Robert F.
Buchanan, a retail analyst at A.G. Edwards, ``and it makes sense to
undue the mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers who counted on Saks stores to showcase their newest
creations also worried that the corporation was running the upscale
emporium like a mundane department store _ starving it of necessary
resources for inventory, remodeling and staff training to hit its
financial targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger went off because there was a lack of understanding
on what it takes to run a first-class luxury operation,'' said
Arnold Aronson, a former Saks Fifth Avenue chief executive. ``It is
better that the realization came late rather than never.''
</P>
<P>
   The spin-off is clearly a bid to improve Saks Inc. sagging stock
price. Before acquiring Saks Holdings and changing its name,
Proffitt's was an industry leader in buying businesses at a rapid
pace and making them profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the purchase, it became apparent that the former
Proffitt's had hit a block in integrating the disparate parts of
its empire. Last summer, the company said it would miss earnings
estimates for the fiscal year 2000 by a mile, in part because of
disappointing growth in its credit business and because of
lower-than-anticipated revenue growth at Mercantile Stores, a chain
of bargain-priced apparel stores that it bought from Dillard's Inc.
in 1998. Then this spring, sales were lower than anticipated in the
department stores, and the company on Wednesday forecast an
operating loss for its fiscal second quarter, ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Inc. had already missed earnings estimates for three
quarters in a row, and its stock price has crumbled by more than 50
percent since the merger was announced. The stock gained 68.75
cents, to $12.50, on Wednesday ahead of the spinoff announcement,
which came after the financial markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
   The company stopped just short of saying that the purchase had
been a mistake but acknowledged that winning Wall Street's favor
was a motivating factor in the plan announced on Wednesay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will let others critique whether I lost my focus,'' Martin
said, but this deal was necessary ``to get the appropriate focus on
each business as well as the appropriate capital structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two new companies, Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises appears
to be in stronger shape, stock analysts said. Because of a booming
economy, the luxury market has been soaring, and sales at Saks
Fifth Avenue have been growing at roughly 10 percent a year. The
prospects for Saks Inc. and the midlevel department stores in
general seem grimmer, reflected Wednesday in the news that Martin
will eventually relinquish his position with the department store
group to remain on as chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises,
although he will continue to own a stake in both.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Miller will continue as chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue,
and Christina Johnson will continue as president and chief
executive of the Saks Fifth Avenue stores division. The department
store group will start a search for a new chief executive.

SEEING BUSH VULNERABLE ON STATE BUDGET, GORE WILL VISIT TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: this story, held earlier, is now restored) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAYTOWN, Mo. _ Seizing what he views as a golden chance to
pierce the heart of Gov. George W. Bush's campaign, Vice President
Al Gore said Wednesday that he would ride into Bush's backyard in
Texas on Thursday to highlight the state's budget woes.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore entourage had planned to travel from Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, back to Washington, but Wednesday morning Gore announced that
he was diverting his campaign to San Antonio for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign can hardly contain its glee over the daily
headlines out of Texas describing a budget shortfall and its
attendant problems. It campaign can be expected to hit the air with
television commercials on the subject soon, and will exploit the
budget problems for maximum publicity for some time to come,
particularly as a competing story line with the Bush campaign in
the days leading up to the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that how the governor runs Texas says important
things about how he'd run the country,'' said Mark Fabiani, a
spokesman for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani said the Gore team perceives the Texas budget shortfall
as politically devastating for Bush as the pollution of Boston
Harbor was to Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts when he ran for
president in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a surprising weakness,'' Fabiani said. ``The thing that
hurt Governor Dukakis the most is that people thought a Democratic
governor ought to be strong on the environment, and when questions
were raised about the harbor it undermined one of his strengths. If
a Republican governor can't effectively manage his state budget in
a period of tremendous prosperity, it is just as bad. This is his
Boston Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters Wednesday night that the Boston Harbor
comparison ``never crossed my mind.'' But when asked whether he
hoped his attacks on Bush would be as effective as the attacks on
Dukakis, he did not answer directly. Instead, he criticized the
administration of Bush's father, which he said ``squandered'' money
on a tax cut that could have been used on a cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   There is a special irony for the Gore campaign in being able to
turn the Boston Harbor strategy so forcefully against Bush since
his father, in seeking the presidency in 1988, had turned Boston
Harbor into a weapon against Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has already been using bits of this strategy
by pointing to a variety of problems in Texas, but the vice
president's advisers said the budget offered a graphic opportunity
to bring various threads of the Texas story together. These
threads, as Gore described them Wednesday, run from Bush's
``unaffordable tax cuts for powerful interests, coupled with vague
promises that the numbers will somehow add up in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   One Gore aide exclaimed, ``It's a metaphor for everything!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The announcement of Gore's trip to Texas comes amid growing
fights among Texas lawmakers and public officials over the state's
budget. Earlier this week Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander
announced that the state would see an estimated $1.1 billion
surplus _ more than enough, she said, to pay for the estimated $610
million in cost overruns that has pushed the state over budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a shortfall,'' said Rylander, who will release a
final figure for the surplus on Friday. ``There are budgeting
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she made the announcement to reassure Wall Street
investors. But Democrats questioned the timing of Rylander's
announcement of the surplus, noting that the comptroller usually
projects revenue at the end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a bunch of bull,'' said state Sen. Mario
Gallegos, D-Houston. ``I think she released it early not because of
ratings from Wall Street, but because of the ratings that George W.
Bush is getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy became public last week when state budget
officials confirmed that unanticipated cost overruns, particularly
in Medicaid and in state prisons, had thrown the state $610 million
over budget. Bush's aides quickly responded that cost overruns were
routine during any two-year budget cycle, and that the surplus
would more than make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   But several Texas Democrats are pouncing on the issue, blaming
the $1.7 billion in tax cuts championed by Bush for the shortfall,
and portraying the governor as having put short-term political
interests ahead of the state's fiscal stability.
</P>
<P>
   An internal memorandum leaked from the Texas Department of
Health has only fueled the controversy by predicting that Medicaid
shortfalls alone could reach $633 million by Aug. 31, 2001.
Ultimately, the Legislature must approve an emergency appropriation
next year to keep the state in the black.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden scrutiny of the Texas budget has also focused
attention on the $84 million in the state's Rainy Day Fund, an
account established in the 1980s after the oil boom ran out of
steam. Dick Lavine of the Center for Public Policy Priorities in
Austin said the Rainy Day Fund, as it stands, could pay for state
government services for about 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesman, Dan Bartlett, said that the Rainy Day Fund had
only $8 million when Bush took office in 1995 and that the account
has since grown tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been mentioning Bush's budget problems every day since
the issue emerged last Friday, although his main focus has been
another set topic.
</P>
<P>
   At the City Hall in Raytown, where he announced a proposal to
help local communities hire 10,000 more prosecutors, Gore began
with a minor tutorial on the Texas budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several days ago, we learned that under Governor Bush's
leadership, Texas has suddenly gone from its biggest budget surplus
ever to a budget shortfall, the most serious budget problem in
almost a decade,'' Gore said in a speech at the City Council
chamber here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we learn at a time of national prosperity _ indeed, the
longest economic boom in the history of America _ that Texas has
saved less for the future than almost every other state in
America,'' Gore continued. ``The state's so-called Rainy Day Fund
could barely withstand a drizzle. It's now so small that by this
fall there will be only enough money to run the Texas state
government for a single day. You know, there'd be a real problem if
Texas had a rainy season.''

ALICE LORD LANDON, OLYMPIC SWIMMER, DIES AT 98 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alice Lord Landon, a pioneer in women's swimming and diving who
was a presence on the American Olympic scene for eight decades,
died July 13 at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 98.
</P>
<P>
   At age 13, Alice Lord swam nine miles across Long Island Sound.
At 18, she was a platform diver on the first U.S. women's swimming
team in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   At 82, she led the procession of American athletes at the Los
Angeles Olympics, wearing a replica of her uniform from the 1920
Games at Antwerp, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   And at 94, she carried the torch for the Atlanta Games when it
moved through Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice was the grande dame of the Olympians,'' said Dorothy
Franey Langkop, honorary executive director of U.S. Olympians, an
association of former competitors that the diver and her husband,
the Olympic high-jump champion Dick Landon, helped found in the
mid-1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Landon was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of
Fame at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   She was evidently the oldest female American Olympian, according
to the U.S. Olympic Committee. Hal Prieste, 103, who won a diving
bronze medal for the United States in 1920, is listed as the oldest
living American Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Brooklyn and then Westchester County, N.Y., Alice
Lord was encouraged by her father to pursue physical fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother and I walked 20 miles a day,'' she would recall.
``I swam distance, going a little further and faster every day, but
not for competition. I wasn't working to make the Olympics, because
I didn't know what the Olympics were.''
</P>
<P>
   She began competing with the newly formed Women's Swimming
Association of New York, which dominated the emerging sport. But
diving conditions were primitive. The practice pools were often
only 6 feet deep, forcing Alice to snap forward quickly and cup her
hands after entering the water to keep her head from hitting the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Competing at the 1920 Games, she was handicapped by the lack of
a coach and failed to make the finals in platform diving. But her
teammates from the Women's Swimming Association of New York were
among the stars of the Games. Aileen Riggin Soule, now 94, won the
gold medal in springboard diving, and Ethelda Bleibtrey captured
three golds in swimming to lead an American women's sweep.
</P>
<P>
   On the boat going to Antwerp, Alice Lord met Dick Landon, and
the high jumper and the diver were married two years later in a
burst of publicity over their Olympic romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got so tired of answering how we met,'' she remembered long
afterward. ``Finally he answered that we met in midair: He was
going up and I was going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Landon remained active in the Olympic movement. She was an
official of U.S. Olympians, held the starter's gun for women's
swimming in the Olympic trials during the 1920s and 1930s, helped
choose team uniforms and raised money for the U.S. squads.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Bunny McMunn of Ormond Beach; two
grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and one
great-great-grandchild. Her husband died in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Although she promoted the Olympic movement, Lord Landon spoke
out on its blemishes. She believed that the Olympic ideal of
placing participation above winning was violated when winners were
honored but losers were forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creed is fine,'' she said. ``It hasn't always been lived
up to.'' &QL;

   THURMONT, Md. _ Hurtling toward a tension-crackling midnight
deadline, the Camp David peace summit seemed on the verge of either
a final breakthrough or a final breakdown as President Clinton kept
the Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the presidential retreat
well into Wednesday evening, determined to press for an agreement
until it was no longer worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to address the nation before boarding a
plane for Japan sometime in the early morning hours of Thursday.
After a high-tension day of rapidly shifting moods, it remained
until the end unclear whether he would be pronouncing an end to a
bitter, 52-year conflict, announcing a partial solution or
proclaiming an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Making an all-out effort to retrieve what looked like a failing
meeting, Clinton shuttled between the Israeli and Palestinian
leaders, fended off an Israeli initiative to leave early and
returned repeatedly to his advisers and to the negotiators in
search of a formula that would save the summit.
</P>
<P>
   During the nine-day summit, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel
and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, dealt with every issue
at stake in their conflict _ from borders and the fate of Jewish
settlements to the right of return of Palestinian refugees and the
status of Jerusalem. But it was unclear on Wednesday whether the
ultimate stumbling block was a single issue, like Jerusalem, or the
trade-offs needed to fashion an overall agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Each side was gearing up to lay the blame for a failed summit
squarely on the purported bad faith of the other party. Each leader
appealed privately to Clinton in letters written in the last 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of the high-stakes day see-sawed. At midday, it seemed
certain that the talks were fizzling out. By early evening, when
the parties were still entrenched at Camp David and a tentatively
scheduled final press conferences were postponed, it seemed
possible that Clinton would be able to pull out an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The day started out with a tension-crackling midnight deadline,
which would allow Clinton to depart for Japan by early Thursday
morning, a departure he had already delayed by a day in a final bid
to rescue the summit.
</P>
<P>
   But it built to an unexpectedly quick first climax, when the
Israeli journalists accompanying Barak were ordered in the
afternoon to rush to their hotels for a security check so that
their luggage could be shuttled to Andrews Air Force Base for an 8
p.m. departure for Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock ran down, expectations were rife that there had
been a breakdown. Israeli television revealed, and an American
official later confirmed, that Barak had sent a letter to Clinton.
The letter, Israeli television said, announced the prime minister's
departure and laid the blame for the summit's failure on the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian side is conducting negotiations insincerely
and is not willing to negotiate in a serious and practical manner
for a permanent peace between us,'' an Israeli reporter cited as a
direct quotation from the letter.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a done deal or non-deal but a senior Palestinian
negotiator, Abu Mazen, who himself was heading to the airport to
fly home to his son's wedding, brushed off what he saw as an
eleventh-hour Israeli tactic to increase pressure on the
Palestinians. Talks were ongoing, he said, and the fate of
Jerusalem, a seemingly intractable issue, was still on the table.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington reporters were told that Clinton, by himself,
might address reporters at the White House at 6 p.m., and that
Barak, by himself, would speak shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a 5:30 briefing at the Thurmont Elementary School some
five miles from Camp David, an announcement by Joe Lockhart, the
White House spokesman, gave the final day an extended lease on
life.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than confirming that the hopes for an agreement had
pretty much faded away, Lockhart told reporters instead that the
summit had reached a ``pivotal moment.'' Clinton, he said, was busy
``exploring every possible avenue'' for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been going at this now non-stop for nine days in this
session,'' Lockhart said. ``I think we've obviously reached a
pivotal moment in these talks and I can't predict how it will come
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that as he spoke, Clinton was sitting down at the
retreat's Birch Cabin to his second face-to-face session on
Wednesdaywith the Arafat. Clinton had met with Barak earlier in the
day, but in what observers considered a sign of trouble, the two
Middle East leaders remained apart all day as the American
president shuttled between them.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the changing dynamic of refreshed momentum, Israeli
journalists returned to the press filing center, where one, Keren
Neubach, announced breathlessly that their bags were being returned
from the Air Force base to the Hampton Inn where they were staying.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton also received a letter from Arafat,
which arrived first, on Tuesday. He did not characterize its
contents, but Palestinian officials said that Arafat had reached a
peak of frustration on the eighth day.
</P>
<P>
   If news of the letters lowered expectations of a deal, Lockhart
reported that Clinton had managed by late afternoon to keep the
leaders from walking out. ''They are still there, they are all
still talking,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   When Lockhart described Clinton's last-dash effort to save the
situation, he made clear that the two leaders were having trouble
making concessions on deeply emotional issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders both want to go home with an agreement,'' Lockhart
said. ``The problem is the substance and structure of the
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the extended deadline would have to stand.
``There comes a time when you have to put a time limit on
discussions,'' he said.

CLINTON TRIES TO SALVAGE PEACE TALKS 
 

</HEADLINE>
 TALKS-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton made a last-ditch effort
Wednesday to salvage a Middle East peace deal at the Camp David
summit, as the Israeli and Palestinian delegations prepared to
leave for home without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton planned to
negotiate through the night if necessary. But he acknowledged that
neither Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak nor Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat were speaking to each other, a signal that there
would likely be no comprehensive deal struck before Clinton leaves
today for the Group of Eight economic summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked very hard to find a path to an agreement. At
this point in time, we have not reached that,'' Lockhart told
reporters during an evening briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Clinton's 11th hour efforts as a ``pivotal moment in
these talks,'' he said the president still hoped to fashion some
kind of pact addressing the thorny issues of Palestinian statehood,
the final status of Jerusalem, the fate of refugees and Israeli
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   But he indicated that Clinton would likely declare the talks
``over'' around midnight if both sides rejected a final round of
U.S. proposals dealing with the division of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian sources reportedly told Reuters new service that one
of those proposals called for shared control in one part the Old
City of Jerusalem. The Palestinians would also win sovereignty over
some areas outside the city boundaries. But Israel would maintain
sovereignty over the remaining areas of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Reuters report, Arafat was given a deadline of
midnight Wednesday by Clinton to make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart went on to describe the negotiations unfolding at the
presidential mountain retreat five miles from here as ``very
difficult'' and said Clinton had no plans to delay his trip to the
economic summit any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to have left on Wednesday for Japan, but he
postponed the trip by one day in hopes of persuading both sides to
compromise on their hard-line positions.
</P>
<P>
   Given the apparent intransigence of both sides, a grim-looking
Lockhart said, ``I don't think anyone sees any value in staying on
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared to dismiss suggestions that Clinton might try
to reconvene meetings with the two leaders when he returns from
Japan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our point, we've certainly made it clear that this is the
summit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton struggled to hold things together, he made a series
of telephone calls to other leaders in the Middle East to update
them on the talks and to sound them out on possible avenues left
unexplored that might convince Arafat and Barak to strike a deal.
But by late Wednesday night, there was no evidence that any of his
conversations had yielded a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, both Barak and Arafat spent most of the day
threatening to walk out, as Clinton shuttled back and forth between
them trying to convince them that a deal was still possible.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his best efforts, it appeared late Wednesday night
that he would be unable to convince the two sides to settle the key
issue that has confounded the negotiations all along _ whether the
Palestinians will be allowed to reclaim the areas of East Jerusalem
that were captured and annexed by the Israelis in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are demanding that they be given sovereignty
over East Jerusalem, which they plan to designate as the capital of
a future Palestinian state. But the Israelis have insisted on
maintaining sovereignty over the entire holy city while granting
limited control of certain areas of East Jerusalem to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, neither Barak nor Arafat seemed ready to budge from
their stands. &QL;

COWBOYS TRYING TO FIND TWO CORNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ You notice it most as the players make their
post-practice walk to the locker room, and the fans stacked 10 deep
behind a chain-link fence begin their daily ritual of begging for
autographs. And if not a signature, just a glance or a wave.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The frenzied screams of ``Emmitt ... Emmitt'' and ``Troy ...
Troy'' haven't changed in a decade of summers.
</P>
<P>
   But what's been very different this week are the quick pauses of
near silence as the adoring public hurriedly scans roster sheets,
trying to match names with jersey numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, star power is on the decline for the Cowboys.
Suddenly gone are a Michael, a Deion and a Moose, all of whom could
touch off near-riot conditions on the other side of the fence at
Midwestern State University.
</P>
<P>
   You still hear a lot of ``Dat,'' as Dat Nguyen remains extremely
popular, but a puzzled ``who's that?'' has now become a constant
and daily end-of-practice buzz by the fandom. The face of the
Cowboys is changing drastically, and so is ring-finger jewelry.
Only nine players remain from the last Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to this new era of metallic-blue mystery men,
Mike Zimmer will be dealing with it constantly this summer, and
into the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer is the new defensive coordinator under Dave Campo, and
the former long-time secondary coach. The one most up-for-grabs
position on the team is cornerback. The Cowboys are looking for not
one, but two starters, and this duo must be found from a list of
Brand X candidates.
</P>
<P>
   For many, this will be considered the logical fallout from the
departure of Deioness. For many, replacing the Nine-Toed wonder
will be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But on that note, consider one comment yesterday from Zimmer:
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't want to be helping our cornerbacks on every
snap. We've had to do it for the last two years, and it just takes
away so much from your overall defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Deion and his do-rag were in that secondary the past two
seasons, although two years ago he missed nearly half the season
with various ailments, real and imagined.
</P>
<P>
   But the point here seems to be that the Cowboys were having the
same kind of cornerback woes with Deion. And if he were still here,
counting $8 million against the salary cap, a prevalent theme of
this camp would center on his health, his obvious slippage in
coverage last season, his availability for the 16-game season, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have a healthy Deion than anybody who plays the
position,'' said Zimmer, who remains a large fan of Nine-Toed.
</P>
<P>
   With him or without him, however, questions hang over both
corners. Owner Jerry Jones, another Deion lover, decided it was
time to move on minus Sanders, as the salary costs were not worth
the health risk. It was the most logical subtraction Jones has made
in years.
</P>
<P>
   But now what?
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, at a Valley Ranch minicamp, Zimmer offered the
possibility of rotating six cornerbacks, highly unusual to say the
least. It was mentioned that if he had to play six corners, that
might mean he couldn't find two, prompting a smile from Zimmer, and
a reply of ``now that's a negative outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there aren't two. And maybe not one. But the seven
leading candidates include veterans Kevin Smith and newcomer Ryan
McNeil, a spunky yet limited veteran, Charlie Williams, last year's
rookie free agent surprise, Duane Hawthorne, and three rookie draft
picks: Dwayne Goodrich, Mario Edwards and Kareem Larrimore.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Smith continues to be hobbled by injuries, and Zimmer was
frank yesterday in saying: ``Kevin has got to be better than what
we've seen thus far. I love Kevin Smith and his competitive nature,
but if he can't do the job, it would be unfair to the other 10 guys
on defense to put him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Zimmer lists McNeil as a starter at one corner,
with the other side posted as TBA. McNeil slid into free agency in
the off-season, and his career has been on the slide since he made
nine interceptions for St. Louis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The key at cornerback is if and how quickly the three rookies
develop. Larrimore, the fourth-round pick out of West Texas A&AMP;M, is
Zimmer's early pick as the most likely to make an impact: ``He's
ahead of the others in speed and quickness. I think he has a chance
to be a great player in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   If shaky cornerback play continues, it would give Zimmer less
options in allowing safety Darren Woodson to come up in run
support, and in calling blitz packages. ``The most important part
of training camp is what we come out of here with at cornerback,''
Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Deion is gone, and the worries continue. nn

RANGERS TRADE LOAIZA FOR TWO MINOR-LEAGUERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Unwilling to go to arbitration with a $2.65
million middle reliever, the Rangers traded pitcher Esteban Loaiza
to the Toronto Blue Jays yesterday for minor-league pitcher Darwin
Cubillan and shortstop Mike Young.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loaiza, who was sent to the bullpen earlier this week, is
eligible for arbitration in the off-season and the Rangers knew
that at some point they would have to trade him or release him.
They decided now was the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to decide if at the end of the year we could get better
value than what we could get now,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``We didn't think we could. We felt now was the right
time because there were a number of teams interested. Toronto was
the most aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, acquired two years ago from the Pittsburgh Pirates ,
said: ``I can't say I'm happy. I was here two years, and I liked it
here. I'm disappointed, but what can you do. I loved the players,
the team and the atmosphere in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said trading Loaiza does not signal the start of a fire
sale for the Rangers, who went into last night's game having lost
five of seven. They were 9 1/2 games back of the Seattle Mariners
in the American League West, but Melvin said the Rangers' focus
should be on winning games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers might have to make changes if they don't start
making up ground on the Mariners and wild-card contenders, but
Melvin said: ``I don't think we're at that point. We've been
playing pretty good baseball. It's not like we're getting blown out
or playing poorly, like in 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are still trying to win, but they feel they have a
better chance with second-year pitchers Ryan Glynn and Matt Perisho
in the rotation. That made Loaiza expendable.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers wanted Young, the Blue Jays fifth-round pick in 1997
out of the University of California-Santa Barbara, who played in
the Double-A All-Star game this year. The deal was done when the
two sides settled on Cubillan as the second player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young was the guy we wanted all along,'' Melvin said. ``He's
got good athleticism, he's someone who can play on both sides of
the bag at second, he runs well, has a strong arm. We like the way
he plays the game; he's a real intelligent player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays used Young at shortstop and second base. The
Rangers plan to use him at shortstop with the Double-A Tulsa
Drillers to go with two of their other top prospects: first baseman
Carlos Pena and second baseman Jason Romano.
</P>
<P>
   Young was hitting .275 (95-for-345) at Double-A Tennessee with
24 doubles, five triples, six homers and 16 stolen bases. He was a
Florida State League All-Star at Class-A Dunedin last year, hitting
.313 with 36 stolen bases and 83 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash said: ``It's a seller's
market. Given the dearth of pitching, there's a price you have to
pay. From a purely scouting point of view and a development point
of view, we probably overpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubillan, a native of Venezuela, was signed by the Blue Jays as
a minor-league free agent in the off-season. The Rangers also had
interest at the time. He was 3-1 with a 0.55 earned-run average and
six saves in 24 appearances for Triple-A Syracuse. He also appeared
in seven games for the Blue Jays, going 1-0 with an 8.04 ERA,
walking 11 batters in 14 2/3 innings. He has a combined 55
strikeouts in 48 1/3 innings this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a good arm,'' Melvin said. ``He throws 90 to 93
\Rmph\S, has a good changeup and pretty good command of his
pitches. He just needs to gain consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubillan is being sent to Triple-A Oklahoma. nn

LEMIEUX CONSIDERS STARS' BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Bargain hunters thus far in the free-agent
market, the Stars appear in position to land the last major
acquisition available.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux, who has been a Stanley Cup champion with three
teams, is inching closer to signing a multi-year contract with the
Stars, possibly as soon as today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talks are continuing in a very amicable basis,'' Lemieux's
agent, Michael Barnett, said yesterday of his negotiations with
Stars general manager Bob Gainey. ``He [Lemieux] is approaching
this like the veteran that he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year veteran right winger, who helped the New Jersey
Devils knock off the Stars in six games last season to win the
Stanley Cup, is seeking a three- or four-year deal that would take
him to the end of his career. He also wants a raise from the $2.47
million he earned last season.
</P>
<P>
   Money might be the pivotal barricade to finalizing the deal to
this point. Barnett and Gainey spoke yesterday, but were unable to
strike a deal. Barnett said he will discuss yesterday's
negotiations with Lemieux and expects to be in contact with Gainey
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of problems associated with it that at this
point [we] haven't been able to find solutions for,'' Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, who turned 35 Sunday, whittled his wish list down from
nine to six and finally to four teams: the Stars, New York Rangers,
New Jersey Devils and St. Louis Blues. Barnett said all four teams
remain in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He [Lemieux] is taking his time to discuss the various
proposals,'' Barnett said. ``He's looking at rosters over a
three-year period. He is taking a very logical approach to where he
wants to end his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said Lemieux, one of the game's top antagonists, is
evaluating his options on several levels. Foremost, he wants to
ensure his final years will be spent playing for a contender. He is
also looking ahead, seeking a destination that might provide him an
opportunity to remain in the NHL beyond retirement and provide a
long-term home for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said Lemieux is also weighing issues such as state
taxes. Texas is the lone state of the four on Lemieux's wish list
that does not have a state income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, 6-foot-1, 225 pounds, has won the Stanley Cup with
Montreal (1986), Colorado (1996) and twice with New Jersey (1995,
2000). As a rookie in '86, he was Gainey's teammate on the Stanley
Cup-champion Canadiens. After playing in 10 regular-season games
that season, Lemieux scored 10 goals and had six assists in 20
playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   While he has posted outstanding regular seasons, including
scoring 30 or more goals five times, the postseason cemented his
reputation as a hard-nosed, abrasive instigator and a premiere
clutch goal scorer. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff
MVP with the Devils in 1995 when he scored 13 goals, scoring on 20
percent of his shots.
CANADIENS PURSUE CARBONNEAU Former Stars center Guy Carbonneau
might be headed back to Montreal, where he played for 12 seasons
and enjoys hero status. Stars general manager Bob Gainey said the
Canadiens have offered Carbonneau, who retired earlier this month,
a position within their organization.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey said Carbonneau phoned him from Montreal after receiving
the offer to discuss specific opportunities with the Stars and
where they might lead in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey said he will speak with Carbonneau next week to further
discuss Carbonneau's possible future within the Stars'
organization. nn

IN PRIVATE, CLINTON MAKES HIS CHOICES KNOWN FOR V.P. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Maine, Ind., S.D., R.I., Nev., Conn.)  By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has told friends and associates
that two of his favorite choices for Vice President Al Gore's
running mate are former Sen. George Mitchell and Sen. Bob Graham,
both of whom he considered picking eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has gone out of his way to stay clear of the selection
process, people close to him said, because he wanted to avoid
appearing as though he was imposing his preferences on Gore _ or
injecting himself into his vice president's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton is regarded by many Democrats as his party's most
brilliant strategist. And when he is questioned privately at party
functions about who he thinks would make sound choices, he has not
been reluctant about offering his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is a political brain attached to a body,'' said
a Democratic lobbyist who has heard Clinton rattle off vice
presidential possibilities recently. ``He can't help himself. It's
how he's wired.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Clinton said he sounds most animated when he is
discussing Mitchell, the former Senate Democratic leader from Maine
whom he picked to preside over the peace negotiations in Ireland.
Clinton has told people that Mitchell would bring a weight and
dignity to the ticket, has no skeletons in his closet and would be
particularly appealing because he is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks it would be great,'' said one person who has talked
to Clinton about Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton loves him,'' said a Democratic strategist close to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had considered Mitchell as a potential running mate in
1992, but he was not on the final short list, according to people
involved in the process then.
</P>
<P>
   The president also tells people he has quite high regard for
Graham of Florida, who, according to aides at the time, he came
quite close to selecting eight years ago. The president has long
been deeply interested _ some of his aides say obsessed _ in
winning Florida for the Democrats and has told people that could
happen if Graham were on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   One person who worked closely with Clinton eight years ago said
he remembered that the then-governor of Arkansas said more than
once that Graham, who had been governor of Florida, ``was the best
governor I served with.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Graham said that after undergoing the
background checks and interview with Clinton in 1992 he was not
sure whether he would be picked. But he said he had been
``anxious'' because he was seeking re-election that year and wanted
the matter settled. In Florida, candidates cannot run
simultaneously for the Senate and on the national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I feel as if I was going to get a call to join the ticket
or definitely not going to get one? I didn't know,'' Graham
recalled. ``I was uncertain as to what Governor Clinton's decision
was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he discussed his prospects for helping Clinton win
Florida that year, Graham said: ``I'm sure we did. He has told me
personally that he feels one of the major mistakes that was made in
'92 was that they gave up on Florida too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Clinton said he is also intrigued with Sen. Evan Bayh
of Indiana because of Bayh's involvement with the Democratic
Leadership Council _ a centrist group that Clinton once headed _
and because he would evoke an energetic and vibrant image, similar
Gore's when he was picked in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to Clinton said the president spoke positively
early on about Defense Secretary William Cohen, a former Republican
senator. But Cohen is not discussed much anymore by people close to
Gore. Some Gore loyalists said they had been disturbed about nice
things Cohen said about Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in a
television interview in May.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can be considered an expert on the selection of a
running mate. He sometimes says that his choice of Gore will be an
important part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The president's musings are very sensitive in Gore's circles.
People who have discussed the No. 2 slot with the president said he
has been careful not to push one prospect above another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart enough not to say, `My first choice is ...''' said
one Democratic official who has talked with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That official also said he believed that Gore was so concerned
about being viewed as independent from the administration that he
might change his mind on a choice if it looked like he was
following the president's counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Like his vice president, Clinton seems to enjoy keeping up the
suspense. At a fund-raising reception last month for Sen.
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Clinton joked about the selection
process in a hotel ballroom full of senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing crowd of people here tonight,'' Clinton said.
``And not all of them want to be vice president. But a lot do.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the audience were Sens. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Jack Reed of Rhode Island
and Harry Reid of Nevada.

TENNESSEE WHISTLE-BLOWER WORRIES ABOUT HER FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.J., Ore., Ill.)   (ADDS that Bensel-Meyers is a tenured associate professor in 8th
graf) 
 (Eds.: Buuck in 2nd graf if 2nd take is cq) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The whistle-blower finds comfort in her
office these days, surrounded by books about Renaissance drama, her
speciality. So long as Linda Bensel-Meyers can keep her mind in the
past, she can forget about the lawsuits against her, the damage to
her marriage, the anger of University of Tennessee officials and
coaches, the threats by local fans who curse her as a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   But she is reminded of the present by the fat leather briefcase
leaning against a leg of her desk. It is stuffed with what she
calls her evidence, the paper trails that always lead back to the
altered grades, ``friendly'' courses and plagiarized papers that
she says the athletic department uses to keep varsity players
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the evidence is being used against her; one suit
implies she has publicly released confidential student information,
which she denies. After some five years of being ignored by the
administration, she talked to ESPN last September after it began
its own investigation of the athletic tutoring system.
</P>
<P>
   Four football players were suspended for a game pending the
school's investigation, and Bensel-Meyers became a well-known
pariah on campus. Students taunt her, teachers turn away. She says
her office has been broken into, mostly as intimidation, she
thinks. She is sitting now with her back to the office window that
overlooks the 107,000-seat football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never feel sorry for myself,'' she says, just a bit too
stoutly, ``because I am responsible for my own decisions. I am not
a victim. I hate it when people look at me with pity. Sometimes,
however, I despair.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the righteousness of this 47-year-old Methodist church
organist pops up. ``It is hard for one good person to live among
those who are not good, and to try to make the right choices,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers is not alone these days as the American
Association of University Professors and another national group of
faculty members convened last year at Drake University in Iowa and
considered reforms in intercollegiate sports. The Drake Group, in
particular, has declared that big-time college sports is basically
a corrupting influence on the academic mission of the university.
And the Rutgers 1000, a group of professors and students, is
calling for that university to divest itself of varsity sports.
</P>
<P>
   At Tennessee, a 44,000-student university, most members of the
administration and the athletic department who speak on the record
say Bensel-Meyers who is a tenured associate professor, has made
all the wrong choices, attacking a source of state pride. The
Volunteers were national football champions two seasons ago. And,
as officials point out, the NCAA conducted an investigation for
months on her charges and found no violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campus is just weary of reading about all her charges,''
said the university president, J. Wade Gilley. ``We've had nine, 10
investigations in the 11 months I've been here, by the faculty
senate, the conference, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, the Federal Bureau of Investigation _ what have I left
out? _ and nothing was found that violated rules or laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilley says he thinks Bensel-Meyers may have an agenda, a ``big,
pregnant idea,'' about de-emphasizing college sports. If that's it,
he chuckles, then there's no better place to start than at a place
that ``epitomizes the system, like Notre Dame or Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice is low. ``This is not my cause,'' she says. She talks
into her hand. Her eyes rarely make contact. ``I'm a company
person. I thought I'd be here forever. I went through channels. But
my options have been limited because no one would listen to what
I've been saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when they did hear me, the attitude was, just fail the
athlete who plagiarized. How can I do that, when the plagiarism was
institutional, when the athlete thinks he's supposed to turn in a
paper written by one of the hired tutors? How can I sacrifice some
poor guy who bought into the dream just like me, to get off the
farm.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers left the family chicken farm in Pendleton, Ore.,
30 years ago for a scholarship to the University of Chicago. She
always loved sports, she says, the third of four children who all
became teachers. She roughhoused with her brothers. She ran track
in high school and continued to play basketball and volleyball at
the University of Oregon, where her Ph.D. dissertation was on ``The
Duchess of Malfi,'' a bloodthirsty revenge tragedy, written by John
Webster circa 1613.
</P>
<P>
   At Tennessee, where she began her first tenure-track teaching
job in 1986, she says she has rarely missed a Volunteers football
game on television. But she has never taken her three teen-age sons
to the stadium because she is afraid of crowds and heights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, she became director of composition, a job she loved,
she said, because the required first-year writing course gave her a
chance to shape a curriculum that would teach critical thinking and
``empower'' the many ``provincial, religious, concrete thinkers,''
who, as she had been, were the first generation in their families
to attend college. She borrowed from the great books courses
created at Chicago and from her own scholarship. She sees parallels
between the Age of Gutenberg, when the printing press helped
replace ethical reasoning with scientific thought, and the Age of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among her early tasks was hiring and training the tutors who
would help athletes, particularly male football and basketball
players. Slowly, over the years, she began to realize, she says,
that the athletes were being exploited by a system that did not
deliver a real education in return for the millions of dollars the
university made from their time and energy. Tutors came back with
stories of being sexually harassed by athletes, not to mention
having to write their term papers.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers, with access to transcripts, began to notice
patterns of grades being altered, of clusters of unusually high
grades for athletes in certain courses, of special privileges. She
thought there was abuse in the labeling of certain athletes as
having disabilities, which could excuse them from having to read or
write. She began to send memos to her superiors. She was ignored.
She began sending e-mail messages, first to foreign colleagues whom
she had met at Renaissance conferences, then with almost anyone who
seemed to understand and would respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda is naive, a straight arrow who never understood the
power she came up against,'' says Jeffrey Kovac, a 51-year-old
chemistry professor and one of Bensel-Meyers' few public supporters
at Tennessee. Last week, he quietly announced a legal defense fund
to which faculty could contribute anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Most faculty are cynical about sports,'' Kovac said.
``Athletes get away with murder, so what, just let me concentrate
on neutron scattering. But I've also been a professional soccer
referee for 20 years, and I've always thought, all we have is our
integrity and a whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovac's fund-raising is welcome news to David L. Buuck, a
graduate of Tennessee and its law school who finds himself shunned,
as well as underpaid, while defending Bensel-Meyers. The libel suit
against ESPN.com and a former head of the tutoring service, by a
former player and a former tutor, does not even name Bensel-Meyers,
but she had promised to pay for any of her teachers who were sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't let them be punished because someone's trying to get
at me,'' she said. ``I worry about my seven doctoral students,
working on dissertations, mostly on the Renaissance. What if after
all this, my letters of recommendation are poison?''
</P>
<P>
   An injunction to keep his records private was filed by Spencer
Riley, the center on last year's football team who is now trying
out for the Buffalo Bills. The university's failure to defend her
along with itself sent a chill through the faculty; would this be a
precedent to punish anyone out of favor who became a target of
litigation?
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers finds herself more and more isolated, with fewer
responsibilities. She thinks she may be fired. She is afraid of
going to her car at night in the campus underground garage. Her
children hear remarks about her at school. Her husband, who thinks
she is hurting the family, rarely talks to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for my kids to see what I'm doing,'' she
says, not sounding absolutely certain. ``Or it will be someday. We
can't teach people abuse of the law and not expect it will lead to
more crime. We're losing values in this country, and the university
may be the only place left to preserve these values.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to teach kids there's a reason to be on earth and it's
not just grabbing off pleasure. I believe if people have all the
information they'll choose the right thing. That's why I talk to
the media, why I send out all these e-mails. But then I have this
image of myself doing cartwheels along the edge of a cliff,
blindfolded. I think I'll be all right as long as I don't see where
I'm going.''

BILL WOULD LIFT BAN ON IMPORT OF U.S. DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Vt., La., Mich., N.D.)  By STEVEN A. HOLMES and ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday overwhelming voted to
permit pharmacies and wholesale distributors of prescription drugs
to import and sell U.S.-made medicine that originally had been
exported to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   But in voting 74-21 to overturn the ban on such imports, the
lawmakers also unanimously adopted an amendment requiring the Food
and Drug administration to certify that the action would pose no
risk to public health and safety and would significantly reduce
costs to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment sponsored by Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., could
delay lifting the ban by tying up the food and drug agency in an
extensive rule-making exercise to determine precisely how it would
guarantee the safety and low cost of imported drugs that are
reimported.
</P>
<P>
   Given the possibility of delay, supporters of the measure
emphasized its symbolic importance. Regardless of whether it
becomes law, the measure's backers say the vote in the Senate,
along with a vote approving a similar measure in the House last
week, sends a strong signal to the pharmaceutical industry that it
must do something about its prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shot across the bow,'' said Sen. James Jeffords,
R.-Vt., who is the chief Senate sponsor of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Jeffords' legislation becomes law, drug manufacturers
said, consumers might not see any savings because there was no
assurance that pharmacists and wholesalers would pass on the lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action in the Senate and the similar action last
week in the House came on amendments to a bill to finance the
operations of the Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments vary slightly, but would have the same effect.
The differences are to be reconciled in a Senate-House conference.
</P>
<P>
   Because the legislation is an amendment to a spending bill, even
its supporters acknowledge that it could be dropped in the give and
take of negotiations with the White House at the end of the fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures cover the importation into the United States of
prescription medications that have been produced here or in foreign
pharmaceutical plants approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
Proponents of the measure have argued that pharmaceutical companies
often get tax breaks for developing drugs, then charge much more in
the United States than in foreign countries for the same drug.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say that ending the ban would result in a flood of
cheap, counterfeit imports because there is no way the food and
drug agency can police the way drugs are stored, transported or
produced abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's coming from Canada, that's not a bad deal,'' said Sen.
John Breaux, D-La. ``But this amendment is not limited to Canada.
We'd be importing from third world countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate action responds to pleas by the elderly, the
country's most politically active demographic group, which has in
recent years expressed concern about the high cost of prescription
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Because countries like Canada subject prescription medicines to
price controls, popular drugs like Lipitor, the anti-cholesterol
medication and Prozac, the anti-depressant, cost much less there _
in some cases half as much. Federal law says that a prescription
drug made in the United States and exported may not be reimported
except by the manufacturer. The law, adopted in 1988, sought to
choke off a ``gray market'' for drugs that were counterfeit,
adulterated or too old to be used safely.
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 measure, introduced by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., was
widely seen as a consumer protection measure. Congressional
investigators documented many cases in which counterfeit drugs,
including birth control pills, had been imported.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Congress last year, Dr. David Kessler, the former
commissioner of food and drugs, said, ``The dangers of allowing
reimportation of prescription drugs may be even greater today than
they were in 1986.'' With the rise of Internet pharmacies, he said,
``the opportunities for illicit distribution of adulterated and
counterfeit products have grown as well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeffords tried to address such concerns. His amendment says that
the Department of Health and Human Services, in allowing
pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs, must
establish safeguards to protect public health and to guarantee the
safety and effectiveness of the imported products.
</P>
<P>
   Support for such legislation has increased along with the cost
of prescription drugs. In an interview, Rep. Bernard Sanders,
I-Vt., said, ``Safety is a legitimate issue, but because of the
high price of drugs, hundreds of thousands of elderly sick people
cannot afford to fill the prescriptions they receive.'' Sanders has
been pushing legislation to allow access to low-cost foreign drugs
since May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper advertisements in the last few days, the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, representing
major drug companies, expressed alarm at Jeffords' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., denounced the advertisements. ``The
pharmaceutical industry wants to scare people into believing the
legislation is bad for consumers,'' he said. ``We would assure the
safety of the drug supply, but we would also assure consumers they
can have access to drugs that are priced reasonably.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said Wednesday night that the administration had not opposed
Jeffords' amendment. But Jennings said Congress ought to provide
money to the food and drug agency so that it can assure the safety
and purity of imported drugs.

LAWSUIT CLAIMS LACK OF CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE IS DISCRIMINATORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SCHUBERT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A pharmacist at Bartell Drugs, shocked that her
medical plan doesn't cover prescriptions for contraceptives, on
Wednesday filed a lawsuit arguing that the lack of coverage amounts
to sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court here, is backed by the
legal and financial resources of Planned Parenthood and is the
latest tactic in the organization's push to make coverage for
prescription contraceptives as universal as coverage for
vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first known federal case to challenge the lack of
prescription contraception coverage on the basis of Title VII, the
federal Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory employment
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sex discrimination when male employees get their basic
health care needs covered by insurance, but women are forced to pay
for theirs,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood
Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff is Jennifer Erickson, a pharmacist in Seattle. But
court papers ask that it be made a class-action lawsuit, covering
women enrolled in Bartell's self-insured prescription plan who use
contraceptives. The goal is an order requiring Bartell to cover all
FDA-approved prescription contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Class action is a mechanism that allows people to challenge
the status quo,'' said Roberta Riley, staff attorney for Planned
Parenthood of Western Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the suit could have broad implications for
private employers and their female employees across the country.
Three out of four American women of child-bearing age rely on
employer-provided insurance plans, according to the Alan Guttmacher
Institute, a New York-based research organization that studies
reproductive issues.
</P>
<P>
   But half of all fee-for-service plans do not cover any
reversible contraception, and only 15 percent cover all five
prescription contraception options: the birth control pill, IUDs,
diaphragms, Norplant implants and the drug Depo-Prevera.
</P>
<P>
   Bartell has not yet been served with the lawsuit, but a company
official said Wednesday that the firm's comprehensive health
benefits, provided at no cost to the employees, are lawful and
non-discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``No medical benefit program covers every possible cost,'' said
Jean Bartell Barber, the company's chief financial officer, at a
press conference Wednesday. ``For example, we do not cover
prescriptions for Viagra, infertility drugs, drugs for weight
reduction, immunization agents, drugs for cosmetic purposes and
various other items.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug store chain reviews its health plans once a year,
Barber said, but cost dictates how much the company can add.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we add something to the plan, we have to take something
away from the plan,'' Barber said.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, 26, started working for Bartell in February 1999. It
is, on the whole, a great company to work for, she said. But she
was surprised to find that contraceptives were not part of her
prescription health care benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, who is married, currently pays more than $300 a year
out-of-pocket for birth control pills, but she said other women
can't always afford that. As a pharmacist, Erickson said every day
she tells many women who come in to fill prescriptions that
contraceptives aren't covered under their health plans either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see women actually walk away from the counter when it's
not covered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson questioned the policy and wrote a letter to the
benefits department asking that the coverage be changed. In
December, she filed a complaint with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, a legal prerequisite to filing a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until today, no one has asked a court to stop this form of
discrimination that blocks a woman's access to basic health care,''
said Roberta Riley, staff attorney at Planned Parenthood of Western
Washington and lead attorney for this case.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is the first lawsuit of its kind, advocacy groups
have been pushing to have prescription contraceptives covered in
health plans for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood of Western Washington has been waging a
campaign urging employers to voluntarily add prescription
contraceptives to their health-care plans. As a result, Microsoft,
Swedish Medical Center and Darigold have all extended their
prescription benefits to include contraceptives. Some said they
didn't realize contraceptives weren't included in their health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lack of awareness for many companies,'' said Chris
Charbonneau, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Western
Washington. ``There are some companies, however, that are really
recalcitrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states have laws that require contraceptive coverage;
Washington is not among them. Federal legislation that would
require all health plans nationwide to cover contraception has been
stalled in Congress since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely an issue that all the people who are
concerned with reproductive rights are concerned about,'' said
Louise Melling, associate director of the ACLU's Reproductive
Rights Project. ``Reproductive rights include the right to have a
child _ and the right not to have a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle Taylor-McGhee, executive director of the California
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, argues that the
reproductive health services have been segregated from overall
health care for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it interesting that insurers will pay for
pregnancy-related services, but they won't pay for services related
to making sure that a woman doesn't have an unwanted pregnancy?''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the lawsuit don't buy the argument that
contraceptions are an elective drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without contraception, the average woman would have 12 to 15
pregnancies in her lifetime,'' said Riley, the lead attorney.
``This is basic health care for women.''

ALWAYS THERE TO HELP OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAMES MELROY  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ For those who venture to the 2000 NBA
Summer Pro League at the Pyramid, there are many familiar faces
competing on the court, hoping to leave an impression on those who
are watching.
</P>
<P>
   One such face is familiar to fans of Southern California
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Cooper has been a part of local basketball for 15 years,
playing at Lakewood High school before continuing his education
(and playing days) at USC.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike a majority of the athletes remaining at the Summer
Pro League, he has played in the NBA, having stints with teams such
as the Lakers and the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, Cooper has been a mainstay at the
Pyramid during the summer, hoping to showcase his skills enough so
that another NBA team would decide to add him to their roster.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, he continues to maintain the ultimate trait of a good
point guard: unselfishness. In fact, some of the younger athletes
playing with Cooper come to the 6-1 guard, looking for some
guidance from someone who has been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got guys that look to me for advice, but I think it's just
because I am getting old,'' Cooper said half-jokingly. ``I've been
around the block a little bit. As far as the NBA goes, those teams
are looking for new faces. I think that's a shame, but at the same
time I can understand that. So, if I can help a young guy out, I'll
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping younger players out might be something Cooper ends up
doing for a long time. He said that after his playing days end, a
new endeavor might be on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'd like to buy and sell real estate, but I think my
calling is to coach, to be a college coach,'' Cooper said. ``I've
been offered a few coaching jobs since I've graduated from college.
Southern Illinois, Northern Arizona and Loyola Marymount are a few
of the schools I could help out with.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cooper takes great pride in improving, not only himself,
but others that come in contact with him. For instance, the
Lakewood graduate joined a struggling college program in the
Trojans. But along with Harold Miner and head coach George
Raveling, Cooper helped lead USC to an NCAA Tournament berth in his
senior year.
</P>
<P>
   And now, almost 10 years later, Cooper is showing that his will
to win and ability to lead hasn't waned one bit.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Coopers' Anaheim Roadrunners trailed the Supreme
Court All-Stars by nine midway through the fourth quarter. But with
less than 6:30 remaining in the game, Cooper ran off eight
consecutive points, including a pair of 3-pointers, in a span of
just over a minute. The run by Cooper, who finished the game with
17 points, sparked the Roadrunners to a 107-100 victory.

UNITED AND AMERICAN BEAT EARNING EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Earnings at the nation's two largest airline
companies, UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, and AMR Corp.,
owner of American Airlines, handily beat Wall Street expectations
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news was tempered by United's warning of weaker
earnings in the current quarter, sparking a large selloff of
airline stocks, led by UAL.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, US Airways, the No. 6 carrier, said its profit
plunged 41 percent, excluding one-time gains, while TWA, which has
continued to elude profitability despite the travel boom, narrowed
its losses more than analysts had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The strong showing by United and American came after similar
reports by Continental Airlines and the low-fare leader Southwest
Airlines on Tuesday. ``If the economy is slowing down, we don't see
it in the airline business,'' said Tom Horton, AMR's chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profit at UAL rose 17 percent, to $408 million, or
$3.47 a share, compared with $349 million, or $2.86 a share, in the
period a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent, to $5.11 billion
from $4.54 billion in 1999. Analysts had expected the company to
earn $3.24 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   United said that it benefited from higher fares and a 6.8
percent increase in passenger traffic during the quarter, led by a
21 percent increase in the Asia-Pacific region. That more than made
up for the surge in fuel prices, which is an airline's
second-biggest expense after labor, thanks to an aggressive hedging
program that locked in fuel costs before the big price increases.
</P>
<P>
   But United also suffered from several operational headaches
during the quarter that gave it the poorest on-time record and most
flight cancellations of the major airlines. Executives blamed
unusually poor weather, the air-traffic control system and the
refusal of many of its pilots, who are angry about the slow pace of
contract negotiations, to fly overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Rono Dutta, UAL's president, said that the pilot action cost the
company $50 million during the quarter. United has cut thousands of
flights and is adding more time into its schedule to try to reduce
cancellations and delays.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta said that revenue would continue to be strong in the
current quarter but that the reduction in capacity along with
higher fuel and wage costs would result in earnings between $2.60
and $3.20 a share, lower than analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   The news caused shares of UAL to plunge $6, or 10.1 percent, to
$53.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   AMR reported a 32 percent surge in profit, excluding
extraordinary items, to $285 million, or $1.75 a share, compared
with $216 million, or $1.36 a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Revenue rose 10.4 percent, to $5 billion from $4.5 billion last
year. Analysts had expected AMR to earn $1.57, according to First
Call.
</P>
<P>
   American also benefited from hedging its fuel costs, saving $105
million during the quarter, Horton said. He said that the airline
also gained $10 million to $15 million in additional revenue by
attracting passengers displaced by cancellations at United, its
main competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, American faced an easier comparison with results in
the quarter a year earlier, when its bookings were weakened by the
aftermath of a pilot sickout that crippled its operations. And a
recent decision to remove seats from most of its airplanes to give
passengers more legroom helped increase its average fare.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue at US Airways rose 6.4 percent during the quarter, to
$2.43 billion from $2.28 billion in 1999. But profit fell to $80
million, or $1.17 a share, compared with $136 million, or $1.83 a
share, in 1999, excluding one-time gains. Analysts were expecting
US Airways to earn $1.36 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger demand was strong at the airline, which agreed in May
to be acquired by UAL for $4.3 billion, but it was hurt more by the
rise in the cost of fuel than were United and American. US Airways
said that its fuel costs rose nearly 63 percent during the quarter,
or $102 million, whereas American said its fuel costs rose only 37
percent. In addition, US Airways lost some lucrative business
passengers who shied away from the airline because of the threat of
a strike by its flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Rakesh Gangwal, the chief executive of US Airways, told analysts
that the airline was focusing on winning back business travelers.
But he predicted a further decline in unit revenue during the third
quarter and another hit from higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   TWA also had record traffic during the quarter. Revenue rose
10.3 percent, to $954.9 million from $866 million. But the
struggling airline, which does not aggressively hedge its fuel
costs, was still in the red. TWA said that it lost $4.2 million, or
8 cents a share, compared with a loss of $5.3 million, or 17 cents
a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Still, analysts had
expected the airline to lose 33 cents a share during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's last profitable quarter was two years ago.

DESPITE SALES SLUMP, IBM'S EARNINGS RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite declining sales, IBM managed to surprise Wall
Street on Wednesday with earnings of $1.9 billion for the second
quarter, up 12 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That works out to $1.06 per share, well above the $1.00 Wall
Street expected.
</P>
<P>
   The company compensated for weak sales, especially of personal
computers and mainframes, through strict cost controls. It also
bought back $1.8 billion of its stock, increasing the per-share
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts dismissed the share buybacks and cost cutting as
necessary evils.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM has not been getting credit for beating the earnings
estimates,'' said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.
``Their revenues are so sorry looking, you wouldn't want to give
them the wrong idea. The truth of the matter is that the market
needs to see revenue turn around and they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts took heart that IBM, did not back off its
optimistic forecasts for the second half of the year, despite more
negative assessments in recent weeks by services companies like
Electronic Data Systems and software companies like Computer
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors were nervous that IBM would back off from the second
half and they didn't do that,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst
with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading, IBM's shares rose to $109, after closing
at $104.16, up $1.28, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In a long conference call with analysts, IBM detailed signs of
improvement in most of its business lines.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, IBM's fast growing Global Services division, which
designs and operates computer systems for other companies, signed
contracts worth $20 billion over the next several years, far more
than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the company reduced the loss in its personal computer
business to $69 million, from $100 million a year earlier, and John
R. Joyce, the company's chief financial officer, told analysts the
unit should break even by the end of the year. He said that in the
second quarter, 24 percent of the company's PC sales were direct to
customers, rather than through dealers, up from 19 percent in the
previous three months. By the end of the year, he said, direct
sales, the technique used to great effect by Dell Computer, should
be 35 percent of IBM's PC sales.
</P>
<P>
   Other strong areas included Unix servers and storage systems,
both in increasing demand by companies operating Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, IBM said the rise in the dollar reduced sales
overseas by 1 percent in dollar terms. And it said it was having
continued difficulty with its hard disk drive business.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, hardware revenue fell by 4.9 percent to $9.2 billion.
Services revenue increased by 2.4 percent to $8.2 billion. Software
revenue increased by 1.7 percent to $3.2 billion. And financing
revenue increased by 10.1 percent to $819 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its services revenue actually grew by 10
percent when it excluded figures for its network services unit,
which IBM sold to AT&AMP;T last year, and for services related to the
Year 2000 computer bug, demand for which has fallen off sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Sales declined in the Americas and Europe, but increased sharply
in Asia.

CITIGROUP AND CHASE REPORT HIGHER EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services
company, earned more than $3 billion for the second consecutive
quarter, despite a sharp drop in the performance of its Salomon
Smith Barney securities unit. At Chase Manhattan Bank, the No. 3
United States bank, the drag on earnings came from its investments
in private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday
that were higher than a year earlier and exceeded analysts
expectations. Citigroup shares rose $1.3125, to $68, while Chase
shares slipped 25 cents, to $50.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Strong growth in its consumer businesses helped Citigroup
increase its net income 23 percent, to $3.005 billion, or 87 cents
a diluted share, from $2.45 billion, or 70 cents a share, in the
second quarter of 1999. That profit was down significantly from
Citigroup's first-quarter profit of $3.6 billion, which was the
biggest quarterly profit any company has reported, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial. Analysts expected earnings of 83
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at the Salomon unit were down 33 percent from the first
quarter and up just 5 percent from the period a year earlier, at
$641 million. Salomon was hurt by the downturn in stock market
activity and a slowdown in bond trading, caused in part by rising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's chairman and chief executive,
noted that the Smith Barney brokerage unit took in $24 billion in
new money from U.S. customers in the quarter, surpassing the $11
billion its bigger rival Merrill Lynch reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at what some of our competitors did, relative to the
size of our sales force, we did excellent,'' Weill said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Merrill, which said that it would cut 1,800 jobs in its
brokerage unit, Smith Barney has no layoffs planned, Weill said.
``We run a very efficient retail brokerage business,'' he said.
``We like to run it on a steady-as-you-go basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Weill said that rising interest rates had not posed a problem
for Citigroup's consumer lending businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to see in the U.S. very strong credit quality
trends with delinquencies continuing to decline,'' he said.
``Writeoffs are at the lowest level in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup said it would split its shares 4 for 3 next month.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away at Chase headquarters, executives sounded
upbeat even though Chase's earnings fell 22 percent, to $1.09
billion, or 85 cents a diluted share, from $1.39 billion, or $1.06
a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, Chase earned
95 cents a share, beating analysts estimates by 12 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Chase officials attributed most of the decline in profit to the
falling value of its private equity investments. Chase had private
equity gains of just $298 million, down from $513 million a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real reassuring number that showed that even in a
tough, dislocated market, they can protect their reported
earnings,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are more concerned about the bank's expenses rising
faster than its revenue, Kraushaar said. Chase has spent a lot of
money hiring people and buying companies to add heft to its
investment banking business and, he said, the ``question for
investors is can they stay on top of the investments and turn it
around quickly?''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Shapiro, Chase's vice chairman, tried to reassure investors
that spending would not outpace revenue growth for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have what I call a field of dreams strategy that says
we will spend all of this money and hope that one day the revenues
will come in and pay for it,'' he said. ``We intend to pay for
things on a pay-as-you-go basis.''

   THE REPUBLICANS: GETTING PERSONAL WITH BUSH
</P>
<P>
   For voters who were not feeling up close and personal enough
with the candidacy of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the campaign
Wednesday unveiled a redesigned Web site, www.GeorgeWBush.com, with
a new feature, ``My George W.'' It allows users to receive e-mail
messages from the campaign about issues of specific interest to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The revised site, which has a less cluttered look than its
previous incarnation and includes sections like ``GWB TV,'' which
is devoted to video clips of Bush, is being promoted in a novel
way, too. The campaign says it is running the first political
television commercial designed solely to advertise a candidate's
Web site. The unnarrated, 30-second spot scans the campaign's home
page and supplies the address of the Web site, where users can also
answer a daily trivia question and win Bush campaign souvenirs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE ISSUES: ANTI-ABORTION PLANK
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of abortion rights said Wednesday that they had told
Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Republican
platform committee, that they had not ruled out a floor fight to
change the platform's strong anti-abortion stance. The exchange
occurred in a meeting with Thompson in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has said repeatedly that he is under instructions from
party leaders to make no changes in the platform's abortion plank,
which calls for a constitutional ban on the practice without
exceptions. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed nominee, has
said he favors keeping that language.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Cullman, co-chairwoman of the Republican Pro-Choice
Coalition, said she and her colleagues told Thompson that their
struggle would not end with the vote of the platform committee.
Cullman said simply that her group was reviewing its options _ one
of which is to try to assemble a majority of six state delegations,
necessary to make a motion to suspend the rules and try to bring
the issue to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOUSE: DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT SEAT
</P>
<P>
   None of the three candidates in Tuesday's Democratic primary in
Georgia's 7th Congressional District took more than 50 percent of
the vote, so a runoff will be held on Aug. 8 to decide which of the
top two finishers, Roger Kahn or Jim Williams, gets to challenge
the incumbent Republican, Rep. Bob Barr, in the fall.
</P>
<P>

MINIMED REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS UP 77 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ MiniMed Inc., which makes microfusion systems for
the delivery of drugs, on Wednesday said second-quarter earnings
grew 77 percent, fueled by strong demand for the company's insulin
pump.
</P>
<P>
   The Sylmar-based company also said its board had set a
two-for-one stock split.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed's income climbed to $8.6 million, or 26 cents a share,
compared with $4.9 million, or 16 cents a share, for the 1999
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues grew about 41 percent, to $69.4 million, over the $49.1
million reported in the comparable quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did pretty well,'' said Alfred E. Mann, chairman and chief
executive officer at MiniMed. ``We have been on a roll now for 21
quarters, ever since we went public, and every quarter we either
meet or exceed expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann said the company was set to introduce a number of new
products over the next couple of years, including a disposable
infusion system for Type 2 diabetes and a prefilled insulin
cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of new products that should accelerate our
growth,'' he said. ``Our strong revenue increase continues to be
driven by worldwide insulin pump placement growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The results exceeded Wall Street forecasts for 24 cents a share,
according to a survey of industry analysts by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Despite the strong earnings report, shares of MiniMed
fell $4.938, or 3.7 percent, to close Wednesday at $113 on heavy
volume of 534,700 shares traded on the Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are great numbers,'' said Kevin Kotler, an analyst with
ING Barings in New York. ``This is a company that is starting to
see an acceleration in its earnings story, which is fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With new products for 2001 and 2002, including their consumer
glucose censor and its Type 2 (insulin) pump, it should add to
estimates on Wall Street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the stock split would be effective Aug. 2 for
holders of record at the close of business on that date and will be
distributed Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board's decision to approve another stock split
demonstrates continued optimism and confidence about the company's
future,'' Mann said.

   MOTORISTS USING LESS GAS; SUPPLY OF HEATING OIL IS LOW
</P>
<P>
   Facing higher fuel prices, motorists are using less gas _ but
only slightly less. The American Petroleum Institute said that
deliveries of gasoline in the first half of 2000 were down about
0.7 percent, ending a long period of growth.
</P>

AT ST. ANDREWS, THERE'S WOODS AND THERE'S EVERYONE ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Either Tiger Woods will win the career
Grand Slam, or someone else will have a grand weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When the British Open begins Thursday, Woods will chase history,
trying to become the youngest player, at 24, to win all four
majors. But there are other reasons the 2000 British Open is
certain to be remembered. Jack Nicklaus, at 60, could be playing
his last Open, and he is probably competing in his last tournament
at one of golf's most treasured sites, the Old Course at St.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, Nicklaus, nostalgia and a world-class field _ a blend
certain to produce excitement. While Woods enters the tournament as
the clear-cut favorite, how can anyone be certain what will happen?
Who expected Paul Lawrie to win last year at Carnoustie, Scotland?
And who can predict how players will react to the changes at St.
Andrews, including rock-hard fairways that are faster than some
greens and refaced bunkers that can take several strokes to escape?
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Open, some of the world's best players can be
grouped into two categories _ those who are in a groove and those
with something to prove. Meanwhile, beware of long shots, like
Lawrie last year, who could make a surprise move.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who are in a groove, Woods, Ernie Els, Lee Westwood and
Notah Begay III head the list.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won 14 of his last 26 starts worldwide, and he won the
U.S. Open last month by a record-setting 15 strokes. Woods is a
presence, not only on the course, but inside the heads of his
competitors. He tees off at 9:20 a.m. local time, and almost
everyone else in the clubhouse will be tracking his score.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods opens with a 65 or better, and if he putts well early,
some of his competitors will be demoralized. But if Woods struggles
in the first round, as he did at the Masters this year when Vijay
Singh won, the tournament will suddenly feel much more wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not win the Western Open a couple of weeks ago,''
Westwood said. ``He is clearly the best player in the world. He is
not going to win every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwood is Europe's most torrid player, winning two consecutive
starts and three of his last six. But Westwood only has one
top-five finish in a major, and he does not care for St. Andrews.
Yet, after taking last week off, Westwood felt well rested and
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two tournaments have been wins, so results-wise, it
could not be much better,'' Westwood said. ``Stay out of the
bunkers. That will be the main point this week.''
</P>
<P>
   After Woods, Els is the player being mentioned most often as the
next favorite. Els has finished second this year at both the
Masters and the U.S. Open. He has won the U.S. Open twice, and he
is not intimidated by Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ernie Els is going to win the tournament,'' said Gary
Player, who will be playing in his 45th British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Begay has won his last two starts _ the FedEx St. Jude Classic
and the Canon Greater Hartford Open. But Woods did not play in
either of those events. And Begay is playing in his first British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   The list of those with something to prove is headed by five
players ranked among the world's top 10 _ David Duval, Colin
Montgomerie, Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III and Jesper Parnevik.
Duval, Mickelson, Montgomerie and Parnevik have never won a major,
while Love has not won any event in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who has not won anywhere since April of last year, will
have to improve his putting and bunker play to contend this week.
But he is still a great driver of the ball and he insists he has
not lost confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've gone backward,'' Duval said. ``Truthfully,
I think I'm better. The putting has been lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, a native of Scotland, seems to put even more
pressure on himself when the Open is in his homeland. But it may
help that with Woods, Els and Westwood playing so well, Montgomerie
enters this event far from the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, the weight of expectation is not so great,''
Montgomerie said. ``I believe I am more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson turned 30 last month, so there is a sense of urgency
to win a major. Parnevik, who has three top-four finishes at the
Open, is 35 and still has not won a major.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who won the 1997 PGA Championship, has been a poor Sunday
player recently, doing what it takes to finish second, not first.
Love has six top-five finishes this year, but no victories.
</P>
<P>
   Among the long shots to watch are: Loren Roberts, who won at
Milwaukee on Sunday, finished third at the Masters and eighth at
the U.S. Open; Padraig Harrington, who tied for fifth at the 1997
British Open and also tied for fifth at this year's U.S. Open; and
John Huston, who finished fourth at the U.S. Open and tied for
fifth at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   But as the tournament begins, Woods is in a familiar position _
the focus of attention, with his mind focused on winning. One day,
Woods expects to complete the career Grand Slam. And he hopes that
day is Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are any two tournaments you want to win, it's the
U.S. Open at Pebble Beach and the British at St. Andrews,'' Woods
said. ``I get the chance to complete the slam on the most historic
golf course ever designed. It's just a wonderful opportunity.''  &QL;

SAKS FIFTH AVENUE SPLITS FROM PARENT
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 10th graph to reflect that earning estimates were for fiscal
2000 and the second quarter ending July 29) By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The answer to the question of whether a country
peasant can marry a Park Avenue swell and live happily ever after
appears to be no.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Inc., previously called Proffitt's, with headquarters in
Birmingham, Ala., announced late Wednesday that less than two years
after it acquired Saks Fifth Avenue and renamed itself, its board
had approved a plan to split again into two separate public
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The spun-off entity will be called Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises
Inc. and will include the luxury-oriented stores of Saks Fifth
Avenue; the Saks Direct, which includes catalog and Internet
operations; and Saks Off Fifth, its upscale outlet business. Saks
Inc. will retain the rest of the department store business _
including regional department stores like Proffitt's, McRae's and
Parisan _ and will eventually be renamed. Shareholders are expected
to receive one share of Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises common stock
for every three shares of Saks Inc. stock they own.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Proffitt's-Saks merger in September 1998, skepticism
abounded about the logic of combining mid-market department stores,
which rely on staple brands like Liz Claiborne and Levi's, and the
tony retailer, best known for such offerings as Prada and Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts and consultants argued that the businesses were
too dissimilar to produce real benefits and accused the company
chairman, R. Brad Martin, of being blinded by his desire to own a
upscale property _ with the opportunities to hobnob with socialites
and celebrity designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake to buy Saks Fifth Avenue,'' said Robert F.
Buchanan, a retail analyst at A.G. Edwards, ``and it makes sense to
undue the mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers who counted on Saks stores to showcase their newest
creations also worried that the corporation was running the upscale
emporium like a mundane department store _ starving it of necessary
resources for inventory, remodeling and staff training to hit its
financial targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger went off because there was a lack of understanding
on what it takes to run a first-class luxury operation,'' said
Arnold Aronson, a former Saks Fifth Avenue chief executive. ``It is
better that the realization came late rather than never.''
</P>
<P>
   The spin-off is clearly a bid to improve Saks Inc. sagging stock
price. Before acquiring Saks Holdings and changing its name,
Proffitt's was an industry leader in buying businesses at a rapid
pace and making them profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the purchase, it became apparent that the former
Proffitt's had hit a block in integrating the disparate parts of
its empire. Last summer, the company said it would miss earnings
estimates for the fiscal year 1999 by a mile, in part because of
disappointing growth in its credit business and because of
lower-than-anticipated revenue growth at Mercantile Stores, a chain
of bargain-priced apparel stores that it bought from Dillard's Inc.
in 1998. Then this spring, sales were lower than anticipated in the
department stores, and the company on Wednesday forecast an
operating loss for its fiscal second quarter, ending July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Inc. had already missed earnings estimates for three
quarters in a row, and its stock price has crumbled by more than 50
percent since the merger was announced. The stock gained 68.75
cents, to $12.50, on Wednesday ahead of the spinoff announcement,
which came after the financial markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
   The company stopped just short of saying that the purchase had
been a mistake but acknowledged that winning Wall Street's favor
was a motivating factor in the plan announced on Wednesay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will let others critique whether I lost my focus,'' Martin
said, but this deal was necessary ``to get the appropriate focus on
each business as well as the appropriate capital structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two new companies, Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises appears
to be in stronger shape, stock analysts said. Because of a booming
economy, the luxury market has been soaring, and sales at Saks
Fifth Avenue have been growing at roughly 10 percent a year. The
prospects for Saks Inc. and the midlevel department stores in
general seem grimmer, reflected Wednesday in the news that Martin
will eventually relinquish his position with the department store
group to remain on as chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises,
although he will continue to own a stake in both.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Miller will continue as chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue,
and Christina Johnson will continue as president and chief
executive of the Saks Fifth Avenue stores division. The department
store group will start a search for a new chief executive.

JAPAN AND U.S. REACH TRADE PACT ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With its ownership of nearly all telephone lines that go
into Japan's homes and businesses, the Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp. has long enjoyed a virtual monopoly in this
country. On Wednesday, however, a U.S.-Japanese trade agreement was
reached that is likely to make telecommunications services in Japan
far more affordable, competitive and diverse.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after nine days of intense negotiations and
averted a major trade battle between Japan and the United States on
the eve of a global summit meeting in Japan. American trade
officials, who have been pressing loudly for increased American
telephone industry access to the $140 billion Japanese market,
called it a huge victory.
</P>
<P>
   Its central feature is cuts in the fees that NTT charges other
telecommunications companies to use its domestic network, which
covers 98 percent of the lines to all customers.
</P>
<P>
   For other telephone companies, the agreement will lower the
costs of linking up with NTT by an average of 35 percent in two
years and by at least 40 percent over three years, said Charlene
Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges have been consuming roughly 40 percent of the
revenue of NTT's competitors, stifling competition to provide
telecommunications services in the world's second-largest economy,
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has been placing a tax on the Information Age by the way
it regulates NTT,'' said Richard W. Fisher, Barshefsky's deputy, in
an interview. ``It's therefore a tax on competition, and that tax
is going to come down substantially now.''
</P>
<P>
   While Japanese officials said the agreement was only modestly
different from a proposal they made in January, their American
counterparts noted that it provided for significantly deeper cuts
than the 17 percent reduction Japan had offered previously. The
agreement also accelerates the timing of the cuts so that most of
them take place over two years instead of Japan's original offer of
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Japan also agreed to reconsider its methods of setting the fees
paid by NTT's competitors to use its network, which U.S. officials
said should have a more widespread effect on reducing fees and
enhancing competition in 2002 and thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most significant element of the deal is how it
came together. That process ruptured long-standing relationships
among regulators, politicians and NTT, and those rifts may lead to
sweeping changes in regulatory structure here and in the structure
of NTT itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``By how many percent interconnection fees are cut and whether
it takes place over two or three years is not really very
important,'' said Harumasa Sato, a professor at Konan University in
Kobe and a telecommunications policy expert. ``The important thing
is that it may lead to fundamental reform of regulation that will
create fair competition in this market.''
</P>
<P>
   The broader scope of the agreement came about in part because of
the way the U.S. trade representative's office fought for it. US.
negotiators moved the debate out of the confines of the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications, which regulates telecommunications,
and into a broader public view.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while past U.S.-Japanese trade fights over issues like
film distribution, car parts and flat glass failed to capture the
imagination of ordinary citizens, the public took a major interest
in this fight, and Japanese politicians noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher embarked on a calculated campaign to make the issue
relevant to consumers in Japan, giving numerous interviews to the
Japanese media and using easily understood examples of why high
connection fees hurt Japan's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly bemoaned the fact that only 10 percent of Japanese
elementary and middle school students could connect to the Internet
because charges were so high. He asked why his daughter paid less
than $9 a month for Internet service in the United States while her
Japanese friend in Tokyo paid eight times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should a Japanese girl be at such a disadvantage to an
American girl?'' he asked over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently made his case, because with the exception of one
newspaper known for its strong conservative editorial view, Japan's
major dailies all supported sharp reductions in connection fees.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese industry also spoke out. The business federation known
as Keidanren, which represents Japan's giant blue-chip
organizations, argued for lower connection fees, and Hiroshi
Mikitani, the founder and president of Japan's biggest e-commerce
site, Rakuten Ichiba, commissioned a study about the impact of the
fees on Japan's ability to harness the information technology
revolution, which he then used to advocate lower charges.
</P>
<P>
   NTT's Japanese competitors weighed in on the side of lower
rates, as did European and American companies attempting to break
into the market. Even some of the companies under the NTT umbrella,
which also pay fees for connecting with the lines owned by the
regional telephone companies that are their cousins, complained.
</P>
<P>
   The concerted effort worked, and around the beginning of the
year, influential politicians began to question the postal
ministry's arguments for only modest reductions in the connection
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that its position on fees was now politically
unacceptable, NTT officials offered to accede to U.S. demands in
exchange for pledges from sympathetic politicians that they would
work to abolish the NTT Law, which restricts the company from
entering other types of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal appealed to Hiromu Nonaka, who is perhaps the most
powerful politician in Japan and the secretary-general of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Among his many roles, Nonaka
serves as the chieftain of the ``postal'' tribe in the Parliament,
a large group of politicians with strong ties to the postal
ministry and to NTT.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, Fisher said, it was Nonaka who struck the deal
on connection fees that emerged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said the breakthrough came when Nonaka invited him and
other U.S. officials, including Ambassador Thomas Foley, to a
Tuesday morning meeting. It began with a 20-minute monologue by
Nonaka.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a very erudite and extremely thorough discussion
about how Japan needed to come into the IT age and needed to
restructure NTT to do that,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   One hour after the meeting ended, Fisher said, the postal
ministry called the embassy and asked for a meeting that resulted
in the agreement.

BOEING POSTS SECOND QUARTER GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. offered fresh evidence it has bounced
back from an engineering strike as well as some production woes
Wednesday, posting a 26 percent jump in second quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The gains don't reflect one-time charges that took away the
profits on paper.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of the company's aircraft deliveries _ 167 in the
second quarter _ demonstrates a healthy demand for aircraft and
continuing productivity improvements at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the aerospace giant recorded $654 million in adjusted
net earnings during the second quarter, up from $520 million a year
ago. However, those figures don't include a one-time charge in 2000
and a windfall in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have recovered from the depths of despair, but there is
still a lot of upside by going to new levels of efficiencies,''
said William Fiala, an analyst at the investment firm Edward D.
Jones &AMP; Co. ``It was a lot of good news on all fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all good news. The company suffered a one-time $34
million loss tied to the launch a mock payload on a Delta III
rocket next month. Boeing also enjoyed a one-time $181 million gain
the year before thanks to a tax settlement. When the items are
added to Boeing's performance the company's earnings fell 11
percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors welcomed the company's latest financial
snapshot, pushing Boeing shares up $.75 to close at $45.88 in
trading Wednesday. Over the past two days, Boeing shares rose
$1.91.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most encouraging signs of the quarter was a jump in
operating margins, a key barometer of profitability, at Boeing's
commercial airplane division. Operating margins hit 8.9 percent at
the unit, up from 4.4 percent during the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement was driven, in part, by the fact that many of
the 167 airplanes delivered in the quarter were essentially built
in the first quarter, according to Boeing Chairman Phil Condit.
Boeing delivered just 75 planes in the first quarter as it
struggled with a 40-day engineering strike.
</P>
<P>
   The company also raised its revenue estimates to $51 billion
from $50 billion in 2000 and to $53 billion from $51 billion in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The increase was built, in part, on the back of the company's
expectation that commercial airplane deliveries will jump between 5
and 10 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty stable market,'' Condit said during a
telephone briefing with reporters and financial analysts. It's a
``period that we have not really seen before ... relative
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the aircraft market, Boeing and rival Airbus Industrie
continue to battle over new orders. In recent months, Boeing has
landed a series of high-profile orders, including one for 94
single-aisle 737s from Southwest Airlines Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not seeing big shifts on the pricing side. (It's)
fairly stable and remains an ... aggressive market,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also delivered some bad news. The company's military
aircraft and missile unit reported problems in its helicopter work.
Executives didn't identify the issues, saying they expect to fix
the problems in the coming months. Overall, the military unit
posted $250 million in operating revenues in the second quarter,
down from $368 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chief Financial Officer Michael Sears also said the unit
is seeking international customers for its F-15 fighter. But he
characterized the line as ``warm'' as the company waits for
additional congressional funding.
</P>
<P>
   And the Space and Communications unit posted an operating loss
of $38 million, down steeply from $94 million in earnings a year
ago. Boeing blamed the loss on research and development costs and
the expense of launching the Delta II mock payload.
</P>
<P>
   The financial report offered few details about the question on
the minds of many Boeing employees: where and when executives may
decide to sell another plant, operation or asset.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have been swirling around the company's Auburn, Wash.,
fabrication plant and other units about an impending sale. Condit
didn't discuss possible sales, but he said Boeing has several
options to handle underutilized assets as it reviews its
operations. Executives could sell a unit outright, consolidate its
work or free up space and sell the real estate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be looking at our business and trying to
maximize asset utilization. Where we have a plant that is
underutilized we are going to address that issue,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also reported that its research and development budget is
growing. The company spent $375 million on research in the second
quarter, compared to $350 million in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the spending is now flowing to Boeing's new Connexion
project, which will offer airline passengers access to e-mail, the
Internet and computer networks during their flights.

NUGENT SCRATCHED FROM CONCERT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``Stranglehold.'' ``Paralyzed.'' ``Homebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Choose your favorite Ted Nugent hit. It seems to describe the
rocker's prospects of opening for KISS at the Cynthia Woods
Mitchell Pavilion in The Woodlands on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Pace Entertainment released a statement saying the concert
promoter and Nugent's management both confirm that the Motor City
Madman will not be playing with KISS in the Houston area this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is the result of Nugent's onstage rant about an
English-language-only America when he played with KISS in Houston
in April.
</P>
<P>
   The decision has left Nugent fuming, the local League of United
Latin American Citizens feeling vindicated and Pace Entertainment
closing the books on the entire matter.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bob Roux, Pace Entertainment regional vice president
of SFX Music, said Nugent could play only if he agreed to sign a
conduct agreement attached to the concert contract. Nugent didn't
sign the agreement, but thought he would be able to play on the
bill just as he had at more than 90 other concerts with KISS since
March.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nugent concedes that is not going to happen. He also hinted
that his dismissal in Houston might not be the end of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It's the) land of the free, home of the brave, 'cept for
white guys, I guess,'' said Nugent in an e-mail to the Houston
Chronicle following the confirmation he would not be playing. ``The
lawyers are hammering as we speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Banker, Nugent's manager of 20 years, said that he had
never been presented with a ``sign to play'' agreement concerning
the Michigan-based rocker. He called the stipulation for Nugent
``unjust and an infringement on his First Amendment rights.'' He
declined to comment on any legal action that Nugent might consider
against Pace, but said Nugent is exploring his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of the fact that they are requiring us to sign (the
agreement), Ted will not play,'' Banker said Wednesday. ``Ted won't
compromise his values and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace Entertainment had no other comment on the matter beyond the
one-sentence statement announcing that Nugent would not be playing.
</P>
<P>
   That statement finished a ``will he or won't he play'' saga that
began June 30 when Pace announced that the KISS farewell tour would
be returning to the Houston area. The tour first passed through
Houston on April 1 with both Nugent and Skid Row opening.
</P>
<P>
   At that show, Nugent, dressed in a Confederate flag T-shirt,
said that people living in the United States should leave if they
don't learn English. He appeared to be addressing Mexicans in
particular by speaking a few words of Spanish, followed by his
thoughts about the ``abusive Mexican government.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks left Woodlands Pavilion officials vowing that Nugent
would never play the venue again and LULAC officials calling for a
boycott of his merchandise and tours. News that Nugent would not be
returning with KISS was met with relief and victory by local LULAC
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with the courageous action taken by The
Woodlands,'' says Johnny Mata, LULAC's District 18 director of
media and communications. ``It shows that a united community can
correct any wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the KISS-Nugent date in April, local LULAC districts
worked with the association's national leaders to organize a
boycott of Nugent's concerts and albums. LULAC is still upholding
that boycott.

DISCUSSIONS ON ERASING DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN RICH AND POOR
NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to name other companies on the task force in graf before
optional end.)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A group of high-technology executives urged the
wealthiest nations Wednesday to take action to erase a growing
digital divide resulting from the economic chasm separating the
developed and developing worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The perception that the world is increasingly being divided into
information technology haves and have-nots is among the topics that
the seven leading industrial nations and Russia will take up at
their annual summit meeting, which begins Friday in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   A task force established by the World Economic Forum, a policy
organization made up of many of the world's largest corporations
that meets annually in Davos, Switzerland, presented on Wednesday a
series of policy proposals on the issue to Japan's prime minister,
Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here, members of the World Economic Forum
task force appeared sensitive to the issue of self-interest on the
part of the large corporations backing significant financial
investment in high-technology spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about self-interest,'' said Vernon J. Ellis,
international chairman of Andersen Consulting. ``There is nothing
wrong with self-interest, as long as it is enlightened long-term
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force, including the chief executives of Sony Corp. and
Toshiba Corp., Japan's two largest consumer electronics firms,
proposed a set of principles including telecommunications and
Internet deregulations, universal access to education and
technology training, as well as support and financing for small
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, prepared at the request of the Japanese government
at the Davos meeting, also includes ideas like the creation of a
Peace Corps-style volunteer group, the Global Digital Opportunity
Corps; the establishment of local technology community centers; and
the establishment of e-chambers of commerce to support
technology-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese high-technology executives said Wednesday evening that
Mori planned to announce at the summit meeting that Japan would
commit $12 billion in loans and $3 billion in Overseas Development
Assistance funds over five years to information-technology
initiatives in the developing world. The move is intended to prompt
similar commitments from other countries to integrate developing
nations into the world's expanding digital infrastructure, a
Japanese executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who acknowledged this week that he is a computer novice
and has only recently learned how to use a mouse, appeared
Wednesday afternoon with an international group of high-technology
executives to underscore his nation's commitment to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to make this an information technology discussion,
mainly focusing on the developing nations,'' Mori said. ``This
digital divide issue is a crucial matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a global digital divide has been seized on in the
past year by corporate executives eager to prove they are socially
responsible. But there is disagreement over what the divide
represents and how permanent it is.
</P>
<P>
   A number of economists and technologists believe the world
income gap created by the industrial revolution may still be the
fundamental dividing line between rich and poor nations rather than
the question of access to technology.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the task force said that the digital divide should
not overshadow the traditional issues that define rich and poor
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a digital divide, said Richard Li, chairman
and chief executive of the Pacific Century Group. ``It is an
education divide, and information technology is only a conduit to
promote education.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies represented on the task force include Sun
Microsystems, Microsoft, Yahoo, 3Com, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard,
Novell and Alcatel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sony's chairman, Nobuyuki Idei, acknowledged that his company
had struggled with its own internal digital divide and had been
slow to deploy information technology among its workers. ``This is
a good indication of the problems that will confront us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Schwab, the founder and chairman of the World Economic
Forum, said in an interview this week that he believed that
inexpensive digital wireless technology systems would increasingly
spread in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally feel that a breakthrough is coming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said on Monday that information technology holds
promise for creating economic opportunity as well as improving
access to health care and education. But they noted that while
there are now an estimated 332 million people connected via the
Internet around the world, only 1 percent live in Africa. And less
then 5 percent of the computers connected to the Internet are in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The officials would not offer any U.S. commitment or pledge of a
specific dollar amount to help bridge the digital divide. But they
said they would welcome such proposals from other nations at the
summit meeting and from the U.S. private sector.

NEW YORK TIMES EXECUTIVE JOINING LOS ANGELES TIMES AS MANAGING
EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dean Baquet, the national editor of The New York Times, was
appointed by the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday as managing editor
and its No. 2 newsroom executive.
</P>
<P>
   Baquet, who won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting
in 1988, is the second top editor appointed by the Los Angeles
Times from outside since March, when the Tribune Co. announced its
purchase of the newspaper's parent, the Times Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the Chandlers, the Los Angeles Times' controlling
family, agreed to sell their holdings to the Tribune Co., which is
based in Chicago, Tribune executives appointed John S. Carroll,
editor of the Baltimore Sun, to replace Michael Parks as editor in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun was part of Times Mirror and is now owned by Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the Los Angeles Times has been a site of
controversial and continually revised experiments with newsroom
management. Most memorable was a deal to split profits from a
Sunday magazine, whose coverage was devoted to a new downtown
sports arena, with the arena's management.
</P>
<P>
   Baquet, 43, has a low-key, informal management style that
matches Carroll's. Baquet will oversee all the newsroom
departments. Newsroom executives at the Los Angeles Times said that
in the past three months, Carroll had shunned meetings, preferring
to leave his door open for reporters and editors to drop by.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the newsroom was reverting to ``a more traditional
management structure'' and jettisoning the top-heavy structure of
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Until early this year, the Los Angeles Times had four managing
editors; it now has two _ Karen Wada and John Arthur _ and an
executive editor, Leo Wolinsky. Their new titles and roles ``will
be worked out over the next several weeks,'' Carroll told his staff
in a memorandum Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baquet won the Pulitzer as leader of a team of reporters for the
Chicago Tribune that uncovered self-dealing and waste in the
Chicago City Council. At the time, the Tribune's No. 2 editor was
Jack Fuller, who is now president of the Tribune Co.'s newspaper
division. Baquet joined The New York Times in 1990 as an
investigative reporter and has been national editor for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Times is a hard place to leave,'' Baquet said
Wednesday. ``I just think that the Los Angeles Times would be a
fun, exciting place to be right now. It has a lot of talent. The
thought of working with John Carroll and going to a paper that was
good but was also about to take on new leadership was
irresistible.''

MAN WHO DIED IS CHECKED FOR WEST NILE VIRUS
</HEADLINE>
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal health authorities are analyzing the blood of
a 71-year-old man who died Wednesday on Staten Island to see if he
was infected with the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whom hospital and government officials did not
identify, was taken to St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten
Island on July 5 complaining of a headache, fever and confusion.
Those symptoms are sometimes associated with encephalitis, which
can be caused by West Nile, a mosquito-borne virus. The man, who
was visiting from South Carolina, died early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said it was just as likely that the man died of
an illness other than West Nile. ``It is highly premature for
people to assume this gentleman was infected with West Nile
virus,'' said Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city health commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several viruses peak in July and August and cause
encephalitis, especially among children and the elderly, health
officials said. And the Staten Island patient, Cohen said, ``had a
number of debilitating health conditions that may have been
responsible for his illness and his deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   But because crows infected with the virus were found on Staten
Island earlier this month, Health Department officials took blood
and spinal fluid samples from the man Tuesday to be sure that he
was not New York's first human case of the virus this year. Last
year, the virus sickened 62 people, killing 7 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that test results from the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta were expected
on Thursday or Friday. ``At this point there are several competing
hypotheses for his illness,'' Giuliani said. ``In other words, West
Nile is not the only possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, 32 mosquitoes with evidence of the virus have been
found in Westchester and Suffolk Counties, and 25 birds with
confirmed infections have been discovered on Staten Island and in
Rockland, Westchester and Suffolk Counties in New York and in
Bergen County in New Jersey. But there have not been any confirmed
cases in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The finding of dead birds and animals has led to the resumption
of pesticide spraying in several counties, many of which had
already taken preventive measures to kill mosquitoes since the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Staten Island was scheduled to be sprayed with insecticide on
Wednesday night and Thursday morning.

 FORD, SUED IN AIR BAG CASE, SAYS VICTIM WAS STRANGLED  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co., accused by a New Jersey man of killing his
wife when her air bag inflated during a car crash three years ago,
is defending itself by asserting that the woman was actually
strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's assertion has enraged the man and his lawyers, who are
seeking to expand a lawsuit to include defamation charges against
the automaker. Ford, the lawyers said Wednesday, should pay heavy
punitive damages for trying to avoid taking responsibility for a
faulty product by tacitly suggesting that their client murdered his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Kruzel, a Ford spokeswoman, said the company merely
wanted to bring evidence in the case to the prosecutor's attention.
``Our goal is to defend our product,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The case dates from Feb. 9, 1997, when Tracy Thomas, 37, a
former ballet dancer who was six months pregnant, died after the
Ford Explorer she was driving skidded into a utility pole at a
speed of about 15 miles per hour, not far from her home in Cape May
Courthouse, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Dr. Eric Thomas, is suing Ford in U.S. District
Court in Camden, N.J., claiming that his wife was killed by the
force of an air bag deploying at 200 mph. Dr. Thomas was riding in
the passenger seat, and the couple's young daughter, who also
survived, was in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is seeking unspecified compensatory damages for the loss
of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Thomas' death was ruled an accident by the Cape May County
prosecutor's office, which administered a lie detector test to Dr.
Thomas at his own lawyer's request. He passed the test.
</P>
<P>
   The accident is among 60 low-speed traffic deaths that the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has investigated
since 1990 and found to have been caused by air bags. Tim Hurd, a
spokesman for the highway safety agency, said the cause in the
agency's file is taken directly from the coroner's report, and
reads, ``Blunt trauma to neck with asphyxia.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the evidence presented by Ford during the pretrial
discovery phase is a report by a pathologist it hired who concluded
that Tracy Thomas was not killed by the air bag. ``In my opinion,
Thomas died of compression of the neck by the hands of another,''
wrote the pathologist, Dr. Michael M. Baden.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mellon, a lawyer for Dr. Thomas, said Baden's conclusion
conflicted with findings of the county prosecutor, the coroner and
the highway safety agency. He also said Ford tried to persuade the
county prosecutor to reopen the case as a criminal investigation in
an attempt to intimidate his client into dropping the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has hired Floyd Abrams, a well-known specialist in First
Amendment cases. Abrams appeared at a pretrial hearing on Tuesday
to oppose a motion to expand the suit to include the defamation
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams argued that lawyers should be given broad latitude to say
and do things in their clients' defense, even if, in other
circumstances, those things might be grounds for defamation or
other charges. If the judge allows the defamation charge, Abrams
said, it could set a precedent that ``would chill the bar from
doing its job of representing clients.''

NINE TOP RIDERS PASS SURPRISE BLOOD TESTS
</HEADLINE>
  By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ At no time was the D-word uttered during
the Tour de France Wednesday. On a day when Lance Armstrong
maintained his lead while two other well-known racers dropped out
of the event, a handful of the 20 teams were tested for drugs.
Armstrong and the race's eight other top riders passed the surprise
blood test taken in their hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The D-word was not voiced thereafter, so at least verbally in
this 87th Tour de France, drugs are nonexistent. But in the next
few months, urine samples that have been taken daily from the stage
winner, the overall leader and two riders selected at random will
be subject to a new examination developed at the French national
drug testing laboratory. The samples, which are flown daily to the
laboratory outside Paris, have been frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Once the new testing technique is medically, and thus legally,
approved _ as it was not before the Tour started on July 1 _ the
names of those detected using such illegal performance-enhancing
drugs as EPO will be announced and the riders will be stripped of
their honors, if any.
</P>
<P>
   The testing is the latest step in an understated official effort
to prove the goodwill and integrity of the Tour and the cycling
union after the drug scandal that plagued the race in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday the focus was on Erik Dekker. A Dutchman with the
Rabobank team, Dekker won his third stage in a mass sprint finish
into Lausanne, easily beating Erik Zabel, a German with Telekom, in
second place, and Fred Rodriguez, an American with Mapei, in third.
</P>
<P>
   The way Dekker was rolling Wednesday, he might even win the
customary sprint on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday. He completed the
155-kilometer (96.3-mile) run from Evian les Bains in 3 hours 24
minutes 53 seconds, a speed of 45 kilometers an hour (28 mph).
</P>
<P>
   The stage began and ended on opposite sides, French and then
Swiss, of Lake Geneva, which was dotted with sail and motorboats,
their wakes shimmering in a hot sun.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the U.S. leader of the U.S. Postal Service team,
continued in the yellow jersey of overall top dog, 5:37 ahead of
Jan Ullrich, a German with Telekom, and 6:38 ahead of Joseba
Beloki, a Spaniard with Festina.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-seven riders among the 130 left in the Tour finished in
the same time as the leaders, with the rest left behind to admire
the nearby vineyards climbing the hills on stone terraces in the
Swiss manner.
</P>
<P>
   There were two significant dropouts: Marco Pantani, the Italian
leader of Mercatone Uno, the winner of two mountain stages, the
Tour champion in 1998 and the highest name on Armstrong's hit list,
failed to start because of a reported case of dysentery. He faded
badly in the mountains Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The other casualty was Alex Zuelle, a Swiss with Banesto, who
finished second overall to Armstrong last year. Seeking to move up
a notch, he changed his entire training regime for the Tour and has
been invisible since the start. As the stage passed Swiss alpine
meadows where newly cut hay scented the air green, Zuelle
apparently thought of his nearby home and dropped out.

TORRICELLI SAYS HE IS EAGER TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Saying he alone could repair his party's deep
wounds and sweep Democrats back to control of both houses of the
Legislature, U.S. Sen. Robert G. Torricelli said Wednesday for the
first time that he was eager to run for governor of New Jersey and
boasted that he had already won the backing of most of the county
Democratic organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that last month's bitter U.S. Senate primary might
merely be replaced with another bloody intraparty conflict,
Torricelli and Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, the man who
until a week ago had been the lone front-runner for the Democratic
nomination, dispensed with intermediaries and sniped at each other.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two weeks, Torricelli has been jockeying for
support behind the scenes, but not acknowledging his intentions
publicly. Wednesday, he still shrank from officially declaring
himself a candidate, but nonetheless said he was frustrated by the
slow pace of change in Washington and had reached ``the point in
life where I would like to actually achieve something.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, he said the governor's office had been
a lifelong ambition and denied that he saw it merely as a
steppingstone to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   For McGreevey, who has described Torricelli as a close friend,
the senator had only faint praise Wednesday. He said McGreevey had
a ``tremendous future in elective or appointive office.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli also made several pointed references to perceptions
that McGreevey was too dependent on a few powerful state
legislators for support. ``I've made it clear that people should
understand that if I become a candidate for governor, there'll be
no deals, no arrangements, no winks, no nods,'' he said. ``There'll
be no Rasputins, no one whispering through side doors.''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey, meanwhile, responded tersely with a reference to past
questions about Torricelli's ethics. ``Considering Senator
Torricelli's track record, that indeed is a remarkable comment,''
he said, refusing to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said he would run only if he could unify the
Democratic Party's northern-central and South Jersey factions,
which exploded into all-out warfare during the Senate primary
between Jon S. Corzine and former Gov. Jim Florio. But in the next
breath, he said, ``Most of the counties in northern Jersey and
almost all in southern New Jersey have come together of a common
mind'' to support his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He added that his supporters included Florio and former Rep.
William Hughes in South Jersey; Reps. Frank E. Pallone of Monmouth
County and Bill Pascrell of Passaic County; and Michael Murphy, a
former Morris County prosecutor. The last three, he said, are
interested in challenging McGreevey themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can unite almost all of them,'' he said. ``Otherwise
I think there's likely to be a Democratic primary of four or five
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey, who has refused to abandon his own candidacy,
dismissed the senator's claims of overwhelming support as
``rhetoric'' and maintained that he would prevail in a primary with
Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   But McGreevey said the senator was putting his ambitions ahead
of the party's goals in the presidential and congressional
elections. ``The irony is that while Bob Torricelli allegedly
discusses unity, his actions will inevitably produce a very
divisive primary,'' McGreevey said. ``The self-serving actions of
Senator Torricelli are not premised upon electing a Democratic
majority on the federal level, but only serving his personal
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said he had been approached for months by Democrats
in New Jersey but became interested only after the Senate primary.
``If these wounds are not healed, the next gubernatorial election
is going to be lost,'' he said. ``There are Democrats in the
southern and northern Assembly caucuses who will not go in the same
room.''
</P>
<P>
   He even went so far as to outline the makings of a campaign
platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States Senate has been enormously rewarding, and I
feel I've made a real difference, but we're not making a difference
on a large enough scale,'' he said. ``The point I've made is, can
we actually win a sufficiently convincing victory to do things like
establishing statewide day care, mandatory school instruction at
age 4, buying enough open space to limit suburban sprawl, expanding
our prescription drug program to include middle-income people, and
establishing clinics in the state where pregnant women can get care
in rural and urban areas?''

FORT WORTH CHURCH OFFICIALS SAY THEY WON'T EVER ACCEPT FEMALE
PRIESTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JIM JONES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Defiant officials of the Episcopal Diocese
of Fort Worth say they won't bend to the national church's demand
that they accept women as priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stay and fight for the right to believe what we
believe,'' said the Rev. Canon Charles Hough, a close associate of
Fort Worth Episcopal Bishop Jack Iker. ``They are asking us to do
something we can't do. It's a matter of conscience for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Iker, who is on vacation, could not be reached to comment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Iker has been one of the leading challengers to ordaining
female priests, saying it goes against his understanding of church
tradition and biblical teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Fort Worth proponents are taking heart from the
national ultimatum and are saying it is time for the 23-county
local diocese to comply with a 26-year-old church law opening the
priesthood to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are living in the dark ages,'' said Peter Tringham, a
member of Trinity Episcopal Church and a longtime proponent of
women in the priesthood. ``It's a done deal. We have 1,700 female
clergy now across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But none is in Fort Worth _ or is likely to be anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   More pressure was put on Iker and bishops of two other dioceses
to accept female priests during final sessions of the Episcopal
Church U.S.A.'s general convention, which ended Friday in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates approved a much-debated resolution calling for a
``task force'' to visit and assist the dioceses of Fort Worth,
Quincy (Ill.) and San Joaquin (Calif.) to develop an action plan to
make sure they accept female priests by Sept. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The task force will make semiannual reports to the Episcopal
Church Executive Council on how the dioceses are progressing.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 100 U.S. dioceses, three were targeted for oversight. The
resolution notes a lack of progress in accepting female priests in
Fort Worth and in Quincy, Ill., where the Right Rev. Keith Ackerman
is bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Some progress is being made in the Diocese of San Joaquin, based
in Fresno, Calif., the resolution states. But Michael Adari, a
parishioner in that diocese, said he does not see any progress.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fort Worth, the diocese has no female priests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop John David Schofield ``has vowed never to allow a woman
priest here,'' Adari said.
</P>
<P>
   Adari's wife, Maryly, is being assisted by an Episcopal bishop
in Sacramento in her quest to become a priest, her husband said.
Schofield refused to help her meet the requirements to become a
priest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schofield could not be reached to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Iker and retired Fort Worth bishops before him _ Donald Davies
and Clarence Pope _ have been leading Episcopal traditionalists who
say ordaining women contradicts Scripture and church traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Parishes select their priests, but the bishop has input. Iker
and his predecessors have encouraged conservative priests to take
positions in the diocese and promoted them to leadership roles. The
diocese covers 23 counties and has about 19,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   But many Fort Worth Episcopalians, and some priests, are
strongly supportive of women in the priesthood. Some female priests
have been brought into the Fort Worth diocese as visiting clergy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Fred Barber, rector of Trinity Episcopal Church,
allowed a visiting female priest to assist in celebrating Mass with
him two weeks before the general convention, said Katie Sherrod, a
leader of the national Episcopal Women's Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Barber informed Iker that he might invite a woman to help
celebrate Mass, Sherrod said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is kind of a `Don't ask, don't tell arrangement,'
'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth diocese has adopted a ``Dallas plan,'' which Iker
says complies with requirements that the priesthood be open to
women.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the Fort Worth diocese who are called to the priesthood
are put under the supervision of Bishop Jack Stanton of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman becomes a priest, Stanton _ not Iker _ would issue
her priesthood license. And, she would be under the spiritual
direction of Stanton even though the church would remain part of
the Fort Worth diocese in terms of finances and organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrod said the Dallas plan is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our diocese is 17 years old, and during that time any woman
who wanted to be ordained had to leave,'' she said. ``All the
Dallas plan does is say she must go to the diocese in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   If Iker stands firm in not complying with church laws, he faces
the possibility of undergoing a church trial and the potential of
being ousted as a bishop under a long, complicated process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, that could happen,'' Hough said. ``But there are
bishops in the church who are allowing the blessing of same-sex
unions (which is prohibited under Episcopal Church teachings), and
no one is stopping them from doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishops are rarely removed. During the Episcopal General
Convention, bishops strongly approved the resolution on pushing
dioceses to accept women as priests, but they also approved a
``mind of the house'' resolution calling for a pastoral approach
and for respect of bishops who hold minority views.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Durham, a member of All Saints Episcopal Church, said he
favors the national church's decision to speed up acceptance of
female priests in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would not seek out a female priest personally,'' he
said. ``But I don't think the diocese should deny women the right
to be a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he would like the leadership of the Fort Worth diocese to
be more in line with the national church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I feel more like a Fort Worth Episcopalian than a
national Episcopalian,'' Durham said. ``I love Fort Worth, but I
want to be part of the whole church.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton waged an all-out effort
Wednesday night to salvage the nine-day Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks at Camp David, shuttling between the two sides against an
early morning deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing reporters at 5:30 p.m., Clinton's spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, said that the talks were at a ``pivotal moment'' and that
the president was ``exploring every possible avenue'' for an
agreement. The talks then returned to the secrecy which has
surrounded them from the outset, and the hours ticked on.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton was still planning to leave by early
morning Thursday on a trip to Japan already delayed by one day.
Officials said the president would probably make a statement before
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   But after a high-tension day of rapidly shifting moods, it
remained unclear to the final hours whether he would be pronouncing
an end to a bitter, 52-year conflict, announcing a partial
solution, or proclaiming an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Clinton shuttled between the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders _ fending off an Israeli initiative to leave
early and returned repeatedly to his advisers and to the
negotiators in search of some formula that would save the summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   During the summit meeting, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel
and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, apparently dealt with
every issue in their conflict _ from borders and the fate of Jewish
settlements to the right of return of Palestinian refugees and the
status of Jerusalem. But it was unclear on Wednesday whether the
ultimate stumbling block was a single issue, like Jerusalem, or the
trade-offs needed to fashion an overall agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Each side was gearing up to lay the blame for a failed summit
meeting squarely on the other, and each leader appealed privately
to Clinton in letters written in the last 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of the high-tension, high-stakes day see-sawed. At
midday, it seemed certain that the talks were fizzling out. By
early evening, when the parties were still entrenched at Camp David
and tentatively scheduled final news conferences were postponed, it
seemed possible that Clinton would be able to pull out an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The day started out with the declaration of a midnight deadline,
which would allow Clinton to depart for Japan by early Thursday
morning _ a departure he had already delayed by a day in a final
bid to rescue the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But the day built to an unexpectedly quick first climax, when
the Israeli journalists accompanying Barak were ordered in the
afternoon to rush to their hotels for a security check so that
their luggage could be shuttled to Andrews Air Force Base for an 8
p.m. departure for Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock ran down, expectations were rife that there had
been a breakdown. Israeli television reported, and a U.S. official
later confirmed, that Barak had sent a letter to Clinton announcing
the prime minister's departure and laid the blame for the summit
meeting's failure on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian side is conducting negotiations insincerely
and is not willing to negotiate in a serious and practical manner
for a permanent peace between us,'' an Israeli reporter cited as a
direct quotation from the letter.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Palestinian negotiator, Abu Mazen, who himself was
heading to the airport to fly home to his son's wedding, brushed
off what he saw as an eleventh-hour Israeli tactic to increase
pressure on the Palestinians. Talks were ongoing, he said, and the
fate of Jerusalem, a seemingly intractable issue, was still on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television reported that Barak sent Arafat a message
that he was willing to return to Camp David for another round of
talks but that he might not still be prime minister by then.
Palestinian officials reported, in turn, that Arafat, seeing this
as a threat, retorted that if he made too many concessions, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas
group, would be taking his place.
</P>
<P>
   Washington reporters were told that Clinton, by himself, might
address reporters at the White House at 6 p.m., and that Barak, by
himself, would speak shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 5:30, in a briefing at the Thurmont Elementary School
some 5 miles from Camp David, an announcement by Lockhart gave the
final day an extended lease on life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been going at this now nonstop for nine days in this
session,'' Lockhart said. ``I think we've obviously reached a
pivotal moment in these talks and I can't predict how it will come
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that as he spoke, Clinton was sitting down at the
retreat's Birch Cabin to his second face-to-face session Wednesday
with the Arafat. Clinton had met with Barak earlier in the day, but
in what observers considered a sign of trouble, the two Middle East
leaders remained apart all day.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the changing dynamic of refreshed momentum, Israeli
journalists returned to the press filing center, where one, Keren
Neubach, announced breathlessly that their bags were being returned
from the Air Force base to the Hampton Inn where they were staying.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton also received a letter from Arafat,
which arrived on Tuesday, before Barak's. He did not characterize
its contents, but Palestinian officials said that Arafat had
reached a peak of frustration on the eighth day.
</P>
<P>
   If news of the letters lowered expectations of a deal, Lockhart
reported that Clinton had managed by late afternoon to keep the
leaders from walking out. ''They are still there, they are all
still talking,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart made clear that the two leaders were having trouble
making concessions on deeply emotional issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders both want to go home with an agreement,'' Lockhart
said. ``The problem is the substance and structure of the
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the extended deadline would have to stand.
``There comes a time when you have to put a time limit on
discussions,'' he said.

   During the day, Clinton telephoned other leaders in the Middle
East to brief them on the developments, the first such contacts
since the summit meeting began.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that an ultimate sticking point concerned the future
status of Jerusalem, the most divisive issue and one that has never
before been negotiated by Israeli and Arab leaders. It was seen as
the make-or-break issue, but it is possible that other stumbling
blocks remained, too.
</P>
<P>
   After conquering East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, Israel declared that the city would ``eternally''
remain united and under exclusive Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The visit of the Egyptian leader, Anwar el-Sadat, to Jerusalem
in the fall of 1977 was interpreted by the Israelis as recognition
of Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital. But a year later, at the
first Camp David summit meeting between Sadat and Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin, the question of Jerusalem threatened to
scuttle the entire conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Carter tried to find some sort of symbolic solution _
such as flying Muslim flags on the Temple Mount _ but the
suggestions were rejected by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oslo agreement of 1993, under which Israel recognized the
Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinians renounced
all violence against Israel, the future of Jerusalem, along with
the fate of Palestinian refugees, final borders and some other
issues, was left for ``final status'' talks. The official position
of the United States has been that the fate of Jerusalem must be
negotiated between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last seven years, diplomats, professors, demographers
and officials from both sides have tried to come up with various
arrangements that could satisfy the demands of both sides,
including ideas that involved ``autonomy'' for Palestinian
neighborhoods in Jerusalem and allowing the Palestinians to claim
the neighboring village of Abu Dis as their Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But these ideas were dismissed by the Palestinians as a ``Jewish
solution.'' Abu Dis, they argued, is not Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have watched Arafat over many years say that he always
set a benchmark: He would not be the Palestinian who went down in
history as the one who gave up Arab claims to East Jerusalem as the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, they point out, was not asking for a divided city but
rather shared sovereignty in an open and undivided city. Offering
municipal control over some neighborhoods, they said, fell far
short.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, for Barak, making concessions on a city that many
Jews regard as their capital by divine fiat was extremely
difficult.

GORE ADDS TEXAS STOP 
TO CHALLENGE BUSH

<P>
   RAYTOWN, Mo. _ Sensing a breach in George W. Bush's Texas
battlements, Vice President Al Gore abruptly changed travel plans
Wednesday and will challenge the Texas governor's budget priorities
not far from the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's troops can't wait till he gets there.
</P>
<P>
   Before touting a crime-fighting initiative in this Kansas City
suburb, Gore said Bush should justify his decision to cut taxes for
the wealthy in Texas while the state's budget surplus dwindled. He
said he plans to spotlight the issue in San Antonio this afternoon
along with the states' approach to children's health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Governor Bush's leadership, Texas has gone from its
biggest budget surplus ever to a budget shortfall,'' Gore told
police at the Raytown City Hall. ``Now we learn that at a time of
national prosperity _ indeed, the longest economic boom in the
history of America _ Texas has saved less for the future than
almost every other state in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's so-called rainy day fund could barely withstand a
drizzle,'' Gore said, adding that by this fall, there may only be
enough money to keep the state government running for a single day.
``There would be a real problem if Texas had a rainy season.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer issued a statement
saying: ``If Al Gore wants to talk about progress and prosperity
there is no place like Texas, where taxes are low, budget surpluses
are high and we even have a bipartisan patient bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   And Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander, who will announce
in Austin Thursday that Texas is in good financial shape, asked
Gore for the opportunity to brief him ``on the facts about our
state budget and our current surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Rylander's invitation were state Sen. Bill Ratliff,
R-Mount Pleasant, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and
state Rep. Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's trip is the latest development in a growing debate over
state budget overruns, projected to be about $610 million, but
expected to be covered by an unexpected surplus in sales tax
revenue. Gore, the likely Democratic presidential candidate, has
charged that his GOP rival has irresponsibly put $1.7 billion in
tax cuts for the wealthy ahead of providing health insurance for
the state's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major issues of this whole election is, what will
our priorities be for the next four years,'' Gore told reporters.
``Will we be for the people or for the powerful? If we have a
budget surplus, what will we do with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Democratic state Sen. Mario Gallegos has accused
Rylander and Republican leaders of cooking the state budget books
to make Bush look good in the final months of the presidential
campaign. Gallegos has demanded an independent audit, while others,
including the state's highest ranking Democrat, Texas House Speaker
Pete Laney, have praised the governor's efforts in working with the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bush's record in Texas matters. The fate of the
federal government's surplus would be in his Republican rival's
hands if he is elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Governor Bush has run Texas is relevant to the judgment
the American people will make as to how he would run the country if
they gave him the chance,'' Gore said, ``especially when he is
calling for the same priorities that gave Texas its budget
shortfall in a time of unprecedented prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, said the Gore campaign had been
considering the diversion to Texas for several days and Wednesday
was finalizing plans. The goal, he said, was to reinforce the
differences between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Later, reporters asked Gore about the comparisons that would be
drawn between his new strategy of trying to attack and define his
opponent on his home turf and an earlier presidential campaign:
Bush's father, former President Bush, buoyed by 1988 polls that
showed him closing on Democratic challenger Michael Dukakis,
blasted the Massachusetts governor on his home turf for neglecting
polluted Boston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never crossed my mind,'' Gore said of the comparison ``It
really didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was on a four-day tour through Tennessee, Missouri and Iowa
to promote his crime-fighting proposals. He told police officers
Wednesday that he would fund an additional 50,000 positions to
continue the efforts of the Clinton-Gore administration to put more
officers on the street.

At St. Andrews, it's more than a game
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ He is in his usual seat at the wee table
to the left of the door as you enter the bar of The Dunvegan Hotel,
which if not the heart of the Open, at least houses its soul.
</P>
<P>
   James ``Tip'' Anderson lifts his half-empty glass of McEwan's
bitter, says ``Cheers!'' and won't you pull up a chair to hear a
few quick stories from one of the great golf heroes in all of
Scotland. It will only cost you the price of another pint, laddie.
</P>
<P>
   And faster than you could pull a 3-wood out of your bag, he's
off and running down fairways of the past, telling of the six-year
stretch in the '60s when he won the Open three times and finished
second once, though it was actually Arnold Palmer and Tony Lema who
hit all of the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is a caddie, retired now, a tall, 1-iron slim,
distinguished gentleman in a powder-blue sport coat, a white cap
and sneakers, as much a fixture in the cradle of golf as the
clubhouse of St. Andrews and The Dunvegan itself, a five-room hotel
run by a former Texas Aggie from Liberty named Jack Willoughby and
his sweeter-than-shortbread Scottish lass wife Sheene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the walls of the place, look at the photographs,''
Anderson says. ``There's Arnold over there. And there's Elk (Steve
Elkington) tending bar one evening. And Jack Nicklaus and Peter
Jacobsen and Ian Woosnam and Payne Stewart and all the rest. See,
there's the young lad, Tiger, and there's one of Sheene out by the
17th hole with your American president George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the game that brings them all together. It's
this place.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrews has been called the birthplace of the game, harking
back to centuries when men flailed at a feather-stuffed ball with
hickory sticks, and the confessional of the game, for the way it is
so often talked about in hushed terms and pulls out players' sins.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place where the champions and the never-weres, the
legends and the caddies, the former presidents and the innkeepers
can pay quiet homage or give loud, rowdy toasts to this intriguing,
addictive and incredibly frustrating game.
</P>
<P>
   It is the charming seaside town of 20,000 that could swell to a
temporary population of 1 million this weekend _ roughly one-fifth
the population of Scotland _ as the 129th British Open moves in to
paint more stories, more memories, more images.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Road Hole and the Swilken Burn. There is the
Principal's Nose and the Hell Bunker and the Valley of Sin and so
many other names that say this isn't country club golf the way you
know it back home.
</P>
<P>
   A wedge shot away from the 18th green is The Dunvegan, which is
just down the hill from the center of town, where the spectacular
rosebushes that adorn the public areas and the odd-sounding items
on the menu that confirm it is an entirely different place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haggis, Neeps and Tatties'' is one recommendation for lunch at
Littlejohn's restaurant. ``Scotland's national dish served the
traditional way with mashed tatties and neeps. Served with Scottish
oatcakes and a complimentary nip of fine whiskey. O' what a
glorious sight _ warm, reekin and rich!''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   There is Hal Sutton admiring a perfect drive on No. 17, the Road
Hole, and there is Lee Trevino taking several frustrated whacks out
of the gorse on No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cloudless day when the temperature soars to 76 degrees,
enough to wilt the spirit of even the stoutest Scot. So they tromp
slowly around the Old Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe this heat?'' asks a woman.
</P>
<P>
   And the man simply nods, his face is so slathered with white sun
block that it looks as if he had gone headfirst into a bowl of
mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   A threesome of Nicklaus, John Daly and Jean Van de Velde
finishes up a practice round and it is the affable Frenchman _ who
self-destructed on the final hole to lose the Open title last year
at Carnoustie _ that gets the biggest applause.
</P>
<P>
   The sea wind blows strong and cool _ the mark of links golf _ in
the face of 88-year-old former champ Sam Snead as he stands over a
putt on the second green. Just 100 yards away, across the road, a
strip of beach called the West Sand is filled with would-be sun
worshippers, all pale, but soon to be pink. A toe into the North
Sea finds it surprisingly pleasant, while a bagpiper in full
regalia, surely sweating under his kilt, stands at the water's edge
playing a tune.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus chips close to the pin. Snead makes his putt. Back at
The Dunvegan, Anderson raises his glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Tis a slice of heaven if you're a golfer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still a sizable chunk of paradise if you're not.

U.S. LOSES SECOND ATTEMPT TO SEIZE PAINTING NAZIS TOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A painting by Egon Schiele that was taken from its
owner by the Nazis during World War II cannot be seized by the
federal government as stolen property, a federal judge in Manhattan
ruled this week.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time the painting, ``Portrait of Wally,'' has
been released by the courts. The New York state courts rejected an
attempt to hold it and another Schiele painting, ``Dead City,'' as
stolen goods in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney's office subpoenaed the two
paintings when they were on loan to the Museum of Modern Art in
early 1998. ``Dead City'' was released, but prosecutors have been
battling the owner of the paintings, a private Austrian museum,
over ``Wally'' ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's subpoena was quashed by the New York
State Court of Appeals in September 1999. In a ruling that avoided
questions of ownership, the court ruled that the state's
30-year-old Arts and Cultural Affairs Law prevented seizure of
artworks on loan to museums.
</P>
<P>
   But immediately after that ruling, the office of Mary Jo White,
the U.S. attorney, moved to seize ``Wally'' under a federal law
that forbids transporting stolen goods in foreign commerce. Lawyers
for the museum, the Leopold Museum of Vienna, argued that the
paintings were not stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision released Wednesday, Judge Michael B. Mukasey of
federal District Court ruled that the paintings could not legally
be considered stolen because they had been recovered by U.S. armed
forces after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Mukasey wrote that under the law, a person cannot be convicted
of receiving stolen goods if he received them after they were
recovered by the original owner or the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally'' was the possession of a Jewish art gallery owner in
Vienna before World War II. After the Nazis came to power, they
confiscated the gallery. Later, the owner, Lea Bondi Jaray, was
also pressured by the Nazis to surrender ``Wally,'' which was part
of her private collection, Mukasey wrote. Her heirs are seeking its
return.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the painting was seized by American forces in
Austria. The judge wrote that the military mistakenly returned the
painting to someone thought to have owned it before the war. It was
later sold to the Austrian national gallery, to a private owner and
then to the Leopold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the U.S. forces were charged with recovering
stolen items and acting on behalf of the items' true owners,''
Mukasey wrote. ``This recovery purged the painting of the taint it
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the military made an error in the return, the judge
wrote, ``in the eyes of the law, it was no longer stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, a spokesman for White said the office was
reviewing the decision to determine whether to appeal.

CHURCH LAUDS KC TOY STORES FOR NONVIOLENT ITEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID KLEPPER and KATIE HOLLAR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Julie Crnkovich, with her three sons in tow,
strolled past the chemistry sets, plastic dinosaurs and
kaleidoscopes in the Store of Knowledge that a church study found
to have a low-violence quotient.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City mother on Wednesday shopped the Country Club
Plaza store because of its absence of toy guns, military action
figures and brutal video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for that kind of realistic, gory violence,''
she said. ``At this age, they get desensitized. They don't realize
that in real life, that could really hurt someone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Store of Knowledge was happy with the seal of approval it
earned from the Church of the Brethren. Church members recently
visited more than a dozen local stores looking for violent toys and
games. The church picked Kansas City for its first toy survey
because the denomination wrapped up its annual meeting here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey comes a year after several school shootings left
Americans wondering what was wrong with children. The search for
answers prompted Congress to look at the effects of video games on
youngsters. Earlier this year, a Senate committee heard conflicting
testimony about the possible dangers of children battling and
blasting virtual opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Combating youth violence is high on the church's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, we played cowboys and Indians,'' said Margie
Polhamus, a church member who helped conduct the survey. ``But we
knew it was a game. It didn't change us. The toys we found are a
lot worse than cowboys and Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   The Church of the Brethren has about 140,000 members and its
headquarters is in Elgin, Ill. Church members describe their
denomination as pacifist. The church's survey teams found that
small, independent stores offer fewer violent toys and games than
the larger retailers such as Toys R Us and Kay-Bee Toys.
</P>
<P>
   Stores were judged on a 100-point scale that docked outlets for
toy weapons, soldiers and grisly video games. The four stores that
scored 98 and higher were: Ingenious Toy Store; Adventure Store at
Science City; Noggin Noodle; and the Store of Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Moy McIntosh , manager at the Store of Knowledge, was proud of
her store's score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows you can have success with a company that
sells educational toys,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the larger toy chains said their stores
offered the toys and games children wanted. If a parent thought a
toy was too violent, they shouldn't allow their child to purchase
it, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A Kay-Bee outlet in Independence was criticized by the church
for some video games, and a spokesman objected to the ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be carrying them if they weren't selling,'' said
Kay-Bee spokesman John Riley. ``We respect (church members') views,
but we think they're in the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   FAO Schwarz was rated a 75 _ ``tolerable,'' by the church's
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The store's personal shopper, Thomas Cander, said he thought the
store lost 25 points because of a water-gun display.
</P>
<P>
   ``These water guns are bright yellow and aqua. They certainly
don't look too authentic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the link between toy guns and mayhem is doubtful, said one
Brooklyn, N.Y., child therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the toy makers make things they shouldn't? Probably,'' said
Meri Wallace. ``But will a toy gun make a child into a killer? No.
Parenting is a lot more significant to a child than a particular
toy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said no scientific studies proved that violent toys
produced violent children. But she said studies indicated that
young children who watched violent movies were more aggressive. She
said parents should select age-appropriate games and toys for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need to guide children _ especially younger
children,'' she said. ``Younger children might not understand the
difference between a real gun and a toy. The same goes for movies
and video games.''

ON BASEBALL: WILLIAMS IS UNEASY WITH MVP WHISPERS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Originally skedded BBA-YANKS-WILLIAMS) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The discussion inadvertently sent Bernie Williams
time traveling, causing him to recall what it was like to be a
struggling rookie with the New York Yankees nine years ago.
Williams provided the flashbacks, when petty teammates like Mel
Hall called him Bambi, when manager Buck Showalter had him work out
with minor leaguers in spring training and when every day could
have been his last in the majors. Or at least that is what Williams
thought.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was one mention of the past for Williams to
instantly digress and remind himself of the uncertainty. Williams
is one of the elite players in baseball, he owns three World Series
rings and he has an $87.5 million contract, but he took a few
minutes Wednesday to ground himself. Remember when?
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember those days,'' Williams said, shaking his head. ``I
don't ever want to go back to that. How many people have had great
starts and then you never hear about them again?''
</P>
<P>
   That Williams seized upon the flimsiest of opportunities to
recall when he was not an All-Star center fielder is a sign of his
humility. But Williams is humble, not dense. He is having another
splendid season and knows that he is a prime candidate for the
American League's most valuable player award. Because he plays a
demanding position, he should be the leading candidate. That makes
him uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, it would be great to have one of those in
your trophy case,'' he said. ``It's one of those things you dream
about. The attitude here is team-oriented. That's worked, so I'm
not going to change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill was more direct about Williams and said, ``I'd say
that he is as important to us as any other player is to his team in
the American League.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Williams squirmed. Some Yankees have teased him about
winning the award because he was batting .334 with 21 homers and 87
runs batted in before Wednesday night's game against Detroit. There
is no doubt Williams is improving, but he quickly mentioned other
players who are having terrific seasons: Nomar Garciaparra, Carlos
Delgado, Darrin Erstad, Frank Thomas, Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is on pace to drive in 160 runs, so he added, ``If
this isn't the year for me to go off like this, I don't know what
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was referring to the explosion of offense in the
majors, but he could have also been referring to the aging of the
Yankees. While Williams is only 31, the Yankees are growing older
around him, and they have sputtered this year as they have not
since early 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder O'Neill is 37, the same age as pitchers Roger
Clemens and David Cone. Maybe, deep down, Williams knows that these
Yankees could be approaching their finale.
</P>
<P>
   He was reflective enough to remind himself of 1991. He is surely
reflective enough to know that winning a third straight title is a
gargantuan task. Just getting to the postseason is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got guys breathing down our necks,'' Williams said. ``We
can't really relax.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been customary to call Derek Jeter the MVP of the
Yankees, but Williams is the MVP this year. Even though Williams
has won three Gold Gloves, he does not always get good jumps on fly
balls, he pulls up on others and he has an average arm. But
Williams has not been charged with an error this year, and his
offensive output has obscured the listless defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we need a big hit, Bernie gets it,'' O'Neill said. ``He's
got so much confidence, you know he's going to do it. Without him,
our offense would be less than mediocre.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre is enamored of and amused with Williams, who
is usually the last Yankee on the field for stretching exercises
and the first player to hustle out of the clubhouse after games.
After Williams smacked a two-run triple off Curt Schilling in a 3-1
victory over the Phillies on Tuesday night, the only person who
asked him about it was a security guard because Williams bolted
again.
</P>
<P>
   Before Clemens faced the Florida Marlins last Friday in a game
that was more critical for him than anyone else, Torre told
Williams, ``I need you.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams looked at him and softly said, ``I know.'' Torre loved
Williams' response, which was part playful and part serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably think I'm the goofiest player on the team,''
Williams said. ``I'm always giving them weird answers to make them
think. But I took what Joe said seriously. It was an important
game. I think the whole season will be like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The goofy, great center fielder is right. This has been an
arduous season for the Yankees, and they need a much more stable
starting rotation to get them to October. They do not have to worry
about Williams, who admitted, ``If I'm not the goofiest one here,
I'm one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Goofiest? Probably. Most valuable? Definitely.  &QL;

GORE ATTACKS BUSH'S HANDLING OF TEXAS BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Wednesday was Al Gore's time for some real
heavy lifting.
</P>
<P>
   On day two of his visit to the Kansas City area, Gore took on
George W. Bush over a possible budget crunch in Texas, unveiled a
plan calling for the hiring of 10,000 prosecutors and acknowledged
that his campaign had gotten off to a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   He also found time for some physical exertion by tossing about a
dozen YMCA pre-schoolers _ one at a time _ into the air at the
Raytown YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do that to me, do that to me,'' the youngsters shouted at the
Richard C. Green Sr. Family Center YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   And the vice president, mindful that he was offering television
and newspaper cameras a nifty picture, dutifully complied, tossing
one squealing youngster after another into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't they want autographs instead?'' a red-faced Gore moaned
at one point, sticking his tongue out to emphasize his effort.
``That's a workout.''
</P>
<P>
   At the playground, the Democrat did something else unexpected.
He announced that he was junking his schedule for today to fly into
Bush's Texas. The objective: to highlight the governor's new budget
woes.
</P>
<P>
   The move is reminiscent of former Vice President George Bush's
1988 campaign cruise of the dirty Boston Harbor aimed at
embarrassing Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a Texas newspaper reported that the state's
rainy-day fund designed to help lawmakers overcome future
recessions had been drained to less than two-tenths of 1 percent of
the state's $49 billion annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now so small that, by this fall, there will be only
enough money to run the Texas state government for a single day,''
Gore said later at Raytown City Hall. ``You know, there would be a
real problem if Texas had a rainy season.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer tagged Gore's Texas trip a
``distort and destroy'' mission. He emphasized that Texas still has
a $1.1 billion budget surplus. The point of contention, however, is
over how much of that money will remain after the state pays out at
least $610 million in Medicaid and prison cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore wants to talk about progress and prosperity, there
is no place like Texas, where taxes are low, budget surpluses are
high and we even have a bipartisan patient bill of rights,''
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore clearly appeared to be relishing the prospect of a hot
new issue to use against the Republican. For the second day in a
row, he appeared confident and upbeat, perhaps buoyed by several
new national polls that showed the race virtually deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States of America has now built up the biggest
surpluses in our 211-year history,'' Gore said. ``And how Governor
Bush has run Texas is relevant to the judgment the American people
would make as to how he would run the country if they ever gave him
the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then shifted his attention to his main initiative of the
day _ his call for 10,000 new prosecutors across the nation, an
idea modeled after the Clinton administration's 1994 proposal for
100,000 new police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to talk tough on crime,'' Gore said. ``But let's be
honest: You can't be tough on crime if you're cheap on
crime-fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not stick a price tag on his plan, but said communities
would have to compete for grants and provide a local match to the
federal investment.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of prosecutors nationwide results in too many plea
bargains and ``wrist-slaps'' because prosecutor's office are
stretched too thin, Gore said. Statistics from 1996 show that only
one in four prosecutors' offices nationwide employ even a single
full-time prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``New police are essential,'' Gore told law enforcement and
community leaders at Raytown City Hall. ``But it's not enough just
to catch criminals if our justice system is so overloaded that it
cannot even try them.''
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Gore renewed his call for the hiring of 50,000
new police officers. Those officers would join the 60,000 now on
the job that were hired under Clinton's plan to bring on 100,000
more.
</P>
<P>
   Raytown Police Chief Larry Overfield applauded that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll ever reach a point where there are too
many police officers out there on the streets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also pledged to segregate federal law enforcement funds in
a so-called ``lock box'' so that communities could plan ahead
knowing that money for new officers would be there.
</P>
<P>
   And he also proposed a plan to focus on ``hot spots'' where high
concentrations of crime occur. Gore wants to hire additional police
and prosecutors who would bear down on such districts.
</P>
<P>
   Overfield said he thought his department could benefit from the
initiatives. Raytown police have hired several officers through the
federal COPS program, which partly subsidizes an officer's salary
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he picked the Democratic stronghold of Raytown to make
his appearance because of the success the eastern Jackson County
community has had in battling crime. Raytown claimed a 45 percent
cut in major crimes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had a goal in mind for his weeklong focus on crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is my commitment: the toughest, most effective anti-crime
strategy this nation has ever seen,'' he said. ``More police and
more prosecutors, to widen the thin blue line between order and
disorder. Smarter prevention to stop crime before it starts.''
</P>
<P>
   That can't happen, Gore said, if the money is set aside ``to cut
taxes for powerful interests and the wealthy,'' a reference to
Bush's tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Gore stuck around City Hall for several hours
conducting media interviews and preparing for future events. He
didn't fly out of Downtown Airport until about 4:30 p.m., a
departure that resulted in tied-up rush-hour traffic along
westbound Interstate 70 from the Blue Ridge Cutoff to the Broadway
extension.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Kansas City Star, Gore admitted that
his campaign had started slowly, partly because he was still
thinking and acting like a vice president instead of the Democratic
standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the process (of being vice president), I developed a kind
of habit of responding to every question and every challenge by
thinking first of all, how can I help the administration with this
answer, how can I move the ball down the field for the team here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started for president I was still very much thinking
that way, like I was a vice president running for a promotion. It
took me awhile to break through that and realize...it's not a
question of following somebody's team plan, it's a question of
speaking directly from your own heart, spontaneously and directly
to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he made the shift, he said, ``things began falling into
place.''

SPRINT WOULD REMAIN BRIDESMAID IF DEUTSCHE AND VOICESTREAM DECIDE
TO MARRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Deutsche Telekom AG reportedly has made a bid
to buy VoiceStream Wireless Corp. A deal would all but rule out any
Deutsche bid for Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's Web site, citing unnamed sources,
reported Wednesday that Deutsche's bid for VoiceStream values the
U.S. company at about $205.60 a share in stock and cash, or about
$53 billion. Both Deutsche and VoiceStream declined comment on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   It VoiceStream accepts the offer, Deutsche is expected to ditch
any idea of making a run at Sprint. The area's largest
private-sector employer long has been seen as juicy target for the
cash-rich German telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche owns 10 percent of Sprint through an earlier
international joint venture. In theory, at least, a Sprint
acquisition would give Deutsche a big presence in U.S.
telecommunications with land lines, wireless, Internet and data
transmission, and long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say there is no logic in Deutsche's pursuit of
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a bid for VoiceStream, it makes no sense to make a
bid for Sprint,'' said Steven Hanson, senior analyst for Merger
Insight, a research firm for institutional investors. ``The
antitrust issues for Deutsche to buy both would probably be
insurmountable.''
</P>
<P>
   When rumors circulated two weeks ago that Deutsche was sniffing
around Sprint, it raised the hackles of some U.S. senators, who
didn't like the idea that a company that is majority-owned by the
German government might get its hands on a vaunted domestic
telecommunications company. The German government's ownership stake
is down to about 58 percent and would be diluted further if
Deutsche gives up stock to buy VoiceStream.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche might still covet Sprint's other assets, Hanson said,
but if you have VoiceStream, you don't need Sprint's prized
wireless operations. Moreover, he said, it would be ``stupid'' to
buy Sprint and sell off what many see as its best asset.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sprint's digital wireless operations, Sprint PCS, that
WorldCom Inc. most desired when it offered $129 billion to buy
Sprint last October. The deal with WorldCom, which antitrust
regulators filed suit to stop because it would have combined the
nation's second- and third-largest long-distance carriers, was put
to rest by both companies last week.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing termination of the WorldCom deal last week, Sprint
Chief Executive William T. Esrey declared, ``Sprint is not for
sale,'' in pieces or as a whole. He said that the WorldCom deal had
been a unique opportunity and that Sprint was not interested in
being partners with anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint officials had no comment Wednesday about reports that
Deutsche had made an offer for VoiceStream. Last week, Esrey said
the company had not had any conversations with Deutsche.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking to anybody, haven't talked to anybody and
aren't looking to talk to anybody,'' Esrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in a telecommunications market where many think a
company must be able to offer all services to all clients to
compete, what you want and what you get can be two different
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone offers you enough money, the Sprint board would be
hard-pressed to turn it down,'' said Hanson, who thinks there are
plenty of other companies, particularly foreign companies, that
would be interested in Sprint. NTT DoCoMo, the publicly traded
wireless unit of Japan's Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone Corp., and
France Telecom might be interested.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sprint's stock closed at $45, down $2.25. Sprint
PCS closed unchanged at $69.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nespola, chief executive of the consulting firm The
Management Network Group and a former Sprint executive, agrees
there are plenty of companies that would like to own his old
employer. There is no question that Sprint remains ``the prettiest
girl at the dance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report by The Journal, notably, indicates there is no
guarantee a deal with VoiceStream will be concluded.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Journal, VoiceStream has had discussions with
several potential partners in the past few months. Telekom's offer
could set off a bidding war with NTT DoCoMo, which has been looking
at VoiceStream and is expected to make a bid for the firm, people
familiar with the situation said.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in Bellevue, Wash.-based VoiceStream stems from the
fact that it is the only independent national wireless carrier left
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign firms that want access to the U.S.
telecommunications market are turning to wireless first as a way to
get a foothold. That's because wireless is a quicker way to offer
service in local markets. Wireless firms don't have to go through
the same regulatory hurdles as wireline companies, which are
strictly regulated by states and must have rates and tariffs
approved by state regulatory bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Another big factor in the fate of VoiceStream is the opinion of
Finland's Sonera Ltd. and Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., two
companies that hold large stakes in VoiceStream.

NEW WHISTLE-STOP TOUR TAKES CARNAHAN THROUGH MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When President Harry S. Truman made the last speech
of his historic whistle-stop train tour in the 1948 presidential
campaign, Mel Carnahan was in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Carnahan embarked on a four-day, whistle-stop tour
of his own, rolling through the Missouri countryside in search of
votes to help him win Truman's old seat in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, Missouri's two-term governor, can only hope his tour
and the fall election follow in Truman's tracks. In an interview,
he remembered the Truman speech vividly, even though he was only
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Saturday night before the Tuesday election, a rousing
crowd,'' Carnahan said. ``He was chipper, confident.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's tour, on a seven-car chartered Amtrak train,
began in St. Louis before a crowd of 200 supporters. The train then
stopped in Elsberry, Louisiana and Hannibal before going on to
Moberly, where the governor will hold a rally to begin today's leg
of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, a crowd of 75 to 100 sign-toting supporters had
gathered at old train depots or rusted silos. Carnahan, speaking
from the back platform of the train, said he would better represent
the average Missourian than has incumbent John Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Truman wouldn't want John Ashcroft filling his seat,''
Carnahan said. ``Harry Truman's seat will go back to the working
people.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carnahan called the 22-stop tour a way to reach out to the
voters across the state, the Missouri Republican Party called it a
``luxurious train ride'' that should address tax increases he
imposed as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he continues to attack his opponent, Mel Carnahan needs to
explain why he is punishing working families with record high
taxes,'' party Executive Director John Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release, Hancock said Carnahan oversaw the biggest
state tax increase in U.S. history when he signed Senate Bill 380,
a $315 million tax increase to pay for education.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's campaign manager, Marc Farinella, was quick to
respond, comparing the tax histories of the governor and Ashcroft,
who served as governor from 1985 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``During John Ashcroft's two terms as governor, he raised taxes
by a half billion dollars,'' Farinella said. ``He never passed a
tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Farinella said taxes over the nearly eight years of Carnahan's
tenure have dropped by a net of $315 million. The increase in 1993
was mainly on the personal income of the wealthiest 11 percent of
taxpayers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the state Republican party said Carnahan was ``railroading
Missouri,'' the Ashcroft camp had criticism of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel Carnahan feels forced to go places he doesn't normally go
to explain his record of imposing high taxes on working families,''
said Ashcroft campaign spokesman David James.
</P>
<P>
   Making the trip with Carnahan are various supporters, including
labor leaders, large contributors and other Democratic state
candidates. One car is called the ``donor car.'' Carnahan and the
other candidates are sharing the cost of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   One of the speakers Wednesday was John Truman, the grandnephew
of Harry Truman. He likened Carnahan to Truman and took an apparent
stab at Ashcroft's ties to the Christian coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry used to say, `If a man at church is too loud with his
amens, he's probably a horse thief,' &UR; '' Truman said. ``You never
had to lock your barn with President Truman. I see in Gov. Carnahan
the same qualities I saw in Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan and other Missouri Democrats denounced Ashcroft's
record in the Senate, saying he only appears to support
initiatives, such as a patients' bill of rights and prescription
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But, said former Sen. Tom Eagleton, ``when John Ashcroft goes
back to Washington, he votes against every single one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Attorney General Jay Nixon, ``Do not fall for his
slick efforts to redefine himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan plans to emphasize a different subject on each day of
his tour. Wednesday, it was health care. Today it will be rural
issues, such as the Freedom to Farm bill, and Friday it will be
seniors' legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said the 1996 farm bill is significantly contributing
to low farm prices and that subsidies should have been built in to
prepare for lean years. Ashcroft is too patient in letting the bill
work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said the problem with the farm bill is that government
is not keeping its commitments to enforce trade deals with foreign
partners that would open markets to American goods.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the rest of Carnahan's schedule: Today, Moberly,
Salisbury, Henrietta, Independence, Harrisonville and Nevada. He
will be in Independence about 2:30 p.m. and Harrisonville about
4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Friday: Joplin, Aurora, Springfield, Lebanon, Rolla and
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday: Crystal City, Ste. Genevieve, Cape Girardeau,
Sikeston, Portageville and Hayti.

FACE OF THE LAW IS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A potential client asked for names of previous clients at a
career counseling center. Oh, we can't tell you that. It's illegal,
came the response.
</P>
<P>
   Hogwash. Revealing names might be a violation of individual
privacy agreements, but reputable companies can and do get previous
clients' permission to include their names on reference lists.
Nothing in the law forbids that.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to know what's legal and what's not in the work
world. Workers who have never gone through certain experiences
before have no idea whether the responses they get are correct. In
fact, labor lawyers and human resource professionals have trouble
keeping up.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of regulatory agencies, legislative bodies and court
decisions adapt and reinterpret workplace law on a daily basis.
What's ``legal'' is refined case by case, in response to individual
complaints and lawsuits, and subject to lengthy appeals and
reversals.
</P>
<P>
   For example: A divided National Labor Relations Board last week
rejected a 12-year-old precedent. It ruled that a nonunion employee
had the right to have a representative present when he was called
in by his supervisors for what he expected to be a disciplinary
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Previously the labor board had guaranteed that right only to
union members.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's case involved an employee who, with another
employee, wrote a memo to his top boss, asking that their
supervisor be removed. The boss responded by calling the employee
to meet with her and the supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The employee refused to attend unless he could meet with the
boss alone. Or, if the supervisor had to be present, the employee
wanted to be accompanied by his co-worker who also signed the memo.
Both requests were denied, and the employee was sent home and then
terminated the next day for gross insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   A majority on the NLRB board decided that, unionized or not,
employees have the right to act in concert and that ``an employer
may not mask the obstruction of employee efforts to exercise rights
by asserting a right to deal on an individual basis.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the board ruled that the employee was wrongly
dismissed for insisting that his co-worker attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   So, is this the ``law'' now? Can any worker who suspects he or
she is being taken to the woodshed demand to have a co-worker
present?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. The NLRB decision may be appealed by the
employer. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals may rule on it. Other
appellate courts may rule differently in other cases. The case
could work its way to the highest court in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Left unclear, too, is whether an employer even has to call a
disciplinary meeting or whether an employee has a right to demand
one.
</P>
<P>
   The process of determining workplace rights is arduous. It takes
time and money _ things that most workers aren't able to give.
They're too busy earning paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The process also is piecemeal. Sweeping legislation may set
guidelines, but interpretations are incremental. And that's partly
why it's so hard to know what's ``legal'' and what's not.

 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Nine days of U.S.-led Mideast peace talks
collapsed in failure late Wednesday, as President Clinton was
unable to broker a resolution to the thorny territorial and
security disputes at the heart of half a century of
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to cast the marathon effort as at least a partial
success, White House officials claimed that Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had narrowed their
differences and set the stage for further negotiations at a time
yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat left the Camp David summit, however, at an
acrimonious impasse that threw a pall of uncertainty over a
seven-year Mideast peace process less than two months before the
leaders' self-imposed deadline for settling their dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit has come to an end without reaching an agreement,''
White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart said in a prepared statement
read to reporters just before 11 p.m. (ET) by National Security
Council spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to leave shortly after that by motorcade for the
hour-long drive from the cloud-shrouded presidential retreat in the
Catoctin Mountains in western Maryland to the White House, where he
was expected to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last three hours, he's been shuttling back and forth
between the two leaders,'' Crowley said, ``but was unable to help
them make an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   As the talks faltered through a final tumultuous day of
brinkmanship, high drama and heated negotiations, both sides blamed
each other for not yielding on the intractable issue of the future
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat came into the talks vowing not to accept any accord
unless it guaranteed Palestinian control over East Jerusalem, the
site of some of the holiest shrines in the Muslim, Christian and
Jewish worlds. Israel captured it in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for his part, had pledged that an undivided Jerusalem
would remain the eternal capital of Israel, fully under Israeli
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was unable to bridge those differences, and largely upon
the shoals of that ancient dispute the talks apparently foundered.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome constituted a deep and potentially dangerous setback
for the region, where analysts have warned that factions of
Israelis and Palestinians opposed to the peace process might try to
foment unrest in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a bitter disappointment for Clinton, who has
invested seven years of diplomacy in the quest for a comprehensive
Mideast peace agreement and had sought an accord as a final grand
foreign policy achievement before he leaves office next January.
</P>
<P>
   With hope for reviving the process on Clinton's watch all but
extinguished, the president was left with a record of limited
accomplishments in the Mideast, despite the leverage of
unprecedented American influence and might in the aftermath of U.S.
victories in the Cold War and the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also been thwarted in his efforts to broker peace
between Israel and Syria, a second component of his objective of
closing the elusive circle of peace in a region that is the cradle
of Western civilization, home to three of the world's major
religions and the reservoir of two-thirds of the world's known
crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to go early Thursday morning to a
Washington area airport, where he was to board Air Force One for
the 15-hour flight to Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There, far from the crucible of Mideast summitry and even
farther from the flesh-and-blood issues the talks were designed to
address, Clinton was to assume the role of elder statesman at his
farewell session of the annual summit of leaders from the so-called
Group of Eight democratic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned at the outset of the talks that failure could
trigger renewed ``hostility and . . . perhaps even more violence,''
in the volatile Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   He had also cautioned that ``there was no guarantee of
success,'' at the Camp David summit, where he spent nine days and
nights, interrupted only by a day of activities in Baltimore and
Washington last Thursday.

   THURMONT, Md. _ Nine days of U.S.-led Mideast peace talks
collapsed in failure late Wednesday, as President Clinton was
unable to broker a resolution to the thorny territorial and
security disputes at the heart of half a century of
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to cast the marathon effort as at least a partial
success, White House officials claimed that Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had narrowed their
differences and set the stage for further negotiations at a time
yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat left the Camp David summit, however, at an
acrimonious impasse that threw a pall of uncertainty over a
seven-year Mideast peace process less than two months before the
leaders' self-imposed deadline for settling their dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit has come to an end without reaching an agreement,''
White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart said in a prepared statement
read to reporters just before 11 p.m. (ET) by National Security
Council spokesman P.J. Crowley.

MEMO DETAILS CLINTON'S EFFORTS TO QUIET CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last several days, the Senate campaign staff
of Hillary Rodham Clinton and her surrogates have worked to snuff
out the controversy over an allegation that she made an
anti-Semitic remark long ago, a charge she has denied.
</P>
<P>
   According to a campaign aide's memorandum leaked to the news
media by a recipient, the efforts to rebut the allegation included
enlisting Jewish supporters to call reporters at Jewish
publications to defend Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A new book accuses her of unleashing a slur 26 years ago at the
manager of Bill Clinton's losing congressional race in Arkansas.
Clinton has vehemently denied making the remark, though the target,
Paul Fray, stood by the allegation in an interview broadcast
Wednesday on ``Good Morning America'' on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be glad to take a lie-detector exam,'' said Fray, who is a
Baptist but says his paternal great-grandmother was Jewish.
``That's the bottom line right there in a nutshell. And if that
doesn't satisfy the question, then let me take a truth serum.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's supporters have tried to challenge Fray's credibility,
and the Clinton campaign memorandum lists several talking points
that do the same. Fray and his wife have acknowledged in a series
of television and newspaper interviews that he lost his license to
practice law years ago for altering court records and had suffered
a brain hemorrhage that led to some memory loss, but insist that he
remembers the remark clearly. He acknowledged in Wednesday's
television interview that he had leveled false accusations at the
Clintons in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a news conference in Albany, where she received the
endorsement of the state AFL-CIO, said: ``I've said all I'm going
to say about this. It wasn't true, it didn't happen and I'm not
going to allow it to distract from the real issues of the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Clinton sought to move past the episode, her staff
had to answer questions about the memorandum to Jewish supporters
that disclosed how orchestrated their efforts were. In the
memorandum, an adviser on Jewish affairs urges supporters to call
reporters at two Jewish publications to defend Clinton, and
implores them not to reveal that the campaign had requested them to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would appreciate it if you could call these people as
concerned citizens, (It is important that you do not say that you
calling because the campaign asked you to, but because you are
outraged with what was said about her.),'' the memorandum, from
Karen Adler, said. ``The most important thing is to let them know
that you know Hillary and you know that she would never make these
kinds of Anti-Semitic or racist comments.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reporters, Rachel Donadio, of The Forward, said she
received two calls Monday evening from people she does not normally
talk to offering their unsolicited, positive views of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The other reporter, Adam Dickter of The Jewish Week, said he
received seven calls in a 24-hour period beginning Monday night _
some from usual sources, some not _ but he did not know if they
were prompted by the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Clinton, said the memorandum was
written to assist people who had called the campaign office angry
over the charge and wanting to offer their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to know how they could be most helpful,'' said
Wolfson, who declined to address why they were told not to reveal
the Clinton campaign's involvement in their calls.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish supporters rallied behind Clinton, including Sen.
Charles E. Schumer, who called a news conference in Washington on
Wednesday y with other Jewish lawmakers to express their continued
support for Clinton.

TCU LOSES TWO RECRUITS, FINDS TWO; OTHER NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ The jewel of TCU's 2000 football recruiting
class, All-American running back Tyson Thompson from Irving, has
been declared academically ineligible.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horned Frogs coach Dennis Franchione confirmed yesterday that
Thompson and Galveston Ball defensive back Derrick Pope failed to
achieve the minimum requirements mandated by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Though losing Thompson and Pope are major hits, the 2000 class
received a boost with the signing of Dunbar twins Jerome and Jerrod
Braziel, both 1999 commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The Braziels, both cornerbacks, signed with TCU last yearbut
failed to qualify academically. They decided to sit out a year and
retake the standardized tests needed to gain their eligibility.
They met the qualifying scores recently and were on campus
yesterday afternoon signing their scholarships offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire them for what they've done,'' Franchione said. ``It's
not easy to go through what they went through. It's a real credit
to those kids, their parents and their coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braziels had stellar football and track careers at Dunbar,
both earning All-District 9-4A honors at cornerback and running
legs on the state champion 4x100-meter relay team.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione said Thompson could still be a partial qualifier or
travel the same path as the Braziels. As a partial qualifier,
Thompson could enroll at TCU this fall and practice with the team,
and, should he make satisfactory academic progress, would be
eligible to play next season.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was a first-team ``Parade Magazine'' All-American and a
``Star-Telegram'' National Top 100 selection. As a senior, Thompson
rushed for 2,933 yards and 32 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Pope played linebacker and tailback at Ball, but was expected to
be a defensive back at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   Though Franchione was unsure of Pope's plans for the immediate
future, he said Pope and Thompson remain in TCU's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, we want to put something together to make sure
both get into Horned Frog purple,'' Franchione said.
TENNIS COACH LEAVING According to sources, TCU men's tennis coach
Michael Center has accepted the head-coaching position at Texas and
an announcement could come as soon as tomorrow. Center was out of
town yesterday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Center coached the Frogs to a 36-12 record the past two seasons,
including a 22-5 mark and trip to the NCAA Division I quarterfinals
last season. Before coming to TCU, Center coached the men's and
women's teams at Kansas, and served as a volunteer assistant at
Stanford.  &LR; subheds:Wagner update Keith-Ann Wagner, who suffered
partial paralysis in a car accident July 4, continues to make
steady progress, according to her mother, Shirley Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's starting to feel real good and her spirits are high,''
Shirley Wagner said. ``Her arms are getting strong and she has more
feeling in her legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith-Ann Wagner has begun occupational and physical therapy at
Baylor Medical Center in Dallas, and doctors have set Sept. 28 as
her tentative release date. Wagner, TCU's starting goalkeeper the
past two seasons, had surgery to repair her broken sixth vertebra.
FOOTBALL ON TV The TCU football team could have up to eight of its
11 regular-season games televised this season.
</P>
<P>
   KSTR/Channel 49 has agreed to broadcast three Frogs games,
including the season opener at Nevada on Sept. 9. The network has
also picked up the Tulsa (Oct. 21) and Rice (Oct. 28) games.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net, which is already televising Northwestern (Sept.
16) and Navy (Sept. 30) nationally, is close to picking up Fresno
State (Nov. 11) and SMU. The SMU game is scheduled for Nov. 25 but
would probably be moved to Nov. 24, the day after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Regional might add the Hawaii game (Oct. 7). nn

PROSECUTION WRAPS UP ITS I.B.F. CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Asserting that boxing is a ``dying sport that has
lost the trust of people,'' the prosecution in the federal
racketeering and bribery trial of the president and founder of the
International Boxing Federation laid much of the blame for that
state of affairs Wednesday on a scheme of bribes in exchange for
favorable rankings and matchups that the defendants are accused of
running.
</P>
<P>
   In a daylong summation of the prosecution case, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Marc A. Agnifilo painstakingly sketched out the details of
the 32-count indictment against Robert W. Lee Sr., 66, the
president of the IBF, and his son, Robert F. Lee Jr., 38, who
served as liaison to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Lees are accused of extorting $338,000 over 15 years from
managers, promoters and fighters in exchange for rankings and
sanctioning that were crucial to boxers getting shots at lucrative
televised championship bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Agnifilo said that in each of the alleged bribes, the pattern
was the same, with the elder Lee using go-betweens to arrange and
collect the money and then launder it so he would never be ``at the
messy place'' where it all took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no doubt who is in charge of this organization,''
Agnifilo said. ``It's Bob Lee Sr. He runs the IBF, and particularly
the criminal acts of the IBF.''
</P>
<P>
   While highlighting the strengths of the prosecution case,
Agnifilo also tried to shore up its weaker points: the absence of
direct testimony that Lee or his son solicited or accepted
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evidence linking them to payments from promoters,
managers and fighters was provided by Colin Douglas Beavers, a
former rankings committee chairman of the IBF, based in East
Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers cooperated with the prosecution, secretly videotaped and
audiotaped conversations and testified that he was a bagman for the
Lees.
</P>
<P>
   Agnifilo reviewed many of those taped conversations, culling
excerpts of comments by the elder Lee which, Agnifilo said,
incriminated Lee in spite of his tendency to talk guardedly and in
a clipped, coded manner.
</P>
<P>
   Those excerpts were printed in large type on 10-inch-square
placards, which were attached by Velcro strips to an 8-by-4-foot
chart that dominated the wall of the courtroom of U.S. District
Judge John W. Bissell.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day there were more than 40 placards arranged
like tiles on a Scrabble board.
</P>
<P>
   The defense summation was expected Thursday, and there was a
chance that jurors would begin their deliberations as soon as
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the trial, which began April 11, was nearing its
conclusion, Bissell indicated that he was still considering defense
motions that would limit the mail and wire fraud charges that the
jury could consider. That part of the government's case pivots on
defining a fair ranking by the IBF as a thing of value and a right
due to the boxers the organization served. But the judge said he
was still researching case law for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The case has dealt a blow to boxing and particularly the IBF,
which became the first private sports organization that the federal
government has taken over and monitored under provisions of the
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Robert J. Cleary, the U.S. attorney for New
Jersey, persuaded Bissell to wrest control of the organization from
its leaders and appoint a monitor to oversee it, a move that has
usually been limited to corrupt labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has in addition seen boxing's image tarnished by a
parade of promoters including Robert Arum, the powerful owner of
Top Rank, and Cedric Kushner, who have testified to paying bribes
to Lee and the IBF and who could eventually face prosecution.

LOS ANGELES TO REROUTE TRAFFIC AROUND DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV and ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A traffic plan released Wednesday for the
Democratic National Convention sharply restricts traffic for
several blocks around Staples Center, forcing some businesses to
consider closing for that week in August.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown business owners _ many still reeling from rioting after
the Lakers' NBA championship victory _ fear workers will get caught
in traffic and that protesters will destroy property or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Lakers game forward, it's been a horrible experience
_ and it's going to get worse before it gets better,'' said Steve
Auth, whose Kaiser Bros. Honda and Oldsmobile dealership sustained
more than $100,000 in damage during the Lakers unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan said he is confident the plan will
minimize traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared for anything that can happen and will give the
Democrats the best convention they ever have held,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he hopes downtown businesses cooperate by changing
employee work shifts, if possible, for the week of Aug. 14-17, as
they did during the 1984 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to see that people go on a staggered work
schedule and carpool to ease some of the traffic,'' Riordan said
during a news conference. ``And it will allow people like me to
ride our bikes to get in and out of downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, an ardent bicyclist, said he plans to help by riding
his bike one day during the convention to get around downtown.
</P>
<P>
   One boost for planners is the time the convention will be held:
4 to 8 p.m. each day. Most traffic will come before or after rush
hour _ unlike the Olympics, which had events at all times of the
day and throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic restrictions will be in place by Aug. 12 and some
will be instituted several days earlier, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some highlights of the plan:
</P>
<P>
   _The immediate area around the Convention Center and Staples
Center, including their parking lots and adjacent streets, will be
restricted to only those people with credentials.
</P>
<P>
   _Near Staples Center, traffic on Figueroa and Flower streets
will detour to Grand Avenue for southbound travel and northbound
vehicles will detour to Hope Street, except from 6 to 11 p.m., when
Olive Street will be used.
</P>
<P>
   _Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus lines will be
modified to avoid the Staples Center perimeter, where 35,000
convention visitors are expected, as well as up to 50,000
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   _Bus-only lanes will be created on some streets, new turning
lanes will be created and traffic signals will be altered.
</P>
<P>
   _A tour guide has been published to advise delegates about
places to visit around Los Angeles and how they can use public
transportation, from buses and cabs to the Red Line subway and Blue
Line rail systems.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes hospitality booths at all the airports and
hotels _ staffed by the convention's local Host Committee _ to
provide information to the delegates on sites to see and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put together a pretty solid plan, given our experience in
dealing with large volumes of people here in downtown,'' said
Francis Bannerjee, general manager of the city Department of
Transportation. ``We plan more than 1,500 major events a year and
whenever anyone throws a major party, we are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she said the number of people attending the convention is
small considering the Figueroa Corridor is used by more than 2
million people a week.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners are not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about the security of the employees and myself,
also,'' said Tony Alfaro, manager of Winston Tires, where vandals
smashed plate glass windows during the Lakers celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Auth said he has not decided whether to close his doors, but he
doubts any customers will come in and is planning to do ``spring
cleaning'' during that week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending upon the traffic, depending upon the kind of
activity the protesters are doing that week will determine whether
we close or stay open and for what hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schatz, president of the Central City Association, said
her group is trying to reassure business owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern _ there has to be any time you are inviting
thousands of people to your home,'' Schatz said. ``Whenever you are
talking about huge crowds and events, it is foolish not to be
prepared for any eventuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schatz and city leaders say they are optimistic that the
week will go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing for a joyous, peaceful celebration for a week
and to showcase the heart of our city that we've worked very hard
to make vital,'' Schatz said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis O'Neill, general manager of T.R. King Co., which sells
gaming supplies south of Staples Center, said he likely will close
his shop to business but stay there to try to protect his property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still recovering from that riot. Our business was
destroyed and we were broken into,'' O'Neill said. ``I think it
could very well happen again. It just takes anything to spark these
people off, any excuse to loot and riot.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the plan are available by visiting the city's Web
site at www.lacity.org and clicking on the Democratic National
Convention icon. The city also has a telephone hotline to provide
information at (888) 356-4661.

OPEN MAY BE SHOWDOWN FOR SORENSTAM AND WEBB
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL FIELDS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. _ Golf rivalries are an elusive commodity, often
more hype than reality. But the women's game has a real one, and
when the 55th U.S. Women's Open begins Thursday, much of the focus
will be on Annika Sorenstam and Karrie Webb.
</P>
<P>
   The two young, dominant LPGA stars have done almost everything
but have a showdown in a major championship, but the stage is set
for that possibility this week at the Merit Club, a course about 40
miles north of Chicago that opened in 1992 and is playing host to
its first national championship.
</P>
<P>
   In a 150-player field with elite players of all ages, from
14-year-old Nare Wongluekiet to the Hall of Famer Nancy Lopez, who
after 23 tries and at age 43 is still looking for her first Women's
Open title, a Sorenstam-Webb battle could raise the profile of an
event in the unenviable position of being played the same week as
the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, a 28-year-old Swede, is coming off two consecutive
victories and leads the LPGA Tour with five victories for the
season. Webb, a 25-year-old Australian, has four victories this
year, including a 10-stroke triumph in the Nabisco Championship.
They are one-two on the LPGA money list by a wide margin over No. 3
Juli Inkster, the defending champion this week. Already this
season, each golfer has beaten the other in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really talk about the rivalry,'' Sorenstam said.
``But I can't deny it. I check her scores whether I'm playing or
not playing. She's one of the best, and if you want to be the best,
you've got to beat the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam has won 18 times since taking her second consecutive
U.S. Open title in 1996, but none of those victories have come in
majors, and she missed the 36-hole cut at the Open in 1997 and
1999. ``I think I've been in my own way mentally,'' she said,
reflecting on her recent record in majors.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by the success of Webb, who eclipsed her as the
world's No. 1 player, Sorenstam was determined to improve. With a
combination of more practice and less worry, she said she ``wanted
to get back to the No. 1 spot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After last year I was a little disappointed with the way I
played,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Merit Club, built on the site of a former cattle farm, is
known for its most famous member, Michael Jordan. At 6,540 yards,
the layout is the longest in Women's Open history, and the fairways
are firm. Only a few holes are tree-lined and the wind often blows
across the layout.
</P>
<P>
   Webb and Inkster, who successfully defended her McDonald's LPGA
Championship last month, have between them won the last five
women's majors. Webb was in position to thwart Inkster at the LPGA
Championship but she pressed down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest hurdle that I have to overcome is my patience,''
Webb said. ``I go so long and keep everything in and then just one
bad break or one bad swing and I lose it. And that's what I have to
work on.''

FORMER PAROLE OFFICER TALKS OF PRESSURE TO RELEASE FELON
</HEADLINE>
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former state parole official testified on Wednesday
that his supervisor had gotten ``a tremendous amount of pressure''
from the Pataki administration to release a violent felon whose
family had contributed thousands of dollars to the governor's 1994
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Ronald Hotaling, also testified that he
received a request from an official in the state's Community
Affairs office to report back to her about whether the prisoner had
been released.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by Hotaling was in Federal District Court in
Brooklyn on Wednesday at the trial of Yung Soo Yoo, a New Jersey
businessman who was often tapped by the Republican Party to raise
money among Koreans in the New York area. Yoo, 63, has been charged
with telling three Korean families in Queens that he would use his
influence to obtain parole for their sons if they donated thousands
of dollars to the campaign of New York Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution of Yoo stems from a two-and-a-half-year federal
investigation into accusations that Pataki officials used the
promise of early parole to help fill the governor's campaign
coffers. The prosecutors overseeing the case have repeatedly said
there is no evidence that Pataki participated in or had knowledge
of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also introduced a letter they said was written in
November 1996 by Yoo addressed to Patrick Donohue, who at the time
was Pataki's campaign finance director. The letter said that two
contributors were furious that their sons had not been released and
were threatening to go public. Donohue has not been charged, and
his lawyer, Thomas Puccio, did not respond to phone calls seeking
comment. The defense said on Wednesday that it planned to call him
as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Hotaling also testified that Brion D. Travis, the chairman of
the parole board, received a message in April 1996 from the
governor's office advocating the release of John Kim of Queens, who
was serving time for armed robberies. Two years earlier, Kim's
family and their supporters contributed about $7,000 to Pataki's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hotaling said Travis then told him to relay the interest of the
governor's office in the case to two of the three parole
commissioners charged with deciding on Kim's release. The two
commissioners, Sean McSherry and Leo S. Levy, voted to parole Kim
after he had served the minimum of his 4-to-12-year sentence, the
first opportunity he was eligible for release. Hotaling also said
Grace Koh of the Community Affairs office asked him to call her
after a ruling on Kim's parole was made. She has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Hotaling, 53, pleaded guilty last year to lying to a grand jury
to cover up his dealings with Travis and the two parole
commissioners. McSherry was convicted in August 1999 of lying to
the same grand jury, and Levy was charged last month with
misleading investigators.

 &HT;    CLINTON UNABLE TO PREVENT MIDEAST SUMMIT TALKS FROM COLLAPSE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Nine days of U.S.-led Mideast peace talks
collapsed in failure late Wednesday, as President Clinton was
unable to broker a resolution to the thorny territorial and
security disputes at the heart of half a century of
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to cast the marathon effort as at least a partial
success, White House officials claimed that Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had narrowed their
differences and set the stage for further negotiations at a time
yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat left the Camp David summit, however, at an
acrimonious impasse that threw a pall of uncertainty over a
seven-year Mideast peace process less than two months before the
leaders' self-imposed deadline _ Sept. 13 _ for settling their
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit has come to an end without reaching an agreement,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a prepared statement
read to reporters just before 11 p.m. (ET) by National Security
Council spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to leave shortly after that by motorcade for the
hour-long drive from the cloud-shrouded presidential retreat in the
Catoctin Mountains in western Maryland to the White House, where he
was expected to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last three hours, he's been shuttling back and forth
between the two leaders,'' Crowley said, ``but was unable to help
them make an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   As the talks faltered through a final tumultuous day of
brinksmanship, high drama and heated negotiations, both sides
blamed each other for not yielding on the intractable issue of the
future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat came into the talks vowing to reject any accord that
didn't guarantee Palestinian control over East Jerusalem, the site
of some of the holiest shrines in the Muslim, Christian and Jewish
worlds. It was captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for his part, had pledged that an undivided Jerusalem
would remain the eternal capital of Israel, fully under Israeli
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was unable to bridge those differences, and largely upon
the shoals of that ancient dispute the talks apparently foundered.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome constituted a deep and potentially dangerous setback
for the region, where analysts have warned that factions of
Israelis and Palestinians violently opposed to the peace process
might try to foment unrest in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a moment of opportunity that will not re-occur,''
Barak had warned at the outset of the talks. ``It is accompanied by
major risks. And if, God forbid, we should fail, then the risks,
and not the opportunities, will come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Those failings were a bitter disappointment for Clinton, who has
invested seven years of diplomacy in the quest for a comprehensive
Mideast peace agreement and had sought an accord as a final grand
foreign policy achievement before he leaves office next January.
</P>
<P>
   With hope for reviving the process on Clinton's watch all but
extinguished, the president was left with a record of limited
accomplishments in the Mideast, despite the leverage of
unprecedented American influence and might in the aftermath of U.S.
victories in the Cold War and Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also been thwarted in his efforts to broker peace
between Israel and Syria, a second component of his objective of
closing the elusive circle of peace in a region that is the cradle
of Western civilization, home to three of the world's major
religions and the resevoir of two-thirds of the world's known crude
oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to go early Thursday morning to a
Washington area airport, where he was to board Air Force One for
the 15-hour flight to Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There, far from the crucible of Mideast summitry and even
farther from the flesh-and-blood issues the talks were designed to
address, Clinton was to assume the role of elder statesman at his
farewell session of the annual summit of leaders from the so-called
Group of Eight democratic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned at the outset of the talks that failure could
trigger renewed ``hostility and . . . perhaps even more violence,''
in the volatile Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   He had also cautioned that ``there was no guarantee of
success,'' at the Camp David summit, where he spent nine days and
nights, interrupted only by a day of activities in Baltimore and
Washington last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak left Camp David shortly after Clinton for long
flights to their home region, where both faced the political
challenges of balancing the costs of failure here against the
virtues, however those might be calculated, of not having given in
on issues fundamental to their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat walked away from a deal that would have given him a shot
at carving out an independent state of Palestine, though not,
apparently, on terms he regarded as essential to building a viable
state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak pushed off from a chance to forge a framework for Israeli
security, though he upheld his pledge to retain full Israeli
sovereignty over all of Jerusalem.

AFRICAN AMERICAN TRAFFIC CITATIONS DISPROPORTIONATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KERY MURAKAMI  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A disproportionate number of black drivers were given
traffic citations by Seattle police last year, the department
acknowledged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledgment before a City Council committee immediately
raised the prospect of racial profiling _ the practice of making
traffic stops based on the race of the driver.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. John Diaz said the study does not explain why the
disparity exists, and called for an independent study.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said a group examining racial disparities in policing
analyzed 86,000 traffic citations written in the city last year.
Blacks were given 16.8 percent of the tickets, even though they are
estimated to make up only about 9 percent of all drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're past the point of saying `is there disproportionality?'
There clearly is,'' he told the council's Public Safety Committee.
``The tough question is `is there racism?'''
</P>
<P>
   The study was ordered by Interim Police Chief Herb Johnson in
March amid controversy over racial profiling. The review of
departmental data was done in conjunction with the Building Blocks
Coalition, a group chaired by King County Councilman Larry Gossett
that has a diverse membership that includes state Supreme Court
Justice Bobbe Bridge and Mothers for Police Accountability leader
Harriet Waldron.
</P>
<P>
   Though in some minds the numbers verify what the already
believed _ that minorities are pulled over because of their color _
Diaz said, ``Finding out the reasons why is going to be extremely
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he noted that about 20 percent of the citations
given to blacks were for driving with a suspended license.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's clearly an economic issue,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz and others said police do not keep data that would clearly
explain if racism is a factor. For example, the department does not
track instances where officers make a traffic stop but do not write
a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Boruchowitz, president of the Washington Defenders
Association, which represents public defenders around the state,
said that if minorities are disproportionately stopped, without
being cited, it might indicate they are being pulled over as a
pretext.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Murray, a policing consultant who works with King
County, said a further study could examine if a disproportionate
number of tickets given to blacks are dismissed in court as lacking
merit. He said that could also suggest blacks are being pulled over
unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Jim Compton, chairman of the committee, said that as
a first step he will prepare a council resolution declaring racial
profiling ``reprehensible and intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he was quick to note the data do not
necessarily mean blacks are targeted because of race. Racial
profiling has become a nationwide issue in recent years. Just last
year, New Jersey State Police acknowledged that troopers took into
account the race of drivers in determining who to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle police have repeatedly said they do not practice racial
profiling, and Compton said that he's ``satisfied we have nothing
like that kind of racial profiling in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``racial disproportionality is a fact,''
whether it happens because of improper training, prejudice or other
factors. He urged further study to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   Compton said the council should urge the department to begin
collecting more data that would shed more light onto why the
disproportionality exists.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Peter Steinbrueck, like Diaz, said the city shouldn't
wait. He called for an independent study _ perhaps by the
University of Washington _ based on the information the city
already collects.
</P>
<P>
   James Kelly, executive director of the Urban League of
Metropolitan Seattle, also called for a more detailed study. He
said the city needs to find the reason for the disproportionality
to restore trust in police among people of color.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Eason Jr., president of the Seattle branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, echoed the call
for a more detailed study.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of racial profiling, Eason said, is that ``it doesn't
just stop with writing tickets and putting people in jail. ... It
goes into the court system, it gets into the judging, and from
there it goes into the prisons. That's why you have such a
disproportionate number of blacks in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if a person is just being stopped because of who they are,
that is going to manifest itself in more (minority) people being
sentenced, more people locked up.''

SOBE NICHE IN DRINK MARKET KEEPS EXPANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since it first appeared on store shelves a mere four
years ago with its lineup of unusual flavors and a distinctive
double-lizard logo, Sobe has grown into a Godzilla of the
alternative-beverage business.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company expects to post $250 million in sales, up
from $167 million last year and $67 million in 1998. Its products,
which it prefers to call ``healthy refreshment,'' have names like
Zen Blend, Tsunami and Strawberry Carrot Elixir, featuring
ingredients like bee pollen, ginkgo and something called kava kava.
It has established a customer base that ranges from middle-age
women to radicalized teen-agers, and its official alliances run the
gamut from Wal-Mart to Biker Sherlock, a demigod of the
extreme-sports racing circuit. Its marketing has been mostly grass
roots, with sampling from old buses and milk trucks, and
advertising has been mostly on the radio and in print.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with giants like Coca-Cola taking an interest in
drinks beyond their traditional brands, pressure is growing to
develop a more sophisticated advertising campaign and, to go with
it, a more aggressive business plan. Many analysts say Sobe has to
push itself to the next level, to become less a phenomenon than a
permanent player in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded by John Bello and Tom Schwalm in 1996, has
plans to put at least $12 million into advertising and sports
sponsorship this year and will introduce several products in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   It has also announced plans to sell a two-thirds stake to the
Boston-based investment firm of J .W. Childs Associates, a
development that many think will lead to an initial public offering
of the company before long. Sobe's archrival, Snapple Beverages, is
planning to go public later this year in an offering estimated at
$115 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sobe right now is at a critical point,'' said John D. Sicher,
publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ``It is on
its way to becoming a very successful brand. How fast and whether
that happens will be known in the next year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bello said his company had succeeded ``because
we have a product that consumers want,'' and added that he planned
to expand distribution in the coming year with a variety of
products and packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Among those is a sports drink, like Gatorade but with additives
like D-ribose, packaged in a reusable plastic sports bottle. There
are also plans to introduce a chocolate drink, named ``Love Bus
Brew,'' and a high-energy blend called Adrenaline. Child-friendly
packages, containing a vitamin-fortified juice drink tentatively
named Lizardade, are on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution now includes mass merchandisers like Costco and
Wal-Mart. And this week was the official introduction in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're everywhere, but we are not everywhere we need to be,''
Bello said. ``We have had some difficulty penetrating the major
cities, like New York, Philadelphia and Washington, where there are
not a lot of distribution options.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobe's competitors, which include Snapple, Nantucket Nectars and
Mistic, tend to be handled by the same distribution network, he
added. ``Where do they put their focus?'' he said. ``That's the
game we are playing at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Many industry experts praise Sobe's development so far, saying
it has carved out a particular place in the crowded beverage aisle.
``The marketing, the use of the lizard, and the innovation have all
been first rate,'' Sicher said. ``I really think the U.S. consumer
is fascinated by a beverage that claims to do more than taste good
and refresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobe has so far avoided television ads because Bello thinks they
would be too defining for the brand. An ad aimed at teen-agers
could alienate other Sobe loyalists, or so the thinking goes. Too
much emphasis on the ingredients, and there might be a whole other
set of problems to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone mainstream with a product that has all these
nutrients and herbal additives and tastes great and has mystique,''
Bello said. ``The last thing we want to be is a medicine, or a
castor oil, or something that doesn't taste good.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, television ads may not be as effective for
Sobe as its fleet of buses and trucks and armored cars, all bearing
the lizard logo, have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to spend so much to cut through the clutter,'' he
said. ``Our sampling really works to create a buzz around the
product in local communities. We are trying to maintain the common
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick going forward, particularly with a new majority
shareholder, will be to maintain all that. ``What John has done
with the positioning, with his grass-roots marketing, has been to
build a very dedicated following,'' said Michael Bellas, chief
executive of Beverage Marketing, a consulting company that tracks
beverage sales. ``He has to not lose that as he gets more broad
based.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the success of Sobe has not gone unnoticed by
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the giants of the soft-drink business, which
have declared their intentions to get involved in all kinds of
beverages. ``Coke is going to be looking at that category very
strongly,'' said Andrew Conway, a beverage stocks analyst for
Morgan Stanley. ``They will look at developing brands on their own
and at equity investment or ownership of existing brands.'' &QL;

SUBS DELIVER LIKE HEROES AS THE METS RALLY TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The New York Mets' bench is largely a collection of
players who were never part of the team's original plans.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Johnson played in Japan last year and signed a minor league
contract. Joe McEwing is the player the Mets took from St. Louis
when they had to find someplace to trade Jesse Orosco. The Mets
thought pitcher Bill Pulsipher could succeed; when he did not, they
traded him to Arizona for Lenny Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has become a starter, but Johnson and McEwing have had
few opportunities to contribute. All played important roles
Wednesday night when the Mets beat the Montreal Expos, 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing singled in the tying and the go-ahead runs in the eighth
inning off Montreal closer Steve Kline, who had allowed singles to
Jay Payton and Benny Agbayani leading off the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani eluded the throw from center fielder Milton Bradley by
sliding to the right of home plate and tagging the plate with his
left hand.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing _ who scored the Mets' final run on a single by Derek
Bell _ was batting for Johnson, who had a pinch-hit single in the
seventh and scored on a triple by Harris. Harris' hit tied the
score, 2-2, and though Vladimir Guerrero doubled off Pat Mahomes in
the seventh to regain a one-run lead for Montreal, McEwing's
heroics gave the Mets the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets won their third game in a row after losing nine of 12.
Armando Benitez recorded his 22nd save, matching a career high set
in 1998 and equaled last year.
</P>
<P>
   Expos pitcher Tony Armas Jr. arrived at Olympic Stadium on
Wednesday night with a strained rotator cuff, and the Expos
announced that Felipe Lira would start in his place. But Lira is a
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   That forced the Expos into a spring training arrangement, with a
tag team of pitchers working a few innings each.
</P>
<P>
   Lira pitched three innings and allowed only a homer to Todd
Zeile leading off the second. Scott Strickland followed with two
scoreless innings. Anthony Telford came on for the sixth, but he
got into trouble in the seventh when Johnson had a pinch-hit single
with one out. Harris followed with a line-drive triple to the
left-center field gap, scoring Johnson to tie the game, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Rusch had gone 341/3 innings without giving up a walk
until he walked Jose Vidro and Vladimir Guerrero in the first
inning. The Expos used three singles to get their first run, in the
second, and a two-out walk to Lee Stevens led to their third-inning
run, when Stevens scored on Chris Widger's triple.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch worked six innings, allowing two runs, six hits and three
walks. It was the 12th time in 17 starts he has lasted at least six
innings and allowed no more than three earned runs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his final inning, he was aided by center fielder Payton, who
has impressed the Mets with the routes he takes, which maximize his
fine range. Lately, Payton has put every inch to use.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the ninth in a tie game at Toronto Monday,
Payton sprinted back and to his left to chase a drive by Homer
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If the ball had dropped, the speedy Bush probably would have had
a triple.
</P>
<P>
   But Payton got there, cradling his glove over his shoulder as
Bush's fly dropped in for an out.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning Wednesday night, Payton was playing in on
Mike Mordecai in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The third baseman sent a liner over Payton's head, but Payton
hurried back and leaped to spear it, the ball peeking out of the
webbing of his glove.

PAUL YOUNG, BRITISH ROCK SINGER, DIES AT 53 
</HEADLINE>
   c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Young, a British rock singer who sang with the group Mike
and the Mechanics, died on Saturday at his home in Altrincham, near
Manchester, England. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   The cause apparently was a heart attack, said a British
representative of Young and the band.
</P>
<P>
   Young, one of two British pop singers with that name (the other
one is noted for the 1985 hit ``Every Time You Go Away''), sang
with a number of blues-rock bands in the 60s and was a founding
member of the Manchester group Sad Cafe in the mid-70s. The group's
combination of bluesy romps and commercial soft rock earned a
number of hits in Britain, including ``Run Home Girl,'' ``Babylon''
and ``Everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 Young was invited by Mike Rutherford, the bassist in
Genesis, then on hiatus, to sing in a new group, Mike and the
Mechanics. The group would feature two lead voices, Young's
conventional rock approach and the soulful croon of Paul Carrack,
who had sung in Squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Mike and the Mechanics' first album, released late in 1985,
contained the hit song ``All I Need Is a Miracle,'' which featured
Young and came to be his signature stage number. But the group's
biggest hit was ``The Living Years,'' sung by Carrack on the
group's 1988 album of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   The group has carried on sporadically over the years, releasing
a total of six albums.
</P>
<P>
   Young is survived by his wife, three children and one
grandchild.

A HURDLER'S DIFFICULT DECISION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It could not have been a more perfect
moment for Derrick Adkins to win an Olympic gold medal in 1996 in
the 400-meter hurdles. He won in Atlanta, where he lived and had
attended Georgia Tech. His parents and friends were in the stands
and as he carried an American flag on a jubilant victory lap around
the Olympic Stadium, cameras flashed like thousands of blinding
fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, as he attempts to make another Olympic team,
Adkins is not the same caliber of hurdler.
</P>
<P>
   What no one but his parents and coach knew that celebratory
night in 1996 was that Adkins was suffering from severe depression.
He had been diagnosed three months earlier, unable to sleep,
feeling an overwhelming sense of hopelessness and thinking suicidal
thoughts, and had been placed on the anti-depressant medication
Luvox.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Atlanta Games, without telling anyone, he
stopped taking the medication because it left him feeling sedated
and fatigued. And when the euphoria of winning a gold medal faded
several weeks later, he experienced a depressive episode that led
him to drink an entire bottle of wine one evening in Monte Carlo,
leaving him hung over and dehydrated and in no condition to run
well on the European circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, in Berlin, he finished third in a hurdles race
and lost a chance at what would have been his biggest payday of the
season. Carole Adkins remembers watching the race on television,
seeing her son fade over the final hurdles then drop to his knees
on the track, his head cradled in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart was pounding,'' she recalled. ``I knew it was
depression-related. I called the hotel and Derrick said he was all
right, just disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, he was not all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all the excitement of the Olympics, and living in
Atlanta, the depression was pretty much drowned out by what was
going on,'' Derrick Adkins said. ``Three weeks after the Olympics,
my mood sunk dramatically. I started to feel worse than before. I
drank a whole bottle of wine one night. I needed something to
anesthetize the pain. I also had some problems with drinking prior
to the Olympics. It numbs the emotions for a little while.''
</P>
<P>
   By January 1997, Adkins resumed taking his daily medication.
Over the last three years, he said, he has felt continued emotional
stability, but there has been a tradeoff. His track career has
slumped dramatically. An Olympic champion in 1996, he could finish
no better than eighth at the 1998 national track and field
championships and seventh in 1999. In the summer of 1998, at the
Goodwill Games in Uniondale, N.Y., only a few miles from his
hometown of Lakeview, he ran before several hundred friends and
family members and finished dead last. He nearly quit the sport
then, and again during a frustrating season last summer.
</P>
<P>
   He has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in potential
earnings on the track circuit and has been dropped by the shoe
company whose apparel he endorsed. Yet he has persevered, and at
age 30, he still has hopes of qualifying for the 2000 Summer
Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Adkins will run the first round of the 400-meter
hurdles here at the Olympic track and field trials. His best time
of the season, 49.86 seconds, is more than two seconds slower than
his personal best of 47.54 run in 1996. On the face of it, he would
seem to have no chance of finishing among the top three at the
trials and qualifying for the Summer Games in September. However,
with permission from his psychiatrist, Adkins again stopped taking
Luvox two weeks ago. His training has improved significantly, and
he and his coach, Grover Hinsdale, are more encouraged about his
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make expectations,'' Hinsdale said. ``For a long
time he's been erratic. But based on his last two or three weeks of
training, there is a chance he may run well. You never say never.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkins has begun to tell his story in hopes of educating and
encouraging others who suffer from depression. Next month, he will
self-publish his autobiography, ``Let's All Get High,'' an
inspirational book aimed at young adults. The holder of a degree in
mechanical engineering from Georgia Tech, Adkins is now studying
for a master's degree in divinity at the Atlanta campus of the
Christian Life School of Theology. He credits his spirituality and
reading of the Bible with helping him pull through his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly think I am going to make the team,'' Adkins said.
``If I didn't think I could, I wouldn't go out there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cassandra Wanzo of Atlanta, the psychiatrist who is treating
Derrick Adkins, said she endorsed his decision, knowing the side
effects that anti-depressant medications can cause. Adkins said
Luvox causes tendon and muscle weakness, affects his
oxygen-carrying capacity and inhibits the adrenaline rush that
athletes use to prepare for races.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, he has experimented with different medications and
dosages, seeking to achieve both emotional stability and athletic
success. He has also begun to use natural supplements, he said. If
he makes the Olympic team, he plans to resume taking Luvox, then
stop again two to three weeks before the Summer Games to let the
medication flush from his system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a roll of the dice,'' Hinsdale said of Adkins'
decision to stop taking Luvox for the trials. The first round of
the 400 hurdles is Thursday, the semifinals are Friday, and the
final is Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gets no sleep, he has no chance,'' Hinsdale said. ``At
this point, he's sleeping very well. If he sleeps well, it was a
very good decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said he had become concerned about Adkins in the
spring of 1996, when with the Olympic trials approaching, his
energy level would suddenly dissipate in practice, ``like the
battery of a cell phone going off.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Adkins said, he had been suffering severe bouts of
depression for three years. From childhood through college, he
said, he sometimes felt low moments, but they were submerged
beneath an almost obsessive desire to obtain good grades and to
become an elite athlete. He was a dean's list student at Georgia
Tech, but in 1993, by then graduated from college and competing as
a professional athlete, he said he began to get severely depressed
for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I tried to fight it with mind power and meditation,
the more it got worse,'' he said. ``Every waking moment was a
moment of emotional pain. I didn't know where it was coming from.
All I looked forward to was sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on April 16, 1996, two months before the Olympic trials
in Atlanta, Adkins decided to get professional help and visited
Wanzo. ``He was really depressed,'' she said. ``He was at the point
where there was no reason to live. He was feeling hopeless. He did
express to me that he was thinking of buying a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her diagnosis was that he was suffering from a major
depressive disorder, a chemical imbalance, and immediately placed
him on anti-depressant medication. Adkins then told Hinsdale, his
coach, saying that he had become mentally exhausted, virtually
unable to sleep for up to three days at a time. He flew home to
tell his parents, and as she picked up her son at La Guardia
Airport, Carol Adkins noticed that he had lost considerable weight,
that his skin was pale, his eyes hollow and sunken.
</P>
<P>
   Within several weeks of taking medication, his mood elevated and
Adkins recovered sufficiently to win an Olympic gold medal. Four
years later he no longer suffers severe bouts of melancholy but
also no longer hurdles with the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accomplished the highest level of achievement in this
sport,'' Adkins said. ``If I don't make the Olympic team, I already
have what all the other athletes are searching for. If I accomplish
nothing else, I've already had a great career. At the same time, I
hope and plan to make the team. Since leaving Luvox, there has been
a definite change in my ability and endurance. I knew the drug was
holding me back, but I didn't want to go off of it. When you go off
for general purposes, it gives me a lot of mood swings. I like my
moods to be stable. But since this is the Olympic trials, I've
decided to go off of it. A lot of people will be surprised by how
fast I am running. If I don't make the team, I'll come close.''  &QL;

COMMENTARY: COVERDELL, A QUIET MAN IN A NOISY TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  By HOWELL RAINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 20:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia was a mild-mannered Republican
seasoned in political obscurity. As minority leader of the Georgia
State Senate in the 1970s, he was part of a legislative bloc so
small and impotent that it was ignored, steamrolled and sometimes
openly ridiculed by the Democrats who controlled the Legislature as
if by birthright. None of us covering the Georgia Capitol in those
days would have picked Coverdell, who died Tuesday at age 61, as a
future U.S. senator. Now, in retrospect, we can see him as part of
the second of two transforming waves that swept Georgia politics in
the last third of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The first wave of change was driven by law. The Voting Rights
Act of 1965 brought hundreds of black Democrats into office. The
second wave of change was demographic, as exemplified by
fast-growing Atlanta. Georgia's progressive Democrats had long
dreamed of the day when Atlanta would be big enough to outvote the
state's rural conservatives. What they had not foreseen was that
thousands of the newcomers flooding into the Atlanta suburbs would
be out-of-state Republicans who rejected both the Democratic power
structure and the Goldwater Republicans then in control of the
Southern GOP.
</P>
<P>
   They created a ready-made constituency for Coverdell, a classic
mainstream Republican who was fiscally conservative yet moderate on
social issues. ``That was what made the Republican Party attractive
to these people who came in,'' said Bill Shipp, a veteran political
commentator from Atlanta. ``Until Coverdell and Johnny Isakson
[another Atlanta moderate) came along, Georgia Republicans were
disgruntled segregationist Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the sprinkling of ultraconservative Republicans elected
during the Goldwater boom, Coverdell was not hostile to black
aspirations. Indeed, by the time he left the Georgia Senate in
1989, he had gained enough influence to make his mark as a reliable
legislative advocate for Atlanta's black mayors. He was known as a
policy wonk and a nice guy, traits that would mark his service as
director of the Peace Corps under President George Bush. He worked
hard in that position to promote a program that is unpopular with
many Republicans because of its identification with President John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   A similar earnestness would mark Coverdell's career in the U.S.
Senate, but he did not get there by wearing a halo or emphasizing
his credentials as a moderate. He won his seat from Wyche Fowler, a
Democrat popular with liberals, by running to the right, especially
on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, always tricky to define political moderation
among Southern Republicans. By any measure, Coverdell, a big
booster of tax cuts and school vouchers, was plenty conservative.
Lately he had grown close to Trent Lott, the Senate's tough-guy
majority leader. But his primary alliances were with less
hard-edged types like President Bush and his son George W. Bush,
the Texas governor. He helped plan the coming Republican
Convention. In the event of a Republican victory, according to Sen.
Max Cleland of Georgia, a Democrat, Coverdell ``would have played a
big role in a Bush administration, in the cabinet or as a special
adviser.'' But in a region that still tends to celebrate pols who
are loud and flashy, Coverdell will be remembered for his general
decency, his serious interest in good government and his unlikely
leap from the back benches of the Georgia Capitol.

   &LR; SACRAMENTO _ Rafer Johnson lit the torch during the opening
ceremony at the 1984 Olympics, his ascent of the L.A. Coliseum
steps eyeballed by 100,000 mesmerized spectators and a worldwide
television audience.
</P>
<P>
   That was soothing _ a veritable deep-tissue massage on his
nerves _ next to this. Tonight, Johnson will sit in Cal State
Sacramento's Hornet Stadium and watch his son Josh try to qualify
for the 2000 U.S. Olympic Track and Field team in the javelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even close,'' Johnson said Wednesday. He fidgeted
fretfully in his seat. ``There's no comparison. It's way more
nerve-racking watching Josh compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying round of the event Monday was unadulterated agony
for the elder Johnson, a two-time Olympic medalist in the
decathlon. The Sherman Oaks resident is here to tell you there is
an event even more grueling than his 10-event specialty.
</P>
<P>
   It's called offspring gazing.
</P>
<P>
   Watching his son post the fifth-best throw in the first flight
and then waiting helplessly to see how many of the 19 throwers in
the second flight surpassed it gave Rafer Johnson a worse case of
cotton mouth than the pole vault ever did. His stomach was churning
more than it would down the stretch of the 1,500 meters, the
decathlon's fitting finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is much different than when I was competing,''
Johnson said. ``Then I could work out or find some way to burn that
nervous energy.''
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, all he can do is sit and pray. Oh, Johnson could
hold up sign boards with silly sayings like another proud papa,
Richard Williams. He could stand up and shout instructions to his
son, thus assuring the television cameras, which were largely
absent in his heyday, found him.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not Johnson's style. The way he sees it, he has had
his day on sport's center stage. It's his kids' turn now, and so he
sets up in the shadows and stalwartly supports his children (his
daughter Jenny Johnson Jordan is inching ever closer to securing a
U.S. Olympic berth with partner Annett Buckner-Davis in beach
volleyball).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was ``holding his breath'' Monday as the second
javelin qualifying flight wound down. Seven throwers surpassed
Josh's best throw of 226 feet, 9 inches, leaving him the 12th and
final qualifier for tonight's final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone came up to me afterward and said, `Your son just made
it by the skin of his teeth,' '' Johnson said. ``My reply was,
`Doesn't matter. All that matters is he made it.' Everybody starts
with a clean slate now. If he catches one, he can be right there.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke of his son's prospects, Johnson's chiseled features
softened; it was obvious that seeing the soft-spoken, statuesque
Johnson as a father is catching him in his most flattering light.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson shed his athletic past when his children were young,
boxing up and putting aside all his sporting mementos as though his
storied athletics career was a sweater that no longer fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt when we had children, it was their time,''
Johnson said. ``So from the time they were very young, we tried to
make the house theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was you could walk into the Johnson's Sherman Oaks home
and see Jenny's soccer trophies prominently displayed and Josh's
track ribbons but neither Rafer's silver medal from the 1956
Olympics nor his gold medal from the 1960 Summer Games in Rome.
Jenny and Josh Johnson would get to ogle their father's Olympic
hardware once a year like Fourth of July fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go to their schools on a yearly basis and bring my medals
and speak,'' Johnson said. ``They could hold them and rub them
then, along with their classmates. I think they learned a little
bit about what I'd done from the appearances I made and the talks I
gave.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a parent, of course, is an ongoing revelation. Johnson
experienced the pressure of competing for an Olympic gold medal as
the world-record holder in Melbourne, Australia, in 1956. He
suffered the disappointment of finishing second to teammate Milt
Campbell there and the thrill of winning four years later. And yet
nothing from his athletic past prepared him for his children's
sporting pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it goes well for them, I have great weeks,'' Johnson
said. ``When it doesn't go quite the way they want it, I'm bothered
just like they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Johnson was feted along with other former U.S.
Olympians at a lavish dinner at the Convention Center. Earlier in
the day, he admitted that even as he was enjoying the company of
former U.S. teammates and good friends such as Glenn Davis, his
mind would be with his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a flash of a thought, definitely,'' Johnson
said. ``The flash will come when I look around and think it would
be so great if Josh and Jenny could make an Olympic team and
someday have this same experience.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 20:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a magazine like Fortune or Forbes conducts a survey to
determine who is the most admired businessman of the year, decade
or even the century, Jack Welch of General Electric invariably
finishes at or near the top of the list. In his 20 years as GE's
chief executive officer, Welch has generated enormous wealth not
only for the company's stockholders but for hundreds of companies
that do business with GE. But is Welch worth $7.1 million as a
writer? That is what Time Warner Trade Publishing has agreed to
advance him for a book about his career, his business philosophy
and whatever else Welch chooses to write about when he retires next
year. It is the biggest advance in publishing history, exceeding
the up-front money paid to Colin Powell and the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Paying off a $7.1 million advance will require North American
hardcover sales of 1.6 million books. Only one or two titles a year
sell more than a million copies. A recent best seller by
Microsoft's Bill Gates sold about half a million. So this is a
gamble, but to some publishing executives, not nearly the gamble it
seems to be. The reason is that whatever Welch writes is going to
be perceived as the bible of American business.
</P>
<P>
   People are not going to buy it for its plot, character
development or sex appeal. Unlike Chrysler's Lee Iacocca, whose
story sold an astonishing 2.6 million hardcover books, Welch did
not rescue a large American company from bankruptcy, nor does he
have Iacocca's promotional flair. People will buy Welch's book
because it will be marketed as the definitive text of modern
American business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Does he have enough managerial wisdom to write such a bible?
Welch himself would say no. But a lot of people think he has all
the answers, and Time Warner is betting that that there are at
least 1.6 million people willing to pay good money to find out what
they are. There may be other factors at work here, too, including
America's growing obsession with business and the stock market. But
the real come-on is Welch and his mystique.
</P>
<P>
   That mystique is grounded in some hard realities. He took a
company with a market value slightly in excess of $12 billion and
turned it into a company worth $500 billion. Along the way he sold
off underperforming divisions and fired about 100,000 people, thus
earning himself the name ``Neutron Jack.'' He also introduced
simplicity to an excessively cumbersome system of checks and
balances. GE was famous for, even admired for its layers of sector
managers, department managers, unit managers and supervisors, all
of whom were thought to be essential to strategic planning and
quality control. Neutron Jack threw some ordnance at this system,
and when the dust cleared he had eliminated all but four of nine
hierarchical levels _ and, more important, made sure that the
bosses of each of GE's various businesses reported directly to him.
</P>
<P>
   Freed of fuzzy paternalism, the people who remained were
encouraged to think for themselves and question the corporate
culture, resulting not only in technological innovation but in huge
cost savings. At the same time, Welch was not at all shy about
borrowing good ideas when he came across them. Companies like
Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba gave him tips on productivity and
customer relations, and from Allied Signal and Motorola he lifted
an entire system of quality control.
</P>
<P>
   Welch is not without his critics. But in an era when CEO's seem
to hang around for only two or three years (see Coca-Cola, or
Mattel) before the directors decide they have made a mistake,
Welch's 20 years of virtually uninterrupted success inspires
curiosity _ enough, Time Warner hopes, to sell 1.6 million books.

EDITORIAL: INFERNAL SNOWMOBILES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., Idaho, Wyo., Nev.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 20:
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, the subject on the Senate floor turned
to snowmobiling in the national parks. ``You will see very little
variety in wildlife in Yellowstone in the wintertime,'' Sen. Conrad
Burns of Montana remarked. ``If you have been there, you know that
about the only thing you will see is bison. Let me tell you, you
don't bother them with a little old snowmobile.'' Sen. Larry Craig
of Idaho agreed. ``Somehow,'' he mused, ``the wildlife of
Yellowstone is going through some emotional problem as a result of
snowmobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns and Craig were not alone in making fun of the Interior
Department's sensible and long-overdue ban on snowmobiling in the
national parks, which was announced in April. And Sen. Craig
Thomas, R-Wyo., offered an amendment to the Interior Department
appropriations bill that would have torpedoed the administration's
ban by ordering up one of those endless ``studies'' of the
situation and by denying Interior the funds it needs to carry out
the ban. Thomas later withdrew his amendment. But the clear threat
was that it would resurface later this summer when the House and
Senate meet in conference to resolve their differing versions of
the appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   This is a typical example of the legislation-by-stealth employed
by anti-environmental senators. The senators who oppose an end to
snowmobiling in the parks know that the ban enjoys widespread
public support and is buttressed by careful, conscientious science.
Their only hope to scuttle the ban is to do so out of sight. The
Interior Department's rule is and has been open for public comment.
That is a far more democratic procedure than the device of sneaking
a piece of substantive legislation into an appropriations bill
without hearings, which is what the Westerners clearly intend to
do.
</P>
<P>
   As for the proposed ``study,'' the issue has already been fully
investigated by the Air Resources Division of the National Park
Service, which concluded that snowmobiles create a
disproportionately large amount of atmospheric pollution in
Yellowstone. But there are other compelling reasons to ban
snowmobiles. Their numbers, their noise and their ability to
disrupt wildlife contradict the National Park Service's mandate to
maintain, unimpaired, the natural resources of the parks.
</P>
<P>
   One lone Westerner, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, made yet another
telling argument. He pointed out that of the 130,000 miles of
designated snowmobile trails in the United States, only 600 are in
national parks. That leaves 129,400 miles for the machines. That
seems sufficient.  &QL;
