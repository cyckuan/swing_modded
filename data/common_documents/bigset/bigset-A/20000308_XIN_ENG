<HEADLINE> French Soldiers Wounded in Terrorist Bombing in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Seven French soldiers with the
multinational peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) were wounded in
a terrorist grenade attack launched by unidentified attackers in
the Yugoslav province on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen local residents were also wounded in the the grenade
attack, which targeted a U.N. registration point.
</P>
<P>
At about noon, grenade explosions and gunfire struck the
registration area in the northern, Serb-held part of Kosovska
Mitrovica, according to the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
French peacekeepers immediately began searching for the
attackers in the Bosnjacka Mahala neighborhood, which was
predominantly ethnic Albanian before the Kosovo war in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kosovska Mitrovica, 32 kilometers northwest of the provincial
capital of Pristina, has been the scene of repeated terrorist
attacks in recent weeks that caused several deaths and tens of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Since violence intensified in the area in early February, more
than 30 French peacekeepers have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
KFOR peacekeepers have stepped up their efforts to control
Kosovo's borders since the start of this week, in an effort to
stop the infiltration of personnel and weapons into the troubled
region.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Dam Not to Increase Discharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The company that operates the giant
Cahora Bassa dam on the Zambezi river in Mozambique's western
province of Tete insisted Tuesday that there will be no increase
in discharges from the dam, despite Zambia decided to open
floodgates on the Kariba dam further upstream.
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement that the Cahora Bassa lake can
 hold a further 25 billion cubic metres of water. This means that
the discharges from Kariba can be held by Cahora Bassa for a
further 30 days, without posing any danger of flooding in the
Zambezi valley.
</P>
<P>
The lake has been receiving 2,700 cubic metres of water a
second since February 25, when the discharge from Kariba increased
to 7,200 metres a second.
</P>
<P>
The company is confident that, given the huge storage capacity
of the lake, Cahora Bassa has no need to increase its own
discharge from the normal 1, 600 cubic metres a second.

<HEADLINE> China to Recognize Future Palestinian State: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's representative to the
Palestinian National Authority Wu Jiu Hong has said China will be
among the first countries to recognize the Palestinian state when
it is declared.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks in an interview with the Palestinian News
Agency here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China has already recognized the Palestinian state when it was
declared in exile in Algiers in 1988, Wu said, reaffirming that
China will recognize the state when it is declared on the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat said on Tuesday that the year 2000
would witness the declaration of an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital. He noted that the definite and firm
decision on statehood declaration would incarnate the Palestinian
national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
As for the Middle East peace process, China has supported the
process since the Madrid peace conference in 1991, which kicked off
the Mideast peace drive, Wu said, noting that neither wars, Jewish
settlement activities nor unilateral move could solve the Middle
East problem.
</P>
<P>
Dialog and serious negotiations are the only means for defusing
tension and establishing a fair and comprehensive peace in the
region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official urged for commitment to all relevant U.N.
resolutions especially regarding the Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to offer every possible help to push forward the
peace process, Wu said. He pointed out the necessity of
implementing all Palestinian-Israeli accords to resolve the
problems facing the peace march, urging the Israeli government in
particular to put into force the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak reached
an agreement in the West Bank town of Ramallah on resuming the
peace talks in Washington after the Muslim Feast of Sacrifice,
which ends on March 19.
</P>
<P>
The agreement ended the month-long deadlock between the two
sides, which provides that Israeli-agreed further West Bank land
transfer of 6.1 percent will be carried out within days, a
framework deal on a permanent peace will be sealed by May and the
September 13 date for a permanent peace accord should be honored.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli settlement activities, Wu said the settlement
expansion will not guarantee the security of Israel, but rather
worsen the situation and escalate tension between the parties
concerned, he added.
</P>
<P>
Terming Chinese-Palestinian ties as strong and distinguished, Wu
said that the Chinese people and government would continue
supporting the Palestinian fair cause and the rights of the
Palestinian people to freedom and dignity within their independent
state.
</P>
<P>
Expressing appreciation for achievements made by the PNA within
a short period of time, Wu said China will continue its
contributions to many joint projects in the Palestinian self-rule
areas.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Pakistan to Expand Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Pakistan here on Wednesday
stressed the need for expanding mutual cooperation in economic and
industrial fields, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with visiting Pakistani Commerce Minister Abdur
Razzaq Daud, Iranian Industries Minister Gholamreza Shafei said
there are suitable grounds for the expansion of mutual cooperation
mainly in the commercial sector.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's potentials in the cement, chemical, flour
and rubber industries, he called for further broadening of mutual
cooperation, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani minister was mainly interested in the marketing of
his country's textile products in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He also introduced Pakistan's production and export capacities
in sugar cane, textiles, vehicles and some other products and
called for the expansion of trade exchange between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales in Britain Fall on Price Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) - New car sales in Britain fell in
February to 73,735 - 12.3 percent lower than in the same month in
1999, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
(SMMT).
</P>
<P>
The motor trade is pinning its hopes on March's "W" plate
lifting total new car registrations above the previous March's 370,
060.
</P>
<P>
This also suggests that consumers may be waiting to see if
prices fall following the publication of the government's
Competition Commission report into the new car market which is
expected in a few weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been holding an investigation into car
prices after a host of top-name manufacturers were accused of "
price-fixing" - preventing dealers offering discounts beyond a set
level.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, the motor industry remained upbeat, as the
figures were better than forecast. "We forecast 70,000
registrations for February but actually secured 73,735," said SMMT
chief executive Christopher Macgowan.
</P>
<P>
The industry was confident that March 2000 sales of the new W-
registration cars would exceed the March 1999 total of 370,060,
Macgowan said.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches Program for Reducing Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Wednesday
launched a European Climate Change Program with two initiatives
for meeting emission reduction target which the European Union (EU)
is committed under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive advocates a twin-track strategy for
implementing the emission reduction target, giving new impetus to
the 15-nation bloc's efforts for reducing greenhouse gases that
lead to global warming.
</P>
<P>
A Green paper on emission trading foresees the setting-up of an
emissions trading system within the EU for the energy sector and
big industrial installations. The second pillar of the strategy
are targeted measures to reduce emissions from specific sources.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner Margot Wallstrom said she is very satisfied to
see both the proposals adopted together, because the key to
meeting EU's Kyoto commitments is not to concentrate on one or the
other sector, or one or the other instrument, but to take action
simultaneously on a broad range of emission sources.
</P>
<P>
"This is why we have decided to launch a European Climate
Change Program. Together with other policies and measures,
emissions trading will be an integral part of this program and the
Community's implementation strategy," she said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the EU member states need to make much more effort
to meet its Kyoto target for reducing greenhouse gas emission by 8
percent in the time-frame between 2008 and 2012. The latest data
show that CO2 emission are increasing rather than decreasing, and
that the 8 percent reduction objective will not be met if no
additional measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
This emphasizes the need for a reinforcement of policies and
measures to reduce emissions across all sectors of the EU's
economy, the EU executive said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces continued
their assaults Wednesday on the remaining rebels in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya, killing 37 militants.
</P>
<P>
Two special officers of the Justice Ministry were killed and
seven interior troops wounded in fighting near the village of
Komsomolskoye, said Gennady Alyokhin, head of the North Caucasus
army group's press center.
</P>
<P>
In the fighting near the village of Selmentauzen 37 rebels were
killed earlier Wednesday, the Interfax news agency quoted Alyokhin
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fierce battles are continuing in the Komsomolskoye, where
Russian commanders hope to capture Ruslan Gelayev, a senior rebel
field commander leading 25-30 rebels.
</P>
<P>
Another band of rebels has been surrounded on the outskirts of
the village, Alyokhin said.
</P>
<P>
With the bulk of rebels destroyed in the campaign that started
last September, military authorities said they are now employing
what they called large-scale reconnaissance operations to find the
remaining rebels.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft and special equipment will be utilized in the
reconnaissance, said Colonel General Gennady Troshev, acting
commander of the Russian army group in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya has now been divided into strips and specific army
units have been to search and destroy the enemy in their strips,
Troshev said.
</P>
<P>
He said rebel commanders Shamil Basayev and Khattab might be
somewhere west of the Argun gorge where fighting is underway.
</P>
<P>
They tried to break through Russian lines on two occasions but
failed both times, Troshev said.
</P>
<P>
Federal air force destroyed a runway on Goluboye Lake in Vedeno
district on Tuesday, he said. The runway was believed to be made
for the evacuation of the rebel ringleaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) - Profits at British American Tobacco
(BAT), the world's second largest cigarette company, jumped 86
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The company markets brands such as Lucky Strike, State Express
555 and now Rothmans, reported pre-tax 1999 profits of 1.371
billion pounds after 738 million pounds a year earlier on turnover
up 25 percent at 21.7 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
BAT announced that the growth in profits was boosted by a seven-
month contribution from Rothmans, which was overtaken by the
company last year.
</P>
<P>
The takeover of Rothmans created a global tobacco group, second
in size only to Philip Morris, which makes Marlboro.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the Rothmans merger, we made a major advance in
1999," BAT chairman Martin Broughton said. But he expressed "
disappointment" that its success has yet to be reflected in its
share price.
</P>
<P>
Its shares have underperformed the benchmark UK share index,
the FTSE, by 20.3 percent in the past 12 months.On Monday, they
closed at 274p after a setting a high of 675p in January 1999.

NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi
said Wednesday that his government was taking measures to curb
the proliferation of illegal firearms in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
"No effort will be spared to contain the situation," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the firearms posed a threat to state security, Moi
ordered officials in border areas to fight the smuggling of small
arms.
</P>
<P>
Moi told local officials to assure the public of their security
so as to reduce the possibility that they arm themselves.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has been plagued by illegal small arms from neighboring
war-torn countries like Sudan and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The illegal arms have fueled the violence in the country, where
the crime rate is on the rise due to high unemployment and slow
economic growth.

<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's tax revenues rose by 21 percent in
February this year as compared to the same month of 1999, reaching
11.9 billion shekels (2.975 billion U.S. dollars), said the Finance
Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The amazing increase was owe to the 33 percent jump in income
tax receipts in the month, which amounted to 1.825 billion dollars
as against 1.35 billion dollars in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the February tax revenues was still lower compared with
January, during which 3.025 billion dollars were collected.

<P>
JERUSALEM -- New sales in life insurance in Israel totalled 0.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's High Court of Justice
said in a landmark ruling Wednesday that Arab citizens of the
Jewish state could no more be prevented from living wherever they
choose in the country.
</P>
<P>
The five-judge panel of the High Court of Justice also ruled
that
it was illegal to designate any community in Israel as exclusively
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was handed down in a case brought by the Association
for Civil Rights in Israel on behalf of an Arab Israeli couple who
were rejected as potential homeowners by a resident's cooperative
committee in the small northern town of Katzir.
</P>
<P>
"It is the most important High Court decision regarding Arabs
and
their equal rights," said Dan Yakir, the association's legal
counsel who represented the Arab couple.
</P>
<P>
The panel, headed by President of the High Court of Justice
Aharon Barak, said no Israeli citizen could be refused, because
of "religion or creed," the right to buy land in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Arab couple wanted to be enrolled as members of the

Katzir cooperative, but were refused because the cooperative said
it does not accept Israeli Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The association, on behalf of the couple, filed shortly after
the
incident the suit against the Israel Lands Administration, the
Jewish Agency and the Katzir cooperative.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish Agency is an organization dealing with immigration
issues and the establishment of Jewish towns and communities in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling received mixed reactions in Israel. The
National
Religious Party, the right-wing party within Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's coalition, strongly opposed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The party said Wednesday that the ruling could cause tremendous
damage to judaism.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Arabs voiced their support for the ruling, saying it

was the precedent set by the court.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Iran Hint on Increase of Oil Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Iran on
Wednesday agreed that world oil producing countries should provide
adequate and timely supplies for the good of the world's economy,
hinting major oil producers will ease their current production
curb.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a meeting between Saudi Oil
Minister Ali Al-N'aimi and his Iranian counterpart Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh, who arrived here earlier in the day for discussions on
conditions of the global oil market.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers considered the current hike of oil prices a
matter that is not in favor of the oil producing and consuming
countries, a press release issued after the meeting was quoted by
the Kuwait News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the two sides asserted that the agreement was
of importance to the stability of the international oil market.
</P>
<P>
But the fresh consensus of the world's two key producers
reflected a backdown of Iran's previous opposition to higher oil
output by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
OPEC members Iran, Libya and Algeria said in a joint statement
issued by Iranian Oil Ministry on Monday that they opposed oil
production increases, on grounds that world demand will fall by 3
million barrels per day (bpd) in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The trio's statement, which ran counter to the position adopted
in London last week by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico, pushed
the prices of Benchmark Brent North Sea crude to a new nine-year
peak of 31 U.S. dollars a barrel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rampant oil markets have prompted United States President
Bill Clinton to warn OPEC that high prices were not in its long-
term interests.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials, including Clinton himself, have recently
been lobbying for an increase of oil supply to cool off the surging
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers are scheduled to hold their annual meeting in
Vienna on March 27 to decide whether to extend or slightly ease the
one-year production reduction agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement due to expire by the end of this month, OPEC
members began to slash their output by 1.7 million bpd from April
1, 1999, while non-OPEC producers cut their daily production by
400,000 barrels.

<HEADLINE> Turkey After Post of OIC Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has named a career diplomat
as candidate to campaign for the post of Secretary-General of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), reported Turkish
Daily News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For his rich knowledge and good command of foreign languages,
notably Arabic, Yasar Yakis is described in Ankara's diplomatic
circle as a powerful match for a position of this nature.
</P>
<P>
The 56-member OIC, one of the most influential establishments in
the Islamic world, was formed in May 1970 with its headquarters in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is one of the founding members of the OIC.
</P>
<P>
Azeddine Laraki, current OIC secretary-general from Morocco, was
elected to office in 1996 and is due to be replaced in the near
future. His predecessor was also from Morocco and served a four-
year term in office.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Morocco is trying its utmost to ensure that
another Moroccan assumes the position for a third consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming Arab League meeting to be held at the
weekend, Morocco is expected to convince others to agree on a
binding decision to support its candidate.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey argues that as two Moroccans have served in
office for two consecutive terms, it is now time for the Asian
group to take its turn. The OIC members are grouped under Africa,
Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
So far Oman and Sudan have officially announced that they will
support the candidate nominated by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Leaders Break Deadlock in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
leaders agreed at a summit here Wednesday to resume peace talks
between the two sides later this month in Washington, breaking a
month-long deadlock in the peace process on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat decided that the negotiations will
resume after the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of
Sacrifice, which ends on March 19.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, who attended the two-
hour summit, made the announcement on behalf of the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The parties made good progress in addressing and resolving many
of the interim issues and agreed to intensify their negotiations,"
Ross said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
"Toward this end, they agreed that the negotiations will resume
after the Eid in Washington," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the objective (of the resumption of the talks) is to
achieve a framework agreement as soon as possible so that all the
permanent issues will be resolved by September 13.
</P>
<P>
Ross did not elaborate on what progress Barak and Arafat have
achieved at the summit, the second between the two leaders in less
than 24 hours. They met late Tuesday night in central Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio
shortly before the summit that Israel and the Palestinians have
agreed on a new timetable for both interim and permanent issues.
</P>
<P>
According to the reported compromise deal, Israel will carry out
a long-overdue troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank
in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to reach a framework agreement on a
permanent peace by May, three months after the initial deadline
they set in the Sharm el Sheikh agreement last year, and clinch a
final peace treaty by September 13 as scheduled in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations broke down on
February 3 over a dispute on the 6.1 percent withdrawal, which
should have been implemented on January 20.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians wanted the land to be transferred at this stage
to include Arab villages and towns around Jerusalem, whose future
status is among the toughest issues supposed to be resolved in the
permanent peace talks. Israel rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise gesture, Israel identified 10 percent of the
West Bank from which the Palestinians can select 6.1 percent. But
Arab areas around Jerusalem were excluded in this offer.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accepted the offer after Israel agreed to carry
out the third and the last phase of the interim redeployments by
June. Barak had wanted to combine this withdrawal into the
permanent peace talks, but the Palestinians had rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
At their summit late Tuesday, Barak reportedly presented a "
confidence-building" package to Arafat that includes release of
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the opening of a
northern "safe passage" between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise gesture on their part, the Palestinians accepted
Barak's new timetable for reaching a framework agreement by May.
After the two sides missed the February 13 deadline for such a
deal, the Palestinians had suggested that the two sides skip over
the framework accord and focus on the final treaty instead.
</P>
<P>
The mutual compromise was achieved as a result of intensive
mediating efforts by the United States and Egypt in the last few
days. Ross returned to the region Tuesday for the second time in
less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Ross said after the Wednesday summit that both President Bill
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have stressed
that the Palestinian track is the core of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Levy will fly to Sharm el Sheikh Thursday for a
meeting with Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a
Palestinian official told Xinhua at the hotel where the Israeli-
Palestinian summit was held.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Peace Talks Need to be Upgraded: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
on Wednesday stressed the need to upgrade the Cyprus peace talks so
that they can "go into the substance of the issue."
</P>
<P>
Clerides met United States Presidential Emissary for Cyprus
Alfred Moses and State Department Coordinator Thomas Weston, who
arrived here Tuesday on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said after the meeting
that the U.S. officials did not put forward any new ideas.
</P>
<P>
"The President of the Republic (of Cyprus) had the opportunity
to elaborate on our side's views regarding the need to upgrade the
talks and make them more substantive so they become more effective
and are sped up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou noted the Cyprus government is open to any new views
or ideas as long as they are within the framework of United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a short statement, Moses said the meeting with Clerides is
a "good meeting" but he refrained from making any further comment.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a pro-
Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been pushing for reunification of Cyprus under a
bizonal, bicommunal federation formula but all efforts have so far
failed.
</P>
<P>
As a new effort to reach a solution in Cyprus, two rounds of U.
N.-sponsored proximity talks between the two sides have been held
since last December.
</P>
<P>
A third round of separate meetings is scheduled to begin in the
U.N. headquarters in New York on May 23.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Moses, Weston and U.S. Ambassador in Cyprus Donald
Bandler had a meeting with British High Commissioner Edward Clay
and were scheduled to have a working lunch with Cyprus Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides later in the day.
</P>
<P>
They will cross into the northern area Thursday to meet with
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.

<HEADLINE> Bradley to Quit Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Former New Jersey Senator Bill
Bradley is planning to drop out of the presidential race Thursday
and endorse Vice President Al Gore for presidential nomination,
his advisers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gore swept the Democratic primaries and caucuses in all the 15
states from coast to coast on Super Tuesday, leaving Bradley in no
position to continue the race.
</P>
<P>
AP quoted two senior Bradley advisers as saying that the former
senator would leave the race Thursday and endorse Gore at a news
conference near his New Jersey headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Bradley's decision marks the end of a candidacy that soared
briefly but floundered when the first votes were cast in the Iowa
caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
Both Bradley and Gore praised one another in public comments
Tuesday night after Gore's victories sealed Bradley's fate.
</P>
<P>
His quick embrace of Gore is bound to increase speculation
about Bradley as a potential running mate.
</P>
<P>
"I'll make my plans known shortly,"' Bradley said after his
defeat in the 15 states, including Missouri, where Bradley was
born, and New York, where he was a basketball star.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: United Nations Calls for World Help for Flood-Hit Mozambique (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday joined the U.N. agencies once again in calling for
massive aid to Mozambique, saying that the flooding in the
Southern African country was "all the more tragic" because the
nation was considered an African success story over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's call coincided with the announcement by the
Rome-based U.N. World Food Program (WFP) to prepare a second
appeal to help Mozambican flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, concerned over the worsening flooding
situation in Mozambique, has responded with strengthened efforts
to seek more funds, helicopters for the Southern African country
in a bid to assist Maputo in fighting against the nation's worst
flooding in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Annan, at a press conference here Tuesday, urged governments
and aid agencies to give generously to Mozambique as well as
neighboring countries affected by the worst flood in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"It is bitterly ironic that the Economist Intelligence Unit
had singled out Mozambique as likely to have the highest growth
rate in Africa this year," Annan said. "But at least that means we
know the government and people there can make good use of any aid
they receive."
</P>
<P>
One day earlier, the president of the U.N. Security Council,
Anwarul Chowdhury of Bangladesh, issued a statement, saying that
all 15 Council members were "gravely concerned" that the floods
had seriously slowed the "impressive progress" of recent years,
particularly in the areas of rehabilitation of victims of war and
large-scale de-mining, and could severely erode the benefit of
post-war recovery.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique had recovered from a civil war, which broke out
shortly after its independence fro Portugal in 1975. The United
Nations sent a peace-keeping force into the country to cement a
1992 truce.
</P>
<P>
The statement also commended the regional and international
relief efforts in Mozambique and urged all governments and the
international community to do as much as possible to help the
people and the Government of Mozambique to overcome the
devastating effects of the floods that began on February 11.
</P>
<P>
Scores of international relief organizations and at least 16
Western and African governments have provided more than 100
million U.S. dollars to help Mozambique recover from the floods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations has reported "steady progress"
in the efforts by the international community to provide emergency
assistance to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
more than 10,000 people have been rescued so far by air, and such
operations were in the process of being completed.
</P>
<P>
The aid operation, which included forty-three helicopters and
120 inflatable boats, was being overseen by two coordination
centers, one in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, and other in
Beira in the central part of the African nation.
</P>
<P>
"The major thrust now is the supply by air and water of food
and equipment for ensuring clean drinking water as well as the
movement of personnel and supplies to address health needs," he
said. "One hundred tons of aid is being distributed daily. Shelter
is also a priority."
</P>
<P>
In fact, these needs were among the priorities outlined by the
ministers from Botswana, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa
held last Friday in Pretoria, South Africa. International
contributors, or at least pledges, to the emergency effort now
stand at 78 million U.S. dollars, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations appealed last week for 13.6 million U.S.
dollars to help 300,000 people for six months with food assistance,
shelter, health care, water, sanitation and education.
</P>
<P>
The floodwaters that swept across the country have receded,
leaving at least 400 confirmed and a million people either
homeless or in desperate need of help.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 950,000 people have been affected by the flooding,
including 250,000 people who were displaced from their homes and
are currently being sheltered in 64 care centers or camps in the
Limpopo and Save river basin areas.
</P>
<P>
With the level of all rivers continuing to fall and Cylone
Gloria dropping in intensity, plans are under way to re-open the
road from Maputo to the coastal city of Macia, some 150 kilometers
to the northeast in order to facilitate the delivery of food and
other emergency items.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Targets Violence Against Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children
's Fund (UNICEF) on Wednesday issued a strong attack against
culturally-sanctioned homicidal violence directed at women and
girls around the world.
</P>
<P>
In a statement marking the International Women's Day, March 8,
2000, Executive Director of UNICEF, Carol Bellamy, said "honor"
killings, acid violence, female infanticide and bride burning are
examples of men and boys killing or seriously injuring female
family and community members with impunity.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said it is an outrage when those who commit such crimes
are openly admired in their communities and are subjected to only
token prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Although these crimes are unacceptable to the public in
virtually all countries, the practices persist, even where there
are legal prohibitions, Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said these crimes, along with the forced marriage,
involuntary virginity tests, female genital mutilation,
trafficking and forced prostitution, are egregious violations of
girls' and women's rights, based on outmoded and unjust cultural
norms.
</P>
<P>
She cited the call of United Nations Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women on
governments to recognize, and work to modify inherited prejudices
and customs which have made so-called "honor" killings and acid
attacks acceptable.

<HEADLINE> Koehler as new Europe's IMF candidate </HEADLINE>

<P>
BERLIN, March 8 (Xinhua) --After the failure of Caio Koch-
Weser, Horst Koehler is expected to be approved by the European
Union as a common nominee, a spokesman for German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
58-year-old Koehler was named Tuesday as German candidate for
the post of managing director of the International Monetary Fund (
IMF).
</P>
<P>
The previous nominee, Caio Koch-Weser was opposed by the
United States, the biggest shareholder. In the eyes of the U.S.
Koch-Weser lacked the qualities needed to lead one of the world's
most important financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Caio Koch-Weser, a former senior World Bank official and
currently Germany's deputy finance minister.
</P>
<P>
"There will soon be common European recommendation..." said
Schroeder's spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye.
</P>
<P>
About the new nominee, Horst Koehler who at present leads the
London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (
EBRD), had a "wide appeal".
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has been informed about the
nomination of Horst Koehler according to Spokesman Heye.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is traditionally led by a European while an American
heads the World Bank.The IMF chooses its managing director under a
consensus system in which the vote of each member state is
weighted according to its shares in the bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian foreign minister's
visit to Switzerland has encountered with enormous protests in the
Swiss capital of Berne.
</P>
<P>
After her arrival on Wednesday morning, Austria's new foreign
minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner met with her Swiss counterpart
Joseph Deiss at a government villa outside Berne for official
talks on bilateral relations and discussions on the new Austrian
government coalition, which has been widely criticized by Austria'
s European Union partners for its inclusion of the far-right
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
Security was tightened at Austrian diplomatic missions and a
number of demonstrators were held in Berne, according to Swiss
Radio International.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Switzerland's Social Democrats protested in
parliament against plans by the government to welcome Ferrero-
Waldner on Wednesday and Austria's new chancellor, Wolfgang
Schussel, at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats said the visits would make Switzerland the
first country in the world to breach the political isolation of
the new government in Vienna. In an appeal to the government, the
Social Democrats said Schussel's coalition did not deserve to be
given a chance.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Airlift Food for Flood Victims in Madagascar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food Program
will launch its first airlift operation Friday to deliver urgently
needed food rations to tens of thousand of people stricken by
floods in Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
In a press release Wednesday, WFP warned that more than half a
million people in areas worst affected by cyclones Eline and
Gloria will need emergency relief supplies including food and
medicines. Some of the worst damaged areas on the Indian Ocean
island are extremely remote.
</P>
<P>
The government of Madagascar issued an international appeal for
relief assistance on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As an immediate response, WFP will dispatch by helicopter 25
metric tons of emergency rations consisting of rice, beans and
sugar to some 30,000 people in the coastal town of Mahanoro, one
of the areas worst affected by floods.
</P>
<P>
The agency will deliver another 375 metric tons in the next few
days to other areas damaged by the two cyclones, the northeast
coastal town of Antalaha, Vatomandry and the west coastal town of
Belo-Tsiribihina.
</P>
<P>
Cyclone Eline swept through Madagascar two weeks ago before
heading on to wreak havoc in Mozambique. Last week, Cyclone Gloria
also stormed across the island following the same east-west route
and leaving another trail of heavy downpours in its wake.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Proper Radio Spectrum for Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday it is calling on European Union (EU) member states to
negotiate sufficient additional radio spectrum to allow for
further development of the third generation mobile communications
systems in the information society.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive Commission fears that insufficient spectrum
space would stunt the growth of the third generation mobile
telephony and hamper the jump to mobile Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Commission's position is set out in a policy document
adopted today on the EU priorities and objectives for the World
Radio Communications Conference 2000 that will take place from May
8 to June 2 in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations in Istanbul give Europe a vital chance to
stake out a commanding position in the information society," EU
Commissioner Erkki Liikanen said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot ensure sufficient spectrum availability for 3rd
generation mobile phones, this will severely handicap the leap of
the Internet from being screen-based to hand-held. Europe will
lose out,for the EU's big technological lead is in mobile
telecommunications. Furthermore, Europe's own Galileo satellite
navigation system needs adequate spectrum availability so that it
can develop quickly and cost-effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive's officials have agreed that Europe's lead in
mobile telephones will be crucial to maintaining its competitive
edge when the Internet goes mobile. This issue comes in the run-up
to the EU Lisbon Summit in two weeks' time, when it is hoped that
EU leaders will endorse the executive's "eEurope initiative" to
accelerate Europe's transition to the digital economy.

<HEADLINE> Greece Not to Participate in Turkish Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Navy would not
participate in a Turkish-organized NATO exercise that will take
place on April 12-22 in the Aegean Sea and eastern Mediterranean,
Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not give the reason of Greece's pullout, only
said that Greece participated in military exercise of NATO,
European and other nature to the degree that the complete
implementation of international law is safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, Greece had previously
decided to send a naval frigate to take part in the exercise, and
the military's decision to pull out came after the exercise would
reportedly involve flights over occupied northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have nearly gone to war
three times in the past 26 years over their territorial dispute in
the Aegean and the problem of Cyprus, which has been divided into
the Greek Cypriots-controlled south and the Turkish Cypriots-
dominated north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens
coup.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two neighboring countries have decreased
since last June with a series of diplomatic and civil initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Bring AIDS Education to Schools: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government said
Wednesday that it will bring education on HIV/AIDS prevention into
school curricula.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Godfrey Miyanda said that his ministry in
conjunction with United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) would integrate HIV/AIDS in the
country's school system.
</P>
<P>
Education is paramount in preventing the scourge, Miyanda told
a workshop on HIV/AIDS prevention in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Education and awareness are crucial to curbing HIV/AIDS spread,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister advised the society not to concentrate
so much on discussing the source of HIV/AIDS or statistics about
it but to concentrate on minimizing its impact.
</P>
<P>
What people should know is that HIV/AIDS is with us and there
is no cure currently, Miyanda pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Not so long ago, HIV/AIDS was believed in many countries to be
an adult problem, affecting only women and men. Even now, some
young people still deny that AIDS can affect them because all
prevention massages target adults.
</P>
<P>
But reality has shown that HIV/AIDS knows no age, and the
abounding literature on the pandemic reveals diversification in
focus for prevention, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda further explained that women have continued to suffer
the blunt of the scourge due to cultural norms and called for an
end to their subjugation.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that Zambia lost 1,000 teachers in 1998, 600
last year and expressed concern that the statistics for this year
may be higher.

JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some South African women are
still suffering domestic abuse and are threatened by the HIV/AIDS
pandemic, Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite that the Domestic Violence Act has come into effect,
South African women are still troubled by physical, emotional and
sexual abuses, Msimang said at a special debate in the National
Assembly to mark the International Women's Day which falls on
March 8.
</P>
<P>
The minister said those inflicting abuse on women must be
stopped, emphasizing that the key to solving these problems lies
in improving overall social education and giving women more power.
</P>
<P>
Women should also be courageous to resort to laws to protect
their basic rights, she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaria may break out in
South Africa' s Northern Province from mid-March, the provincial
health and welfare department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The signs of worsen-than-usual malaria epidemic have been in
place due to the recent floods in most parts of the Northern
Province, the department said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The serious situation has also left patients at risk because of
delayed immunization programs and interrupted treatment of
tuberculosis, hypertension and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no sign of cholera in the province so far,
the report said. But neighboring Mozambique has witnessed many
cholera cases due to the floods in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition is also likely to occur over a long period as a
result of acute starvation, crop destruction, and longer-term
economic effects influenced by the recent floods, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The provincial health and welfare department has planned or
already embarked on programs including teaching people how to
prevent from being infected with the diseases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rescue teams are trying to re-establish road contact
with clinics to ensure continuous supplies of medicines and other
vital items to the flood victims.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Calls for Water Transport Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has expressed deep concern over the continuing loss of life in
boat accidents on Lake Victoria and other lake waters in the
country and called for strict enforcement of water transport laws.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office Wednesday said
that the president was shocked to learn of the March 6 boat
accident on Lake Victoria in which more than 45 people are
reported to have died.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who expressed deepest condolences to all those who
lost family members, relatives and friends in this accident,
instructed the relevant government departments to take up this
matter with utmost urgency and ensure that the safety laws and
regulations governing water transport are implemented and enforced
with vigilance in order to avoid further loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
In a modernizing Uganda, it is not acceptable for people to
continue losing their lives due to inadequate enforcement of
transport regulations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place Monday afternoon when a boat loaded
with more than 60 people, much beyond its capacity, was heading
for an island in the lake and its engine stopped suddenly.
</P>
<P>
There was no life jacket on the boat when the boat capsized, a
Radio Uganda report said.
</P>
<P>
There are often reports of boat accidents in Uganda due to
overloading and inadequate safety measures.
</P>
<P>
On December 26,1999, 18 revellers celebrating Christmas
perished at Nabugabo landing site in Masaka district when their
boat capsized due to dancing by those in the boat.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, a boat carrying 145 people at Kagera on Lake
Victoria sunk and 11 people drowned. The accident followed
another one on August 24, 1999, in which 30 people drowned on Lake
Victoria near Buvuma Islands.

NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan women are determined
to fight all forms of violence, officials from the Ministry of
Gender and Social Welfare said prior to the International Women's
Day which falls on March 8.
</P>
<P>
The violence done to women include rape, defilement and
physical assault, the Rwanda News Agency quoted the officials as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It is important that all Rwandans act against women violence
and promote gender equality, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Justice Mucyo Jean De Dieu said that
judicial structures need to take a leading role in punishing
culprits of sexual violence especially.
</P>
<P>
He urged his ministry to take action and mete out heavy
punishments to those involved in such violence done to little
girls and women.
</P>
<P>
Society is urged to try by all means and denounce women
violence that is a disgrace to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Women account for 54 percent of the Rwandan population.
One-third of Rwandan families are headed by women.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Rwandan women remain employed in invisible private,
unpaid productive labor because of their low education and skills
levels, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Women, especially the unemployed in rural areas, townships and
informal settlements experience the worst effects of poverty and
AIDS.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Women Should Be Empowered Through Education: Museveni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has said that empowerment of women in the country should be
through education.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks at the national Women's Day
celebration in the western district of Rukungiri Wednesday
afternoon, a press release from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the big gathering in the Rukungiri Stadium,
the Ugandan president spoke of the leading role of the National
Resistance Movement government in the empowerment of women.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the government has appointed women to
high political positions, provided for each district to have a
woman member of parliament and set up programs for micro-credit
finance for women, the most important empowerment of women in
Uganda has just started through the Universal Primary Education
(UPE) program launched in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Museveni stressed that the women's problem was not first and
foremost political but rather social due to the fact that girls
have not been having equal opportunities with boys in going to
schools.
</P>
<P>
He also addressed other issues concerning women's co-ownership
of lands with their husbands, marriage commercialization and
employment.
</P>
<P>
Since the advent of UPE program, primary school enrolment has
more than doubled to 6.5 million pupils. Most of the increased
number of primary school pupils are girls.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will coordinate
with other developing countries within the World Trade
Organization (WTO) so as to reach a common position, Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Erwin told the National Assembly that South Africa's policy
within the WTO was to support the liberalization of trade and
services, provided the present international general agreement on
trade and services was maintained.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking certain initiatives to increase our trade with
economies such as Brazil within the South American Common market,
known as MERCUSOR and economies such as India within South East
Asia, and of course, in Africa as well," Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia visited South
Africa last week to begin negotiations on a possible free trade
agreement between the Southern Africa Customs Union and MERCOSUR
and to develop a joint approach to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
MERCOSUR is made up of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Erwin dismissed opposition criticism for developing links with
Cuba and Libya, saying the government would focus on enhancing
relations with many economies, including those two.
</P>
<P>
"There are tremendous opportunities for South African business
and traders in economies like Cuba and Libya and elsewhere," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Erwin returned on Tuesday from a meeting in Cairo with Nigeria
and Egypt to plan discussions with other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said it was important that all steps be taken to ensure
that a new round of WTO negotiations began as soon as possible,
and that the role of developing countries be expanded.

HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Resident Representative of the
United Nations Development Program in Zimbabwe Carlos Lopes on
Wednesday appealed international community to provide 3.3 million
U.S. dollars worth of emergency assistance to Zimbabwean victims
of Cyclone Eline.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that four U.N. specialists who carried out
assessment of the affected areas had noted that at least 96,000
people were affected, of which 20,000 left homeless.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the needs we identified were health related although
there are no life threatening situations. we expect to get
malaria and cholera outbreaks because floods are associated with
the breeding of insects which transmit these diseases. It is a
matter of time before they break out," he said.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came five days after the Zimbabwean government asked
for 20 million U.S. dollars to provide emergency assistance to the
 affected areas.
</P>
<P>
He said victims in the country urgently need food, shelters,
medicine and vaccination for disease control.

the equal rights of men and women. We must live up to both
challenges," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"In some societies racked by conflict, women have acted as
intermediaries between warring parties, exploring ways to find
common ground. They have gone into refugee camps to support
displaced women and children. They have braved the contempt, and
conquered the distrust, of male combatants, until finally their
demand for peace has won through," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"We in the United Nations know at first hand the invaluable
support women provide to our peacekeepers. We are making special
efforts to recruit more women for our own peacekeeping and
peacemaking operations, and to make all our missions more aware of
gender issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General call on the Member States to include
qualified women in the contingents they send and to nominate
qualifies women candidates for United Nations posts at all levels.
</P>
<P>
There can be no enduring peace without development, and there
can be no development unless women play their full part, he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> No Security Guarantee If Israel Withdraws Unilaterally: Lahoud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beirut, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
warned that his country will not give any pledge of security to
Israel after its withdrawal from south Lebanon unless the Jewish
state returns in full the Golan Heights to Syria and solve the
Palestinian refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
"How can we guarantee these borders when there are in the
Palestinian camps tens of thousands of armed refugees asking for
the
right to return," Lahoud said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is not ready to guarantee the comfort of Israel by
performing the role that Israel itself has failed to perform
since invading Lebanon in 1982," Lahoud said.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's warning was the highest-level comment ever from
Syria or Lebanon on Israeli cabinet's decision on Sunday to
withdraw from Lebanon even without a deal with the two Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made amid surging fire tradings between Israeli
occupation troops and Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas in south
Lebanon, which have left seven Israeli soldiers dead since the
outset of this year.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts escalated hot on the heels of the breakdown of the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks over Israel's rejection to a Syrian
demand to commit itself to return the whole Golan, it captured from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud also raised Lebanon's long-standing demand for
clarifying the future of the 367,000 registered Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Beirut objects to any efforts to settle them inside Lebanon, for
fear that their permanent residence will break the country's
delicate sectarian balance, a main cause for the 1975-1990 civil
war.
</P>
<P>
"Solving this problem is primarily the responsibility of
Israel," Lahoud said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has opposed the return of the Palestinian refugees, who
fled the their homes after the establishment of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said Israel's
pullout decision will not alienate the close relationship between
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Lebanese people for the solidarity to protect
the border with Israel, the local NBN Television quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed
Hassan Nasrallah announced the guerrillas will not cease their
fighting until the last Israeli solider leaves Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah and other guerrillas are waging a war of attrition
against Israel since it carved out a border zone in south Lebanon
in 1985. South Lebanon is the last active Arab-Israeli battlefront.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Peace Talks to Resume in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the
Palestinians will resume their stalled peace talks in Washington
later this month, U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross
announced Wednesday after a summit between Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"The parties made good progress in addressing and resolving many
of the interim issues and agreed to intensify their negotiations,"
Ross said in a brief statement after the two-hour summit between
Barak and Arafat, their second in less than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"Toward this end, they agreed that the negotiations will resume
after the Eid in Washington," Ross said, referring to the Muslim
holiday of Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, which lasts four
days starting from March 16.
</P>
<P>
"The objective (of the resumption of the talks) is to achieve a
framework agreement as soon as possible so that all the permanent
issues will be resolved by September 13," which is the target date
for the two sides to reach a peace agreement, he added.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat held the talks at a hotel in this West Bank
city less than one day after a late-night meeting between the two
leaders in central Israel. Both sides said substantial progress was
made at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ross' statement marked a breakthrough in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, which was stalemated in early February after Barak and
Arafat failed at a summit to resolve their difference on both
interim and permanent issues.
</P>
<P>
Ross said the Wednesday summit "represents an important step in
reaffirming the Israeli and Palestinian commitment to work in a
spirit of partnership and mutual confidence to end the conflict
between them."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Workers Stage Rally Against Parliament Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Iranian workers from
various parts of the country Wednesday morning held a rally in
front of the Majlis (parliament) to protest a newly-approved bill
on labor.
</P>
<P>
The workers carried placards against the bill passed on February
7, which deprives workshops with less than five employees of being
covered by the labor law for a period of six years.
</P>
<P>
The protesters said the bill is intended to rob them of their
job security and therefore is against the labor law and the
country's Islamic system, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at end of the rally, the workers termed
the bill as one of the worst in the history of parliaments in the
country and contradictory to international labor regulations.
</P>
<P>
The protestors also called on the Guardians Council, which has
the power to turn down bills passed by the Majlis, to reject the
new bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill is believed to be part of a drive by the current
conservatives-controlled Majlis to encourage investment and end a
chronic unemployment problem. But, it will make it easy for small
firms to fire workers and pay them as little money as possible,
protesters said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Law, introduced after the 1979 Islamic revolution,
makes it almost impossible to fire workers and imposes employee
benefits.
</P>
<P>
The new bill has also met with opposition from organizations
representing labor interests and criticism from the reformist
factions and groups, which won a landslide victory in the
parliamentary elections last month.

<P>
In response to media queries, the spokesman said that Singapore
and Japan conducted their inaugural meeting from March 7 to 8,
2000, to explore a possible bilateral FTA between them and the
meeting saw positive progress in identifying the scope of such an
FTA.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman refrained from giving more details about the
meeting, except that both sides would strive to complete the study
and to submit by November 2000 a joint report to their respective
prime ministers with a recommendation on whether the two countries
should proceed with formal negotiations for an FTA.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that it is hoped that the prime ministers
of the two countries could announce the "successful completion" of
the study and its recommendation when they meet at the sides of
the ASEAN + 3 summit in Singapore in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also announced that the next meeting of the joint
study will be held in Japan in late April 2000.
</P>
<P>
The idea was reportedly brought forth in December last year
when Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong visited Japan and held

<HEADLINE> Bank of Greece Reduces Key Intervention Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Greece, the country's
central bank, made a rate reduction for the fourth time in the
past five months by slashing its main intervention rates by up to
0.75 percent of a point.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a statement that this decision took into
account the developments on inflation and the containment of
credit expansion in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The intervention rate for two-week funds was reduced from 9.75
percent to 9.25 percent, the primary overnight lending rate from 9.
59 percent to 8.75 percent, and the secondary overnight rate from
8.5 percent to 8.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also slashed the Lombard rate by 0.75 percent to 10.25
percent from 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
On January 26, the Bank of Greece reduced its main
intervention rates by up to 1.0 percentage point, after a cut of
up to 0.75 percent in December 1999 and a 0.5 percent across the
board cut in October 1999.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Look Set to Win Presidential Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gore won in all 15 states including New York, California,
Georgia, Vermont, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland,
Maine, Rhode Island, North Dakota, Idaho and Missouri, according
to television networks.
</P>
<P>
Bush, the eldest son of former President George Bush, won eight
states. The projections show that Bush won the two biggest prizes,
New York and California, after Ohio, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri,
Maine and Minnesota fell into his hands.
</P>
<P>
Bill Bradley, Gore's rival, has not won in any state so far
even in the state of Missouri, where he was born and raised.
</P>
<P>
Arizona Sen. John McCain, Bush's rival for the Republican party
presidential nomination, has won in Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut and Vermont
</P>
<P>
Gore, appearing before supporters in his home town, Nashville,
Tenn., said, "Tonight I salute Bill Bradley."
</P>
<P>
"I think that anybody who has heard Bill Bradley throughout
this campaign has come away from the experience moved and touched
by the strength of his commitment to healing the divisions in our
country, especially divisions based on race. I have learned from
his passion," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the Republicans on banning so-called soft
money and attacked the policy of the previous Republican
administration.
</P>
<P>
"We need to build on our record of prosperity. We don't need
to go back to where we were eight years ago. They tried their
approach before -- it produced a triple-dip recession and
quadrupled the national debt. If you don't want to go back to that,
then join us now," Gore noted.
</P>
<P>
"I will challenge the Republican nominee to join with me right
now in banning so-called soft money and then going even further to
eliminate all of the 30-second and 60-second radio and TV ads, and
instead debate twice a week every week as soon as the nominees of
the parties are known, every week until the election, a separate
issue each time," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech in Austin, Texas, Bush said on Tuesday night that
"we have a national victory."
</P>
<P>
Congratulating Gore for his victory, Bush also attacked the
Democrats for "not controlling legal authority" in the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate him and look forward to the contest. He is the
candidate of the status quo in Washington, D.C., and he's a tough
case, he's got a tough case to make in the general election," Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "I will remind Al Gore that Americans do not
want a White House where there is no controlling legal authority."
</P>
<P>
"I will repair broken bonds of trust between Americans and
their government. America must not give Clinton-Gore four more
years," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, McCain expressed his thanks for the "great
support" from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that this trend of support will continue on
the West Coast and I look forward to all the results as they
continue to come in," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Bradley were competing for 1,315 delegates to the
Democratic Convention in Los Angeles in August, more than half of
the 2,170 needed for the presidential nomination. Gore began the
day with 482 delegates to 57 for his rival.
</P>
<P>
For Bush and McCain, at stake Tuesday were 613 delegates, more
than half the total 1,034 delegates needed to obtain the
Republican presidential nomination at the convention in the coming
summer.

<HEADLINE> Ali's Daughter Knocks Out Arcand at Casino Windsor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Laila Ali, the daughter of the
former heavyweight boxing champin Muhammad Ali, knocked out Canada
's woman boxer Crystal Arcand Tuesday night at Casino Windsor,
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The fast-punching and agressive Ali beat Arcand of St. Paul,
Alberta, at 1:10 of the first round in her scheduled four-round
middle-weight match.
</P>
<P>
"She knows what she's doing, all right," said her referee Fern
Chretien, a former world top 10 light-weight contender from
Toronto. "You can see some of her dad's moves."
</P>
<P>
Arcand didn't get a chance to see many of the moves as the 22-
year-old Ali bore in with a two-handed attack that included a
snapping left jab and jolting right uppercut.
</P>
<P>
Arcand was down a half-minute into the round, arose, but could
not weather the storm and Chretien counted her out.
</P>
<P>
It was Ali's fourth pro bout since she fought her first last
October.
</P>
<P>
"It ended pretty fast. I get in there all hyped up. Mainly, it'
s the power. Opponents aren't used to it," said Muhammad Ali's
little girl.
</P>
<P>
Arcand, who had a 5-0 record in amateur matches before Tuesday
night, admitted having "underestimated her". "I can't take
anything away from her; she's got lots of power." said the 27-year-
old mother of three.
</P>
<P>
Ali, who plans to fight again on March 25 against an
undesignated opponent, has to spar with men because the women in
her gym are too small for her five-foot-10, 168 pounds.

<HEADLINE> "I Witness Growing Status of Tibetan Women" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- "I have witnessed daily
improvement of the quality of Tibetan women and their growing
status," Yexe Yangzom, a paediatrician at the No.1 People's
Hospital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said today, the
International Women's Day, who is here attending the 3rd Session
of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji urged in his government work report to
seriously implement the women and children development program. "I
know how important this is for the development and progress of
ethnic minority women, because I myself is one of them," said
Yangzom.
</P>
<P>
She graduated from a Beijing-based medical college in the 1970s
and was among the first Tibetan University students after New
China was founded in 1949. And now, her 25-year-old daughter,
having studied for 11 years in inland areas, works at Tibet TV
station.
</P>
<P>
Her daughter is only one of the many lucky Tibetan girls who
have had such opportunities to study elsewhere, Yangzom said,
adding that the central government sets aside special funds every
year to set up Tibetan middle schools in inland areas. And
approximately 20,000 students have graduated from these schools.
</P>
<P>
Yangzom often goes to inland areas for academic exchanges, and
has twice been to the United States as a visiting scholar. "I
would not have dreamed of this in the old days, as my ancestors
were serfs." And Half the nurses and doctors in her hospital have
been to inland areas for on-job training programs, she said.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is no longer plagued by epidemic diseases, with
vaccination covering more than 85 of the villages, and in some
areas as high as 90 percent, she said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Soldier, Civilian Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's mortars fired Wednesday
from the occupied zone hit a checkpoint just outside the western
sector of the zone in south Lebanon, wounding a Lebanese soldier
and a civilian, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Five cars also caught fire in the raid, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli helicopters blitzed Majdel Zoun, a village
facing the western sector. There were no immediate reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The raids came in retaliation for an earlier Hezbollah attack on
a outpost of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army in the central
sector of the zone, which Israel carved out in 1985 with a claimed
aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The fire exchange between Israeli occupation troops and Syrian-
and Iranian-backed Hezbollah has taken place almost on a daily
basis and seven Israeli soldiers and several SLA militiamen have
been killed since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The increasing casualties in Israeli camp has catalyzed the
Israeli government to decide to withdraw its troops from Lebanon by
July this year, with or without agreements with Lebanon and its
powerbroker Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria, whose talks with Israel broke down again in January only
after two rounds of talks since resumed in last December, opposed
Israeli unilateral pullout, insisting the Lebanese and Syrian
issues be solved together.
</P>
<P>
The return of Golan Heights, Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Mideast War, is at the heart of the Syrian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon leaders Wednesday also made it clear that Lebanon will
not give any pledge of security to Israel if it pulls out without a
broader agreement with the two Arab states first.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Philippines Favor Closer Cooperation Among Asian States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran and the Philippines on
Wednesday underlined the need for strengthening all-out cooperation
among Asian countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of their first round of talks, Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and visiting Philippine Secretary
of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon stressed the importance and
status of Asia in the world's political and economic arenas.
</P>
<P>
The two sides called for proper mechanisms for bilateral and
regional cooperation, and for expansion of cooperation among
regional economic organizations as a means to bolster the role of
Asia in the trend of globalization, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that looking eastward and upgrading level of
collective cooperation with Asian countries is among priorities of
Iran's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, relations with the Philippines as a member
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are of great
importance.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction over the process of peace between the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front which
was realized with the mediation of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the potentials of cooperation between the two
countries, Kharrazi underscored the importance of providing
necessary facilities for increasing the volume of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Siazon also expressed satisfaction over the trend of Tehran-
Manila relations, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's pivotal stance in the region, its rich resources and
strategic situation in having access to central Asia are all among
important features that highlight Iran's importance for the
Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lauding the initiative of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami in
proposing dialog among civilizations, Siazon said the Philippines
supports the initiative and is ready for any bilateral or
multilateral effort in this connection.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers explored avenues for further expansion
of cooperation in anti-drug fightings, for visa facilities and for
facilitating services to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi and Siazon also termed formation of committees for
political consultations between the two countries and reviewing
trend of relations as a positive step.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the second round of talks between the two foreign
ministers on Thursday, a letter of understanding will be signed for
Tehran-Manila cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine foreign minister heading a high-ranking
delegation comprising political and economic officials arrived here
Tuesday for a three-day official visit.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police to be Under Control President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"And within 5 to 10 years ahead, if the national defense system
has been steady, it is expected that the ministry of defense will
supervise the Indonesian Military (TNI) Chief and Commander of the
combined staff," the minister told the House of Representatives (
DPR) Commission I on security, defense and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"From now on until 2005, we will see a parallelism of positions
between the minister of defense and TNI commander," the minister
said,adding the change is a part of reformation policy in the
national defense system which has been launched by the ministry of
defense in its bid to adjust to the country's new developments and
challenges in the future.
</P>
<P>
Sudarsono also said that starting from 2005 the TNI will not be
involved in politics. "Only minister of defense will talk about
politics," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Polri was separated from the armed forces and
put under the control of the ministry of defense, and the Polri's
chief was picked up by the president based on proposals of the
minister of defense.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister hoped that the Polri will be more
professional and able to handle security disturbances at home. "We
want that internal security affairs will gradually be borne by the
police and the judicature," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So far the TNI has been involved in supporting the police in
handling security disturbances at home, but it is expected these
things will only be borne by the police, so that the TNI can focus
its attention on external (security) affairs," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the strength of police now is still far from
enough.
</P>
<P>
"We only have 200,000 personnel of police right now. It is not
enough, so we need to add the number of police," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week president Abdurrahman Wahid said that he wanted the
strength of police to be expended to 600,000.

Women's Day, I appeal to all political parties to extend support
to the legislation which the government has introduced in

"I firmly believe that if we can reserve one third of seats
for women in parliament and state legislatures, not only
democratic system will be further strengthened," he added.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of women upliftment and their
economic development, he said it was not only essential to provide
them job but also to ensure "equal work, equal pay" for them in
private sector.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining that education of the girl child is the basic
foundation of national reconstruction, he lamented that even after
five decades of our independence, "we are still behind in the work
of women literacy".
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the need for bringing women in the forefront for
the country's economic development, he said that the government
would soon set up a "task force" to review all provisions relating
to women participation in national economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) confirmed Wednesday in the southern
Philippines their tactical alliance with the rebel New People's
Army (NPA).
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine News Agency, Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF
vice chairman for political affairs told reporters in Cotabato
city that"neither religion nor political ideology would stifle
their tactical coalition with other revolutionary groups."
</P>
<P>
As this developed, military sources said that military
intelligence units are checking reports that Afghanistan nationals
were training MILF rebels in special operations.
</P>
<P>
As early as February 22, the intelligence community received
reports that some MILF rebels trained on special warfare, have
planned to launch terroristic activities in Lanao del Sur province
in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed on February 25 when two bombs exploded
inside an Ozamis bound ferry boat killing at least 38 people and
seriously wounding 37 others.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for an independent state in Mindanao
during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado admitted
that the number of NPA rebels has grown from almost a spent force
of 5,000 in 1995 to about 10,000 to date.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said last month that he is
giving the MILF and PNA up to June this year to come up with peace
agreement with the government.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government said here
on Wednesday that it was not perturbed over U.S. President Bill
Clinton's decision to make a stopover in Islamabad after his five-
day visit to India later this month.
</P>
<P>
"We are not perturbed about it," Minister of State for External
Affairs Ajit Kumar Panja told reporters at the parliament house in
an obvious attempt to downplay Clinton's decision. "It is not a
full-fledged official visit, it is just a brief stopover."
</P>
<P>
Clinton would be accorded a warm welcome when he comes to India,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President conveyed his decision to visit Pakistan
during a telephone conversation with Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a foreign office spokesman on Wednesday once again
ruled out the possibility of India's acceptance of any third party
mediation on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Under the Simla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration, India and
Pakistan were committed to resolve the Kashmir issue bilaterally,
the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Clinton's visit was aimed at paving the
way for a qualitatively new and closer relationship between the
United States and India.
</P>
<P>
"It is also a direction-setting visit for long-term relations,"
he noted.

<P>
The volcano's seismic network recorded low frequency volcanic
quakes and short duration harmonic tremors as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sulfur dioxide emission rate measured 3,900 tons per day,
although low compared to recent measurements, is still way above
the volcano's baseline level, said the Phivolcs.
</P>
<P>
The institute said ground deformation surveys showed that the
edifice is slightly inflated. At night, when the volcano's summit
area was visible, intense crater glow continue to be observed.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs reminded local officials that residents within 6-
kilometer permanent danger zones (PDZ) and the 8 kilometer
extended PDZ at the southeast of Mayon must stay in their
respective evacuation camps.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, more than 1,000 families have returned home
while about 60,000 people stayed in different evacuation centers.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Welcomes U.S. Decision on Clinton Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government on
Wednesday expressed its happiness over the White House decision to
include Pakistan in President Clinton's South Asia tour later this
month.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the announcement of President Clinton's visit to
Pakistan," Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said at a press
briefing here.
</P>
<P>
After quite a few weeks' delay, the U.S. government finally on
Tuesday declared the visit of Clinton to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Pakistan's arch-rival India has been announced
earlier and since then the Indian government has been trying to
disabuse Clinton's possible visit to Pakistan. The U.S.president's
tour to the region from March 20-25 will include Bangladesh, too.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said Clinton's visit will provide the two sides "an
opportunity to discuss bilateral, regional and global issues"and
these discussions will have "a positive effect on the security
environment" of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the U.S. president will utilize this
visit to engage in efforts to resolve the Kashmir dispute which is
the root-cause of tensions in South Asia," Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Pakistan believes that the United States has "
an ideal opportunity for making a meaningful contribution to the
promotion of durable peace and security in the region."
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, the spokesman said he "has a good
feeling" that Clinton will urge India to resume dialogue with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the resumption of dialogue is a necessity to resolve
the outstanding issues between Pakistan and India," he said,
adding that Pakistan welcomes "all kinds of dialogues."
</P>
<P>
Altaf dismissed the speculation that there was some assurance
made by Pakistan behind the White House decision.
</P>
<P>
"No. Neither Washington has sought nor we have given any
assurance," he said categorically.
</P>
<P>
The visit to both India and Pakistan by Clinton had been
planned last year. But the military coup in Islamabad in October
last year has hindered the American government from taking an easy
decision on the Pakistan visit.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said the traditional Pakistan-U.S. friendship was the
basis on which White House has made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan-U.S. relationship, based on friendship and mutual
cooperation, over the past half century has significantly
contributed to positive developments internationally and to peace
and stability in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We share important common interests which underscore the need
for strengthening of cooperation between the two countries," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad was one of Washington's allies during the cold war
and the two countries cooperated closely in the Afghan struggle
against the Soviet invasion in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Currently the United States is still seeking cooperation from
Pakistan on issues such as nuclear non-proliferation,curbing drug
trafficking and combating terrorism in the region.

BELGRADE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic Albanians and Serbs
clashed Tuesday in Kosovska Mitrovica, a city in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, wounding 16 French peacekeepers and 24

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Condemns Violence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The multinational peace-keeping
force in Kosovo will not tolerate deliberate provocation of
violence by extremists, NATO Secretary General George Robertson
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Robertson condemned Tuesday's outbreak of violence in Kosovo's
northern city of Kosovska Mitrovica that injured more than 40
people, including 16 French soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"Deliberate provocation by extremists and troublemakers will
not be tolerated by KFOR. We will not stand idly by and allow
them to achieve their goals of division, separatism and ethnic
hatred.
</P>
<P>
"KFOR reacted swiftly and firmly to these latest attacks and
will press forward with the goal of establishing a democratic,
multi-ethnic and secure Kosovo," the NATO chief said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson also said it should be clear to all that commanders
of the Kosovo peacekeeping force will respond vigorously to any
attacks on troops. "No one should doubt our resolve," he said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said the situation in Kosovska Mitrovica was quiet
this morning. "KFOR will endeavor to ensure that it remains so,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson appealed to all the inhabitants of the city to reject
the violence and hate-mongering of extremists and to cooperate
fully with international institutions.
</P>
<P>
"That is the only way to give the people of Kosovo a chance to
build a stable, democratic and prosperous future," he added.

<HEADLINE> HK to Make most of China Advantages: Financial Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will make the most of
its unique China advantages and benefit handsomely from China's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Finance Secretary
Donald Tsang said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his 2000/2001 budget speech, Tsang said China's accession to
the WTO will "bring substantial business opportunities for Hong
Kong enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is China's closest economic partner in terms of both
trade and external investment. In 1999, the mainland's total trade
with Hong Kong exceeded 1,000 billion HK dollars (128 billion U.S.
dollars), representing about 40 percent of Hong Kong's total
external trade.
</P>
<P>
After China's accession to the WTO, the mainland market will
open up further, which will greatly benefit Hong Kong's
distributive trades, financial services, telecommunications, and
tourism sectors as well as many other professional services, Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang believed Hong Kong's function in the future will no
longer be limited to acting as an intermediary between the
mainland and foreign enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Once China opens up the services sector further, Hong Kong will
assume a more important role as the hub for high-value-added
services, providing essential professional and support services to
the mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang suggested that Hong Kong and the mainland should enhance
cooperation in many fields, such as enhance the transport links by
adding new facilities and making more effective use of existing
ones.
</P>
<P>
On land transport, a number of projects have already been
detailed by Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa to improve the
cross-border links between Hong Kong and the mainland, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen Hong Kong's information links with the mainland,
Tsang said the Telecommunication Authority of Hong Kong will issue
three licenses for external cable-based field telecommunication
network services, which will increase connectivity between the two
sides more than ten-fold.

<HEADLINE> Western China Looking for Increased Cooperation with Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Less-developed western China is
looking for increased cooperation and more capital from overseas
in an effort to implement the government-initiated develop-the-
west strategy, and overseas investment into the region will be
paid off as it has abundant water, minerals, natural gas, and
biological resources, let alone large-scale markets and one
quarter of China's consumers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongwei, Sichuan provincial governor' who is here
attending the ongoing 3rd Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress, made the remarks during a panel discussion today.
</P>
<P>
Investment from overseas has played a significant role in
helping the coastal areas develop economy. In western China,
however, 10,000 overseas-funded enterprises had been approved by
the first half of 1999, only half that in Shanghai, the country's
largest metropolis in east China.
</P>
<P>
However, some multinational corporations have developed an
interest in western China, and more than 50 of the world's top 500
transitional corporations have economic ties with Sichuan, Zhang
said, adding that Motorola and some 30 other firms have made
investments in the province, and some of them have opened offices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a growing number of foreign businesspeople have come
on business trips to Chongqing Municipality after the central
government made public its program to vigorously develop the
western areas early this year, and some multinationals have set up
institutions to do studies on the strategy, according to He
Guoqiang, a NPC deputy and the city's Party secretary.
</P>
<P>
This year, Britain has opened a consulate in Chongqing, which
draws the most of the overseas investment in west China and is
preparing itself to invite foreign banks to open branches.
</P>
<P>
At present, Sichuan Province is ready to offer 250 projects for
public bidding, which involve hi-tech, environmental protection,
agriculture, infrastructure, state-owned enterprise retooling,
upgrading and re-organization. It has also set up a local
merchants' bureau, a foreign investment service center, centers
for handling complaints from businesspeople from overseas and
Taiwan investors, a school and a hospital for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
During the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression over a
half century ago, the country's western region was the rear area,
and there are still many Taiwan compatriots living in Sichuan and
Chongqing, according to a number of leading officials from western
provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
"We want very much to expand our economic and technological
cooperation with Taiwan," said Zhou Yongkang, Sichuan's Party
secretary.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Advisors Urge Deepening Reform in Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- At a press conference today,
China's top advisors urged deepening reform in the higher
education sector to turn out more talented graduates and
technological results.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaowen, a former president of Qinghua University, said
that although a multi-tier higher education system is taking shape
in the nation, and private colleges have been set up to supplement
the traditional government-run universities, a set of regulations
should be formulated to lend more active support for private
colleges and ensure their healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,200 private colleges have been set up in the
nation so far, with 37 of them authorized to issue related
diplomas.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Shituan, president of Beijing University of Aeronautics
and Astronautics, said that expanding college enrollment calls for
reform in the management system of institutions of higher
education, and increased government financing.
</P>
<P>
Zuo Tieyong, President of Beijing Polytechnical University,
talked about quality education at the press conference, calling
for strengthening moral and ethical education, encouraging a
spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship, and improving students'
practical abilities.
</P>
<P>
A reform characterized by measures such as decentralizing and
merging is under way in China's higher educational system, and
nearly 200 institutions of higher education were handed over to
local governments last year alone. Beijing University is also
planning a merger with Beijing Medical Sciences University, which
is acknowledged by the university president as a way to build a
really first-rate international university.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing Calls for Special Policies for China's West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Greater priority should be given
to science, technology and education in implementing the strategy
of developing China's west in a big way, and special policies
should be adopted to boost the education sector there, said Vice-
Premier Li Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
Li voiced his view when he joined in group discussions attended
respectively by Qinghai and Chongqing deputies to the National
People's Congress (NPC), in session here since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, which has been made by the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council, has won
nationwide support, said Li, who is also a member of the Standing
Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Special policies should be adopted to foster, retain and
attract talented people from the rest of China and abroad, and
their abilities should be brought into full play, the vice premier
said. Greater efforts should be made to popularize nine-year
compulsory schooling and wipe out illiteracy among young and
middle-aged people in the western areas, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that eastern areas launch a nationwide campaign to
provide educational aid to their western counterparts on a one-to-
one basis. Schools in eastern provinces and cities should pick
their partner schools in the west and help them with teachers,
equipment, textbooks, stationery and garments.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator said he is
convinced that Macao compatriots can administer Macao well and can
also maintain its long-term prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National

Basic Law of the MSAR, in an effort to promote the reunification
of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said Macao compatriots have elected their
representatives to the NPC. The election was successful as it was

that Chinese citizens among Macao residents have the right to
participate in running state affairs under the "one country, two
systems" principle, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The work of the MSAR has been going on smoothly since Macao's
return, with the Basic Law fully implemented. And the MSAR
government headed by Edmund Ho Hau Wah is working actively and in
a good order, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR will not adopt the people's congress system in
accordance with the "one country, two systems' principle and the
Basic Law, and Macao NPC deputies will exercise their right to
perform their duties as defined by the Constitution and related
laws. "But you should not interfere in affairs that fall within
the scope of Macao's high-degree autonomy," Li told Macao's NPC
deputies.

<HEADLINE> Media Should Play Bigger Watchdog Role: CPPCC Nat'l Committee Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) have urged the media to play a bigger
supervisory role and said relevant laws and regulations should be
formulated to protect the legal rights and interests of
journalists.
</P>
<P>
They made the call at the ongoing annual session of the CPPCC
National Committee, pointing out that media's supervision is an
important part of socialist democracy and the rule of law. Chinese
reporters have often faced difficulties, obstructions and threats
from institutions and individuals when they try to interview
related people and do investigative reporting, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Nobody should have the right to refuse media access to sources
of information if reporters act legally, and in the meanwhile,
media people should also improve their own quality, they said.

<HEADLINE> Barak-Arafat Summit a Beginning to Remove Obstacles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official on
Wednesday termed an earlier summit meeting between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as a
beginning to remove the obstacles in their stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice of Palestine radio, Arafat's
adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said an announcement on the renewal of
talks could come later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that it is premature to talk about the end of
the current crisis with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour meeting, held at an unidentified location in Israel
late Tuesday night, was also attended by Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed
Qureia and U.S. President Bill Clinton's Mideast envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in Israel earlier in the day in his second visit to
the region since talks collapsed last month over differences on an
interim withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The summit was constructive and an agreement was reached on
some issues that were discussed," said a statement issued by
Barak's office without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to exert intensive efforts during the next
few days to resolve some of the remaining issues and break the
current deadlock in the peace talks, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, during their meeting, discussed a U.S. plan
which was believed to pave the way for the resumption of the final
status talks.
</P>
<P>
The adviser added that the plan includes a May deadline for a
framework agreement, an additional Israeli troop pullback in June
and a new timetable for achieving a permanent peace by September.
</P>
<P>
Political sources in Jerusalem said earlier Tuesday that Barak
will take some moves to push forward the peace process, including
the release of more Palestinian prisoners, opening of the northern
safe passage and implementing the financial dues under the Sharm el
Sheikh memorandum signed last September.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian chief negotiator in the final-status talks
Yasser Abed Rabbo dismissed these ideas as old.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Resist U.S. Pressure at OPEC Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will resist the pressure by
the U.S. on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to increase production at the upcoming Vienna ministerial
conference of the OPEC, a senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sought to fluctuate oil prices in order to reap profits
through speculation in the international oil market, said Iraq's
Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western oil-consuming countries have urged OPEC
members to increase production in the third quarter of this year in
order to lower the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday warned OPEC that its
members could face sliding demand and eventually less revenue if
oil prices remained at the current high level.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. crude futures closed sharply higher in fever-pitch
trading on Tuesday, leaping 1.95 U.S. dollars per barrel to close
at 34.13 dollars a barrel. The price was the highest since
November, 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq deemed the oil prices as "proper" and "acceptable"
compared with those in the past 10 years except 1998, taking into
consideration of the 25-30 percent inflation rate from 1990 to now,
Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that due to the pressure by the U.S., oil prices in
the international oil market fluctuated sharply from the end of
1997 to the middle of 1999, when the oil output was increased in an
unjustifiable way and the oil prices once collapsed to as low as
nine dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Rashid will attend the OPEC ministerial conference, which is to
decide whether to increase oil production to offset a shortage that
now stands at more two million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Second only to Saudi Arabia in oil reserves, Iraq produced 3
million barrels of oil per day before it was imposed economic
sanctions by the U.N.. Now it produces 1.9 million barrels of oil a
day.
</P>
<P>
Following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq has been under
severe U.N. sanctions and is allowed to export limited amount of
oil and use part of the revenue to buy humanitarian supplies for
its people.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Cathay Pacific, the top airlines
of Hong Kong, shrugged off its loss in 1998 to snatch a profit of
2.2 billion HK dollars (281 million U.S. dollars) in 1999,
according to its results of the year released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company posted a loss of 542 million HK dollars (69 million
U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The results for 1999 reflect a strong second half due to both
seasonal factors and a return to growth in the Asian economies,"
said James Hughes-Hallett, chairman of Cathay Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Load factors improved across most routes and the United States
market was particular strong, while a number of Asian markets
rebounded from previous declines, he said.
</P>
<P>
The cargo business, which generates 29 percent of overall
revenues of the company, achieved record high for both tonnage and
revenue.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also attributed the recovery to continued cost
controls.
</P>
<P>
Towards the end of the year, Cathay Pacific plans to buy three
new A330s from Airbus Industries and lease three A340s from Air
China. It has signed an agreement to purchase two new Boeing 747-
400 freighter aircraft to increase the cargo capacity over the
next two years.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Ready for 2nd Step into Information Age: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is ready for the
second step into the information age, which Prime Minister
Mahathir termed as "Strategic Initiative One" of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia launched in 1991 its march into the information age
with Vision 2020 in which it sets the goal of becoming a full
developed nation by 2020, the first strategic step, Mahathir said
when officiating the second Global Knowledge conference here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are now ready for a concerted, comprehensive and committed
quantum leap which will re-make Malaysian corporations and re-
invent Malaysian society," he said, adding "This second step will
be called 'Strategic Initiative One' of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his government explicitly stressed in the 2000
Budget that it was necessary to ensure a paradigm shift from the
production-driven economy (P-economy) to the knowledge-driven
economy (K-economy) and the government has now started the process
of drafting the K-economy Master Plan.
</P>
<P>
He announced that by the end of September this year, Malaysia
will adopt a National Strategic Plan, many of the vital measures
that will need to be taken will be incorporated in the next year
budget to be presented in October this year, and a series of
concrete Plans of Action in Key Strategic Areas will be completed
within one year.
</P>
<P>
The whole process of national consultation, brainstorming,
drafting and national mobilization should be completed within 18
months from this day, he added.
</P>
<P>
The K-economy Master Plan must be a master plan for the entire
nation and a personal master plan for every citizen, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed Malaysia's Strategic Initiative One does
not mean the abandonment of its industrial backbone which now
contributes more than 37 percent of its gross domestic product and
provides 30 percent of all jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Laila Ali, daughter of former
heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, knocked out Crystal Arcand in
the first round Tuesday night at Csino Windsor in Ontario, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Ali, 21, remained unbeaten in her pro boxing career with a 4-0,
all by knockout.
</P>
<P>
"I am to knock people out," Ali said before Tuesday's fight. "I
don't think you've seen half of what I'm going to be."
</P>
<P>
Her latest fight lasted only 70 seconds. Ali came out
aggressively from the opening bell and floored Arcand, making her
pro debut, with a right jab about 15 seconds into the bout.
</P>
<P>
Arcand got up slowly and Ali continued the attack, putting
Arcand on the canvas again with a straight right to the chin.
Arcand got up to one knee but no further as she was counted out.
</P>
<P>
Ali reportedly received $25,000 and Arcand $5,000.
</P>
<P>
Ali knocked out Nicolyn Armstrong in the second round last
December 10 and is to fight March 25 on the undercard of Thomas
Hearns-Crawford Ashley bout.
</P>
<P>
Arcand is a 27-year-old middleweight who fights under the name
Brave Heart. The school counselor, a mother of three, took up
boxing after her 2-year-old son died of a blood clot.
</P>
<P>
Arcand was making her pro debut after compiling a 5-0 record as
an amateur. Last year she advanced to the semifinals of the "
Toughwoman" world championships.

<HEADLINE> HK FS Forecasts Pickup of Revenue in 2000/2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Donald Tsang, financial
secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
said here Wednesday that the SAR's total revenue in the 2000/2001
fiscal year is expected to pick up to 244.2 billion HK dollars (31.
3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, two of the main sources of income, namely, profits tax
and rates, will do so at a rate much slower than the forecast GDP
growth rate of 5 percent, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Under the provisional tax system, profits tax is calculated on
the basis of profits in the previous year, he explained, noting
that even if the economy improves this year, a higher level of
profits tax can be collected only in the following financial year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ability of companies to carry forward previous
years' losses to offset against current year's profits will also
depress profit tax collection in the short term, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsang pointed out the annual rating revaluation reflecting the
continued decline in market rentals will depress the revenue from
rates in the short term.
</P>
<P>
"In order to bring the cumulative growth in government
expenditure fully back in line with cumulative economic growth
over time, we would need to restrain the growth in government
expenditure to a level lower than the trend growth of the economy,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Hong Kong would contain the expenditure
growth to 3 percent for 2000/2001 and 2.5 percent for subsequent
years, against 3.5 percent trend growth of rate of GDP.
</P>
<P>
"This will allow us to restore the balance between the growth
in government spending and the growth in the economy over the next
four years," he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Secretary Delivers 2000/2001 Budget (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- There will be no new taxes, no
tax increases and no reduction in tax allowances in 2000-2001,
said Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Wednesday, when delivering the budget
for the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In a budget speech titled "Scaling New Heights," Tsang outlined
a strategy to ensure that Hong Kong could meet the challenges of
globalization, enhance competitiveness, and satisfy greater demand
for improved public services.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Secretary announced important initiatives in
financial services, trade and investment services and civil
service reform as well as a review of the taxation system.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, he said that Hong Kong's economy staged
a strong turnaround in 1999, registering a GDP growth of 2.9
percent following an impressive growth of 8.7 percent in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
GDP is forecast to grow by 5 percent in 2000. The trend growth
rate of GDP has been raised to 4 percent for 2000-2003, against a
3.5 percent estimate in the last budget.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary revealed a much better than expected
outturn for public finances in 1999/2000, with a budget deficit of
1.6 billion HK dollars (205 million U.S. dollars) compared with an
original estimate of 36.5 billion HK dollars (4.7 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
For 2000/2001, Tsang forecast a deficit of 6.2 billion HK
dollars, with revenue of 244.2 billion HK dollars and expenditure
of 250.4 billion HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This dramatic improvement in our financial position (1999/2000)
comes about almost single-handedly from an unexpected growth in
the earnings on our fiscal reserves invested with the Exchange
Fund," Tsang told members of the Legislative Council during his
reading of the budget speech.
</P>
<P>
"The investment earnings on our fiscal reserves have soared to
44 billion HK dollars, almost double our original estimate of 22.2
billion HK dollars," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tsang unveiled a range of initiatives that would "harness the
forces of globalization" by improving competitiveness in the
financial services sector and providing better services to
business and international investors.
</P>
<P>
These include an open and secure electronic network for
straight-through processing of securities and derivatives trading,
the development of a multi-currency capital market and clearing
system, greater efforts to expand the regional debt market,
ongoing reform of the banking sector and new securities and
futures legislation to strengthen and enhance Hong Kong's
regulatory regime.
</P>
<P>
Stamp duty on stock transactions will be reduced from 0.25
percent to 0.225 percent, but Tsang pointed out that brokerage
commissions would also need to be lowered if there is to be any
real impact in making Hong Kong's stock market more price
competitive.
</P>
<P>
A major revamp of the government's trade, industry and
investment setup was announced to streamline institutional
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Tsang unveiled plans to trim the size of the Civil Service by
10,000 over the next three years, reducing the establishment to
188,000 or the same level as in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants in designated grades will be allowed to take
voluntary, early retirement, with fair compensation, to accelerate
the pace of reform and provide the public with better value for
money.
</P>
<P>
On public finances, Tsang said Hong Kong had to be alert to
potential problems that may erode the government's revenue base.
The greatest uncertainty came from the likely exponential growth
of e-commerce and its impact on Hong Kong's tax regime, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang announced the establishment of a Task Force headed by the
Secretary for the Treasury to monitor the correlation between
recurrent income and economic growth and critically examine the
viability of the existing tax regime.
</P>
<P>
"This should be able to identify whether we are indeed facing a
short-term cyclical problem or a fundamental shift in our revenue
base needing more radical remedies," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of revenue initiatives, the diesel duty concessionary
rate of 2 HK dollars per liter has been extended until December 31,
2000, while the exemption on first registration tax for electric
vehicles will be extended until March 31, 2003.
</P>
<P>
On the expenditure side, the major focus is on improving
education facilities and resources; increasing pre-employment and
vocational training places; increasing community welfare services
and residential places for the elderly; and more support to help
CSSA recipients find work.

<HEADLINE> HK FS pledges to Better Financial Services Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong should further better
its financial services sector to cement its position as the world'
s freest economy, Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, said in his
2000/2001 budget speech Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Tsang stressed the need to enhance the financial
infrastructure, build a leading debt market, reform the bank
sector, enhance the regulatory regime and corporate governance and
attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
As the development in this century of the financial services
sector relies heavily on information technology, Tsang said, the
government will continue to upgrade its financial infrastructure
to take full advantage of the opportunities that information
technology might bring.
</P>
<P>
To make Hong Kong a leading market for global shares in Asia,
Hong Kong will develop a multi-currency capital market, he said.
Under this strategy, Hong Kong will in this year build a U.S.
dollar-denominated capital market first, with a Euro-denominated
market as the next target, he explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsang, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is
developing a reliable and efficient U.S. dollar clearing system
modeled on the present Hong Kong dollar Real Time Gross Settlement
System.
</P>
<P>
The new clearing system will be introduced in phases beginning
in the second half of this year. In parallel, the Hong Kong
Exchange and Clearing Company will have ready a U.S. dollar
clearing system for securities.
</P>
<P>
When both the two clearing systems are in place, Hong Kong will
be able to build a new capital market that offers local and global
investors access to a full spectrum of U.S. dollar-denominated
products, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
As to building Hong Kong into a leading debt market, Tsang said
he has asked interested parties to place focus on three main areas,
namely, to continue to attract outside companies to issue debt
papers in Hong Kong to increase the width and depth of its debt
market; to establish linkage with more central clearing and
depository systems outside Hong Kong; and to continue to
participate actively in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
activities.
</P>
<P>
On the banking sector, Tsang said, the government will continue
its program of reform by further regulating the remaining interest
rate rules covering time deposits and savings and current accounts.
</P>
<P>
A detailed study will be conducted to identify new measures
that will better protect depositors' interest, including the
possible introduction of deposit insurance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include studying the feasibility of establishing
a central credit register in Hong Kong to enable banks to assess
the creditworthiness and overall indebtedness of other customers,
and strengthening bank supervision through the new risk-based
approach.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific Nets Profit in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Cathay Pacific, the top airlines
of Hong Kong, shrugged off its loss in 1998 to snatch a profit of
2.2 billion HK dollars (281 million U.S. dollars) in 1999,
according to its results of the year released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company posted a loss of 542 million HK dollars (69 million
U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The results for 1999 reflect a strong second half due to both
seasonal factors and a return to growth in the Asian economies,"
said James Hughes-Hallett, chairman of Cathay Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Load factors improved across most routes and the United States
market was particular strong, while a number of Asian markets
rebounded from previous declines, he said.
</P>
<P>
The cargo business, which generates 29 percent of overall
revenues of the company, achieved record high for both tonnage and
revenue.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also attributed the recovery to continued cost
controls.
</P>
<P>
Towards the end of the year, Cathay Pacific plans to buy three
new A330s from Airbus Industries and lease three A340s from Air
China. It has signed an agreement to purchase two new Boeing 747-
400 freighter aircraft to increase the cargo capacity over the
next two years.

<HEADLINE> Tibet, Xinjiang to Rid of Poverty by Year-End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poverty would basically be eradicated by the year-end, said
top regional officials.
</P>
<P>
Legqog, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said that
another 50,000 people will be relieved of poverty this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the region lifted 50,000 people out of their plight.
</P>
<P>
Abdul'ahat Abudurixit, chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, said that Xinjiang is planning to basically
solve the food-and-clothing problem for 300,000 people living in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Tong Fu, member of the NPC Standing Committee and vice-chairman
of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the poverty-relief
programs in the two regions represent a major progress in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that in protecting human rights, China, as a developing
country, must first guarantee the rights to live and develop.
</P>
<P>
Legqog said that this year the per-capita income of farmers and
herdsmen in Tibet is expected to reach 1,350 yuan (about 163 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will try to help 2,000 households
move to low elevation areas from highland.
</P>
<P>
The natural conditions in Tibet are harsh. Legqog said Tibet
will invest a record six billion yuan to facelift its
communications, power and telecommunications facilities with the
aim of spurring local economic growth and helping farmers and
herdsmen get rich.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, the central government has earmarked
over 2.6 million yuan for 105 construction projects in Tibet,
which has greatly improved the region's infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Quality Education, A Focus of China's Education Reform: NPC Deputies (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prof. C.N. Yang, a prominent American-Chinese scientist, said
students from China, though outperforming American students in
rudimentary knowledge, found themselves hard to work out new,
creative ideas, and this, to some extent, affects the
competitiveness of China's future.
</P>
<P>
This Nobel Prize winner also raised questions on intensified
competition for college enrollment.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jiagao, president of the Yingyu middle school in Shanghai
and a teacher with 39 years of experience, said it is a shared
wish of the parents to have their children study in first-rate
universities. Since only a few could succeed, most students have
to be turned into "docile machines" merely fit for exams.
</P>
<P>
The intensified competition exerts too much pressure on both
parents and their children, some NPC deputies and CPPCC National
Committee members said, adding that a lack of moral education has
led to the failure to imbue a generation of youngsters with
upright moral conduct and a high sense of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Educational reform, therefore, rose to be an issue of concern
to general public and senior leaders. President Jiang Zemin has
called for the healthy growth of youths, while Premier Zhu Rongji
in his annual work report underlined that quality education be
fully stepped up in schools.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting quality education is to prepare the nation for
fierce international competitions China has to face following its
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), and it will also
comply with the stark reality and pool strength for future reform
and growth, said Zhao Jiagao.
</P>
<P>
A fundamental reform in education is under way throughout the
country, with measures aimed at fostering innovation capabilities
and improving practical competence for students. The concept of "
lifetime education" is also first proposed in the country,
heralding a radical change in its traditional mode of school
education.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Ministry of Education released a
circular on replacing the traditional hundred-grade system with a
more lenient five-grades one. Meanwhile, the educational
authorities also ease the students' workload and ban the use of 39
textbooks in primary schools and high schools.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, less assignments allow the students to have more
after-school time for visiting museums and other outdoor
activities, which acquaint them with society at large and enable
them to appreciate and enjoy the nature.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has about 240 million students, or some one
fifth of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members have noted
quality education is targeted at another significant change in
China's educational sector after the resumption of university
matriculation exams in 1977. The new education, they acknowledged,
is bound to trigger radical reforms in many other aspects of
society and impact the nation's economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Quality Education, A Focus of China's Educational Reform: NPC Deputies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The heated discussions on
education at the ongoing sessions of China's legislature and top
advisory body have focused on quality education, which involves
improving the students' moral conduct and increasing their
innovation capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Given the common practice of prioritizing academic performance
to the neglect of moral education in schools nowadays, quality
education has become a must that concerns the destiny of the whole
nation, according to deputies to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) and members of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, who are here
attending their respective annual sessions.
</P>
<P>
"The shift of focus to quality education shows the country's
educational sector is effecting a new breakthrough by appraising
the traditional practice of dwelling on intellectual education,"
said Zhang Dejiang, a NPC deputy from east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who initiated China's reform
and opening-up drive in the late 1970s, ordered college
matriculation exams be resumed upon his rehabilitation, which gave
rise to a nationwide thirst and respect for knowledge and prompted
students to work harder still to acquire knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kezhi, an NPC deputy and a provincial official in charge
of education in southwest China's Sichuan Province, noted that "
knowledge means strength" has become a top national slogan then as
a result of an acute shortage of qualified intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
A series of radical changes have since taken place:
invigorating the nation through education, science and technology
has become a national policy; and college graduates are becoming a
backbone force of all social sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, defects of the traditional knowledge-based education
have also been revealed in the meantime. A senior teacher from
Beijing, NPC Deputy Wu Changshun, said the rudimentary education
has basically been successful in the country. But he added that it
still has drawbacks: the students are overburdened with home
assignments, crammed with too many intellectual facts and blindly
working for high grades in exams under an ossified teaching method.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Optimistic About Unemployment in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers, who are
gathered here for the annual session of the National People's
Congress (NPC), the country's top legislature, have shown optimism
about unemployment in the country, though the number of layoffs
from the public sector is expected to go up in the second half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to an official estimate by the Ministry of Labor and
Social Security, 11.74 million people will join the army of the
jobless in China this year, which is equivalent to the population
of Shanghai, the largest metropolis in China.
</P>
<P>
However, "the problem is not so fearful as it was in the past,"
said Wen Shizhen, a deputy from northeastern Liaoning Province,
attributing it to the step-by-step establishment and improvement
of a social security system and re-employment mechanisms in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, 910,000 local factory laid-off workers
have found new jobs, according to Wen, the Party chief of Liaoning,
which is one of the largest industrial bases in China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a booming private economy also has been a major way-
out for easing the unemployment headache. Liu Guansong, an
entrepreneur from southern Guangdong Province, said his private
factory has hired over 200 workers laid off from state enterprises.
Official statistics show that more than 4,000 workers laid off
from state enterprises now find work in private businesses every
day.

<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai has been quite successful in tackling the issue. "
State factory workers in Shanghai are not as afraid of losing
their jobs as they used to because the city has set up a fairly
well-functioning insurance system covering unemployment, medical
care and retirement," said Zhu Junyi, director of the municipal
bureau of labor and social security.
</P>
<P>
Over 400 government-funded agencies have been set up in this
largest industrial city of the country, to help the jobless find a
new job or provide them with professional training.
</P>
<P>
Along with the deepening of reform, some sectors long regarded
as hopeless profit-wise have been turned into sources of money,
absorbing a large number of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Some big cities have built three "lines of defence:" a minimum
amount of money for the laid-off worker to buy daily necessities,
unemployment insurance and a minimum amount of money for urban
families to buy daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zuyao, an economist from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said unemployment in China does not mean the Chinese
economy has a crisis. Normally, unemployment picks up only when
there is a depression or low economic growth, but this is not the
case in China where economic growth has remained the highest in
the world, the economist said.
</P>
<P>
To his mind, unempoyment in the country is the result of
ongoing reforms. The government has intentionally freed state
enterprises and government departments of extra workers to improve
work efficiency and boost economic development, Yu noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has been on guard against
unemployment going out of control as it is detrimental to reform
and social stability. In 1999, the government took measures to
increase the income of medium and low-income families in cities,
which benefited more than 84 million urbanites.
</P>
<P>
The government has made it a point that the registered
unemployment rate would be kept at around 3.5 percent this year.
Last year, it was 3.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> 21 Arabic Countries to Attend Meeting in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one Arabic countries will
attend the coming Arabic Foreign Ministers Conference in Beirut on
Saturday and Sunday, it was reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will submit a three-point document to the conference:
condemning Israel's aggression, urging financial support and
calling for Arabic solidarity, reported the local Central News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Megid, who will attend
the meeting, was quoted by local press as saying that the
Organization of African Unity and Iran will also send delegates as
observer "as a show of their support".
</P>
<P>
The League decided to transfer the 113th Arabic Foreign
Ministers Conference, originally set for Cairo, to Beirut to show
Arabic solidarity with, and the organization's support to, Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's planned presence at the meeting enraged the
United Arab Emirates, which threatened a boycott because it has
territorial disputes with Iran over three islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
On February 8 Israeli warplanes pulverized three power stations
on February 8 in retaliation for Hezbollah guerrillas' attacks that
have killed seven Israeli soldiers so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It
set up a self-styled "security zone" there in 1985, with a declared
aim of protecting its north from cross-border guerrilla attack.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Warns Against Unilateral Israel Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
warned
Wednesday that his country could not guarantee security for
northern
Israel until Israel addresses demands to return Syria's Golan
Heights and solve the Palestinian refugee problem
</P>
<P>
"How can we guarantee these borders when there are in the
Palestinian camps tens of thousands of armed refugees asking for
the
right to return," Lahoud said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is not ready to guarantee the comfort of Israel by
performing the role that Israel itself has failed to perform
since invading Lebanon in 1982," Lahoud said.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's warning was the highest-level comment yet from
Syria or Lebanon on Israeli cabinet's decision last week to
withdraw from Lebanon even without establishing peace.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese information minister earlier in the week linked
security guarantees to Israel returning Syria's Golan Heights,
captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
But Lahoud added Lebanon's long-standing demand for
clarifying the future of the 367,000 registered Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon. Beirut objects to any efforts to
settle them inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Solving this problem is primarily the responsibility of
Israel," Lahoud said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed aim of protecting its northern territories from
cross-border guerrilla attacks. Since then, the Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas have been spearheading a war to oust the Israeli
occupation forces and the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Justice Minister to Run for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A speculation gained ground after
some deputies of Turkey's Democratic Left Party (DSP) confirmed
that the party will nominate Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk as
its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
If a constitutional amendment devised to extend President
Suleyman Demirel's term in office cannot be approved, Turk will
enter the race for presidency instead of Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem, Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made as the DSP, a partner of the ruling
coalition, has to prepare for a situation should a so-called 5 plus
5 plan fail, said the DSP deputies.
</P>
<P>
The 5+5 formula, proposed by the ruling coalition, calls for the
seven-year presidential term to be reduced to five years and permit
re-election.
</P>
<P>
Turk will be challenged by Sabahattin Cakmakoglu, the most
likely candidate from the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) of the
ruling coalition, and the two are widely expected to enter the
final race.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit will not announce his "
last minute surprise" until debate on the controversial
constitutional amendment proposal is finalized, which will serve
two purposes, not to offend Demirel and erode Turk prematurely.
</P>
<P>
As the Inter-party Accord Commission failed to reach a consensus
on the constitutional amendment, the negotiations have been
suspended until the end of the 11-day Muslim festivities.
</P>
<P>
The three major coalition partners -- the DSP, the MHP and the
Motherland Party (ANAP), will have only three weeks to prepare for
the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
During this period, if the amendment is not approved, the
candidates will either have to ask the Parliament Speaker's Office
to confirm their candidacy or get nominated by another deputy any
time on April 16-25.
</P>
<P>
Nominating a candidate from outside the Parliament is contingent
upon a petition endorsed by a minimum of 110 deputies.
</P>
<P>
Between April 26 and May 16, the 550-member parliament is
required to elect a new president in four separate voting sessions.
In the first two rounds, presidential candidates must win a minimum
of 367 votes, or two thirds majority, to enter the third session.
</P>
<P>
In the third round, the candidate who rallies 276, or absolute
majority, votes will be elected as the new president. If the
required quorum is still not obtained, the two candidates who
received the most votes in the third round will stay in the race
and the one who finally musters 276 votes will assume the office.
</P>
<P>
If a president can not be elected in the four consecutive
sessions, the parliament will be dissolved and general elections
will be held following which the new parliament will elect a new
president with the same method.
</P>
<P>
The DSP believed that Turk stands a good chance to be elected as
the new president, either in the third or fourth session.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Sends Message on World Women's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
on Wednesday called on the Turkish women to play more active role
in safeguarding their rights and shoulder their social
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
In a message issued on the occasion of the World Women's Day,
Demirel said there is still a long way to go before Turkish women
can fully exercise their legal rights in daily life.
</P>
<P>
"Men have been dominant at all levels of societies till the 20th
century, and women couldn't get the place they deserved in social
life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, March 8 marks a very important day for women around the
world who have been striving for years to "get equal payment for
equal work with men" as part of a global human rights movement.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said efforts are being made by state organizations and
voluntary women institutions to guarantee women's rights and help
solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
The Women's Day was celebrated with various activities in the
country. In the morning, nearly 30 women, members of non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), joined by State Minister Hasan
Gemici, laid a wreath at Ataturk's Mausoleum in commemoration of
the country's founder.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Reform National Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to adjust to new
developments and challenges, the Indonesian government will reform
its national defense system, Minister of Defense Juwono Sudarsono
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The reform will start from internal organs by reorganizing the
Ministry of Defense, TNI (the Indonesian Military) headquarters,
and the National Police ... and the move will be followed by the
structuring of the defense system which is backed by a strong
doctrine and legislation," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"We are thinking about a strategic plan within 5 to 10 years
ahead," the minister told a hearing with the House of
Representatives Commission I on Security, Defense and Foreign
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the future the national defense system will be
focused on external threats without ignoring internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Within five years (from now on) the police is expected to be
able to handle security disturbances at home, so that the TNI will
focus itself on handling security affairs in connection with
threats from outside forces and the TNI will become professional
soldiers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our national defense system will be directed to external
affairs (threats)," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped that the House will support him in his bid
to modernize the TNI's military equipment. "the TNI's equipment
don't suffice anymore as they were bought 20 to 30 years ago, so
their capabilities are very limited," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Combat Discrimination Against Women: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf Wednesday said his government will take
measures to eliminate discriminatory laws and actions against
women.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating a national convention of women here on the
occasion of the international women's day, Musharraf announced
formation of a permanent commission on status of women to examine
laws discriminatory to them and suggest policy guidelines to
ensure their emancipation.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to ensuring equality and justice to all women
of Pakistan," said the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
The commission, he said, will consider women rights enshrined
in the constitution and would also suggest requisite measures to
end discrimination to them in all the spheres of national life.
</P>
<P>
It will also take up violations of women rights with the
concerned authorities, he told women representatives from across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said there had been many laws on the statute books
but these were by-passed as there was no effective mechanism to
stop their infringement.
</P>
<P>
But the new commission will also work out "a judicial mechanism
" and prepare recommendations to be approved by the federal
cabinet to ensure no violations of women rights take place in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive assured the women that his government will
take necessary steps to rectify the existing imbalance which
places them at a disadvantageous position in the society.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Congress to Fast-track Securities Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
urged Congress anew Wednesday to speed up the passage of a new
Securities Act aimed at promoting a more transparent and stronger
stock exchange in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He called on lawmakers to adopt models in Singapore, Hong Kong
and Australia, where the public has the majority ownership of the
stock market, in restructuring the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).
</P>
<P>
"We should emulate the Singapore or Hong Kong or Australian
models. There will be less chances of manipulation by brokers
since 70 percent of the stock market would be publicly owned," he
said on his weekly radio program.
</P>
<P>
Trading went on as usual at the PSE on Wednesday after Estrada
ordered concerned officials to ensure that there would be no
suspension following the mass resignation of members of the
exchange's Compliance and Surveillance Group.
</P>
<P>
The mass resignation prompted Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Chairman Perfecto Yasay to order the suspension
of trading Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, the suspension order was lifted after officials from
the PSE and SEC came to terms early Wednesday to iron out the
kinks that surrounded the stock market fiasco which involved some
brokers of the BW Resources shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Trade and Industry Secretary Manuel Roxas said
the order made by Yasay suspending trading at the PSE was illegal,
since directive coming from the SEC have to be approved and signed
by majority of its commissioners.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the stock exchange sends a strong signa to
investors that the government is committed to fostering a stable
and predictable business policy environment," Roxas said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Approves Mekong Navigation Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has given the
green light for signing an agreement for commercial navigation of
the Mekong River with China, Laos and Myanmar, deputy government
spokesman Ratana Chongsuthanamanee said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ratana was quoted by Thailand News Agency as saying that the
proposal, approved by the cabinet Tuesday, would be inked during
the economic ministerial meeting of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations in Myanmar in May.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communication Minister was authorized to sign the
agreement on behalf of the Thai government while the foreign
ministry was assigned to give a final check of the draft accord
and to push for the implementation of the signed agreement, Ratana
said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to help boost sub-regional trade,
transportation and tourism among the four countries.
</P>
<P>
The initiative for this project began in 1993, whereas the
negotiations started three years later.
</P>
<P>
The signatories agreed to implement the agreement on the upper
part of Mekong River for a year after the agreement is signed,
pending further review.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, passengers and cargo from participating
countries will be able to travel along the upper part of the
Mekong River without having to pay transit fees.
</P>
<P>
The area extends from the Simao area in southwestern China to
Luang Prabang in Laos.
</P>
<P>
The signatory countries will open 14 ports along the upper part
of the Mekong River.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, countries must offer passengers, vessels and cargo
from participating countries the same treatment in customs
procedure, port and cargo service and other related services as
provided to their nationals.
</P>
<P>
The four countries will also have to jointly draft common
navigation rules. The rules will include traffic regulations,
vessel safety, equipment and the entry and exit of vessels.
</P>
<P>
The 4,800-kilometer Mekong River is the longest in Southeast
Asia, flowing from China's Qinghai Province and through five
other countries, namely Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and
Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China expects to have around 800
cities by the year 2010 with a total urban population of 630
million and an urban development rate of 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
China now has 668 cities and vigorous local economic growth has
led to the emergence of clusters of cities nationwide, according
to Chen Xiaoli, director of Urban and Rural Development Planning
Department under the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that most groups of cities are concentrated in the
Yangtze and Pearl river deltas, as well as on Liaodong Peninsula
and in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area. Some 200 medium-sized
cities have been developed on the basis of the fast-growing towns.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that rapid urbanization has to a certain
degree improved the uneven distribution of cities between eastern
and western China. The east is home to 44 percent of cities and
the west 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that China's urbanization development strategy has
paid off by controlling the number and scale of large and extra-
large cities and giving more room to medium-sized and small cities
as well as small rural towns.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China has worked out a series of
laws to govern the country's urban development.

<HEADLINE> HK Expecting Five Percent GDP Growth for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) - Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
Wednesday forecast Hong Kong's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth
at a faster speed of five percent for 2000, based on the fact that
both the domestic and external environment is favorable.
</P>
<P>
In his 2000/2001 budget address, Tsang said Hong Kong's economy
had grown by 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, bringing
full year 1999 growth to 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government is forecasting a five percent GDP growth in real
terms for 2000, since the economy will continue its vigorous
growth in 2000, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's trade prospects remain promising, Tsang said,
referring to the facts that economic activities in East Asia will
intensify further and Hong Kong's production hinterland, the
mainland, is certain to have another year of good economic growth.
</P>
<P>
On top of these, Hong Kong's traditional export markets, such
as the United States, enjoy continued economic growth and rising
consumer demand. The on-going cost and price adjustments in the
local economy coupled with stronger currencies in the rest of Asia
will also help enhance Hong Kong's external competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Taking the factors together, Tsang expected Hong Kong's total
exports of goods to attain a growth of eight percent, comprising a
decline of four percent in domestic exports and an increase of ten
percent in re-exports.
</P>
<P>
The exports of services in real terms was forecast at eight
percent, with continued growth in inbound tourism and a further
pick-up in exports of trade-related, professional and other
business services. Imports of services were estimated to grow by
five percent.
</P>
<P>
As sentiment improves and unemployment falls, Tsang held local
consumer spending will pick up further. But given that the current
restraint on wages will continue to dampen demand, he only
forecast a modest growth in consumer spending of 2.5 percent in
real terms for 2000.
</P>
<P>
On investment spending, Tsang believed the current financial
stringency should ease in due course as business prospects turn
better. Public sector investment in infrastructure is gathering
pace, with a significant output boost from the priority railway
projects and the continuation of the public housing program.
</P>
<P>
Backed by those factors, Tsang forecast investment spending in
2000 to recover to a growth of around six percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Tsang predicted that consumer prices in 2000 will remain soft,
despite the pick-up in the economy. The Composite Consumer Price
Index (CPI) is expected to go down by an average of one percent.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, Tsang said Hong Kong's economic outlook is
favorable, underpinned in particular by sustained robust growth
and further economic reform and liberalization in the mainland
after its accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The forecast of trend GDP growth was raised to 4 percent
annually for the four-year period 2000-2003, as against the 3.5
percent forecast in Tsang's previous Budget, Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Secretary Forecasts Smaller Deficit in 1999/2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is expected to
register a small deficit of 1.6 billion HK dollars (205 million U.
S. dollars) for the financial year of 1999/2000, according to
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
That is 34.9 billion HK dollars (4.5 billion U.S. dollars)
better than the 36.5 billion HK dollars (4.7 billion U.S. dollars)
deficit originally estimated, said Tsang, when he delivered the
annual financial budget at the Legislative Council here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the dramatic improvement in the financial
position to the an expected growth in the earnings on Hong Kong's
fiscal reserves invested in the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the Hang Seng Index from 10,049 at the end of
1998 to 16,962 at the end of 1999 has boosted the value of the
portfolio of Hong Kong stocks acquired by the Exchange Fund in
1998," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the investment earnings on our fiscal reserves
have soared to 44 billion HK dollars (5.6 billion U.S. dollars),
almost double our original estimate of 22.2 billion HK dollars (2.
8 billion U.S. dollars)," he said, adding that "Revenue from land
premiums is expected to be 3.1 billion HK dollars (397 million U.S.
dollars) higher than previously estimated."
</P>
<P>
In total, revenue collections for the year is estimated to be
229.3 billion HK dollars (29.4 billion U.S. dollars), or 24.2
billion HK dollars (3.1 billion U.S. dollars) higher than the
original estimate of 205.1 billion HK dollars (26.3 billion U.S.
dollars), said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the expenditure, Tsang pointed out that a lower
than expected level of expenditure also contributed to the reduced
deficit, and forecast the total expenditure to be 230.9 billion HK
dollars (29.6 billion U.S. dollars), or 10.7 billion HK dollars (1.
4 billion U.S. dollars) lower than the forecast, in the current
year.

<HEADLINE> HK to Allocate More Funds to Promote Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Donald Tsang, financial
secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said
here Wednesday that the government intends to allocate more funds
to promote quality education in the coming financial year.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the 2000/2001 financial budget report at the
Legislative Council, Tsang said quality education for Hong Kong
citizens has always been one of the chief executive's top policy
priorities.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to note that the Quality Education Fund which we
established in 1998 with a grant of five billion HK dollars (641
million U.S. dollars) has since risen to 6.4 billion HK dollars (
821 million U.S. dollars), thanks to good financial management,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Praising the Education Commission for its excellent work in the
first two stages of public consultation, the financial secretary
said a comprehensive proposal will come up to reform the education
system in due course.
</P>
<P>
"I have set aside a sum of 800 million HK dollars (102.6
million U.S. dollars) in 2000/2001, which will enable us to make
an early start on those recommendations of the commission that the
government and the community consider to warrant priority action,"
Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
In the 2000/2001 fiscal year, 44 more primary schools will
operate whole day, and 100 additional information technology co-
ordinators and more technical services to schools will support the
use of information technology in education.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to the improvement of the student financial
assistance schemes, Tsang said some 140 million HK dollars (17.9
million U.S. dollars) will be offered annually to improve the
textbook assistance and travel subsidy schemes beginning in the
new school year in September.

<HEADLINE> No New Taxes or Tax Increases in 2000/2001: HK FS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
impose no new taxes or have any tax increase in the 2000/2001
fiscal year, to help Hong Kong recover from the economic setback
of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the annual budget, Donald Tsang, the financial
secretary of the Hong Kong SAR, said Hong Kong's long-term
interests and economic situation must be taken into account in
formulating the revenue proposals and he has decided to leave most
revenue items as they are.
</P>
<P>
On revenue proposals, Tsang said the rate of stamp duty on
stock transactions shall be reduced by 10 percent, from 0.25
percent to 0.225 percent, noting that the purpose of this proposal
is to help maintain the competitiveness of Hong Kong in the global
financial marketplace.
</P>
<P>
"Many major markets around the world, including the United
States, Japan and New Zealand, are already not charging stamp duty
on stock transaction volumes," he said. "There is a practical need
for Hong Kong to reduce its stock transaction cost as well for our
market to remain attractive."
</P>
<P>
Tsang made the proposition to extend the concessionary rate of
the diesel duty of 2.00 HK dollars per liter for further nine
months to December 31, 2000, and to extend the first registration
tax exemption for electric vehicles for another three years until
March 31, 2003 in the hope of further encouraging the use and
development of this type of environmentally-friendly vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the unchanged tax items, Tsang said profits tax,
salaries tax and rates are the three that generate the highest
level of income.
</P>
<P>
"While I am proposing no change to the rates percentage charges,
the latest general revaluation shows that the ratable values for
properties have fallen on average by 7 percent, reflecting the
continue decline in market rentals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of ratepayers will benefit from this
reduction, which will take effect from April 1, this year," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted the existing profits tax rate and system of Hong Kong
are already extremely business-friendly by international standards,
and there is simply no case for further concession in the present
fiscal situation.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he has decided not to increase the salaries because
the economy is still at an early stage of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Coming to the controversial departure tax, Tsang said a land
and sea departure tax will not be introduced in the coming
financial year in order not to put an additional burden on the
community.
</P>
<P>
"When the time is ripe and we have completed our detailed
implementation study, we will consult the industry and members of
the Legislative Council on our proposals," he said.

LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is to embark
on mass recruitment for its civil service beginning from next
month in a bid to reduce unemployment in the country, according to
a report by The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper on

The civil service at the federal level had not practiced mass
recruitment for many years due to overload, he said.

To enhance efficiency after the recruitment, the civil service
will make training and written examination as pre-conditions for
promotion, facilitate inter-cadre personnel transfer and
computerize its operation, Kirfi said.

the notorious Somali cattle rustlers on Tuesday, spokesman for
Tanzania Police Force Aden Mwamunyange said there is no need for
the involvement of the army in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is not at war right now and there are no reasons which
can justify the involvement of the Tanzania People's Defense
Forces, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Police Force is fully capable of
containing the sporadic military-style attacks by Somali bandits
as long as the force is provided with the necessary facilities and
the effective co-operation of citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Police Force made the reaction just one day after
authorities in Arusha Region suggested the deployment of an army
unit in Ngorongoro District to curb constant attacks mounted by
the Somali bandits.
</P>
<P>
According to local authorities, the Somali cattle rustlers have
killed at least a dozen of people and robbed a large amount of
money from residents of the region since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Kaduna Refinery Resumes Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Kaduna Refinery and
Petrochemical Company (KRPC), which shut down as a result of the
recent riots, has resumed full operations, said a source reaching
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The source quoted KRPC's acting managing director, B.O.
Williams as saying the refinery now has enough petroleum products
in stocks to last for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Over one million liters of petroleum products is released on
daily basis from the refinery to serve Kaduna metropolis alone,
said Williams, adding there was therefore no reason for the
present fuel scarcity in the town.
</P>
<P>
KRPC, one of nigeria's four refineries, has been a major
petrochemical products provider in the northern states of the
country, said the source. It was closed down three weeks ago for
emergency repairs and the recent religious riots in the city made
the situation even worse.
</P>
<P>
Fuel scarcity is looming in Lagos, the biggest city of the
country, as long queues of vehicles waiting for oil at filling
stations throughout the city become common sight in these days.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Imposes Curfew on Riot Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Osun State Governor
Adebisi Akande Tuesday imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew upon the
towns of Ife and Modakeke in the state after a community clash
there had taken the lives of dozens of people, the Guardian
newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Akande as saying in a statewide broadcast
that he was "particularly disturbed by the resort to force on both
sides at resolving an issue which could ordinarily be resolved by
dialog."
</P>
<P>
The violence, which erupted last Friday over a land dispute
between two local Yoruba communities, worsened on Tuesday as over
100 houses were burnt to ground and more casualties were taken.
</P>
<P>
More residents are fleeing from the troubled towns to nearby
areas, including the country's economic hub Lagos State, which
borders Osun State to the south, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Osun State Commissioner of Police Johnson Nwoye, who narrowly
escaped an attack by the riot villagers on Tuesday, said his men,
aided by colleagues from nearby states, were fighting for control
of situation with the rioters armed with sophisticated weapons.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out any link between the Ife-Modakeke flare-up with
the bloody religious rioting that has killed hundreds of people in
northern and southeastern Nigeria in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The towns people of Ife and Modakeke, both inhabited by
Yorubas, one of the three main ethnic groups in the country, have
a long-standing rivalry over land ownership and political
supremacy in the area that sporadically erupted into violence
since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush March to Presidential Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
swept his rival Bill Bradley toward the Democratic nomination
while Texas Governor George W. Bush is winning more than his rival
Arizona Senator John McCain in the Republican primaries and
caucuses on "Super Tuesday".
</P>
<P>
Gore has won the Democratic primaries and caucuses in Vermont,
Georgia, Ohio, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Missouri, New York, Rhode Island, North Dakota, California,
Washington, Idaho, according to latest projections from TV
networks. The highest supporting rate for Gore is in Georgia,
which is 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bradley has not won in any state so far even in the state of
Missouri, where he was born and raised. Democratic officials said
he might quit the race on Thursday. His highest supporting rate is
in Vermont, where he won 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bush, the eldest son of former President George Bush, beat
McCain in Georgia, Ohio, Maryland, Maine and Missouri, New York,
Minnesota and Washington while McCain won in Vermont, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In the State of Idaho, the
Republicans will hold their contest on May 23.
</P>
<P>
In Washington State, Bush won 91 percent while McCain only got
one percent, which are the highest and lowest supporting rates for
both of the competitors.
</P>
<P>
Gore, appearing before supporters in his hometown, Nashville,
Tennessee, said, "Tonight I salute Bill Bradley."
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the Republicans on banning the so-called
soft money.
</P>
<P>
"I will challenge the Republican nominee to join with me right
now in banning so-called soft money and then going even further to
eliminate all of the 30-second and 60-second radio and TV ads and
instead debate twice a week as soon as the nominees of the parties
are known, every week until the election, a separate issue each
time," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, McCain expressed his thanks for the "great
support" from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that this trend of support will continue on
the West Coast and I look forward to all the results as they
continue to come in," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that he did
not consider himself as "presumptive nominee." "I consider myself
a huge step closer and will work hard to secure the nomination."
</P>
<P>
Gore and Bradley were competing for 1,315 delegates to the
Democratic Convention in Los Angeles in August, more than half of
the 2,170 needed for the presidential nomination. Gore began the
day with 482 delegates to 57 for his rival.
</P>
<P>
At stake Tuesday were 613 delegates, more than half the total 1,
034 delegates needed to obtain the Republican presidential
nomination at the convention in the coming summer.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snowstorms have caused
enormous damage to Mongolia, affecting about 40,000 households of
herders, the State Citizens Safeguarding Board said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1.435 million head of livestock have died countrywide so
far and more are dying, Mongolia's top Red Cross official said. Up
to 2 million livestock may die ultimately.
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit areas are Dundgobi, Ovorkhangai and Uvs
provinces. Some 293,700 animals died in Dundgobi, 273,900 in
Ovorkhangai and 171,800 in the western Uvs province. Lots of
households living in these provinces have lost all their livestock.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy last week met with
researchers from the Agricultural University to discuss the
problems caused by the disasters.
</P>
<P>
Extremely low temperatures this winter made animals' survival
hard and continuous snowfalls have made animal abortions common.
</P>
<P>
In the western part of the landlocked country, temperatures
below 50 degrees centigrade were detected.

<HEADLINE> Migrants Face Significant Discrimination in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Immigrant workers and their
families face major hurdles in obtaining jobs and face "
significant and disturbing levels of discrimination" in Western
Europe and other parts of the industrialized world, the
International Labor Organization (ILO) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report of its recent studies in a number of Western
European countries, the ILO said that "overall discrimination
rates of up to 35 percent were not uncommon", meaning that at
least one in every three job applications posed by migrant/ethnic
minority candidates met with discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The ILO said that at least one-third of all advertised
vacancies were effectively closed to applicants from ethnic
minority groups as a result of discriminatory hiring practices.
</P>
<P>
"Discrimination is particularly high in service sectors,
notably in branches where contacts with clients is an essential
element of the services provided," the ILO said, adding that the
trend is "extremely worrying" since services are precisely the
area where job growth is strongest.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem, the ILO is holding a four-day high-
level meeting in Geneva to examine the human rights and political
challenges of reducing and eliminating widespread barriers to
employment of migrants and minorities in Europe and throughout the
industrialized world.

<HEADLINE> Biological Material for Burns Developed in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Officials with a hospital in
Heilongjiang Province in north China have developed a new type of
"skin" to help burn victims.
</P>
<P>
Pang Jianhua, director of the burn unit at Harbin No. Five
Hospital, said the material was made from the ectoderm of placenta,
because it is somewhat similar with the structure of baby's skin
and has the "biological function of people's skin."
</P>
<P>
It is the result of six years of research by Pang and her
associates. Sources from the hospital said the new, low-cost
material has proved successful in clinical tests.
</P>
<P>
Although the ectoderm of placenta had been used before to
replace damaged skin of burn patients, Pang said the new material
is the first to have a multi-layer structure which can protect
body fluid and prevent infection.
</P>
<P>
Pang said that it will provide two kinds of enzymes to help
cells split, proliferate, and shorten the period of healing.
</P>
<P>
The new material is transparent, which allows doctors to
closely monitor the progress of the new material on burned skin,
Pang said.

BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- An average of 500 million people
in China participate in volunteer tree-planting activities every
year, putting as many as two billion trees into the ground
annually.
</P>

A chapter in a soon-to-be-published book titled "Citizen's

China's forest coverage has been increased by almost two percent.

China designated March 12 as its national Tree-Planting Day in
1979. In 1981 the National People's Congress passed a decision
saying that every citizen over age 11 should plant three to five
trees every year.
</P>
<P>
"Since then, China's nationwide tree planting drive has come to
be one of the most successful efforts of mankind to improve the
ecological environment," said Zhang Yunchang, an expert from the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Every woman who passed by the
Beijing Book Building today received a special gift in honor of
International Women's Day: brochure on laws protecting the rights
and interests of Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation and the Ministry of Justice
jointly launched a week-long program to promote public awareness
of women's rights.
</P>
<P>
From March 8-14, professionals in the fields of laws and women'
s rights set up information centers in both urban and rural areas
across the country where women can go for help concerning their
lawful rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Gao Changli said today that since the legal
information hotline "148" was opened to the public in 1998, one
quarter of the call-ins are women who say their rights have been
violated.
</P>
<P>
He noted that though the hotline has helped some women, the
issue of women's rights involves all of society, and the public
should be better informed on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, president of the All-China Women's Federation,
visited the information site in Daxing County in Beijing's
southern suburbs. She attributed reports of sex discrimination and
family violence to the belief of "male superiority" that
flourishes in Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
She said Chinese women, particularly those in rural areas,
cannot protect their rights mostly because of their low level of
education.

JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat met late Tuesday as U.S. Middle East envoy
Dennis Ross arrived for a two-day visit with an aim of breaking the
current deadlock in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Barak is eager for progress in the talks with the
Palestinians and ready for some concessions. They said Barak has
recently sent envoys to Arafat with a number of proposals, which
dealt with both the redeployment issue and a new timetable for
carrying out the agreements.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak Tuesday assumed the role of acting Transport Minister
after Center Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai was forced to take a
leave of absence because a woman in his office accused him of
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general and state prosecutor has authorized a full-
scale inquiry following a preliminary police investigation.
Mordechai announced at a press conference that he decided to
suspend himself from all his government duties in order to allow
the police to conduct a swift investigation. He denied all the
charges leveled against him.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The woman in Mordechai's office who charged him of sexual
harassment was found to speak truthfully in private polygraph test.
Police have recording in which Mordechai's bureau chief tried to
convince the young woman to retract her complaint.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was revealed Tuesday that a former female soldier
had complained to the police about a sexual assault attempt by
Mordechai in 1987 when he was the head of the Southern Command. The
police bureau has compiled a file on her charges over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Mordechai became the first minister in Israel's history who
was being investigated for sexual assault. Police investigators had
an impression that the accusation against him was clear, reliable
and exact.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the parliament in honor of International Women's
Day, Barak said the government is deeply committed to protecting
women from violence. He stressed that Israeli society is plagued by
a very serious problem of attacks on women and it can only be
stopped by strict enforcement of the law and swift punishment of
offenders.

<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- John Page, World Bank director in charge of economic
policies, said Tuesday that Turkey has the biggest economic
capacity in its region.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is the country having the biggest economic capacity in
the region. If Turkey's economic program reaches success, we will
use it as a model in other countries," Page noted.

costs, if we act together with Israel and Palestine."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Tourist Sites Attract More Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 115,000 tourists
visited Siem Reap and Angkor Wat, two famous tourist sites in
Cambodia, in 1999, according to the latest issue of Phnom Penh
Post.
</P>
<P>
The figure is a record high compared with past years and this
has boosted the service business there.
</P>
<P>
Some 76,000 out of the tourists arrived there by air, and
others by land or water.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists directly from Bangkok increased from 10,
243 in 1998 to 28,525 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The tourist boom is the result of the 'Open Skies' policy
implemented by Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Airlines are taking advantage of the policy. There are now
about forty flights landing at the Siem Reap Airport every week,
an indusstry source said.
</P>
<P>
More restaurants and bars have been opened offering a wide
range of cuisine, from Indian food to Italian pizza. Several new
hotels are now under construction.
</P>
<P>
In the past, tourists came only to see the temples and left
very soon, but now they have more items and many of them stay five
or six days, some even stay a month.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of Cambodia's promising industries. The number
of tourists coming to Cambodia last year climbed 30 percent over
the previous year, and tourism officials expect a similar increase
this year.

<HEADLINE> ADB Provides Assistance to African Private Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank (ADB)
has approved a total cumulative amount of 435 million U.S. dollars
for 46 projects of the private sector in Africa for the year 2000,
according to a senior ADB official.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian newspaper, the Post Express, Wednesday quoted ADB
vice- president Cyril Inweze as saying that the bank was doing a
lot in response to the challenges of promoting the private sector
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the media in Nigerian capital Abuja, Inweze said the
ADB had utilized a variety of instruments to assist regional
member countries through policy-based loans to support the
implementation of enhancing private sector investments.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has tended to place more emphasis on assistance related
to the project cycle with particular reference to quality of
projects, he said, adding the bank would be more positively
involved in the private sector development.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed a strong belief in the private sector in
Africa, saying the sector, if given the opportunity, will improve
returns on allocation, mobilize additional sector funds and
stimulate entrepreneurship on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The ADB, established in 1963, is aimed to facilitate its member
nations by investments and loans to realize the social and
economic development.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Take Action Against Soaring Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will take measures to
minimize the impact on its economy of soaring oil prices on the
international market by reducing oil taxes setting price ceilings,
the Finance and Economy Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it will continue to watch the movement of oil
prices on the international market and take proper actions next
week.
</P>
<P>
It said the measures include further cuts in oil taxes, release
of oil reserves stockpiled for use of 28 days and a freeze on
domestic oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices Monday rose to a record level since the Gulf War.
The price of Dubai crude oil, which accounts for the bulk of South
Korean oil imports, hit 26.84 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The high price of Dubai crude oil could deal a crucial blow to
the international balance of payments of South Korea if it
continues its current level.
</P>
<P>
Last Week, the U.S. Energy Intelligence Agency said the price
of crude oil being exported to the United States will rise to 26.
43 dollars in March from 22.38 dollars in February, dimming
prospects for a drop of oil prices in near future.

<HEADLINE> Major U.S. Unions Back Boeing Strikers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. most powerful union,
the AFL-CIO, announced Tuesday that it will give striking Boeing
engineers and technical workers the financial backing they need to
continue their walkout.
</P>
<P>
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka promised to give the
Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA)
50,000 dollars, plus an additional 25,000 dollars per week until
the strike is over.
</P>
<P>
"We feel these engineers have earned the right to be treated as
partners, not as property, by Boeing," Trumka said prior to a
union rally Tuesday night at the Seattle Center.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other U.S. unions have also started donating to the
striking Boeing workers, who did not have a strike fund when
workers walked off the job on February 9.
</P>
<P>
The Communications Workers of America have pledged 25,000
dollars per week for the duration of the strike, while the
International Union of Electricians and the American Federation of
County and Municipal Workers each made a one-time donation of 25,
000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to help offset financial burdens on
striking workers, most of whom have not received a paycheck since
February 24 or earlier. Workers will be able to draw on the new
strike fund to pay up to one-third of their mortgage and utility
costs, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA workers are locked in a contract dispute with Boeing over
guaranteed raises and increased costs for medical benefits. Boeing
declared an impasse in negotiations last week and imposed wage
increases from its last offer over the weekend. The union is
protesting the declaration, and has filed a complaint with the
National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA says the wages hikes imposed by Boeing were still below
market levels and did not do enough to guarantee raises for
individuals. Under Boeing's proposal, certain groups of workers
could receive big raises while other groups get none.
</P>
<P>
"We're not coming back to work until they sit down at the table
with us and negotiate this contract," said Tom McCarty, a member
of the engineering negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has said it aimed to deliver 480 planes this year, but
the month-long strike by 18,000 engineers and technicians
decreased the planned number of deliveries in February from 42 to
27.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Allows Illegals to Collect Back Wages Before Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners who illegally stay in
South Korea will be allowed to collect back wages or loans before
their deportation, the Justice Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners who have filed lawsuits to collect unpaid wages or
loans to others can remain in the country until the legal process
ends, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreigners who were victims of fraud will also be
allowed to stay temporarily and can receive legal assistance from
volunteer lawyers and labor inspectors for collection of back
wages.
</P>
<P>
The number of illegal aliens in South Korea rose to 14,146 last
year from 12,381 in 1998. A total of 485 illegal foreign workers
are under detention, according to the ministry.

SEOUL, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean military has
recently refused a U.S. donation of 14,000 units of mobile anti-
tank missiles, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>

The ministry said it rejected the offer because of the huge
sums of money required to maintain and store the missiles. Besides,
the missiles would later have to be destroyed due to the
introduction of newer missiles within three years.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Current Account Surplus Sharply Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
surplus plunged to 320 million U.S. dollars in January from last
December's 1.4 billion, mainly due to sharply increased imports
and travel expenses, the Bank of Korea said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus is at its lowest level since November 1997 when the
current account balance went into the black with 860 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports in January reached 13.74 billion dollars, up 36.1
percent from the same month last year while imports jumped to 13.
11 billion dollars, soaring 57.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the surging imports to increased
oil and raw material prices, a jump in imports of information and
communications equipment and precision machinery.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the travel and service industries suffered a
deficit in January.
</P>
<P>
The travel sector saw a deficit of 40 million dollars, the
first time since October 1997 because of a large increase in the
number of outbound travelers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province Stops Family Violence by Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province enacted a law on family violence today which makes clear
that spousal abuse and striking children will no longer be
tolerated here.
</P>
<P>
Abuse within families has become a social problem in Liaoning.
The provincial women's federation has logged an alarming increase
in reports from women who say they have suffered at the hands of
their husbands. In some instances, women who were severely beaten
by their husbands became deaf or disabled.
</P>
<P>
The new law on family violence includes specific articles that
will be used to punish those convicted of spousal abuse.
</P>
<P>
China has a national law protecting women's rights and
interests, and local governments have taken steps to implement it.
Beijing has propagated such rules since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Women's Federation has opened a shelter for abused
women who find themselves homeless.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Qingdao, a coastal city in east China's Shandong
Province, said that 90 percent of family violence victims are
women. The violence has been attributed to the increasing income
gap between men and women, more lay-offs of women workers, and
extra-marital affairs.

<HEADLINE> Reception Held to Celebrate Women's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua)-- China's largest non-governmental
women's organization, the All China Women's Federation (ACWF),
hosted a reception at the Great Hall of the People today to mark
the 90th anniversary of International Women's Day and the 5th
anniversary of the UN Fourth World Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, vice-chairman of the Chinese National People's
Congress Standing Committee and president of ACWF, extended warm
greetings to "all sisters and friends" around the world on behalf
of the Chinese government and the ACWF at the reception, which was
attended by over 1,500 Chinese and foreign women delegates.
</P>
<P>
Peng noted that in the past 90 years, remarkable achievements
have been made in the course of international women's emancipation.
The Beijing Declaration and the Platform of Action adopted at the
UN Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing 1995 greatly
pushed forward the international women's movement.
</P>
<P>
She said that based on the state policy of integrating gender
equality into social development, the Chinese government
formulated and carried out the National Program for the
Development of Chinese Women (1995-2000).
</P>
<P>
To date, the main objectives of the program have nearly all
been accomplished, leading to the improvement of the overall
quality of Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
According to Peng, women employees now account for 46.7% of the
total workforce, and 39.3% of professionals and technicians in
state enterprises and agencies are women. In the Chinese Academy
of Sciences and China Academy of Engineering, there are 70 women
academicians, accounting for 6% of the total.
</P>
<P>
Peng stressed that in the new century, China will continue to
uphold the basic state policy of equality between women and men
and to further advance the overall quality of women.
</P>
<P>
She also said the ACWF will actively promote cooperation
between women on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.

<HEADLINE> Women Emancipation Unresolved Issue in Turkey: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey, one of the first countries
in the Islamic world in granting rights to women, still runs far
short of expectations of equality of men and women in a civilized
society, according to local press reports on the occasion of the
International Women's Day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish women were first granted the right to elect and to be
elected in the 1935 elections, in which 18 women were elected
deputies. This number decreased to 15 in the 1939 polls.
</P>
<P>
In the country's most recent election last April, a total of 22
women managed to enter the 550-member Grand National Assembly
(parliament), representing 2.4 percent of the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a Muslim-populated but secular state defined under
Constitution, being listed among first countries granting women the
right to participate in elections.
</P>
<P>
Yet the country has not been very successful in ensuring a
satisfactory degree of women participation in political decision-
making mechanisms. In contrast to Turkey's 2.4 percent, 17.4
percent of the members of Parliament are women in Uganda, an
African state that won independence decades later than Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Research conducted by the Prime Ministry's General Directorate
for Women's Status and Problems showed that throughout Turkey 39.6
percent of the women between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Balance of Payments Deficit Triples in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's balance of payments
deficit tripled in 1999, to 2.6 billion U.S. dollars, according to
figures released by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the balance of payments deficit stood at 842 million U.
S. dollars. However, 1999's figure was still low compared to the
figures of 1997 and 1996, when the deficit stood at 3.5 billion U.
S. dollars and 5.4 billion respectively.
</P>
<P>
When analyzed by quarters, CBS said, Israel had a balance of
payments surplus in the last quarter of 1999, of 409 million
dollars, but a deficit for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Net capital inflow totalled 1.7 billion dollars in 1999,
unchanged on 1998. Net liabilities to overseas rose significantly
in 1999, by 1.8 billion, while net debt fell by 400 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1999, total debts to overseas, less foreign
assets, were 47.3 billion dollars. This includes investments by
foreigners in Israel, less Israeli investment overseas, which stood
at 36.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in Israel, directly and in Israeli stocks,
totalled 1.6 billion dollars in 1999, up by 500 million dollars
from the 1998 figure.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in the goods account increased to 4.5 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, from 3.2 billion of 1998, while the deficit in the
services account fell from 800 million U.S. dollars to 600 million.
</P>
<P>
Income from foreign tourism in 1999 rose from 1998's 2.7 billion
to 3 billion U.S. dollars, but expenditures by Israelis abroad also
rose, from 1998's 2.4 billion to 2.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Israel continued to enjoy a surplus in exports of other services
in 1999. This reached a total of 1.5 billion dollars in 1999,
compared to 1.2 billion of 1998. This was counterbalanced by the
increasing deficit in transport and shipping, which rose from 1.8
billion of 1998 to 1999's 2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the trade figures released by the CBS, total trade with
the Palestinians ended in a surplus of 400 million U.S. dollars in
1999.

<HEADLINE> IDF Urges to Lift Ban on Palestinian Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
has called on the government to lift the ban against Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Police Chief General Ghazi Jibali and
cancel the arrest warrant against him.
</P>
<P>
"For those working closely with the Palestinians, it is clear
that renewed cooperation with the general is necessary," local
daily Ha'aretz on Wednesday quoted senior IDF officers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jibali was put on the wanted list by Israel in July 1997 for his
alledged involvement in ordering three PNA policemen to attack
Jewish settlers near the West Bank city of Hebron. Israel requested
his extradition, but the PNA and the general himself denied the
accusations against him.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Israeli government has turned down all
suggestions from the security forces to alter its position on
Jibali. Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein opposes the
nullification of the arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
But IDF officers said that a complete lack of contact with
Jibali has a negative effect on the quality of cooperation with the
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
"Jibali is also interested in resuming contacts with us. The ban
on him adds disproportionate importance to other senior officers in
the Palestinian security apparatus and creates difficulties in
dealing with issues that fall under the general's authority, such
as car theft," the IDF officers pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted another Israeli security source as saying
that "in short, from our point of view, Jibali is a positive
individual."
</P>
<P>
In the end, the source added, a solution will be found for
dropping the warrant because even the three Palestinian policemen
who were involved in the attack were released from Israel's
administrative detention more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The administrative detention means putting the Palestinians into
jail without any trial.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt and the U.S. on Tuesday agreed to give top priority to
cooperation in the information technology (I.T.) field as part of
their partnership agreement.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the two countries agreed to form a joint
team with the aim of upgrading Egyptian infrastructure in the
fields of I.T. and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- An annual conference of the International Internet
Organization opened Tuesday in Cairo for the first time in Egypt
and the Middle East. The meeting was attended by more than 350
experts from 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- An official source at the Egyptian Ministry of Economy denied
newspaper reports that some European countries levied customs
duties on their imports of Egyptian potatoes.
</P>
<P>
The source added that the Ministry has not been informed yet of
this "strange" decision which is contradicting the previous
agreements concluded with the European Union in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Tuesday there was a
great opportunity to achieve peace in the Middle East and that
Israel must seize this opportunity if it has true desire to make
peace with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the third Mediterranean Forum for Development,
Moussa said the Middle East was passing through a very sensitive
stage and that Arabs would lose all faith in the Israeli policies
unless substantial progress had been achieved in the next few
months.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Meets With Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talking to reporters after an hour meeting, the president said
that the visit was merely to meet an elder person.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana said her
father is in good health and will be examined by a medical team
from the Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been named a suspect by the Attorney General's
Office in a probe into alleged corruption during his 32-year-rule.
</P>
<P>
But the 78-year-old Soeharto failed to answer a summons at the
Attorney General's Office last month. Soeharto's lawyers said
their client was too ill to meet the summons of the Attorney
General's Office.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab earlier said that the meeting was
part of a series of meetings with Indonesian figures. Last week,
the president met suspended coordinating minister of political and
security affairs General Wiranto on Friday night, and met former
president B.J. Habibie on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the president held a meeting with three noted public
figures, including speaker of the House of Representatives Akbar
Tandjung, chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly Amien
Rais and prominent Muslim scholar Nurcholish Madjid.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at resolving various national problems
including the continuity of the democratic process in the country,
Alwi said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Pursue Cases vs. Tax Credit Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
reassured the public Wednesday that he will pursue the prosecution
of former officials involved in a tax credit scam which robbed the
government of at least 8 billion pesos (200 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The president said on radio that government investigators have
recently gathered more documents to nail down officials involved
in the anomaly, which he noted, was perpetrated at the height of
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"As of now, we have discovered at least 8 billion pesos
involved in this fraud committed by former finance officials. This
is documented. We have hard evidence. That's why I reissued the
hold departure orders against them," said Estrada.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Bureau of Immigration issued hold departure
orders against three former officials of the Department of Finance
allegedly involved in this multi-billion peso tax credit scandal
during the previous administration.
</P>
<P>
The hold departure is meant to prevent persons facing criminal
charges from fleeing abroad.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora announced the
creation of a task force to investigate the anomalous tax credit
certificate and duty drawback transactions which have reportedly
bled the government of an estimated 10 billion pesos (250 million
dollars) to 15 billion pesos (375 million dollars) in losses.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said initial investigation showed that the losses were
all incurred during the past administration, from 1992 to the
first semester of 1998.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Urges to Enhance Women's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director of the United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Klaus Toepfer Wednesday called
to improve the life quality of women and enhance their status.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark the International Women's Day here at the
UNEP headquarters, the official pointed out that "most of the
world's poor are women, 70 percent of the world's illiterates are
women and 75 percent of the world's refugees are women."
</P>
<P>
Some 585,000 women, one every minute, die each year from
pregnancy- related causes, Toepfer said, stressing that most of
these deaths are preventable.
</P>
<P>
He said even today, women comprise the most vulnerable segment
of the human society.
</P>
<P>
They are confronted by a legacy of structures of inequality
that retards the pace of their personal development, and affords
them minimal chances to harness their full potential for
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The achievement of sustainable development is inextricably
bound up with the establishment of women's equality, Toepfer
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if developmental policies fail to take account of
women's roles, they risk both having negative impacts on the
natural resources which women rely on and failing to make use of
women's distinctive skills and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Transforming the condition of women is of critical importance
for achieving the end of hunger and a sustainable future of all
humanity, he said, stressing that it will take all of us, women
and men of the developed and developing worlds, to make this
situation right.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer urged that the empowerment of women must embrace all
aspects of their life: a new education, a new information system,
a new social orientation, and a revaluation of the cultural
attitudes and values relating to their political and economic
marginalization.
</P>
<P>
"All these in the long term will be our best guarantees of a
system that enhances the status of women," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must commit ourselves to create opportunities for women
where none now exist, and to implement strategies and take actions
that will finally enable women to gain full control of their lives
and destinies," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He called the governments, non-governmental organizations, the
private sector and the public in general to come together as full
and equal partners in improving the life quality of women.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urged to Widen Export Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
urged the Tanzanian government to reverse its poor performance in
international markets by increasing production and widening export
range, the African newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main problem with Tanzania's poor export record is that the
country' s production is inadequate to satisfy foreign orders and
the product range offered is narrow, said visiting EU Commissioner
for Development and Humanitarian Affairs Poul Nielson while giving
a public lecture at the University of Dar es Salaam on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Over a half of Tanzania's exports to the EU are still
concentrated in three products -- coffee, fish and tobacco, the
commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
He said although the EU has favorable trade terms for African,
Caribbean and Pacific countries, Tanzania could not benefit much
if there is little to export.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Tanzania's exports to the EU in the
last nine years had gone down by more than a half.
</P>
<P>
This shows that Tanzania has not made use of the potential
offered by the trade rules set under the Lome Convention, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, some critics criticized that the EU only paid lip
service to least developed countries including Tanzania, because
it is difficult for these countries to sell products in Europe
under the Lome Convention.
</P>
<P>
The EU was also accused of discouraging the Tanzanian
government to subsidize farmers whose contribution to export
earnings accounted for over 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the critics, the EU offers high subsidies to its
farmers every year, a protectionism which seriously hindered
exports from Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Cult Denied Organizational Status in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo metropolitan government on
Wednesday turned down an application for nonprofit organization (
NPO) status by the Japanese branch of China's outlawed Falun Gong
cult, the Kyodo news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is doubt over its assertion that it does not chiefly aim
at religious activities," Kyodo quoted a metropolitan official as
explaining.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to conclude definitely that it is a religion. It
seems to depend fully on its founder's thoughts, while its
doctrines include something supernatural -- such as healing
diseases with 'qigong' breathing techniques," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The metropolitan government rejected the application not only
because of doubt about the group's religiousness, but also because
it says it will allow only those who recognize and love the Falun
Gong practice to enter the group, metropolitan officials were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the rejection is that since the group's
balance sheet shows no income or expenditure, it is thought to be
unable to engage in any activities, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The group's application was filed to the metropolitan
government last November.
</P>
<P>
Only several applications for NPO status have been rejected in
Japan since a law allowing prefectural governments to give groups
such a status came into force in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, a group cannot obtain NPO status if it chiefly
aims at religious or political activities, or if it puts unfair
conditions on participation in the group.
</P>
<P>
If an NPO status is given, a group can register as a legal body,
making it easier to rent an office or open bank accounts, Kyodo
said.

TOKYO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell in Tokyo Wednesday,
dampened by Tuesday's plunge on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closed below 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First

<HEADLINE> On-Line Tourism Inspires China's E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- E-commerce is new to China, but
already the new technology is being used to promote tourism in the
country.
</P>
<P>
It would appear that e-commerce is entering the tourist sector
more easily than other markets, noted the Wuzhou E-Commerce
Network Co., the largest network company in China.
</P>
<P>
The company said this is because tourism involves less material
circulation and has huge potential.
</P>
<P>
Among those leading this trend, Wuzhou, launched by the
Shanghai Huachen Group, was a pioneer in bringing its tour
offerings on-line in China. This outfit now has business networks
connected with travel agencies and companies in the United States
and several European countries.
</P>
<P>
Major travel agencies in the southern province of Guangdong
have gone on-line, spending an average of one million yuan a year
for creating and maintaining websites.
</P>
<P>
Visitors to these websites obtain information on tourist spots
and can book reservations at the same time. Many on-line travel
agencies offer special discounts for group travel for any 10
subscribers who choose to take the same tour.
</P>
<P>
Tourist market specialists expect on-line tourist business to
accelerate China's international travel industry, and solve the
problems of cash settlement defaults in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The National Tourism Administration has a blueprint for
developing the industry over the next 20 years, which is aimed at
making China the number one tourist destination in Asia. The
number of overseas tourists to China may reach as many as 130-150
million by the year 2020, according to forecasts by the World
Tourism Organization.
</P>
<P>
Internet mavens predict that e-commerce will not be fully
integrated as part of the economy until the number of Internet
users in China exceeds 10 million. The country may reach this
target within this year, as the number of Internet subscribers
already reached 8.9 million by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports to ROK Makes Rapid Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua)-- China's exports to the Republic of
Korea has made rapid progress since the end of the financial
crisis in the ROK, the International Business Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted figures released by the ROK side as saying
that imports from China in 1999 were valued at 8.867 billion U.S.
dollars, up 36.8 percent from the previous year, and accounting
for 7.4 percent of ROK's total import value.
</P>
<P>
Information technology-related electronic products, including
semiconductor cells, computers, liquid-crystal display equipment
and wireless communications equipment, have so far been the
fastest growing sectors and leaped to the top of the export chart,
while farm produce and industrial materials have retained their
share in the ROK market, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
Electronic cells, farm produce and textiles were China's three
largest export categories, valued respectively at 1.6 billion, 748
million and 607 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Coal exports to the ROK rose 43.8 percent year-on-year in 1999
to reach 468 million U.S. dollars, a share of 23.8 percent of the
whole ROK market, second following Australia.
</P>
<P>
Computer exports to the ROK grew three-fold in 1999 to 333
million U.S. dollars, boasting an 8.6 percent proportion of ROK's
computer market. The U.S., Singapore, Japan and Malaysia led China
in shipping computers to the ROK.

Federation (ACWF) and Chen Muhua, honorary president of the ACWF,
participated in the event.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF started planting the "Centennial Woods for Chinese
Women" in the southeastern suburbs of Beijing today. The first
phase of planting will cover 13.3 hectares of land, and similar
activities will soon start across the country.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the ACWF and the State Administration of
Forestry launched the "March 8" Green Project, involving 120
million women each year all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, women attending the activity planted five
billion trees, covering a total area of more than 400 hectares
which helped improve the ecological environment and forestry
coverage in China.
</P>
<P>
Women representing 31 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities, female officers and soldiers from the Chinese
People's Liberation Army and armed police and women
representatives from government organizations attended the
activity in Beijing today.

<HEADLINE> CPC Should Always Represent Public's Fundamental Interests: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The key to running China well
lies with the build-up of the Communist Party of China (CPC) which
will continue to represent the fundamental interests of these
Chinese public, says a commentary to be carried Thursday in China'
s leading newspaper, the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The commentary quotes Chinese President Jiang Zemin as saying
that the CPC not only represents advanced productive forces but
also culturally and socially progressive trends and people's
fundamental interests.
</P>
<P>
It calls for earnest efforts to understand the president's
remarks and better serve the people through developing productive
forces, promoting and enriching the socialist culture with Chinese
characteristics, and constantly raising the standard of living, in
both material and cultural terms, of the general public.
</P>
<P>
"Only by representing the fundamental interests of the
broadest masses in China can we unite the masses as one ... and
overcome all sorts of difficulties and remain invincible," it says.
</P>
<P>
To do so, what is required is not just subjective wishes or
simple living and hard work, but also correct theory, policy and
an advanced political system that can mobilize the general public
to fight together for their common interests, and for the Party's
wisdom in representing the best interests of the masses, it says.
</P>
<P>
It calls for concentrated efforts from the Party in developing
the country's productive forces, creating more material and
cultural wealth and improving itself.
</P>
<P>
In order to better promote and safeguard the interests of the
general public, the Party must administer strictly, build itself
into a more vigorous and powerful Party through improving the its
work in all respects, the commentary says.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Reform Goals attainable If Policies Implemented: Premier Zhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The goals set by the three-year
government program on the reform of state-owned enterprises are
sure to be fulfilled, if all the relevant central policies,
especially those concerning the establishment of the modern
corporate system and transition of managerial mechanism, are
conscientiously implemented.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji made the remark this morning while joining a
panel discussion of deputies from northeastern Liaoning Province
at the current annual session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu praised the achievements scored in restructuring
local state-owned enterprises Liaoning, one of the oldest and
largest industrial bases in the country, where the enterprise
reform has gained momentum over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
It is inevitable that some factory employees have to be laid
off because of the closure of some long-term loss-makers, Zhu said,
urging local governments at different levels to help the layoffs
in strict accordance with the relevant state policies. All the
necessary funds for resettling the layoffs must be allocated on
time, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, special attention must be paid to strengthening
ideological work among the layoffs, as part of the effort to
maintain social stability, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To build and further improve a social security system
represents an urgent need in carrying out in-depth development of
the reform of the state-owned enterprises and a fundamental
measure for safeguarding social stability, Zhu noted, adding that
the related work should be placed at an important position and
must be done quickly and better still.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Principle Sure to Score Greater Success: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today the "one country, two systems" principle will score
greater successes, following its smooth implementation in Hong
Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark when attending a group discussion with
deputies from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to
the on-going Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC).
</P>
<P>
"Continued practice of the 'one country, two systems' principle
in Hong Kong and Macao will enrich our experience and the
principle will surely be implemented better and better," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Jiang said, Hong Kong has maintained a sound
situation since its return to the motherland, on July 1, 1997. The
implementation of the principles of "one country, two systems," "
Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong," and a high degree of
autonomy in Hong Kong has been successful and won worldwide
recognition.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Hong Kong has encountered quite a few
stormy waves and difficulties. But the SAR government, headed by
Tung Chee Hwa, has steamed through the hard times and made
outstanding achievements, with the support of the central
government and the concerted efforts by Hong Kong compatriots,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" concept should be taken in its
entirety, Jiang said. Within the main body of the state, the
People's Republic of China (PRC), the socialist system will stay,
while Hong Kong and Macao, as well as Taiwan after its return to
the motherland, are made special administrative regions to
continue practicing their existing capitalism.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that this is a long-term state policy.
Upholding the one-country principle is to ensure the unity of
sovereignty. No separatism will be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Ten years of implementation of the Basic Law of the PRC in Hong
Kong has fully demonstrated its vitality, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Everything that has been stipulated in the basic law must be
firmly implemented, Jiang said, adding this is the fundamental
guarantee for maintaining long-term stability and prosperity in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the Basic Law is a national law that
should be followed by Hong Kong as well as the whole country. He
urged inland departments and localities not to interfere in
matters covered by the autonomous power of the Hong Kong SAR
government.
</P>
<P>
But any issue that is related to the central government, as
defined by the basic law, must be handled strictly according to
the Constitution and the Basic Law, he said.

<HEADLINE> WTO Entry Expected to Promote China's Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's expected entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will pose challenges to the
country's agricultural sector but will also create opportunities,
according to some deputies attending the ongoing 3rd Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has promised to lower tariffs on some
farm products after China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Entry will probably affect some areas and part of agricultural
products in a short period of time, but in the long run will help
speed up the country's agricultural modernization," said NPC
deputy Mao Daru, who is also president of Agricultural University
of China.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector has witnessed great development in the
last two decades. And a number of farm products are in oversupply,
forcing farmers and agricultural departments to look for a new way
out.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers haven't gained much from good grain harvests in recent
years. That's why they are eager to know what to plant and what
not to. Lack of information and little contact with the outside
have become a bottleneck to local agricultural development," said
NPC deputy Duan Youlin from Hunan province, one of the country's
major grain producers.
</P>
<P>
The WTO accession will undoubtedly help alleviate the dilemma,
as China's exports of vegetables, fruits, and livestock and
aquatic products will increase, Mao Daru said, adding that the
influx of foreign farm produce might speed up the process of
phasing out unmarketable agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The central government encourages overseas investment to flow
into the agricultural sector in order to take in more technology
and management expertise, said vice minister of agriculture Wan
Baorui.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, preparations for the entry have begun. The
central government has decided to banish some unsellable farm
products from a price protection list, a sign that the government
is guiding farmers to readjust their planting structures prior to
China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"It is of great significance that Chinese farmers have gone a
step forward in linking domestic market to the rest of the world,"
said Mao Daru.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Gov't to Spend More in Next 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government will
spend an extra 2.8 billion NZ dollars (1.36 billion U.S. dollars)
over the next three years, thanks to a strong economic recovery
that will continue to run surplus.
</P>
<P>
The budget policy statement released by the country's Treasury
Wednesday afternoon shows the government will spend 117.1 billion
NZ dollars (56.8 billion U.S. dollars) in the three years from
June 2000, 2.8 billion NZ dollars higher than that planned by the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
The plans cover an extra 100 million NZ dollars (48.5 million U.
S. dollars) a year for regional development, a rise in pensions,
axing of the interest rate on student loans and more money for
health and education.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Treasury is tipping a growth of 3.6 percent in
the year from April 1999 to March 2000. The growth will continue
to rise slightly the next year but then dip to under three percent.
</P>
<P>
The 3.6 percent rise will be much better than the pre-election
forecast of a 2.5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The better forecasts mean the government coffers will be 3
billion NZ dollars (1.46 billion U.S. dollars) richer over the
next three years than was forecast by the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Latest Treasury forecasts show the government will take 120.2
billion NZ dollars (58.3 billion U.S. dollars) in income over the
next three years, compared to 117.1 billion NZ dollars (56.8
billion U.S.dollars) forecast last October. The surplus is tipped
to be 400 million NZ dollars (194 million U.S. dollars) in the
year from July 1999 to June 2000, followed by surplus of one
billion NZ dollars (485 million U.S. dollars), 1.9 billion NZ
dollars (921.5 million U.S.dollars), and 2.2 billion NZ dollars (1.
07 billion U.S. dollars) in the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Manila Ready Against Possible Recurrence of El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that it is putting in place several measures to shield
the agriculture sector from the possible recurrence of the El Nino
weather phenomenon during the last quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said in a statement that
the construction of irrigation facilities in food-producing areas
will be accelerated to prepare for the recurrence of the El Nino,
which first hit the country and triggered droughts in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Angara said the government is also stepping up its campaign
against smuggling to prevent the illegal entry of food products
that may unfairly compete with local produce.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical
Services Administration, according to Angara, has forecast a
possible return of the El Nino in the last three months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The country's agricultural output expanded by 6.49 percent in
1999, overshooting the 6 percent growth target and almost wiping
out the 7.18 percent production drop recorded in the El Nino and
La Nina-stricken year of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Uganda in Process of Developing HIV Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is in the process of
developing an appropriate HIV vaccine for the region in order to
further reduce its HIV infection rate and liberate its potentially
productive labor power.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Health Philip Byaruhanga told a
parliamentary committee on government assurances Tuesday that his
ministry was also planning to introduce tele-medicine centers in
major hospitals in the country, the New Vision daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the research work on the development of HIV
vaccine was still in the preliminary stages.
</P>
<P>
In collaboration with John Hopkins University and other
American universities, Uganda's Joint Clinical Research Center was
the leading center in the region regarding the development of the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is among the top African countries which suffer most
from the HIV/ AIDS. Since the first case of AIDS was reported in
the country in 1982, more than 500,000 people have died of the
epidemic. Now the HIV infection rate in Uganda has dropped from

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan women have been urged to
vote for the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) in the
forthcoming referendum to consolidate the gains they have so far
achieved.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark the International Women's Day, NRM
National Referendum Committee hailed the ruling party for
promoting gender sensitivity in all developmental activities,
including the Universal Primary Education program through which
girls are given equal consideration.
</P>
<P>
Gender equality is also provided under the Local Government Act
where a third of the seats are reserved for women at the district,
the lower council and the administrative unit down to the village
level, said NRM Vice Chairman Moses Kigongo.
</P>
<P>
Although there is a lot not attained, the record is clear that
everything is achievable where peace and unity exist, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that through the NRM system all power and authority
would be secured in the hands of the people.
</P>
<P>
Under Uganda's 1995 Constitution, a referendum should be held
in June this year to decide on the country's future political
systems. So far 10 political systems have picked up their forms
from the National Electoral Commission.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Life Expectancy to Be Reduced to 46 by AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Average life expectancy in Kenya
is projected to plummet to 46 years by 2005 because of AIDS,
Kenyan Planning Minister Gideon Ndambuki has said.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Wednesday's East African Standard newspaper as
saying that the present life expectancy of Kenyans is 50 years,
down from 64 years prior to the scourge.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks in a written speech read out at
Monday's seminar on the fight against HIV/AIDS at a hotel in the
capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Since the first AIDS case was found in Kenya in 1984, over one
million Kenyans have died of the killer disease and some two
million of them are living with the virus.
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS has contributed significantly to the rising numbers
of AIDS orphans, increasing levels of infant and child mortality
rates and decline in life expectancy," said Ndambuki.
</P>
<P>
He said children orphaned by AIDS increased from about 300,000
in 1995 to 860,000 in 2000, adding that the infant mortality
increased by 23 percent while the mortality rate of children aged
under five increased by 26 percent over the same period.

<HEADLINE> ACP, EU Conclude Partnership Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The African Caribbean and Pacific
(ACP) and the European Union (EU) countries have finally concluded
a new partnership agreement to be signed in two months time, the
Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an EU news release as saying that the
agreement was aimed at re-formulating relations between the two
groups on a modernized basis.
</P>
<P>
Under the new package, the EU would release 13.5 billion U.S.
dollars, while the European investment Bank would avail two
billion U.S. dollars, to enhance the Export Development Funds.
</P>
<P>
The funds, to which Zambia is a beneficiary, would be disbursed
as soon as the agreement is ratified by all the 71 member ACP
Parliaments, the release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that "the terms of agreement, together with the new
package, have been agreed upon by both parties and the only
remaining aspect is the ratification before finally signing."
</P>
<P>
The terms of agreement which followed about 18 months of
intensive deliberations are focused on three areas to determine
the size of the package.
</P>
<P>
The areas include political pillar, development strategy and
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade cooperation component of the agreement
stipulates that the ACP and EU states would continue to negotiate

<HEADLINE> Women Should be Given More Power on Food Control: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Women should be given more
control over food and other aid as well as greater means to become
self-sufficient in international relief efforts, a U.N. official
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here on the eve of the International Women's Day,
World Food Program (WFP) Representative and Country Director in
Tanzania Irene Lacy said whenever possible, food aid should be put
directly into the hands of a woman because she would ensure that
whatever food she got would be consumed in her household rather
than sold or traded.
</P>
<P>
Women, who are the majority of farmers and food-gatherers in
many developing countries, are also recognized as having a crucial
role to play in the recovery phase of an emergency, she was quoted
by Wednesday's Guardian newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Income in the hands of women contributed more to household food
security and child nutrition than income controlled by men, she
said.
</P>
<P>
That is the reason why investing in women can improve family
food security, she said, adding that in many humanitarian crises,
women and children constitute the majority of those threatened by
hunger and starvation.
</P>
<P>
According to Lacy, WFP was committed to empowering poor and
vulnerable women through the use of food aid. Every year the
organization would give over half of its food aid to women to
distribute, manage and use as the route to new skills, education
and job training.

<HEADLINE> Better Box Office, Lower Costs for Hollywood Movies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. box office hit a
record high in 1999 while the average price for producing and
marketing a movie declined, said the Motion Picture Association of
America (MPAA) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. theater owners hauled in 7.5 billion dollars at the
domestic box office despite slightly fewer admissions, MPAA
President Jack Valenti said in Los Angeles at the eve of the
theater industry's annual ShoWest convention in Las Vegas on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. box office in 1998 was 6.95 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Production costs for major Hollywood movies declined for the
second year in a row and marketing expenses dropped for the first
time in two decades.
</P>
<P>
Average production costs fell to 51.5 million dollars in 1999,
2.3 percent lower than in 1998 and 3.6 percent lower than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Before 1998, costs had spiraled upward every year since the
early 1970s as special-effects-laden blockbusters became more
common, and top star salaries swelled to 20 million dollars or
more per movie.
</P>
<P>
Marketing cost studios about 24.5 million dollars a title in
1999, down 780,000 dollars from the previous year. Combined, the
average expense for making and marketing a movie was 76 million
dollars in 1999, 2 million dollars lower from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Valenti said one of the reasons behind the bullish box office
performance last year is the fact that the average ticket price
across the country rose to 5.08 dollars in 1999 from 4.70 dollars
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the huge success of "Titanic" in 1998, when the
blockbuster sold over 600 million dollars worth of tickets
domestically, for a slight drop in admissions last year. The
industry saw ticketed admissions in the United States fall to 1.
465 billion in 1999 from 1.48 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The MPAA members include top Hollywood studios such as Warner
Bros., Paramount, 20th Century Fox and cartoon giant Walt Disney.

TOKYO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A Tokyo subway train derailed
Wednesday morning from a track above ground and collided with
another train running on the opposition track, killing three
passengers and injuring 31 others, police said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Macao's Future More Stable, Prosperous: Jiang Zemin (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"In observing and reviewing the situation in Macao, we should
bear in mind four strong beliefs: belief in the correctness of
Deng Xiaoping's "one country, two systems" principle; belief in
the ability of Macao compatriots to govern Macao well; belief in
the ability of the Macao SAR government to properly deal with any
situation; and belief in the provision of a strong backing by its
motherland for the maintenance of prosperity and stability in
Macao," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The central government will unswervingly carry out the
principle of "one country, two systems", "Macao people governing
Macao", and a high-degree of autonomy, as well as the Macao SAR
Basic Law, and go all out to support the work of the Macao SAR
government headed by Edmund Ho Hau Wah, support its efforts to
maintain social stability and develop economy and culture, Jiang
said, noting that Macao will have a more stable and prosperous
future.
</P>
<P>
The central government has always shown concern for Macao's
public security, which has improved remarkably since its return
thanks to the Macao SAR government's efficient administration, a
sign that the Macao SAR government is capable of doing a good job
in this regard, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government will do all it can to support the Macao
SAR government in its efforts to improve Macao's public security,
which concerns the very interests of Macao people in general,
Macao's tourist industry or even its economic development as a
whole, as well as its international image, Jiang said, stressing
that it matters greatly and that efforts must be made to well
tackle the problem in a bid to make Macao a really safe and stable
society.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on the Macao NPC deputies to exercise their rights
as NPC deputies, take an active part in administering state
affairs, and propose advice and suggestions for the motherland's
development.

hectares of trees or grass will be planted, so that a total of 2.6
million hectares of forest and grass will be added to the whole
province, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan began a natural forest protection program in 1998,
banning timber cutting in 73 of the counties in the province. And
its eco-environment as well as that of the upper reaches along the
Yangtze, China's longest river, has improved accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province will also initiate its river and lake
pollution control and soil erosion projects, in a bid to create a
still better eco-system for implementing the revitalize-the-west
strategy, the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's "Press Conference" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8, (Xinhua) -- "A question please, President
Jiang. If the two sides of the Taiwan Straits go to war, isn't it
'cooking' too hard?" a reporter shouted as Chinese President Jiang
Zemin appeared this morning in the Hong Kong Room of the Great
Hall of the People to join Hong Kong deputies to the National
People's Congress for a group discussion.
</P>
<P>
"You quote Cao Zhi (a poet who lived more than 1,700 years ago),
" said Jiang, who promptly recited a poem of Cao Zhi's from which
the term "cooking hard" comes. The poem can be roughly translated
as: "Dry bean stalks are burned to cook the beans, and the beans
are crying in the wok. Originally, both grow from the same root,
why cook so hard?"
</P>
<P>
Jiang continued: "If some people go about creating 'Taiwan
independence,' leading to a situation akin to 'why cook so hard',
that is something they have created. 'Originally, both grow from
the same root,' originally there is only one China, why go about
creating 'Taiwan independence'?"
</P>
<P>
Applause came from Hong Kong deputies and reporters present.
</P>
<P>
Another reporter asked: On the Taiwan question, is China afraid
of interference from foreign forces?
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: "The Chinese people have never been afraid of
bluffs."
</P>
<P>
There was applause once more.
</P>
<P>
Yet another reporter asked: "President Jiang, are you willing
to go to Taiwan?"
</P>
<P>
"Is there a need to ask? Of course, I'm willing to go," Jiang
said. "But at the present moment when someone is advocating a 'two-
state' theory, how can I go there?"
</P>
<P>
"It's like a press conference today," Jiang said with a smile.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Signs Bill on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Wednesday signed the bill ratifying ILO (International Labor
Organization) Convention No.182 into law.
</P>
<P>
ILO Convention No. 182 of 1999 on the Worst Forms of Child
Labor categorizes the following as the "worst" forms of child
labor: contemporary ways of slavery, prostitution and other
illicit activities, recruitment of children for use in armed
conflict and hazardous work which damages the child's health,
safety or morals.
</P>
<P>
The president told reporters that in view of the number of
children in the country, the signing is of special importance.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that in his country there are still many
children working in an inhuman manner which is against the
convention.
</P>
<P>
The bill to ratify Convention No.182 was passed by Indonesia's
House of Representatives on March 1.
</P>
<P>
On the potentials of Indonesia in implementing ILO core
conventions, ILO Executive Director Kari Tapiola said ILO did not
expect Indonesia to be able to accomplish their goals in a short
time.
</P>
<P>
"It is unrealistic to say that states can eliminate the worst
forms of child labour immediately. We cannot eliminate them
immediately, but we can immediately start actions to eliminate
them, like through ratifying the conventions like Indonesia did,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The signing made Indonesia the first state in the Asia-Pacific
region and the sixth in the world to have accepted ILO's eight
core conventions alongside Botswana, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia
and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Previously in June last year, Indonesia also seven of the ILO's
core conventions, the first state to have done so in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Reach Emergency Level in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The fires raging in a number of
forests in Sumatera and Kalimantan islands have reached the
emergency level, State Minister for Environment Soni Keraf said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the data we have, there are already 200-300 hot
spots(in the two islands)," Keraf told reporters before attending
a cabinet meeting at the presidential office here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency reported that Pekanbaru, capital of Riau
province in Sumatera island, is blanketed in thick haze,
especially during mornings.
</P>
<P>
The local government recently said it had been monitoring more
than 100 hot spots across the province.
</P>
<P>
In Dumai district, 200 kilometers north of Pekanbaru, haze
disrupted the 6th ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
Scouting Goodwill Camp which was attended by only two of the 10
ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
Only 2,294 boy and girl scouts joined the camp, 150 from
Malaysia and the rest from Indonesia, Antara reported.
</P>
<P>
Smoke pollution from illegal land-clearing fires in Indonesia
has become an annual problem during the region's mid-year dry
season.
</P>
<P>
The situation was disastrous in 1997, when thick haze caused
health problems and hurt tourism in Singapore and parts of
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 fires destroyed about 5 million hectares of forest in
the country with an economic lose of about 4 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> 14 COMESA Members in the Process of Reducing Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Only 14 out of the 21 Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) member states are
reducing their tariffs toward zero rate by October 31, 2000,
according to a report by the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha as
saying that Swaziland and Namibia would not reduce their tariffs
because they belong to the Southern African Customs Union.
However, he did not name the countries that were reducing their
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
COMESA member states are expected to reduce their tariffs to
zero by October 31 this year when the Free Trade Area agreement
becomes effective.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, COMESA is investing heavily in computerizing various
customs department of individual member states to reduce delays by
various departments in giving tax rebates to the business
community.
</P>
<P>
In the past, clearing took so many days, causing a lot of
problems to the business community. These delays have since
prompted the need to invest in the customs department, said
Mwencha in an interview with the press.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we need to harmonize the cost of transportation
within member countries as the distance from Johannesburg to the
sea is the same as from Lusaka to the sea, and from Johannesburg
to Durban the same as from Lusaka to Dar-es-salaam."
</P>
<P>
"If we harmonize the costs, it will be like one is transporting
within the country and it will be cheaper that way," he said.

<HEADLINE> 7,000 Zambians Displaced by Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Zambians have been
displaced by devastating floods, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 people have been left homeless in Luangwa district,
Eastern Province, after the opening of the Kariba Dam spillway
gates on the Lower Zambezi River, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that villages and lodges along the river have
been submerged, with hundreds of livestock drowned and crops
washed away.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Information and Broadcasting Deputy Minister
Fidelis Mando as saying that most part of Luangwa district have
become inaccessible because of the roads destroyed by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The main road to Luangwa was cut off about 200 kilometers from
the river confluence and traffic has to divert to reach the civic
center, Mando said.
</P>
<P>
He said the water pump in the area has been rendered useless
and people were compelled to draw water from the floods.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is doing everything possible to save
people from drowning and to avert the looming hunger in the
affected areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary evaluations indicate that about 30 tons of relief
food is needed for between six and seven thousand people facing
starvation.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Journal Criticized for Conducting Oscar Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) responsible for selecting Oscar awards
Tuesday criticized the Wall Street Journal, which allegedly
attempted to forecast this year's winners by conducting a poll of
academy members.
</P>
<P>
"It just spoils the fun of it," said AMPAS spokesman John
Pavlik. "The Academy Awards are important to the people who win,
and they're important to the people who don't win, but it's not
like electing a president, and part of the fun of it is waiting
until they open the envelopes to see who wins."
</P>
<P>
Pavlik said AMPAS President Robert Rehme sent a letter to all 5,
600 voting members last week, urging them not to chat with the
press about how they intend to fill out their ballots.
</P>
<P>
"In the past few days, we've had indications that someone
claiming to be a journalist has been attempting to poll a wide
cross-section of academy members about how they intend to vote on
this year's awards," Rehme wrote in the letter dated on February
25.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street Journal spokesman Richard Tofel said the newspaper
as a matter of policy did not comment on "stories that we have not
published or may or may not publish in the future."
</P>
<P>
The Oscar Awards will be handed out on March 26 with the ABC
network as the only authorized outlet for live-broadcasting the
annual event.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Cut Coal Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 8 (Xinhua)-- China will cut coal output by 160
million tons to less than 900 million tons this year, the level
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianzheng, deputy director of the State Administration of
Coal Industry, said the ministry will shut down 800 small mines
and 18,000 smaller village-owned mines with a total annual
production capacity of 130 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, major state coal mines will shrink their
output by 30 million tons in 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's coal output had been rising since the 1950s and
surpassed the one billion ton mark in 1989. But market demand for
coal has been decreasing, causing losses to many coal mines, and
the country began reducing production three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Future More Stable, Prosperous: Jiang Zemin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin urged Macao
people to make concerted efforts to turn the wish of "a better
Macao for tomorrow" into reality.
</P>
<P>
Jiang did this here today when attending a group discussion
with deputies from the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), in session here
since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After Macao's return to the motherland, people there can not
only take care of their own affairs, but also elect their
representatives to the NPC, the country's top legislature, to
exercise the right to participate in the administration of state
affairs, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
It is a big event for Macao to form its first independent NPC
delegation to attend the NPC session and have a role in running
state affairs according to law, he said, calling it an embodiment
of the "one country, two systems" principle and the status of
Macao compatriots as masters of their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of the great contributions Macao compatriots
made to Macao's return and the establishment of the Macao SAR. "
The overall situation is good in Macao since its return three
months ago. The principle of 'one country, two systems', 'Macao
people governing Macao' and a high-degree of autonomy, as well as
the Macao SAR Basic Law, have been implemented to the letter,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Operation of the Macao SAR government headed by Edmund Ho Hau
Wah has been going on smoothly, and Macao compatriots in general
are highly enthusiastic about participating in administering Macao
social affairs and economic construction. The Macao SAR government
has had a good beginning, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return is the inevitable consequence of a strong China,
which underwent hardships and was invaded and bullied repeatedly
by world powers since the Opium War. "China has achieved
remarkable accomplishments under the leadership the Communist
Party of China since New China was founded in 1949, and in
particular since reform and implementation of an open policy,"
Jiang said, adding that China will grow stronger as the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics goes on, and that
Hong Kong and Macao will also enjoy a better future.

<HEADLINE> Infectious Diseases Major Killers in Nepal: Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in Nepal
have been affected by the increasing number of diseases caused by
water, food and various kinds of infections, according to health
officers who gathered here Monday for a ten-day workshop on
research epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
The officers said at the workshop that the most pervasive
infectious disease in Nepal is gastro-enteritis, which affects 100,
000 people and cost lives of 3,000 to 5,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
Japanese encephalitis affects 3,000 people and 500 die of it
each year, while Kala-azar affects about 1,500 people and caused
many deaths.
</P>
<P>
The officers believe the spread of infectious diseases are
caused by lack of proper health services, safe drinking water and
sanitation in rural areas of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The ten-day workshop is focusing on mobilizing manpower in the
health sector towards undertaking study and research into
infectious diseases and finding effective methods to prevent and
cure them.
</P>
<P>
Attending the workshop are 19 medical officers, public health
officers and statistics officers from Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai To Turn More Farmland into Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Province in northwest China
plans to turn 364,000 ha of farmland into forests and grassland in
the next 10 years amid a national drive to develop western China.
</P>
<P>
It also will also plant trees and grass on 728,000 ha of barren
mountains and wasteland during the 10-year period, according to
local officials.
</P>
<P>
The plateau province is the source of China's three major
rivers, the Yangtze, the Yellow, and the Lancang, and it plays an
important role in maintaining ecological balance and sustainable
development along the drainage areas of the three rivers.
</P>
<P>
But excessive reclamation and logging in the past caused
serious soil erosion in the province, where some 330,000 square
kilometers of land were eroded, 46 percent of the province's total
area.
</P>
<P>
As the initial phase of the greening project, Qinghai plans to
turn 18,000 ha of farmland into forests this year and plant trees
and grass over 38,000 ha of barren mountains and wasteland.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has worked out a series of measures
to support the farmland-to-forests project, including compensation
for farmers who give up their lands.
</P>
<P>
Related regulations on protecting local ecological conditions
are also being discussed, provincial government officials added.

<HEADLINE> Endangered Animals and Plants Thrive in Central China Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese botanist and zoologist
researchers at the Shennongjia State Nature Reserve in central
China have found that many rare plants and animals believed to be
on the verge of extinction elsewhere are thriving at their reserve.
</P>
<P>
Hu Hongxing, a biologist with Wuhan University, who has been
working at the reserve for 20 years, told Xinhua he has seen
several rare species not indigenous to the region but growing well
there.
</P>
<P>
He said that several endangered plants and animals from north
and south China have gradually adapted themselves to the local
thick virgin forest.
</P>
<P>
For example, otistards, a migratory bird belonging to the
northern Mongolian grasslands, have settled in the migrating
stopover, he noted, adding that the bird disappeared from its
original habitat a decade ago, and has been listed among first-
level endangered species by the state.
</P>
<P>
There are other animals that have chosen to live here, such as
the gorsachius magnificus, a bird that was thought to be extinct
10 years ago, and the bufo stejnegeri, an ancient toad that used
to live only in the far northeast.
</P>
<P>
Botanists also reportedly have found other species in the humid
nature reserve, including some sub-frigid plants.
</P>
<P>
Located at a middle latitude, Shennongjia served as a vital
passage way for migrating animals, and is considered to have been
a "Noah's Ark" for animals and plants in the glacial period some 2.
5 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
With abundant rain and water resources, the 70,000 hectare
nature reserve is a shelter for 60 animal species under state
first-level protection and 50 kinds of rare and endangered plant
species.
</P>
<P>
To better protect this bio-diversity, the Chinese central
government has approved a resettlement project to relocate some 10,
000 farmers out of the region to provide more space for the
reserve's wildlife.

<HEADLINE> Standard Chinese Dialect Promoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Putonghua, or standard Chinese,
also known as Mandarin, and simplified Chinese characters, are
expected to be used in schools nationwide by 2010, according to a
notice issued recently by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the
State Language Work Committee recently.
</P>
<P>
An official from the MOE said that Putonghua will become the
teaching language in schools and kindergartens by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to the notice, schools in economically advanced areas
should try to achieve this goal ahead of the schedule, and
economically retarded areas can somehow postpone the deadline, but
no later than 2010.
</P>
<P>
Putonghua is also now part of the examinations taken to qualify
and employ teachers around the country. The MOE and the State
Language Work Committee said teachers should have the ability to
use standard Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Speaking Putonghua, using standard simplified Chinese
characters, and improving language ability are all important
components of a quality education," the notice says.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Commentary on Hu Changqing Case (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper the
People's Daily hails the execution of a corrupt high-ranking
official today, saying that in socialist China no one is above the
law.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary to be published Thursday, the paper says that
the handling of the case of Hu Changqing has shown that the CPC
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core is administering the Party
strictly, managing state affairs according to law, and
undeviating in its anti-corruption struggle.
</P>
<P>
Hu Changqing, a former deputy governor of Jiangxi Province in
east China, was executed earlier today after China's Supreme
People's Court ordered the Intermediate People's Court of Nanchang
City in Jiangxi Province to carry out the death sentence handed
down by the local court on February 15.
</P>
<P>
Hu was sentenced to death by the local court at the first
trial on charges of accepting 5.44 million yuan (655,000 U.S.
dollars) worth of bribes, possessing 1.61 million yuan (193,000 U.
S. dollars) worth of property from unidentified sources, and
giving 80,000 yuan (9,638 U.S. dollars) in bribes to others to
further his career.
</P>
<P>
The commentary by the paper, the mouthpiece of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), describes Hu Changqing as "the highest-
ranking official executed since New China was founded" in 1949,
adding that the case is an extremely serious one involving
economic crimes and has had a very bad influence on Chinese
society.
</P>
<P>
"For such a flagrant criminal, only the death penalty is
sufficient to safeguard national law, satisfy popular indignation,
rectify the Party work style, and fight against corruption," the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It urges members and cadres of the Communist Party of China,
especially medium- and high-ranking officials, to draw lessons
from the case of Hu Changqing, and not be attracted by all sorts
of temptations during reform and opening to the outside world and
the creation of a market economy.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 800 Nepal-bound cargo
containers have been stranded in Calcutta of India in the last two
weeks, causing a loss of over 5 million rupees (about 70,000 U.S.
dollars) to the Nepali importers.
</P>
<P>
The transit deadlock, which started on February 21 when over
200 Indian transporters waged a strike demanding hike in the
transportation fare, has already incurred a loss of over 5 million
rupees on the importers in the form of demurrage charge, according
to Nepal Foreign Trade Association (NFTA).
</P>
<P>
What's worse, "it has started to cause shortage in the supply
of industrial raw materials" in Nepal and "situation could grow
worse if the deadlock is not resolved within a few days," said
Akhil Chapagain, vice president of NFTA.
</P>
<P>
Chapagain said the stalemate is worsening, as there is still
confusion as to who is the responsible body to hold dialogue on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Calcutta port is the main transit port for Nepali importers
and exporters.

<HEADLINE> Plant Ordered Closed Following Gas Leak in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A petrochemicals plant in Thailand
's eastern province of Rayong was ordered closed for a month
following Monday night's toxic gas leak, the Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The shut-down was ordered to allow for maintenance work, a
manager of the industrial estate, which houses the plant, said,
adding that the situation is now under control. Rayong is about
200 kilometers east of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
One of the company's vice president was quoted as saying that
the medical bills of the 200 people poisoned by the leak would be
covered. The sickened people include workers of the plant and
residents of a nearby village.
</P>
<P>
The company and Japanese experts are investigating the leak of
carbonyl chloride from a ruptured hose, he said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted the company lacked adequate safety mechanism, but
pledged that detector and gas monitoring system and an interlock
for curtaining gas diffusion would be installed.
</P>
<P>
The plant is a joint venture between a Thai company and
Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co of Japan. It started producing
polycarbonate in March, 1998, with an annual capacity of 50,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The leak lasted for 40 minutes after a power blackout occurred
in the plant. At least one worker of the plant is still in
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
An official of the National Safety Council said the plant has a
scrubber to absorb gas before it releases oxygen into the air,
however, the rupture allowed too much gas to leak into the
scrubber and the gas spread, causing a health hazard in the nearby
communities.
</P>
<P>
Carbonyl chloride is an intermediate chemical used for
producing polycarbonate plastic, the good grade plastic used for
making compact disks, plastic equipment in laboratory and
electronic appliances.
</P>
<P>
Carbonyl chloride is a kind of poison gas and can be used in
industry under stringent controls. It is also used in the
production of chemical weapons and was first used during the World
War One by the Germans in 1915, when it was commonly known as
phosgene.
</P>
<P>
But an official of the pollution control department said the
real problem was that the plant is too close to residential areas.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rain Causes Flooding in Australia's NSW </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rain had caused flash
flooding on the mid-north coast of the New South Wales (NSW) state
in southeast Australia on Wednesday, emergency services said.
</P>
<P>
The State Emergency Service (SES) said its volunteers had been
helping residents in that area.
</P>
<P>
"About 75 residents called for help when water threatened their
homes and roofs started to leak due to the heavy rain," the SES
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The weather was easing, but the SES said it would continue to
keep a watch on drains, creeks and rivers in the area.
</P>
<P>
SES spokesman Pat Clague said the problem so far had been
restricted to sandbagging and protecting leaking roofs.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the NSW Agriculture Department also said the state
's western division had received "another bucketing" of 35
millimeters of rain in the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Places which were starting to recover from the last downpour
two weeks ago had been put back two weeks, they said.
</P>
<P>
SES western division spokesman Graeme Wellings said about 10
properties in the area were once again isolated by rising flood
waters.
</P>
<P>
"They'll be stuck until it stops raining and the road dries up,
" Wellings said.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters had dropped food, mail and medical supplies to
those properties, he said.

<HEADLINE> Electricity Use in Thailand Back to Pre-Crisis Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Electricity consumption in
Thailand has returned to the pre-crisis level after eight
consecutive months of growth in demand, the Nation newspaper
Wednesday quoted the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
NEPO said that Thailand's energy demand has resumed growth
since July last year and the strongest growth was recorded in the
first two month of this year.
</P>
<P>
In January and February this year, energy demands increased 9.
59 percent and 9.47 percent respectively from the same period last
year, according to NEPO's latest figures.
</P>
<P>
February's demand reached 14,105 megawatts, returning to the
pre-crisis level of peak electricity demand recorded in February
1997.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen said that the sharp increase in electricity
demand and production index reported during the past few months
have certainly confirmed the broad recovery of the real sector.
</P>
<P>
NEPO's figures showed that fabricated metal, textile, paper and
rubber are among industries that registered sharpest growth in
electricity demand.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum-related and petrochemical demand is slowly recovering,
while demand from commercial users is beginning to recover, NEPO
said.
</P>
<P>
Household consumption, which dropped at a slower rate than
other sectors during the crisis, has shown good signs and is
recovering slowly, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
As by region, Bangkok and suburban Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan
provinces are lagging behind the provincial areas in terms of
electricity demand, said NEPO.
</P>
<P>
The high electricity growth so far this year came despite
relatively cooler weather and the recent increase in electricity
tariff.

<HEADLINE> Barak-Arafat Tuesday Summit "Constructive" to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ended their "
constructive" summit late Tuesday night with an agreement to
resume efforts to resolve the problems that have led to the
breakdown of peace talks a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed after more than two hours of talks to
make efforts to try to solve the problems in the coming days, said
a statement issued Wednesday by Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israel Radio reported that Barak would offer a "
confidence-building package" in a bid to revive the peace talks,
which was suspended indefinitely by Arafat last month.
</P>
<P>
It said the proposals would include release of more Palestinian
prisoners and a promise to open a northern safe passage between
Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The surprise summit between Barak and Arafat started at around
9:30 p.m. local time (1930 GMT) at an undisclosed location in
central Israel, with the reported presence of Palestinian
Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei and Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East Special Coordinator Dennis Ross, who was said
to attend the meeting, failed to appear. Palestinian officials
said Ross would meet Arafat after the summit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy was back in the region earlier Tuesday for more
shuttle diplomacy trying to push forward peace talks between
Israel and its Arab neighbors in a second attempt in less than two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday summit followed Arafat's strong statement earlier
Tuesday that he would declare an independent Palestinian state in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip this year with or without a peace
deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In February talks to frame a final peace deal they have agreed
to try to strike by September 13, Israel and Palestine failed to
resolve differences over an interim transfer of 6.1 percent more
Israeli-occupied land in the West Bank to Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Barak conveyed through Ross to the Palestinians an
offer identifying 10 percent of land from which Palestinians could
select 6.1 percent for the handover. The offer, however, was
rejected by Palestinians since it excludes the villages around
Jerusalem that they have been demanding.
</P>
<P>
Future status of the villages remains one of the hardest issues
to be settled before a final peace deal between Israel and
Palestine could be reached.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Leaders Emphasizes Women's Peace Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan leaders said Wednesday
in their message on International Women's Day that women have a
great role to play in achieving peace in the war-torn island
country.
</P>
<P>
President Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga said it was timely that
the theme for this year was Woman and Peace under the perspective
of an ever changing world.
</P>
<P>
The theme is "an honor bestowed on the women dedicated for the
cause of peace and an indication of focusing greater attention on
women who become tragically helpless destitutes to the ongoing war
in Sri Lanka," she said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike made an urgent appeal
in the name of motherhood to all Sri Lankan people to exert all
efforts to end the war and restore peace.
</P>
<P>
"Let us determine to contribute our mite to fulfill the mission
of our era by ending this meaningless war that has engulfed all of
us," she said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Women's affairs Hema Ratnayake said that women and
children had become the biggest victims of the ethnic war which
has plagued the nation since 1983.
</P>
<P>
She said there was a dire need for women to get involved in the
peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the percentage of widows have risen to
23 percent, mainly due to the ongoing civil war between government
troops and Tamil Tiger rebels who demand a separate Tamil homeland
in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Jaffna peninsula alone there were as many as 18,
657 widows and an even higher number who have lost their children
in the war, she added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Hold Fresh Senate Election in Four Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Fresh senate elections are
expected to be called in four provinces amid indications of
widespread fraud in Saturday's polling, the Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The election commission was quoted as saying that indications
of cheating warranted new contests in four provinces, and delays
in vote-counting in some provinces had forced a delay in the
announcement of the results by another day.
</P>
<P>
Evidence gathered so far indicated that results from at least
10 provinces would be withheld pending examination, Chaisri
Pongpat, deputy director for investigation, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Commissioners were considering whether the new contests should
be held at a provincial level or in specific localities, he said,
but the evidence of fraud was compelling.
</P>
<P>
Delays in counting and complaints of widespread fraud have
hampered an early announcement of the results.
</P>
<P>
Pollwatch, an independent watchdog, Tuesday submitted
confidential reports about irregularities against 17 winners in 12
provinces to a commissioner in charge of investigations.
</P>
<P>
The election commission said it would nullify the victory of
any winners found guilty of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Somchai Srisuthiyakorn, the Pollwatch secretary-general, said
Pollwatch has both documentary evidence and witnesses.
Investigation, however, must be conducted secretly for the safety
of the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The commission had already filed criminal charges against 34
people in 20 provinces for alleged vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
Police colonel Chaisri said most were canvassers but he was
confident they could be linked to winners. "It's too soon for
cheats to think they can get away with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the 34 cases allegedly involved six top-scoring winners,
and the commission is also working hard on 53 other cases.
</P>
<P>
Complaints were pouring in, with reports of irregularities
already from more than 60 provinces.
</P>
<P>
Sawat Chotepanich, a commissioner in charge of investigations,
said the commission will try to announce the results from 12 fraud-
free provinces Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed the announcements of the results would be
completed by March 21, when the present senate's term ends.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Gothom Arya was quoted as saying that it is better
to check out all complaints than to rush to announce the results.
</P>
<P>
Some new elections were inevitable, he said, and voters would
be given a week to prepare to return to the polls.
</P>
<P>
Thailand held the first senate election Saturday since the
country adopted constitutional rule 68 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Because the new senate will be entitled with power to screen
legislation proposed by the government, question leaders and other
officials and remove corrupt office holders, including the prime
minister, the contests among 1,521 candidates for 200 senate seats
were quite fierce.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor Bill Endorsed in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepali parliament endorsed a
child labor bill Monday in its winter session that convened on
March 1, The Kathmandu Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Child Labor Prohibition and Control Bill was endorsed by a
majority of votes in the House of Representatives. The bill had
been passed on to a parliamentary committee during the last
session and necessary amendments were made.
</P>
<P>
The bill which will govern and define child labor is to
prohibit use of child labor in hazardous working conditions like
that in factories and mines.
</P>
<P>
Before the bill can be transformed into a law, it has to be
discussed in the National Assembly and then get the seal of
approval from King Birendra.
</P>
<P>
Such a law had been much awaited since many child rights
activists demanded protection for children being used as cheap
labor force depriving them of their right to education.
</P>
<P>
But due to lack of proper laws and definition of child labor,
the authorities have not been able to do much to punish the people
involved in exploiting children.
</P>
<P>
Child laborers are estimated to be at least 2.6 million in
Nepal, engaged mainly in agricultural sector, carpet industry,
service and sales.

<HEADLINE> Australian Women Play Essential Role in Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Women accounted for 32 percent of
farmers in Australia, contributed billions of Australian dollars
to the economy and were pivotal in keeping farms going in tough
times, the National Farmers' Federation (NFF) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued to mark International Women's Day, NFF
Executive Director Wendy Craik said 70,000 women defined
themselves as farmers or farm managers, and their monetary
contribution in 1995/96 reached nearly 14 billion Australian
dollars (9.24 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics figures
released in 1998 showed women had an essential role in maintaining
farms in times of drought and low commodity prices, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Women also have enormous potential to offer in decision-making
across all agricultural industries in Australia," Craik said.
</P>
<P>
"As well, it would be good to see more women assuming leading
positions at senior levels of farm organizations," she said.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush March to Presidential Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
swept his rival Bill Bradley toward the Democratic nomination
while Texas Governor George W. Bush is winning more than his rival
Arizona Senator John McCain in the Republican primaries and
caucuses on "Super Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
Gore has won the Democratic primaries and caucuses in New York,
Georgia, Vermont, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland,
Maine, Rhode Island and Missouri, according to projections from
the TV networks.
</P>
<P>
Bradley has not won in any state so far even in the state of
Missouri, where he was born and raised.
</P>
<P>
Bush, the eldest son of former President George Bush, beat
McCain in Georgia, Ohio, Maryland, Maine and Missouri while McCain
won in Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
Gore, appearing before supporters in his home town, Nashville,
Tenn., said, "Tonight I salute Bill Bradley."
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the Republicans on banning the so-called
soft money.
</P>
<P>
"I will challenge the Republican nominee to join with me right
now in banning so-called soft money and then going even further to
eliminate all of the 30-second and 60-second radio and TV ads and
instead debate twice a week as soon as the nominees of the parties
are known, every week until the election, a separate issue each
time," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, McCain expressed his thanks for the "great
support" from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that this trend of support will continue on
the West Coast and I look forward to all the results as they
continue to come in," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that he did
not consider himself as "presumptive nominee." "I consider myself
a huge step closer and will work hard to secure the nomination."
</P>
<P>
Gore and Bradley were competing for 1,315 delegates to the
Democratic Convention in Los Angeles in August, more than half of
the 2,170 needed for the presidential nomination. Gore began the
day with 482 delegates to 57 for his rival.
</P>
<P>
At stake Tuesday were 613 delegates, more than half the total 1,
034 delegates needed to obtain the Republican presidential
nomination at the convention in the coming summer.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed, 37 Others Wounded in Tokyo Subway Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The collision occurred at 9:10 a.m. (local time) about 100
meters northeast of Nakameguro Station in Tokyo's Meguro Ward, on
the Hibiya Line, police said.
</P>
<P>
Among the wounded, seven received serious injuries,
firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are yet to determine the cause of the crash and
identify those killed, a man and a woman, police said.
</P>
<P>
According to police, the tail car of the southbound eight-car
train, which was about to arrive at the terminal station on the
line, derailed just after emerging from a tunnel, and hit some
cars belonging to the northbound eight-car train on the opposite
track.
</P>
<P>
The derailed train was carrying about 240 passengers, while the
other was packed with 1,300 commuters.
</P>
<P>
The collision ripped off part of the side of the derailed train
and resulted in the suspension of part of the line's operations,
police said.
</P>
<P>
An initial report said an explosion occurred in one of the
trains, but Tadao Ando, head of Japan's Cabinet Office for
National Security Affairs and Crisis Management, ruled out the
possibility that a crime caused the collision.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese cabinet set up a task force at the prime minister'
s official residence shortly after the crash to deal with the
incident, government officials said.

<HEADLINE> Boston Bruins Defenceman Charged with Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Vancouver Crown counsel Tuesday
decided to charge Boston Bruins defenceman Mary McSorley with
assault at an NHL game against the Vancouver Canucks last month.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to charge Mr. McSorley was made following a
thorough review of the available evidence by regional Crown
counsel," Crown spokesman Austin Cullen said.
</P>
<P>
The counsel demanded McSorley appear in Vancouver court on
April 4 under section 267(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.
</P>
<P>
But Bruins hockey club has said that McSorley is likely at his
home in Los Angeles, without comment on the decision about the
criminal charge.
</P>
<P>
The NHL suspended MaSorley after he struck Canucks forward
Donald Brashear in the head with a stick on February 13. The NHL
said it would prefer to penalize its own players.
</P>
<P>
Bill Daly, the league's chief legal officer, reiterated that
stance Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As we stated at the time the suspension was imposed, we
believe the league dealt with the matter quickly, decisively and
appropriately he said, noting the league "did not feel that any
further action was either warranted or necessary."
</P>
<P>
It took police more than a week to investigate the slashing
incident, which was witnessed by thousands of fans at the game and
shown on TV highlight clips.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stock Exchange Opens as Usual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)
opened Wednesday morning as usual although Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Chairman Perfecto Yasay directed the PSE to stop
trading on Wednesday "until further orders."
</P>
<P>
Attending Wednesday morning's trade-opening ceremony, Finance
Secretary Jose Pardo said he had received an assurance from other
SEC commissioners that they think the exchange should open for
trading.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said he pleaded with the SEC commissioners after he was
advised by Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura that the
stock exchange's closure would have adverse repercussions on the
economy, particularly on the peso.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said Tuesday afternoon there wouldn't be any trading
following the protest resignation of the PSE's 22-member
Compliance and Surveillance Group (CSG) over a possible whitewash
of the BW Resources Corp. stock fraud scandal.
</P>
<P>
"Without effective compliance, monitoring and surveillance that
will enable the exchange to quickly address potential violations
of securities laws and rules, the commission cannot allow trading
operation to continue," Yasay said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said the suspension of trading might be only one day or
extended to as long as 30 days. The approval of the Presidential
Palace will be required if the suspension exceeds 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The trading halt order and the CSG's resignation shook Tuesday
the already fragile investor confidence in the local market, one
of Asia's worst-performing.
</P>
<P>
Rumors that a number of brokers implicated in the scandal would
be cleared by the PSE business conduct and ethics committee sent
the 30-company PSE index falling 51.58 points or 3 percent, to 1,
686.72.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Extends Soldier Recruitment Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan army has extended
the closing date for the recruitment of soldiers till March 20 in
a bid to attract more youths, army sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The army launched a recruitment drive between February 1 and
March 5 this year, aiming to enlist at least 15,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, there were only 1,390 youth being recruited during the
period, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the army also launched an extensive operation with
the support of the police to arrest thousands of army deserters
after an amnesty for them to report for duty ended Sunday midnight.
</P>
<P>
During the general amnesty between February 21 and 27, 3,019
deserters reported back for duty. The amnesty which was extended
till March 5 saw a further 786 deserters return.
</P>
<P>
The army has been plagued by desertion and manpower shortage in
its 17-year-old war against the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels who
want to carve out a Tamil state in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Expels Belizean Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan government,
locked in a territorial dispute with Belize, Tuesday ordered
Belizean Acting Ambassador Salvador Figueroa to leave the country
within 48 hours, reports reaching here from Guatemala City said.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan Foreign Ministry in a statement accused the
Belizean diplomat of adopting a harmful attitude against national
dignity by ignoring a restriction order against three Belizean
soldiers and a policeman who were set free by a Guatemalan
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion order followed the rupture of the dialog
regarding the territorial controversy.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry requested Belizean Prime Minister Said
Musa to name another ambassador. Only last month Figueroa
substituted temporary official Mike Mena, who retired due to
sickness.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala demands Belize return 12,000 square kilometers of
land and suggests that the dispute be resolved at an international
court, but the Belizean government rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Of late, relations between the two countries are going from bad
to worse over territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
Belize, a former British colony which won independence in 1991,
was recognized by the Guatemalan government of President Jorge
Serrano Elias in 1993, but the move has been ignored by subsequent
Guatemalan heads of state.
</P>
<P>
Belize canceled a meeting between the two sides scheduled for
February 25 and 26 in Miami, the United States, to discuss
territorial issues, following Guatemala's detention of three
soldiers and a policeman from Belize at the borders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belizean troops conducted military maneuvers at the
border, which Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gabriel Orellana
described as "playing with fire."
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the Guatemalan Embassy in Belize was attacked by a
bomb, with some buildings damaged.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute between the two countries has its
origin in a border accord signed in 1859 between Guatemala and
Britain.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Says Decision on Kosovo Should Respect Yugoslav Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Boris
Trajkovski said Monday that any decision on Kosovo should ensure
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Briefing foreign press in the Macedonian capital Skopje on the
former Yugoslav republic's stand on Kosovo, Trajkovski pointed out
that under U.N. Resolution 1244 Kosovo should remain in Yugoslavia
with extensive autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a rebel Yugoslav province where majority ethnic
Albanians seek independence, has come under the U.N.'s transient
rule after the Western military intervention there.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian president said his country enjoys good relations
with Yugoslavia, and the only problem between them is that their
borderlines have yet to be officially defined.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, which became independent in 1992, is one of the two
countries bordering Kosovo. Most of the NATO-led peace-keeping
forces entered Kosovo through its territory.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Welcomes more Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of Shaanxi Province,
an area linking eastern and western China, approved 157 projects
funded by direct overseas investment last year.
</P>
<P>
These projects involved a combined contractual value of 420
million U.S. dollars, up 13.8 percent over the figure of a year
ago, said Yang Xisheng, director of the provincial economic and
foreign trade commission.
</P>
<P>
On average, each project cost 2.7 million U.S. dollars, one
million dollars more than the average sum of all previous years.
</P>
<P>
Investors came from 56 countries and regions including 15 of
the world's 500 top multinationals. Investment from Europe and the
United Stated increased while that from Hong Kong declined in the
province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Shaanxi had approved 2,971 overseas-
funded projects involving a combined contractual value of 5.3
billion U.S. dollars and accounting for more than half of the
total direct overseas investment in northwest China, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The central government's strategy for developing western China
offers an unprecedented opportunity for Shaanxi, which is
favorably located, and the province expects to take advantage of
this opportunity to attract more overseas funds for accelerated
development.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are welcomed to invest in agriculture, high-
tech and basic industries, infrastructure, tourism, and get
involved in the reform of state-owned enterprises, Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Western China Preparing for Anticipated Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Four provinces and one autonomous
region in western China are investing heavily in infrastructure
facilities in a bid to accelerate the anticipated upsurge of the
region.
</P>
<P>
The relatively backward infrastructure facilities in Sichuan,
Shaanxi, Gansu, and Guizhou provinces and the Tibet Autonomous
Region have long hindered the economic development of these areas.
</P>
<P>
In response to the central government's decision to shift the
focus of economic development from eastern areas to the
underdeveloped western China, the four provinces and the Tibet
Autonomous Region have worked out detailed measures for improving
local infrastructure facilities, and some achievements already
have been realized.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Province, for example, built 1,000 km of highways last
year, and now construction has begun on several other highways.
The province also plans to invest 130 billion yuan over the next
eight to ten years to construct more highways.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province is expected to invest 4.2 billion yuan in fixed
assets this year, with funds for the communications sector alone
standing at 5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province also will use 600 million yuan over the next six
years to renovate and expand highways, railways, and airports. By
the end of last year, Gansu's highway had stretched to some 36,212
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
A large ecological environment project costing 48.9 billion
yuan will also be initiated soon, and between 2000 and 2010, the
province will return 5.3 million hectares of farmland to forest.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, landlocked Guizhou Province in southwest China spent a
record 12.3 billion yuan to build railways and highways in order
to stimulate local economic development. Thus far, the province's
highways total 33,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In the next two to three years, Guizhou is expected to become a
communications hub linking southwest China, northwest China, and
south China.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region's investment in fixed assets will
reach 6 billion yuan this year, up 20 percent over 1999.
</P>
<P>
This is part of Tibet's effort to step up construction of
communications, energy, and other facilities to accelerate local
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province has also worked out a blueprint to increase
the length of its highways to 100,000 kilometers in the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
These areas are also accelerating the development of their
tourist industries.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, for example, now lists tourism as a pillar industry, and
will open many new tourist destinations in the next few years. By
2005, the province is expected to receive 300,000 overseas
tourists, with tourism income reaching 5.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou Province will host a series of ethnic cultural
festivals and eco-tours to attract domestic and overseas tourists
this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, more than 5.33 million domestic and overseas tourists
visited Guizhou, an increase of 40 percent over 1998, generating 4.
8 billion yuan in income.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Province To Reap Profit From The Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
plans to realize 28 billion yuan (about 3.36 billion US dollars)
in added value from the ocean this year, which would account for
five percent of the province's total gross domestic product, a
leading official of the provincial oceanic bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qingming, director of bureau, said the province will
focus on construction of harbors, the development of fisheries,
ocean tourism, and the exploration of oil resources to develop and
use its rich maritime resources.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang boasts a coast line, including island coastlines, of 6,
486 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantages of its long deep-sea coast line, Zhejiang
will construct a harbor group including Ningbo and Zhoushan
harbors, and connect them with provincial highways and railways to
enhance transportation capacity.
</P>
<P>
Priority will also be given to the development of its ocean-
going fishing fleet and expansion of oceanic breeding. The
breeding area in the shallow sea will be raised from the current
30 percent to over 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province will continue to develop its ocean tourism
programs and will work hard to realize its goal of 15 billion yuan
(about 1.8 billion US dollars) in oceanic tourism income by 2010,
doubling the figure for 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Geologists have determined that the 770,000-sq-
kilometer East China Sea is rich in oil and reserve. Last year,
Zhejiang built an oil gas field in Wenzhou.

<HEADLINE> Aircraft Data Communication Trials Completed in Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- NAV Canada and Air Canada have
completed data communication trials intended to replace
traditional voice communication on aircraft over the North
Atlantic, according to a joint statement released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
the two companies said they would introduce "controller pilot
data link communications" (CPDLC) into the cockpit to enhance
safety while creating operational efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
The CPDLC replaces voice communication with a digital
communication link, through which a coded message, such as a
position report or a clearance, is transmitted.
</P>
<P>
Messages are exchanged between the aircraft and controllers via
satellites, air-ground stations and ground networks.
</P>
<P>
The new system will provide faster, more reliable communication
and help reduce pilot and controller workload, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the traditional voice communication uses high
frequency (HF) radio where the quality varies depending on
atmospheric conditions.
</P>
<P>
The fast growth in the number of flights over the North
Atlantic has caused problems of HF communications due to frequency
congestion, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
NAV Canada is an air traffic control corporation while Air
Canada is the country's No. 1 airline. The two companies said they
had successfully conducted their trials in late January during
flights from Toronto to London over the North Atlantic.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
beat rival Senator Bill Bradley in Georgia and Ohio in the Super
Tuesday primaries and caucuses today, expecting more victories
from Maine to California as 15 states are casting ballots on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
Early returns from Georgia gave Gore an overwhelming lead. Exit
polls there and in Ohio foretold easy victories for the vice
president, and also pointed to a lead in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
The three states made up the leading edge of the busiest night
of the nominating campaign.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Gore and Bradley were competing for 1,315 delegates to
the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles in August, more than half
of the 2,170 needed for the presidential nomination. Gore began
the day with 482 delegates to 57 for his rival.
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, Texas Governor George W. Bush won
Republican primaries Tuesday in Ohio and Georgia, gearing up his
drive to crush his rival Senator John McCain's political
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
But McCain won easily in Vermont as Republican voters in 13
states participated in the year's largest night of presidential
delegate selections.
</P>
<P>
At stake Tuesday were 613 delegates, more than half of the
total 1,034 delegates needed to obtain the Republican presidential
nomination at the convention in the coming summer.
</P>

"It appears that Governor Bush's victory is going to be wide

LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona became the first team to

<HEADLINE> Complex Microbe Widely Applied in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The application of complex
microbes in agriculture, livestock breeding, and fruit growing
have yielded magic results in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Fed with complex microbes, a 20-kilomgram piglet can gain
weight up to 100 kg in three months, and its meat is more tender.
</P>
<P>
The use of complex microbes also can increase in the per unit
output of grain by 20 percent, sugarcane by one ton, and tea
leaves by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Complex microbes not only raise fruit output, but also reduce
the need for farm chemicals by one-third, making the fruit sweeter.
</P>
<P>
As part of government strategy to turn Yunnan into a green
economy leader in China, a local scientific research and training
center has introduced microbe technology.
</P>
<P>
Scientists put a variety of microbes into a fermenting jar to
breed complex organisms which contains 80 different microbe
varieties. These are then placed into mashed wheat, corn, and bean
stocks to turn them into fermented animal feed, and the cost of
one kilogram of this concoction is no more than one yuan.

<HEADLINE> Farmer-Turned Millionaires Invest in Rural Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- About 300 farmer-turned
millionaires have returned to their hometown of Dingxi Prefecture,
one of the poorest areas in China, to help villagers get rich.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Cunping, who now has his own construction company,
invested 10 million yuan last year to build a greenhouse for
cultivating his hometown's famous flowers. He also invited
horticulturists from Qinghai Province and found buyers in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
As a hectare of flowers grown in the greenhouse yields a profit
of 15 million yuan, many of Zhang's fellow villagers have now cast
off the yoke of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Dingxi Prefecture is on the western slope of the Loess Plateau
and lacks water to irrigate farmland, and some farmers left for
other provinces to seek their fortunes. When they became rich,
many came back to invest in agriculture and farm-produce
processing, said Yang Guoai, secretary of the Communist Party of
China committee in Lintao County.
</P>
<P>
At present, the county generates an average of 200 million yuan
a year through starch production and flower cultivation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 returnees pooled funds worth 4.22 million yuan to build
a "drying farming demonstration zone" in Dingxi with the support
from the local government.
</P>
<P>
The company owned by Kang Kegui, a farmer in Lintao County,
sells 300,000 tons of potatoes and vegetables to other provinces
annually, and the assets of Kang's company rose to 2 million yuan
by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Over 80 Percent of Shanghai's Laid-off Workers Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics show that
some 690,000 of Shanghai's 830,000 laid-off workers have found new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to the city's efforts to strengthen
reemployment services, and creation of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has a job information network which covers the
city's urban and rural areas, and has used television and
telephone hotlines to provide employment information to job-
seekers.
</P>
<P>
More than 65 percent of the 155,000 displaced workers who
participated in professional training found jobs in 1999, higher
than the figure for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The city now has over 7,000 non-official labor organizations,
which have helped 70,000 people to find jobs in catering, repairs,
and other service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai also has 167 welfare labor organizations for extremely
needy laid-off workers, and they have helped some 36,000 workers
find jobs.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Xu Kuangdi said that Shanghai has vowed to create 100,000
jobs this year by establishing a responsibility system for
employment and job creation.
</P>
<P>
Xu said the city government will offer support in the areas of
finance, credit, and taxation and social security, and by so doing
the number of registered local laid-off workers will be kept
within 80,000 this year.

<P>
Carefully studying the goods made by Universe Chinaware
Industry Co. of Jingdezhen in east China's Jiangxi Province,
Kiritharan said the quality of this porcelain was really good and
Sri Lankan people used to enjoy Chinese glazed ware.
</P>
<P>
Ordering four containers of chinaware from the Universe company,
he said these products would find a good market in Sri Lanka, as
people in his country are fond of porcelain.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair, which opened Sunday, has attracted more than 3,
200 overseas businessmen who have signed a total of 107 million U.
S. dollars worth of contracts with exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
Universe's vice president Huang Jian said that as China steps
up efforts to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO), the age-
old porcelain industry is confronted with both opportunities and
challenges. Though China's porcelain will then enter the foreign
market, foreign products will at the same time flood the Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
He said the goods displayed by his company, a state-owned
enterprise with more than 1,600 employees, comply with world
environmental and sanitary standards and are targeted at the
international market.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair is hosted by six east China provinces and
Shanghai, China's largest industrial and commercial center. Last
year, the import and export volume of the region amounted to 128.
04 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 35.5 percent of the
country's total. East China, consisting of Shanghai and Shandong,
Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, is one of
the country's most developed region featured by export-oriented
economy.

<HEADLINE> China Values Coal Production Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China will reform its existing
supervisory system to insure coal mine safety, and set up a new
organization to effectively monitor coal production.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianzheng, deputy director of the State Administration of
Coal Industry, made the announcement at a recent national meeting
on industrial coal production in Changsha, the provincial capital
of Hunan.
</P>
<P>
China has initiated a range of policies to limit coal
production beginning three years ago, but the country still
produced 1.045 billion tons of crude coal last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that the new organization will operate as an
independent entity which will receive direct management from the
central government, and will not be easily affected by local
interests.
</P>
<P>
The present coal mine safety supervisory organizations are all
subject to local coal industrial administrations in different
regions, and this prevents them from functioning in the most
efficient manner.
</P>
<P>
China now has 38,000 small coal mines, and many poorly
equipped small mines are considered a major disruption to normal
state's coal production plans, as well as being the sites of many
serious accidents.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, 72 major coal mine accidents took place across
the country, killing 1,196 people. Of these, 55 accidents
occurred in rural and township-run coal mines, claiming the lives
of 840.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he hopes the safety situation in the country's coal
mines will be enormously improved as a result of the
administration's five years of effort.

<HEADLINE> Hu Changqing Executed Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hu Changqing, former deputy
governor of east China's Jiangxi Province, was executed this
morning in the provincial capital of Nanchang.
</P>
<P>
Hu's death sentence was upheld on Tuesday by the Supreme People
's Court of China.
</P>
<P>
Hu was convicted on charges of bribery and possession of
property from unidentified sources, and received the death
sentence at the final ruling of the provincial Higher People's
Court.
</P>
<P>
Between May 1995 and August 1999, Hu was deputy director of the
Administration of Religious Affairs under the State Council,
assistant to the governor of Jiangxi, and deputy governor of
Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
During this period, Hu abused his power by making illicit
profits for some people, and demanded and accepted a total of 5.44
million yuan in bribes over 87 separate occasions. He also failed
to identify the source of 1.61 million yuan worth of property in
his name.
</P>
<P>
On February 15 this year, Hu was given the death sentence by
the Intermediate People's Court of the city of Nanchang, was
deprived of his political rights for life, and had all his
property confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Hu refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Higher
People's Court of Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The higher court rejected the appeal and upheld the first
ruling on March 1 after further investigation confirmed that the
evidence against Hu was authentic and sufficient, and that he had
been adjudged in accordance with law and given a proper sentence.
</P>
<P>
Hu's case was then submitted to the Supreme People's Court for
review.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court said in its decision that as a
senior government official, Hu should have acted as a model and
strictly abided by state laws, instead of abusing his power to
make illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
Since the case has had a very negative social impact and
inflicted heavy losses on the state, the Supreme People's Court
decided that Hu should be given a heavy punishment in accordance
with the stipulations of China's Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
The decree to execute Hu was issued yesterday by the Supreme
People's Court when the final sentence was upheld.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica's Earning From Banana Export Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica earned 648 million U.S.
dollars last year by exporting an unprecedented volume of bananas,
2.3 percent less than the previous year's 663 million dollars, the
National Banana Corporation (Corbana) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 116.2 million boxes, or 2,107.87 million
kilograms of bananas, last year, but the income shrank due to
price falls in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The banana industry experienced instability last year, marked
by over production and low demand, according to Corbana President
Victor Emilio Herrerahe. The banana section "is going through its
worst crisis in history," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 59 percent of the country's total banana production is
produced by local producers, whereas the rest by three
multinational U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
In Costa Rica, about 50,000 people are directly engaged in
banana production and another 50,000 depend indirectly on this
industry, according to government statistics.

WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush
won the Republican primary in Georgia State, while his rival
Arizona Senator John McCain scored victory in Vermont State, early
results of the U.S. Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses showed.
</P>

</P>
<P>
"It appears that Governor Bush's victory is going to be wide

states participated in the year's largest night of presidential
delegate selections.
</P>
<P>
At stake were 613 delegates in 13 states including California,
New York, Ohio, more than half of the total needed for nomination.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore beat former New
Jersey Senator Bill Bradley in the primary in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The exit polls foretold Gore's win in Georgia, and pointed to
his lead in the Vermont contest.
</P>
<P>
The two states were the leading edge of the nominating campaign,
primaries and caucuses in 15 states and American Samoa in a
virtual nationwide primary.

<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- David Beckham has had a clear-the-
air meeting with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
Beckham's future with the Treble winners was thrown into doubt
after his training ground bust-up with Ferguson ten days ago.
</P>
<P>
But Manchester United chief executive Martin Edwards insists
that it is in the past and that the England midfielder is welcome
to stay at Old Trafford "for ever more".
</P>
<P>
Edwards said: "It's down to the manager. I believe he had a
meeting with David Beckham at the weekend and, provided David fits
in with the manager's wishes, which I believe he does, then I hope
he stays here for ever more."
</P>
<P>
Edwards admitted that there had been a problem, with heated
words exchanged between Ferguson and Beckham.
</P>
<P>
"We hope everything is going to be OK, obviously words were
said but we hope that has now been rectified and so let's get on
with winning the Premier League and the Champions League," he told
Sky Sports News.
</P>
<P>
Edwards also insisted Beckham was not involved in talks over a
new contract.
</P>
<P>
"There are no contract negotiations with David at the moment as
he's got three-and-a-half years left on his current deal," said
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
"We will be in contract negotiations with a number of players,
not at the end of this season, but at the end of next season. That
includes David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
"We would not change the deadline for one player as it could
lead to all the players wanting to bring forward their contract
negotiations," he added.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Battles on Despite Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Defiant Mark Richardson has vowed
to keep training and not become downhearted after hearing he has
been suspended from competition by UK Athletics pending a
disciplinary hearing.
</P>
<P>
The British 400 meters runner tested positive for nandrolone on
October 27 of last year when an out-of-competition random test
found traces of the banned substance in a urine sample.
</P>
<P>
He appeared before a UK Athletics-appointed drug advisory
committee (DAC) on Friday, which considered whether there was
evidence that a doping offense took place. The DAC decided there
is a case for 27-year-old Richardson to answer and UK Athletics
have therefore imposed a suspension.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Richardson, who is maintaining his innocence, said:
"I'm not allowed to comment about the matter. As it stands I don't
really know what is going on, although I have been informed I am
suspended.
</P>
<P>
"I am still training as usual and remaining positive and it is
still all systems go for me. I'll have to see what developments
there are."
</P>
<P>
Richardson had his sights firmly set on winning a medal in
September's Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
But now, whatever decision the disciplinary committee reaches,
it seems his hopes of success will, judging from past cases, be
jeopardized by bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Already European 200m champion Dougie Walker has waited 14
months for progress on his case after testing positive for
nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
Walker is waiting for the International Amateur Athletic
Federation's DAC to convene their own inquiry, even though UK
Athletics decided neither he, Linford Christie or Gary Cadogan had
cases to answer against nandrolone charges.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Supports Philippines' Observer Status in OIC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
said here on Wednesday that Iran supports the Philippines' observer
status in the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Iran, as a prominent country in the Middle
East and the OIC, and the Philippines, as a member of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in various fields is
important, Khatami told the visiting Philippine Secretary of
Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation in areas of politics, economy and culture is
a goal pursued by Iran and the Philippines, the Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also stressed the need for observation of the rights of
all ethnical groups within the framework of national interests and
for maintenance of stability and security in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Receiving a written message from his Philippine counterpart
Joseph Estrada, Khatami thanked the Philippine president for
inviting him to visit Manila.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that he would make the visit at an appropriate
time and in turn invited President Estrada to visit Iran.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, for his part, thanked Iran for supporting his country's
presence at the OIC meetings as an observer.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country is ready to contribute to Iran's
economic projects, IRNA said.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Court: President Did not Contravene Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Constitutional Court
ruled on Wednesday President Omar El-Bashir's decrees issued on
December 12, 1999 on imposing a national state of emergency and
dissolving the parliament were constitutional.
</P>
<P>
A number of parliamentarians who supported the former Speaker of
the dissolved parliament, Hassan Al-Turabi, lodged an appeal to the
court against Bashir's decrees, calling them unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled Wednesday the state of emergency was an
exceptional case and the president of the state has the right to
declare it when necessary.
</P>
<P>
The constitution grants the head of state the powers to protect
the country against any potential threats and declaring state of
emergency is one of such powers, according to the court.
</P>
<P>
As for the dissolution of the parliament, the court said the
current constitutional provisions do not deal with the procedure of
dissolving the legislative council or who has the power to do so.
</P>
<P>
However, this should not prevent the head of state, as a symbol
of the state and responsible for the security of the country, from
making a decision in the interest of the country, the court ruling
said.
</P>
<P>
The president has also, according to the constitutional court,
the right to suspend some provisions of the constitution especially
when the parliament was trying to amend the constitution in order
to curtail the powers of the president.
</P>
<P>
The court cited that the parliament had turned down the
president's request to postpone the constitution amendment that
concerned the president, which had no precedence in Sudan's
history.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's court ruling put an end to the dispute over the
constitutionality of Bashir's decrees and strengthened his position
in front of Turabi's supporters. However, the political
repercussions of the ruling are unpredictable.

CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Visiting Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs
Domingo Siazon on Wednesday said his country is interested in
importing fruits from Iran.
</P>
<P>
There is a good market in the Philippines for Iranian fruits
and "we are ready to import apples from Iran," he said in his
meeting with Chairman of Iran's Chamber of Commerce Ali Naqi
Khamoushi.
</P>
<P>
Khamoushi proposed the exchange of trade delegations between the
two countries as a means of expanding bilateral trade and helping
Philippine businessmen know more about Iran's non-oil exports, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Although it needs resources for growth and
development, Iran has failed to attract adequate foreign
investments, a senior official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign investments in the country in the period 1993-96
stood at 128 million U.S. dollars, while those worldwide reached
226 billion dollars in 1996 alone, said Ebrahim Bahadorani, deputy
minister of industries for economics and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The industries official added that given Iran's population of
over 60 million and taking into account various indexes, the
foreign investment volume in the country has to top 3.45 billion
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
He also lamented the fact that the country's growth is directly
related to oil revenues, adding that about 70 percent of the gross
domestic product is directly dependent on oil income.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus' Popular Bank Group Wednesday announced
profits of 175.4 million Cyprus pounds (about 315 million dollars)
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, executive director of the Group,
Kikis Lazarides, said profits increased by 23.0 percent in 1999,
adding profits for shareholders rose to 131.3 million pounds (236
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Group's total assets increased by 23.3 percent in 1999,
compared to 1998, earnings per share reached 85.3 cents compared to
17.3 cents in 1998, while the cost/income ration dropped to 32.2
percent from 53.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lazarides also said the Group's Board of Directors has decided
to propose a 30 percent dividend to the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cyprus economy, Lazarides said the largest part
of economic growth came from abroad, mainly through tourist
services.

<P>
BIRMINGHAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion and first
seed Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark eased through to the second
round of the All England Badminton Championships with a straight
set victory on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Christensen, runner-up at the world championships last May,
defeated Tjitte Weistra of the Netherlands 15-7, 15-2.
</P>
<P>
The Dane has been scheduled to meet England's national and U.S.
Open champion Colin Haughton, who was forced to pull out of the
tournament due to knee injury, which the Briton suffered in losing
the Cuban Open final 15-3, 15-3 to Welshman and Olympic qualifying
rival Richard Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's Ji Xinpeng, joint 5/8 seed at the tournament,
struggled to beat his underdog rival Martin Hagberg of Sweden in
three sets 15-8, 6-15 and 17-14.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shuttler was at an edge to lose the match when he
was left behind at 10-14 in the third set. Only at the crucial
moment, Ji Xinpeng found back his pace and traced the score at 14-
all.
</P>
<P>
Ji asked three points, maintained his attacking speed and took
three points in a row to seal the match and place in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team headcoach Li Yongbo was by no means satisfied by
Ji's performance. He told Ji:"you should have sped up early in the
match. If you don't speed up and attack, you will have little
chance in the second round."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plays Down Expectations From Israeli-Palestinian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
described a renewed round of Israeli-Palestinian talks this month
in the Washington area as an "extraordinarily difficult process"
and cautioned against any expectation for quick results from the
talks.
</P>
<P>
"It's our view that this is the best way to give a kickstart to
the process. But we recognize that it's an extraordinarily
difficult process and even a good kickstart might not get it going,
" State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said he envisaged the talks could "go from anywhere to a
week to a couple of weeks or so," and played down expectations
from the talks, saying they may not lead to much progress.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the Israeli-Palestinians talks was announced
by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross in the West Bank town of Ramallah
earlier Wednesday. But he gave few details of the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the talks would not follow the format of high-level
Israeli-Palestinian talks at Way in Maryland in 1998 or of Syrian-
Israeli talks in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, this year.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to cover both disputes left over from
last year's Sharm el-Sheikhh agreement and the disputes which need
to be solved so that Israel and the Palestinians can reach a deal
by September on "final status" issues such as refugees, borders,
Jerusalem and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
"September is going to be difficult to meet and it won't be
able to be met unless we get an intensified negotiating process.
That's what this is designed to do," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to accelerate the process. This is a way to hopefully
do that. At the same time we recognize that the issues are
extraordinarily difficult," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Finds Strong Growth, Limited Price Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy was still
keeping strong growth in the first two months of this year while
the increases of consumer prices were limited, a new survey
released by the Federal Reserve Wednesday showed.
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey, compiled from reports from its 12 regional
banks, also said labor markets remain tight around the country.
That means employers are having difficulty finding workers to fill
job openings, something that economists fear could lead to wage
and price inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
But "despite faster wage growth for some workers, increases in
the prices of final goods and services were limited overall,
although the prices of transportation services and some industrial
commodities rose noticeably," the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, known as the "beige book" for the color of its
cover, will be used when Fed policy-makers meet on March 21 to
review the central bank's stance on interest rates. The beige book
was based on information collected before February 29.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe the Fed will boost rates again at that
meeting in a further effort to slow economic growth to a pace that
will keep inflation in check. Four times since June the central
bank has raised rates by a total of a full percentage point to 5.
75 percent, making borrowing more expensive for millions of
consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
In its latest snapshot of the economy, the Fed said that "the
majority of districts reported strong growth during the survey
period, with the remaining reports pointing to moderate growth or
continued high levels of activity."
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing sector, most districts reported a pickup
in activity in January and February, the Fed said. "The gains were
moderate in general although Richmond's report indicated
considerable strengthening."
</P>
<P>
On the retail front, the Fed found sales were strong in most
areas and either met or exceeded merchants' expectations.
</P>
<P>
Sales of consumer electronics, appliances and home furnishings
posted the biggest gains, the survey said. Demand for cars and
light trucks was solid with sales matching or surpassing activity
reported for the same period a year ago. Some districts, however,
reported sluggish sales of clothing.
</P>
<P>
Despite rising mortgage rates, residential construction
activity and sales of new homes remained strong in many areas. But
there were signs of cooling in the Atlanta and Kansas City
districts and in several states in the San Francisco district.

<HEADLINE> No Plan to Move N.Irish Peace Process Forward on Table: Wemen's Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The British and Irish governments
have not indicated any fresh ideas about how to save the Northern
Ireland peace process, the Women's Coalition said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Monica McWilliams, leader of the Women's Coalition, made the
comments in Belfast after meeting Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson and Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen.
</P>
<P>
The government ministers are holding a series of separate
meetings with the province's political parties.
</P>
<P>
They hosted round-table negotiations between the pro-agreement
parties at Castle Buildings in Belfast later on Wednesday, trying
to break the political impasse over paramilitary arms
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that all-party talks between those in
favor of the Good Friday Agreement have taken place, since the
political institutions were suspended last month.
</P>
<P>
McWilliams said: "They don't seem to have an agenda. If they
have they are keeping it under the table at the moment. This is
more of a listening exercise. After the round table meeting we
should have an agenda."
</P>
<P>
She added her party had tabled a three-point plan aimed at
advancing the stalled political process.

The reports quoted spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol Ken
Knowles as saying that 22 vehicles were involved in the crash on a
north Florida interstate, including a tractor-trailer carrying
acid. The acid was contained within the truck and never posed a
danger, Knowles said.
</P>
<P>
Knowles blamed the pileup on a blaze in Osceola National Park
some 15 kilometers away. "The low visibility was a result of the
forest fire," he said.

The accident happened shortly before 8 a.m. local time on
Interstate 10 in north-central Florida, midway between
Jacksonville and Tallahassee near a forest fire.
</P>
<P>
It took several hours for authorities to determine how many
vehicles were involved because of so much twisted wreckage. At
least five trucks could be seen jackknifed in the wreckage.

Local officials closed some 30 kilometers of the highway from
Lake City to Live Oak, which is about 120 kilometers east of

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns Bankers to Be Cautious About Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan on Wednesday cautioned the country's bankers not to
make loans on the expectation that the record-breaking economic
expansion will continue unabated.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Independent community Bankers of America at
its meeting in San Antonio, Texas, Greenspan said there was a "
troubling trend" of many banks taking the strong economy for
granted and considering it "ordinary and expected."
</P>
<P>
"Lending granted on that basis could have grave consequences
for the (banking) industry's ability to weather weaker economic
conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen growing evidence of credit granted solely on the
expectation that current robust (economic) conditions will
continue indefinitely, with little thought as to how borrowers
might perform under more stressful conditions," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came two days after he publicly expressed concern
that the nation's record-breaking economic expansion could be
ended by a resurgence of inflation unless growth slowed to a more
sustainable level.
</P>
<P>
Private economists viewed Greenspan's comments Monday as a
clear signal that the central bank, which has already boosted
interest rates four times since June, is prepared to do so again.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Greenspan noted that amid the strong economy,
lenient lending standards and fraud at some banks recently have
caused big losses to the federal deposit insurance funds.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), hit by its largest
losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, last month told
its examiners to keep alert for warning signs of possible fraud at
the banks they inspect. Fraud is said to have been a major factor
in three recent bank collapses, two of which cost the FDIC's
insurance funds an estimated 982 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
There were eight U.S. bank failures last year.
</P>
<P>
The FDIC, which has predicted that as many as 20 banks could go
under this year, also has proposed that capital requirements be
doubled for banks that specialize in risky loans to people with
inferior credit histories.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said bankers and examiners "need to be continuously
vigilant about traditional causes of bank failure such as fraud ...
and rapid entry into new and unfamiliar activities."
</P>
<P>
"History has shown that entry into new business lines without
the experience, tools and controls to do the job right most often
leads to losses and sometimes, failure," he said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Urges Battle against Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) on Wednesday called for fight against all
forms of extremism in order to rid Africa of its long plague of
armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 71st ordinary session
of the council of ministers in the Ethiopian capital where the OAU
is headquartered, OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim said
that the search for peace in Africa should not be limited to
focusing predominantly on conflict.
</P>
<P>
"In order to achieve a conflict free continent, we must
inculcate and strengthen the culture of tolerance and dialogue in
our societies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"With equal vehemence we must fight against extremism of all
forms," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to poverty problems, Salim expressed full support for
the establishment of the African Union and of the African Economic
Community.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that African countries must beef up their
solidarity to avoid further marginalization.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Under Secretary General K. Y. Amoako said in
his speech that the spread of HIV/AIDS and regional conflicts
remain the key challenge to African nations in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Amoako, also Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission
for Africa, said that the latest survey by the commission
concluded that " peace, stability and deepening political and
economic reforms are necessary conditions for Africa's development
during the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian prime minister Meles Zenawi agreed that conflicts and
wars are hampering Africa's economic development, saying African
countries should solve conflicts themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meles added that the OAU, as a continental organization, is
"indeed indispensable" for promoting peace and stability as well
as economic development.

<HEADLINE> Two Million Affected by Flood in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maputo, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said at press of conference on Wednesday that two million
Mozambicans, or about 12 percent of its total population, had been
affected by the rampant flood and 250,000 people were displaced.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the current situation of the floods,
the president said that 212 corpses were found and 15 disappeared
in the flood.
</P>
<P>
He added that the death toll would rise as the relief
operations continue, and more bodies are removed from the flooded
areas.
</P>
<P>
He expressed fears that with the outbreak of diseases such as
cholera more people were likely to die if medicines did not come
on time.
</P>
<P>
The president told reporters that the armed forces are taking
part in the rescue operation in civilian clothes since the
beginning of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
He added that although they have few resources, just two
helicopters, one of which has been recently repaired, the armed
forces were on the ground, risking their lives, long before the
first South African squadron moved in.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that one explanation for the delay in the arrival
of aid was that "although we made the appeal, we didn't have the
pictures to make the world understand the enormity of the
disaster".
</P>
<P>
However, after the foreign press corps moved into the country,
the world started responding to the appeals made by the
government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the armed forces did not have enough aircraft,
because right after the Rome peace accord in 1992, certain members
of the international community refused to finance equipment for
the armed forces, just as they had been reluctant to finance the
training and equipping of the police.
</P>
<P>
But now they were looking at things differently. "They are the
ones who tell us we were right back then", said Chissano.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Confident on Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano on Wednesday said he hoped that the country's economy
would continue showing strong growth despite the devastating flood
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy has been growing steadily at a rate of
over ten percent for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the current situation of the
floods, Chissano admitted that the tragedy had a negative impact
on the economy, but if efforts were redoubled in all sectors it
was possible to maintain the average level of growth.
</P>
<P>
Citing the post civil war reconstruction as an example,
Chissano said that, by following the same principles of courage
and determination, it would be possible to rebuild the ravaged
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
However, the support and understanding of the international
community would be valued if the country is to move ahead, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that foreign assistance for rebuilding the
destroyed infrastructure should be separated from funding for the
state budget and balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
He added that all of Mozambique's bilateral debts should be
cancelled. " We hope that, as Spain announced that it would
totally cancel our bilateral debt, other countries will follow its
example", he said.
</P>
<P>
But emergency aid should not be linked to the pardoning of the
debt. "We want aid, but there's a need to cancel the debt anyway,
because this will enable us to combat poverty", said the
President.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue fighting to have our foreign debt
written-off, not just because there has been a calamity", he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that it was too early to determine the total
damage caused by the flood which has affected five of the
country's ten provinces since early February.
</P>
<P>
He said that a preliminary evaluation for the reconstruction of
roads and bridges gives a figure of 89 million U.S. dollars.
However, he warned that the figures could change as more data
pours in from the provinces affected.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, the government was doing its best to have
seeds and tools distributed to the peasants before the second
planting season in April.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible to recover everything, if we start planting in
this period", he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Opposes Turkey's Nuclear Plant Construction Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday expressed its
opposition to the construction by Turkey of a nuclear plant in
Akuyu.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason for our stand is the high degree of danger,
contained in the use of nuclear energy, because of the earthquake
proneness of the region and the results, which it would have for
development and the environment," Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman
Panayiotis Beglitis said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Turkey would take under serious consideration
the environmental impact of this project and would not take
decisions which would disrupt or burden the sensitive ecological
balance of the region, tourism and general economic development.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with his Turkish counterpart,
Ismail Cem, Tuesday night, Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou also conveyed Athens' concern to Cem over the
construction of the nuclear plant since the procedure of
proclaiming the relevant tender will be concluded Thursday,
according to the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA).

<HEADLINE> Dini Says New Policies Needed to Heal Ethnic Divides in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Wednesday called for more effective action to be taken in
Kosovo to combat continuing ethnic strife in the province and its
growing crime rate.
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the Lower House Committee for foreign
affairs on the current situation in the Balkans, Dini said that in
Kosovo, "measures which go beyond the limbo of good intentions are
indispensable."
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy and her allies were examining fresh ways of
fighting forms of extremism and rising crime in the war-devastated
province.
</P>
<P>
He said that these measures had to protect minorities in the
region, particularly the Serbian minority, from the threat of
ethnic cleansing. He said that a stronger message of unity would
help the people of Kosovo and create a more responsible leadership
ahead of municipal elections in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that in deciding what course to take, the
international community had to take into account the "dramatic
situation last year," when almost a million refugees fled the
province.
</P>
<P>
"A potential humanitarian catastrophe was avoided only thanks
to massive international humanitarian, political and military aid
in which Italy did and is still doing her part," the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Dini later urged the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and other
Kosovar factions to support the United Nations administrative and
peacekeeping efforts in the province.
</P>
<P>
He also called for an end to sanctions against Serbia, saying
that these measures only served to alienate the Serbian people and
strengthen Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Dini also said the West needed to help Serbia rebuild the
bridges over the river Danube which were destroyed during the NATO
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
The minister concluded that Italy was taking an active part in
bringing about "structural change" in the Balkans and, for this
reason, was a "respected, sought after and heeded" power in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Clinton Sends China Trade Bill to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton made the announcement in a speech at Johns Hopkins
University in Washington, saying, "Before coming here today, I
submitted legislation to Congress."
</P>
<P>
The United States signed an agreement to bring China into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on term that both countries will
open markets to other products and investments. And China is soon
to conclude similar agreements with other countries. By then it
will join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States should first grant China the
permanent normal trading status before it could benefit from China
's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"For us to benefit from that, we must first grant it permanent
normal trading status, the same arrangement we have given to other
countries in the WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said support for China's entry into the WTO serves U.S.
national interests.
</P>
<P>
"Supporting China's entry into the WTO ... is about more than
our economic interests; it is clearly in our larger national
interest," he said. "It represents the most significant
opportunity that we have had to create positive change in China
since the 1970s, when President (Richard) Nixon went there, and
later in the decade when President (Jimmy) Carter normalized
relations. I am working as hard as I can to convince Congress and
the American people to seize this opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Clinton warned Congress not to oppose the bill granting China
the permanent normal trading status, saying the United States
could only see other competitors reap benefit from the world
largest market.
</P>
<P>
"If Congress passes PNTR, we reap these rewards. If Congress
rejects it, our competitors reap these rewards. We must understand
the consequences of saying no.... Someone else will step into the
breach, and we'll spend the next 20 years wondering why in the
wide world we handed over the benefits we negotiated to other
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The White House is pressing for a swift vote on the PNTR bill
by June, fearing further delay could bog it down in election
politics.
</P>
<P>
Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate said Wednesday
that they expected the bill to pass.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's allies -- a coalition led by the Business Roundtable
and the Chamber of Commerce -- have earmarked more than 12 million
dollars to round up free-trade votes on Capitol Hill, in their
biggest lobbying campaign since the North American Free Trade
Agreement was passed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Senate leaders said the Finance Committee will hold the first
vote on the China pact and passage was virtually assured. Fifteen
senators on the 20-member committee will support the PNTR for
China.

<HEADLINE> Greece Voices Concern Over Worsening Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday voiced its
concern over the deteriorating situation in the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Panayiotis Beglitis said that
Greece expressed its concern over the continuing tension in Kosovo,
which would become uncontrollable and lead to a new military
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece also expressed it sympathy for the Serbian
citizens and French peacekeepers injured in the incidents in the
northern Kosovo city of Mitrovica Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the multi-ethnic character of
Kosovo as well as the status of wide autonomy and self-rule within
the existing borders of Yugoslavia must be secured.
</P>
<P>
Beglitis also urged the international community to enforce
without delays all the articles of U.N. resolution 1244 and
isolate all those extremist elements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos
Wednesday attributed the recent tension to "revised initiatives"
and "liberation moves" in southern Serbia, among others.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Kosovo has seen rising violence between NATO-
led peacekeepers, ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen French peacekeepers, 20 Serbs and five ethnic
Albanians were injured Tuesday when fighting broke out in
Mitrovica, and it was one of the most serious outbreaks of
violence in the city, which saw two major clashes last month.

Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
In its bipartisan report to lawmakers, the International
Financial Institution Advisory Commission said that institutions
such as the World Bank and the IMF should "focus on an important,
but limited, set of objectives."
</P>
<P>
The report, whose authors included long-term critics of the IMF,
is part of a review initiated in 1998 when Congress approved the U.
S. share of higher quotas at the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders might try to include some ideas in
legislation. But change at the two institutions will depend on the
response from other member states as well.
</P>
<P>
The proposals from the commission would only allow the IMF to
provide short-term credits, lending to fewer countries than at
present. And they would stop the World Bank from lending to
countries that can raise money on capital markets.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress plans hearings on the report on March 23,
with testimony from Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and from
commission members.
</P>
<P>
Allan Meltzer, chairman of the commission, said the proposals
outlined in the 124-page document would prevent the IMF from "
micro-managing" the economies of member states.
</P>
<P>
But economist Fred Bergsten, one of three analysts who put out
a dissenting opinion on the controversial report, said the
suggestions would undermine the world economy and hurt U.S.
economic interests.
</P>
<P>
"The majority proposals would sharply increase the risk of
international economic disorder and dash the prospects of economic
development for millions of poor people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan commission agreed unanimously on two points in
the report -- a call to multilateral lenders to forgive the debts
owed to them by some of the world's poorest countries, and to
limit IMF lending to "short-term liquidity loans."
</P>
<P>
Development groups welcomed the idea of debt relief, but said
the report failed to address fundamental problems at the bank and
the fund, which both played major roles in efforts to resolve the
world financial crisis during the past years.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rebound From Big Sell-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rebounded
Wednesday as investors calmed down after Tuesday's big sell-off on
earnings fears.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 60.50 at 9,856.53.
The blue chip index fell 374.47 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 11.08 at 1,366.70 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 49.33 at 4,897.17.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the Federal Reserve released its "
beige book" survey of the U.S. economic condition. The survey said
there is little evidence of inflation in the overall economy
despite rising workers' wages.
</P>
<P>
The survey relieved investors' worries about a sharp increase
in interest rates this year. The Dow index plunged Tuesday on
investors' fears that higher interest rates combined with rising
oil prices might do significant damage to corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board has raised rates four times since
last June in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy and the board'
s chairman Alan Greenspan warned recently that more rate hike
would be needed if the robust economy and the hot stock market
will not cool down quickly.
</P>
<P>
But the survey did not remove all investors' concerns about
corporate profits, which were sparked by Procter &AMP; Gamble's
warning. The consumer goods company said Tuesday its earnings in
the current quarter would come in well below the levels expected
by Wall Street analysts because of higher prices of pulp and raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
The market was volatile Wednesday, changing directions several
times early in trading before stabilization.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 2.66 at 591.23. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 15.54 at 1,001.40 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 0.01 at 595.46.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,543 down, 1,446 up and 487
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.19 billion shares from 1.30 billion
in the previous session, according to preliminary calculations.

<HEADLINE> Number of Regular Smokers Rises in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of people who smoke
daily in Belgium rose against last year, according to recent data
from the Consumer Research Center.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, about 26 percent of Belgians smoked every day, two
percent more than in 1998. Smoking among people dropped from 40
percent to 25 percent during the 1980s. Since then it has shifted
between 25 percent and 30 percent. More and more young people are
smoking.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 67 million Belgian francs (about 1.75 million U.S.
dollars) were spent on tobacco advertising in Belgium and
Luxembourg, a rise of 9 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The consumer organizations say that the advertising industry is
obviously not suffering from the ban on tobacco advertising, and
they want more money spent on anti-smoking campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges RUF to End Human Rights Abuses in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday called on the former rebel group -- the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) -- to immediately end all human rights abuses
in Sierra Leone and to ensure unhindered access across the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in a statement read to the press here
by the president of the Security Council, Anwarul Chowdhury of
Bangladesh, at the end of a closed Council meeting beginning here
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Council members call on the RUF leader Foday Sankoh to order
his forces to end immediately all human rights abuses; to ensure
immediately removal of all RUF roadblocks -- for which there is no
justification; and to return all weapons illegally seized" from U.
N. peace-keepers, "as he has previously agreed," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members view with deep concern reports of continuing
human rights abuses, in particular gross violence against women
and girls, being committed by rebel groups, especially as the
International Women's Day is being observed today, as well as
reports of a serious humanitarian situation especially in those
parts of the country where UNAMSIL (the U.N. Mission in Sierra
Leone) access is being obstructed," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable given the commitment made by all parties
to the Lome Peace Agreement to ensure protection and promotion of
human rights and unhindered access throughout the country," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Warring parties signed a peace accord in Lome, capital of Togo,
in July last year. The cease-fire is generally held at present,
but the demobilization and disarmament process slowed down with
RUF fighters still controlling most of the mining areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement voiced its welcome to the March 2
meeting in Bamako, capital of Mali, to facilitate the peace
process in Sierra Leone and called on all concerned to adhere to
its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"Council members urge UNAMSIL and Government of Sierra Leone
to investigate all reports of human rights abuses," the statement
said. "They recall that there is no amnesty for crimes committed
after signature of the Lome Peace Agreement, and no absolute bar
to prosecution of crimes committed before then."

Hernando Hernandez, Workers Syndicated Union chairman and
member of the Facilitation Commission, said Wednesday that thanks
to the agreement, troops would withdraw from a zone in the south
of Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the official announcement will be made next

<P>
More than 1,600 people were killed in Colombia's armed

<P>
In order to achieve peace in the South American country,
President Andres Patrana pulled thousands of troops from a vast
southern region in November 1998. But he has refused to
demilitarize Bolivar, a traditional ELN stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Over recent months, the 5,000-strong group has pressured
Pastrana with a devastating sabotage compaign, blocking roads and
dynamiting oil pipelines and power pylons.

<HEADLINE> No Final Agreement on Allocation of Nazi Labor Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wolfgang Gibowski, a spokesman for German industry, told
reporters outside the U.S. State Department building that he
expected the talks, now in their 11th month, to resume in Berlin
later this month to finish the details on the sharing of the 10
billion Deutsche marks (about 4.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks, convened at the State Department, were
chaired by Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat and chief
German negotiator Otto Lambsdorff.
</P>
<P>
"We are in really tough negotiations. We are very close, that's
obvious, but there is still one link missing and that's the
insurance issue," Gibowski said.
</P>
<P>
About 1.24 million slaves, mainly Jews, and forced laborers,
mainly from eastern Europe and central Europe detained during the
war by the Nazis will be the beneficiaries from the German
compensation.
</P>
<P>
The difference now among the negotiators was whether the German
fund should cover any of the insurance claims and the exact
proportion of the fund that should go to about 1 million former
forced laborers, mainly from eastern and central Europe.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Affects Women in Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Honduran women are the ones
who suffer the most from the economic adjustment programs and
their poverty situation was intensified by the damage caused by
hurricane Mitch, a feminist activist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Maria Antonia Martinez, Womans Rights Center director, said
that although certain progress has been achieved for the benefit
of the women of her country, there are still practices and customs
that discriminate against them and prevent gender equality.
</P>
<P>
"The weight of Mitch is still felt by women and no measures
have been taken to alleviate that situation," said Martinez on the
occasion of the International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show a worsening in the living standards of women,
especially in the rural areas, after hurricane Mitch that scoured
the country in the last months of 1998, she added.
</P>
<P>
The leader said that despite the many international agreements
for the protection of women, their application is slow in Honduras
because of the lack of mechanisms for their full implementation.
</P>
<P>
Martinez said that the inclusion of women in high-ranking
public posts does not mean that they raise the flag of the
feminist cause.
</P>
<P>
She said that Honduran President Carlos Flores has three women
in his cabinet and others occupy high-ranking posts in the Central
Bank, but they are in a position of subordination.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Formally Apply for Euro Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece is to submit its official
request for participation in the single currency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Athens' request will be examined by the European Commission,
the European Union's executive arm, and the European Central Bank
(ECB) which are expected to bring forth their opinions in May.
</P>
<P>
A final decision is expected for the European Union summit in
Oporto, Portugal, on June 19-20.
</P>
<P>
According to the EU sources, leading international institutions,
such as International Monetary Fund and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, and financial analysts
generally predict that the request will be endorsed, and this
positive response is likely to be accompanied by commitments on
the part of the euro's 12th member.
</P>
<P>
Recent data shows that 75 percent of Greeks support entry into
the single currency. Meanwhile, inflation remains the principle
criterion to be fulfilled. Greek prices remained 0.07 percent
above the qualification threshold.
</P>
<P>
On January 15, the European Commission's Economic and Financial
Committee revalued the Greek drachma's central rate within the
European Monetary System (EMS) by 3.5 percent, notably to permit a
"more rapid" decline in interest rates and more rigorous control
of inflation. Greece's updated convergence program was endorsed by
EU
finance ministers during their meeting in Brussels on January 31.

<P>
HAVANA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 persons died Wednesday
in the wreckage of a boat off the western coast of Puerto Rico,
Puerto Rican authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The boat had aboard 70 Dominicans who wanted to enter illegally
to Puerto Rico, said the sources, according to reports reaching
here from San Juan.
</P>
<P>
The home-built boat had left Higuey, in the east of the
Dominican Republic, said one of the seven survivors of the
wreckage.
</P>

Puerto Rican authorities recovered 10 bodies and 20 to 25 are
still seen floating in the waters, said a spokesman from the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) office in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
He said that the boat sank when one of those aboard dropped an
anchor, which could not reach the bottom, thus destabilizing the
boat.
</P>
<P>
An INS spokesman said that another boat with undocumented
Dominicans reached the Puerto Rico coast in the same zone where
the other boat sank.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Women Earn 15 Percent Less Than Men </HEADLINE>

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's female employees earn
10 to 15 percent less than their male colleagues, even if they do
the same job, local media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Women also have less of a right to a company car. Facts which
many women already assumed to be true are now documented by
figures.
</P>
<P>
The annual earnings survey conducted by SD Worx reveals that
women tend to earn less for the same work than men, and taking the
example of male head accountants, 20 percent drive a company car
as opposed to 12 percent of women in the same function.
</P>
<P>
The trend applies to most sectors, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
On the International Women's Day Wednesday, several Belgian
political parties called for more woman in politics. Currently,
there are 10 female ministers and secretaries of state from a
total of 55 in the federal government.

OTTAWA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced an additional 10
million Canadian dollars (about 6.9 million U.S. dollars)
