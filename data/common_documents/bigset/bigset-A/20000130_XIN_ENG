<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Calls 36-hour Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi opposition Saturday
announced 36-hour countrywide hartal (general strike) beginning
from February 2 dawn to February 3 dusk, demanding immediate
withdrawal of the Public Safety (Special Provisions) Bill 2000.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing here, Secretary General of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan described the
Public Safety Bill 2000 as a "draconian law" only to repress the
voice of the opposition and the citizens.
</P>
<P>
He noted that though there are so many laws for ensuring public
safety, unfortunately the government is giving a damn about the
countrywide protest to this black bill and decided to table it so
hurriedly.
</P>
<P>
The BNP secretary general said that the opposition alliance has
no option but to call this countrywide 36-hour shut-down.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that opposition alliance would observe
demonstration day on January 31 in all districts protesting the
bill.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan called upon all political parties,
professional bodies and countrymen to support the hartal for
resisting the bill.
</P>
<P>
The controversial Public Safety Bill 2000 was introduced in the
parliament Thursday. The bill had been framed for quick trial of
the offenders committing extortion, hijacking, obstruction of
traffic on road, rail and water-way, braking cars or damaging
public or private property.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Mohmmad Nasim, who placed this bill in the house,
said Thursday that the new law aims at ensuring peace and safety
of public life by bringing the culprits to justice rapidly.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jet Fighters Blast Hezbollah Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli jet fighters bombed on
Sunday several Hezbollah positions inside the security zone in
south Lebanon in retaliation for the killing of the deputy
commander of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
The air strike was ordered Sunday afternoon shortly after the
SLA deputy commander, Colonel Akel Hashem, was killed in a bomb
attack.
</P>
<P>
The explosion went off near the Hashem's home in the village of
Debl in the western sector of the so-called security zone Israel
set up in 1985 with the declared aim of protecting its north from
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, believed to be backed by Syria and
Israel, has claimed the responsibility of the attack on the second
in command of the Israeli proxy militia. Hashem was hated by the
resistance movement as a traitor.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the attack, Israeli Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh pledged to avenge his death. "The murder of Hashem can
not pass without retaliation and I believe that his death will not
weaken the SLA, whose anger will only be boosted by this tough
blow," Sneh told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Sneh also attacked Syria for intensifying Hezbollah attack in an
effort to pressure Israel on stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syria refuses to continue peace talks with Israel in the United
States until Israel gives a clear commitment to a full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
"Syria has given free rein to Hezbollah and allowed it to carry
out an attack which could spark a deterioration in the situation,"
he said, adding that "this proves that Damascus is not really
interested in the success of peace talks with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Israel has been bogged down in a war of attrition with
resistance groups in south Lebanon since it carved out a border
strip as a self-style security zone there after two invasions.
</P>
<P>
Its pullout from the so-called "Israel's Vietnam" will be part
of the future peace talks with Syrian and Lebanon. Barak has set
July as the time to bring the young soldiers back home even without
a security arrangement with Beirut.

<HEADLINE> UAE Repeats Call for Iran to Solve Islands Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Sunday repeated its call for Iran to take sincere actions to solve
a long-standing dispute between the two countries over three
strategic Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has always pursued a peaceful solution to the dispute
over the islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, either
through serious and direct negotiations, or by referring the issue
to international arbitration, said UAE president Sheikh Zayed Bin
Sultan Al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to a response from Iran to these sincere
efforts to end its occupation of the islands to ensure the security
and stability of the region," Zayed told a meeting of the Federal
National Council, a consultative body which serves as the Gulf
country's parliament.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claim full sovereignty over the three
islands, which have been controlled by Tehran since 1971 when
British forces withdrew from the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Iran insists that the two countries hold unconditional dialog
over the "misunderstanding" and rejects the idea of international
arbitration. The UAE, however, maintains that there should be a
time limit for dialogs, and if dialogs cannot solve the dispute
over a limited period, the issue should be referred to the
International Court of Justice in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read on his behalf by Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh
Sultan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Zayed also welcomed the setting up a
tripartite committee by foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Oman and
Qatar last July to help mediate the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Solution of the dispute "will ensure security and stability of
the region based on fraternal relations, good neighborliness and
understanding," Zayed said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Iraq to cooperate with the United Nations so that
economic sanctions on the country could be lifted and the continued
plight and suffering of the Iraqi people come to an end.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, the president reiterated his
stand that Israel should withdraw from all Arab lands to achieve a
just, comprehensive and permanent peace.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Conduct National Survey on Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Statistical Department of
Jordan will launch a nationwide survey on unemployment early
February to clear up conflicting figures on the jobless rate, the
department said in a statement on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, expected to continue for one month, will canvass 8,
800 families across the country with a total population of 4.7
million.
</P>
<P>
The survey will provide a detailed data base on the demographic,
social and economic characteristics to researchers, policy and
decision makers, the department said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is one the most controversial issues of
the kingdom, with the department putting it at 14 percent by the
end of last December as against more than 27 percent by independent
analysts and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the department said it manipulated the results of the
unemployment rate through different methodologies to cater to the
need of changing political circumstances, a charge which was firmly
denied by officials with the statistical authority.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming survey would also help the kingdom to rout out a 1.
5-million-strong illegal labor force.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are Egyptians, Iraqis and Palestinians who are
doing, without work permits, low-income and laborious jobs which
were shunned by status-conscious Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
The government had expelled more than 100,000 illegal workers
since last December in a nationwide campaign to streamline the
labor markets.

start in the next few days.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Khatami Voices Iran's Readiness to Cooperate with Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- President Mohammad Khatami on
Sunday voiced Iran's readiness to cooperate with Lebanon and help
it reclaim its due status and position through development and
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Lebanese Minister of Economy and
Commerce Nasser Saidi, Khatami said that it is necessary for Iran
and Lebanon to adopt suitable strategies for expanding their
bilateral relations in all areas.
</P>
<P>
By utilizing its cultural, humanitarian, historical and natural
facilities, Lebanon can turn into a center of development and
progress in the Arab world and the Middle East, Khatami said,
quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Khatami thanked the Lebanese government and officials for their
support for the Lebanese resistance against Israel, saying Lebanon
has always been innocent and subject to injustice and aggression,
but even in the most critical conditions it never lost its cultural
and humanitarian dignity.
</P>
<P>
Saidi, who is here to attend the Beirut-Tehran Joint Economic
Commission session, submitted Khatami a written message from
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
Thanking Iran for its spiritual, financial and political
support, the Lebanese official called for Iran's active
contribution to implementation of development and reconstruction
projects in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Saidi on Sunday also met Iranian First Vice President Hassan
Habibi, who expressed hope that cooperation between the two
countries will further develop within the framework of their joint
economic commission.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Hand over More Land to Palestinians: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said here Sunday that the peace process has reached a moment when a
decision has to be made, and promised to deliver more territories
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference following his talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Barak said it was high time a
decision be made by leaders of the region in order to bring people
peace, security and prosperity in the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he will turn over another "piece of
territory" to the Palestinians within 10 days. Israel was to hand
over a further 6.1 percent of the West Bank on January 20, in the
third phase of troop redeployment provided for by the Sharm el
Sheikh memorandum it signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal was postponed because of a dispute over the land
to be included. But this time Barak did not clarify what parts of
the lands will be ceded to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Barak arrived here earlier Sunday for consultations with Mubarak
on how to speed up the peace process. During the talks, they
discussed general issues before "delving into" those on the Syrian,
Palestinian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has recently concluded visits to Gulf Arab states and
Syria and Jordan, pushing for an Arab summit to coordinate Arab
stance and promote solidarity in talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told the press conference that Egypt is willing to see
progress on all the three tracks and ready to offer "all the help
it could."
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit came as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators held
their first session of planned 10-day intensive talks to work out a
final-status framework before the February 13 deadline. Many
believe the target date is unlikely to be met since there has been
little progress in final-status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
After wrapping up the talks which lasted a few hours at an
undisclosed location in northern Jerusalem, both sides signaled
optimism, saying they were closer to a peace deal and arrived at "
the moment of truth."
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with Syria have been suspended indefinitely
after two rounds. The Syrians are demanding a clear Israeli
commitment to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights it captured
in the 1967 Mideast War before they return to the talks.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Barak affirmed that Israel was ready to
resume talks with Syria whenever it was ready. He said he
appreciated the Syrians' need for some time before going back to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He also urged regional parties concerned to share the hope for
boosting the peace process between israel and its neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Expects No Breakthrough in Resumed Proximity Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf
Denktash, on Sunday poured cold water on the high expectations of
breakthrough in the forthcoming proximity talks between the Turkish
and the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"it would be wrong to expect a result from the (Geneva)
proximity talks," Denktash told reporters in Istanbul before
leaving for Geneva to participate in the two-week second round of
the proximity talks with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, a Greek
Cypriot.
</P>
<P>
In response to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's call,
Clerides and Denktash held the first round of the proximity talks
in New York last December and agreed to start the second round on
January 31 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Denktash indicated that the aim of the Geneva talks is to
prepare favorable grounds for face-to-face talks and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
Glafcos Clerides said Saturday that the Greek Cypriot side will
not turn the U.N.-brokered proximity talks into confidence building
measure talks with the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to the talks to discuss the substance of the
Cyprus problem, and not the measures", because the measures could
be discussed in Cyprus, Clerides noted before leaving for Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when the
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been pushing for the reunification of Cyprus in a
bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but no significant
achievements have been scored so far.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots, backed by Ankara, demanded that their
breakaway republic be recognized and that the talks with Nicosia be
on equal basis.
</P>
<P>
On August 31, 1998, Denktash put forward a proposal that a
confederation formed by two sovereign states be set up in the
Mediterranean island as a way out of the Cyprus crisis. But the
idea was rejected by the Greek Cypriots and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The thaw of relations between Greece and Turkey, which emerged
in the wake of earthquakes in the two countries last Summer, and
the European Union's decision in December to accept Turkey as a
candidate for membership, have raised hopes for a settlement of the
26-year-old Cyprus dispute.
</P>
<P>
De Soto, special adviser to Annan, who will be conducting the
Geneva talks, said, "There has been a thawing of relations between
Greece and Turkey. Obviously there are favorable winds blowing."
</P>
<P>
However, Greece and Turkey, anxious to promote their improving
ties, expressed cautious optimism before the crucial talks on
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Geneva, Annan is due to meet with
Clerides and Denktash respectively on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Seeks Final Solution to Saudi Pilot Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Saudi Arabia will carry
out a joint search plan to find the whereabouts of a Saudi jet
fighter downed by Iraqi forces in the 1991 Gulf War and its pilot,
the Iraqi News Agency (INA) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's foreign ministry is making final preparations for the
joint search, which will give a final answer to whether the pilot
died or is still alive but in Iraq's hand.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the INA, the foreign ministry said
that in 1997, Iraq informed Saudi authorities through the
International Committee of the Red Cross of having credible
information of the death of the Saudi pilot who had been buried by
an Iraqi officer in the desert.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's delegation to the technical committee meetings held in
southern Iraqi port city of Um Qasr in July 1997 presented some
pieces of the jet wreckage and allowed the Saudi experts to meet
the Iraqi officer who buried the pilot, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that Iraq also received a Swiss expert in August 1998
who checked the pieces of the wreckage and confirmed that the jet
belonged to the Saudi Air Force.
</P>
<P>
The statement refuted a story carried Thursday by the London
based Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat newspaper which quoted the Saudi pilot's
family as saying that the pilot is still alive in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Why would a paper "which is known of its deep connection with
the Saudi authorities" publish such allegations in a time we are
about to complete preparations to find the pilot's corpse, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf earlier this month
also refuted the Saudi authorities' claims that the Saudi pilot was
seen detained by the Iraqi authorities.
</P>
<P>
"These allegations might be an excuse to withdraw from the joint
search plan after an American pressure on Saudi to do so in order
to keep this file open to go on with their aggressive policy
against Iraq," concluded the statement.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf War touched off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia joined the multinational forces led by the U.S. in
driving Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Celebrates King's Birthday in Low Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Sunday celebrated in low
key the 38th birthday of King Abdullah Bin Hussein who is attending
the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
No public rallies were held. Only portraits of Abdullah and
Queen Rania were carried on front pages of local newspapers and the
extravaganza fireworks in the evening could indicate that the
kingdom was celebrating the birthday of one of the youngest
monarchs of the world.
</P>
<P>
This is the first birthday of Abdullah since he acceded to the
throne last February after his father King Hussein died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
He is quickly emerging as a young, dynamic and pragmatic ruler
of the desert kingdom, and he has made it his first priority to
develop the national economy and alleviate poverty among the 4.7
million Jordanians, one third of whom are living under poverty
lines.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, the king is attending the Davos World Economic
Forum which was also attended by other state leaders and hundreds
of world-renowned experts and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech to the forum on Sunday, Abdullah briefed
participants of the forum on business and investment opportunities
in Jordan in a bid to attract the much-need foreign capital into
the kingdom, which suffered a record foreign debts of 7.8 billion
U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The trip to Davos is part of his busy diplomatic agenda to rally
international support for the economic development of his kingdom,
which had been severely affected by the 1990 Gulf Crisis.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian Army to Stage 2 Maneuvers on Revolution Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian army will launch two
unprecedented military exercises Monday on the eve of the "10-day
Dawn" to mark 21st anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution, a
senior commander announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commander of the ground force Brigadier General Ebrahim
Ashtiani said the maneuvers entitled as "Zolfaqar of Velayat 1 and
2" is designed to boost rapid deployment of the ground force. They
will be carried out in western and southern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
During the war games, the air force will reinforce the ground
force and the air-borne units of the ground forces will offer
airborne operations with helicopters, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ashtiani said that in the first exercise, troops will be
dispatched from northwestern Iran to three areas of Ahvaz, Dezful
and Abadan in the southwestern province of Khuzestan and then will
be lifted by choppers to the southern borders to go on the
exercises.
</P>
<P>
The second exercise in western Iran will include dispatching
parachute troops on board C-130 aircraft from Shiraz, the southern
Fars province to the western towns of Mehran, Salehabad and Ilam in
the border province of Ilam, he said.
</P>
<P>
The parachute troops of the ground force will join two armored
and infantry divisions immediately after landing and will go on
mopping-up operations in the border areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army on Thursday also announced to launch a one-day
military exercise named "Fajr (Dawn) 21" on Saturday. However, no
report is available so far about the war game.
</P>
<P>
The "10-day Dawn" celebration starts on February 1 to mark the
return of late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini
from France in 1979 and will culminate with a massive rally on
February 11, the day of victory of the Islamic Revolution.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid wrapped up his three-day visit to Saudi Arabia
Sunday after holding talks with King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here earlier Sunday said that talks between
Wahid and Fahd covered regional, Islamic and world issues of common
concern, including the Middle East peace process and the situation
in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's English daily Arab News said in a front-page
story on Saturday that Wahid's two-week-long foreign tour would
take him to more than a dozen of European and Asian countries to
muster aid, investment and support for his country and his four-
month-old government.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Alliance Adopted by Main Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- About 900 delegates of Canada's
main opposition Reform voted Saturday to adopt a political
alliance with Conservative in a bid to unseat the ruling Liberal
in the next election.
</P>
<P>
Under the banner of the Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance,
a platform has been worked out for a future coalition stressing
family values, a low-tax rate and tough action on crime.
</P>
<P>
"Think big" in favor of a broader, more powerful conservative
political movement, Reform leader Preston Manning urged the
delegates in a 70-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine election night, watching the tide of support for
a new government sweep east to west," he told the delegates amid
wild applause.
</P>
<P>
Manning has vowed to step down if Reform members should
otherwise vote against joining the Canadian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Outcomes are yet to be announced after a leadership review at
the end of the three-day convention of the Reform Party, which was
created 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Reformers will also need a final vote in February and March on
joining the Canadian Alliance, with results expected on March 25.
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority is required for an organization to
become a registered party.

<HEADLINE> Investors Lose Money in Broker Chaos in City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) - Investors in Britain have lost a
great sum of money because of serious technical problems at some
of Britain's biggest stock brokers.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the BBC released Sunday discovered that
investors are often unable to get through to their telephone-based
brokers to trade shares.
</P>
<P>
Lines are routinely engaged and investors are put on hold for
up to two hours. Brokers are also delaying buying or selling
shares once they have been instructed to act by customers.
</P>
<P>
The delays are costing many people thousands of pounds because
they are unable to sell quickly as share prices plunge.
</P>
<P>
Kennech Ashworth, an investor, was unable to sell shares
recently in Intelligence Environment through his broker for more
than 48 hours and finally lost 9000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
By the time he managed to deal, the shares had fallen in value
by almost 25 percent. His broker offered just 3000 pounds in
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Ashworth said: "The mechanism for telephone dealing just does
not work."

<HEADLINE> Feature: U.S. Institute Makes Chinese New Year Accessible to New Yorkers  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Putting down a pair of mini-
scissors and gently opening the folded paper, Olivia, a 7-year
blond girl, greeted her first paper-cut works with a broad smile --
a big Chinese character "Chun", meaning "Spring" in English, cut
out of a piece of red paper.
</P>
<P>
Although she could not write the Chinese word, she, under the
patient instruction from a Chinese teacher, managed to cut a big
Chinese character "Spring" and a fish out of a piece of red paper,
the first time she did paper-cutting.
</P>
<P>
"I am very exciting about it," said Olivia."I'll bring this
back home and put it on the wall. Let everybody enjoy it."
</P>
<P>
She is one of the 30-odd children, ranged from 3-15 in ages,
who attended a workshop organized by China Institute in America,
the first and only cultural and educational institution in New
York with an exclusive focus on China.
</P>
<P>
Every year around the time when the Chinese New Year's Day is
drawing near, China Institute endeavors to make some of the most
interesting Chinese traditions accessible to the entire New York
community.
</P>
<P>
A yellow lion and a green lion are dancing in front of the
China Institute building. Children and their parents are listening
to the stories about the Chinese New Year tradition. Americans are
being taught how to make dumplings, known as jiaozi, a small meat-
and-vegetable-filled dumplings.
</P>
<P>
"We are striving to make Americans understand Chinese culture
much better," Torrey Whitman, the lawyer-turned president of China
Institute. "This is very good for the Sino-American relations."
</P>
<P>
"Besides paper-cutting, children will be able to write their
own New Year's couplet, and listen to stories about the 12 animals
of the Chinese zodiac," France Pepper, program coordinator at the
China Institute, said.
</P>
<P>
"These programs are not boring at all, and my children can
learn the tradition of the Spring Festival in the process of
playing," Zhong Peijun, a mother who stood by while her children
were doing paper-cutting, said. "Actually, I don't want my
children to forget my culture and tradition."
</P>
<P>
Much like a Christmas holiday Western countries, Chinese New
Year's Day is the most important and popular of Chinese festivals -
- a time when families and friends come together to celebrate, a
time to remember forebears, pay respect to elders and treat
friends and children with gift and money. No matter where one
stays, he will manage to get home for family reunion on the New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
Each Chinese year is popularly known by one of the 12 animals
of the Chinese Zodiac, and the coming New Year's Day, which falls
on February 5, is the Year of Dragon, a year people think will
bring good fortune.
</P>
<P>
Attending the programs sponsored by China Institute, people
can enjoy the festival atmosphere ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1926, China Institute is a nonprofit educational
and cultural institution that promotes the understanding,
appreciation and enjoyment of traditional and contemporary Chinese
civilization, culture and heritage and provides the cultural and
historical context for understanding contemporary China.
</P>
<P>
The institute offers programs, activities, courses and seminars
on art, both visual and performing, culture, history, music,
philosophy, language and literature, appropriate for people of all
ages and backgrounds, as well as children's programming, business
and current affairs programs and professional development programs
for teachers.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, being the president of China Institute makes much
less money than a lawyer," said Whitman, who began to study
Chinese at Stanford University 35 years ago, and later at Oxford
University in England. "But I love the Chinese culture very much,
and I like to work hard to introduce the Chinese culture to
Americans, including the U.S.-born Chinese."
</P>
<P>
"Non-Chinese people are interested in the Chinese culture, and
Chinese Americans are learning Chinese culture to find out their
roots," he said.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Repeats Call for IRA to Disarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Protestant
leader David Trimble made a last ditch plea to the Irish
Republican Army(IRA) on Sunday to disarm and save the province's
peace drive.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not write things off prematurely," Trimble said as
tension grew in the province's peace process on the eve of
publication of a key report about disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"It may be just a day or two left but even in a day or two
things can happen which will enable us to proceed. And there's
still time for the Republican Movement to demonstrate whether or
not they have sufficient good faith," the Ulster Unionist Party(
UUP) leader told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
"I hope very much that the Republican Movement realize that
this best chance that they have mustn't be thrown away."
</P>
<P>
Trimble refused to be drawn whether he would follow through on
a threat to resign as the province's First Minister if the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) does not disarm to seal a cease-fire that it
declared some 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
General John de Chastelain, a Canadian who heads the province's
disarmament authority, is to submit a report to the British and
Irish government on Monday which is widely expected to state that
no weapons have yet been handed in.
</P>
<P>
The UUP agreed to form a home-rule administration with Sinn
Fein, the political arm of the IRA, and other parties in December
but said that its survival would depend on early IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said on Sunday that he could not
guarantee that the guerrilla force would disarm by May 22, a key
objective of the landmark Good Friday Accord signed in April 1998.

<HEADLINE> Russians Protest Albright Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 30 (Xinhua) -- About 150 Russians held a rally
Sunday in front of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, protesting against
a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright.
</P>
<P>
The protesters included activists of left-wing and orthodox
organizations, the Interfax news agency reported, citing city
police.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrives here late Sunday on a two-day official
visit, is expected to discuss with her Russian hosts bilateral
ties, the Middle East peace process, arms control and Moscow's
military campaign against rebels in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been critical of the military actions, citing
concern over civilian casualties while expressing support of
Russia's battle against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Leonid Petrovsky, a Communist Party member who leads the People
's Communist Movement, said: "Madeleine Albright hypocritically
talks about the violation of human rights in Chechnya, concealing
one of the goals of her visit - to save the Chechen bandits from
utter defeat."
</P>
<P>
The protesters carried posters that called for prevention of
Albright's visit, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Grandmothers Leave U.S. for Cuba without Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We are grieving that Elian is still here," the boy's paternal
grandmother Quintana said. "He will never be happy because he grew
up in Cuba," she added before boarding a private plane at the
Dulles International Airport, about 50 kilometers from Washington.
</P>
<P>
"He is a Cuban boy. He has a father. He has four grandparents
and an entire family back there," Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
"We think we have reached part of what we were planning to do
here. We came to the U.S. to defend the right of our grandson to
go back home to Cuba. We think we had a step forward," said
maternal grandmother Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
Elian's grandmothers spent more than a week in the United
States campaigning for the boy's return to his father in Cuba.
They lobbied hard but unsuccessfully in Congress and elsewhere for
permission to take Elian with them on Sunday's flight.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) ordered
the boy's relatives in Forida to make the boy available for a
meeting with his grandmothers. The two women visited the boy
Wednesday at a neutral site in Miami Beach, Florida, later
describing him as emotionally drained and incommunicative.
</P>
<P>
"Our grandson is a whole different boy. He has changed
completely. We have to save this boy as soon as possible,"
Quintana said last week.
</P>
<P>
Elian's Miami relatives spoke to lawmakers, too, urging support
for the citizenship bill and saying the youngster did not want to
go back.
</P>
<P>
The INS earlier this month ruled the boy should be returned to
his father in Cuba. However, some lawmakers planned to vote to
offer U.S. citizenship to the boy, claiming that the INS is not
capable of making a judgment.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, about 200 people gathered at the INS office in
Miami, demanding the boy to be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
On November 25 last year, Elian was rescued at sea after a
harrowing capsize in which his mother and 10 other people fleeing
Cuba drowned.

they had charged a 49-year-old man with the murder of county

LUSAKA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) said Sunday that it has airlifted 210 tons of food
to Angolan refugees camped at the western Zambian border post of
Kalabo.
</P>
<P>
A WFP spokeswoman said in Lusaka that the U.N. agency now has
enough food in Kalabo to feed 4,000 refugees for three months.
</P>
<P>
The airlift took over seven days and a total of 30 flights were
done by the WFP to complete the job, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that her agency has worked with the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to move 2,288 Angolans from the
border post to the inland center Mayukwayukwa camp in Western
Province where they can have access to food, medicine and shelter.
</P>
<P>
The WFP estimated that there are about 1,500 refugees left in
Kalabo, with small numbers of people still crossing the border
each day.
</P>
<P>
Angolan refugees have been pouring across the border into
Zambia as they flee raging civil war in their country between the
government troops and the rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
With the recent influx, Zambia now hosts more than 200,000
refugees, making it the largest refugee destination followed by
Namibia in the southern Africa.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Introduce Law on Currency, Forex Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said Sunday that his government will soon introduce
legislation to fix the Zimbabwean dollar and control the flow of
foreign currency out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government was cheated by unscrupulous financial experts to
devalue the local currency purportedly to attract more foreign
currency, the president told a rally attended by over 15,000
people in Epworth near capital Harare.
</P>
<P>
At the rally of the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), Mugabe said that the fall of the
Zimbabwean dollar has made life very difficult for many people and
prices of imported goods have gone beyond the means of many.
</P>
<P>
The prevailing shortage of foreign currency in the southern
African country is artificial because most local exporters prefer
to keep their money in foreign bank accounts, the president
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of land, the president noted that his government
cannot continue e political
violence which retards development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that opposition parties such as the Movement for
Democratic Change and the Zimbabwe Union of Democrats have no
roots.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the ruling party's strength lay in the
women and youth leagues, urging them to embark on a
house-to-house campaign to mobilize people to join the party and
vote yes during the referendum on the draft constitution next
month.
</P>
<P>
The Movement for Democratic Change Saturday launched its
offensive against the ruling party towards the parliamentary
election by unveiling a manifesto ' s ZANU-PF government of mismanaging the economy,
is seeking a chance to take over the reins of power.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians End First Round of Intensive Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators wrapped up the first round of intensive talks on final-
status issues started earlier Sunday with an aim of reaching a
permanent peace framework by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran for several
hours at an undisclosed location in northern Jerusalem, chief
Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo said the talks would
continue Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides launched the 10-day marathon talks Sunday morning
in an effort to clinch a framework agreement by February 13, the
target date set in the Sharm el Sheikh interim peace deal signed in
September.
</P>
<P>
With the deadline merely half a month away, doubts have been
cast over whether the two sides could meet their target since they
are almost as far apart as before over the core issues such as fate
of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Eran has repeated several times in the last few days that it was
unlikely that the deadline would be met.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the main broker in the peace talks, also
admitted that Israel and the Palestinian might fall short of their
target on the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't meet it, they'll reach some understanding about
how to deal with that problem, " a senior U.S. official said
Saturday after a 30-minute meeting between Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Davos, Switzerland, on the sidelines of
the World Economic Forum conference.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo said Saturday that the February 13 target date could be
postponed if the Israelis showed seriousness during the coming
round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the talks, Prime Minister Ehud Barak will meet
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat Thursday at
the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Palestinian-rule Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have criticized Barak for canceling his trip to
Davos Friday, saying he was attempting to avoid a summit between
Arafat and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Some viewed the cancellation as a sign of Barak's reluctance to
invite increased U.S. involvement on the peace talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak arrived in Cairo Sunday afternoon for talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on ways of advancing the Middle East peace
process, on both the Palestinian and Syria tracks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is due to
arrive in the region Wednesday to give the Israeli-Palestinian
talks a new push.

CAIRO, January 30 ( Xinhua ) -- The following are economic news
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's sugar imports over the past five years rose by
203 percent, or 51 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The Arab economic daily, Alalam Elyom, on Sunday quoted a report
released by Cairo Chamber as saying that the imports of raw sugar
climbed from 276 tons in 1994 to 1.3 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the sharp increase of the sugar imports
led to the accumulation of large stocks of sugar in the national
companies.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of Egypt's raw sugar imports are from Brazil,
Cuba and Australia while some 77.5 percent of the refined sugar
from Brazil and France.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Industrial investments in Saudi Arabia rose to about
163 billion riyals (one U.S dollar equals to 3.750 Saudi riyals ),
with non-petroleum industrial production dominating around 38
billion riyals, which is expected to reach 50 billion riyals by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Arab economic daily, Alalam Elyom, on Sunday quoted Saudi
official as saying the industrial investments in Jubail and Yanbu
areas alone amounted to some 95 billion riyals.
</P>
<P>
Jiddah -- Jiddah International Fairs Company (JIFC) said it
would hold its first fair of Saudi industries in Aden, Yemen,
between April 2 and 7 with 75 firms participating.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni market is very important for the Saudi exporters who
seek new burgeoning neighboring markets such as the Eritrean,
Ethiopian, Djiboutian and Somali markets, JIFC Board Chairman
Abdullah Mar'e Bin-Mahfouz was quoted by the Arabic daily Al-Sharq
El-Awsat as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi-Yemeni trade volume has recently risen by 20 to 40
percent to hit 950 million riyals, Bin-Mahfouz added.
</P>
<P>
Sanaa -- A number of documents on trade and investment are
scheduled to be signed by Yemen and Qatar. The documents aim at
preventing double taxation and promoting the exchanges in the
fields of youth and sports, education, health, air transport and
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony will be held here on Sunday by the
conclusion of the two-day session of the Yemeni-Qatari joint
committee, the Arabic daily Al-Hayat reported on its economic page.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni-Qatari joint committee was first headed by the foreign
ministers of the two countries, then its chairmanship was moved to
the ministers of finance.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Malaysian Bourses to Hold Formal Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Malaysian
bourses will have their first face-to-face meeting on the CLOB
issue Monday, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was quoted as
confirming Sunday that the first formal face-to-face meeting
between the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) on the CLOB issue will take place on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lee told reporters, "As the exchange will be meeting the KLSE
tomorrow,We will see what they come up with. We don't conduct
negotiations in public."
</P>
<P>
The meeting follows Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin's
latest letter in reply to one from Singapore's Finance Minister
Richard Hu on the CLOB issue.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Daim expressed his view that the CLOB issue
should be discussed and resolved between the KLSE and SGX and he
agreed that an early resolution of the matter would be in the
interest of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Some 11.5 billion CLOB shares belonging to 172,000 investors
have been frozen since the imposition of capital control and
changes to the law by Malaysia forced the trading of Malaysian
counters on Singapore's CLOB International market to cease on
September 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the KLSE's Securities Clearing Automated Network
Services (SCANS) and SGX's Central Depository signed an agreement
on procedures to migrate CLOB shares to individual accounts of
CLOB investors to be opened with the Malaysian Central Depository
(MCD).
</P>
<P>
Up to now, no solution acceptable to both sides has been
arrived at on the issue although several proposals by the private
sector have been set forth.
</P>
<P>
Investors are hoping that Monday's meeting between the two
bourses will bring a resolution to the 17-month impasse.
</P>
<P>
Daim had earlier urged CLOB investors to consider the private
sector proposals already on the table.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lee stressed in the parliament two weeks ago that
the issue of 7.55 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.5 billion U.S.
dollars) in CLOB shares cannot be resolved by the private sector
and must be settled according to law.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that if no solution can be found in
negotiations,the case will be filed to the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Date of Meeting Between Arafat, Barak not Fixed: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 30 ( Xinhua ) -- A Palestinian official said on
Sunday no date has been fixed for a meeting between Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Redina, Arafat's advisor, said in an interview with
the "Voice of Palestine" radio, that the date of this meeting will
be fixed immediately after Arafat's return from Davos,
Switzerland , where he attends the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
U.S president Bill Clinton said after his meeting with Arafat in
Davos on Saturday that Arafat will meet with Barak at the weekend
at Erez crossing, while Israeli sources said Sunday morning the
meeting will be held next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a statement made by Dany Yaton, Barak' advisor for
political and security affairs, that the date of reaching a
framework agreement on the final status may be delayed, Abu Redina
said the stance weakens the efforts aimed at honouring the dates
included in the accords signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Abu Redina, currently accompanying Arafat in Davos, stressed
that Israel should be committed to the deadline of February 13 for
the signing of the final-status framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio Israel on Sunday morning, Yaton made
it clear that there are no any "sacred dates".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chief Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo said
clearly on Saturday that the fixed date might be postponed for a
short period, provided that Israel proves it is serious in solving
the issues of the final status.
</P>
<P>
In another development, in an unknown place in northern
Jerusalem, the Israeli and the Palestinian sides on Sunday started
their marathon talks on the final status phase in a bid to reach a
framework agreement as scheduled in the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum.

<HEADLINE> Lab to Study Tibetan Medicine and Natural Herbs in Lanzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A laboratory to test Tibetan
medicines and natural herbs has opened in Lanzhou, capital of
northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory, the first of its kind in China, was jointly
established by the Lanzhou Chemistry and Physics Research
Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the
Qizheng Tibetan Medicine Group.
</P>
<P>
With high-tech equipment and outstanding scientists, the lab
will make basic studies of the components of traditional Tibetan
medicines and natural herbs, and offer scientific support to their
pharmacology to aid them in entering the international market.
</P>
<P>
The Qizheng Group is a private high-tech enterprise with two
large facilities producing traditional Tibetan medicines, one in
Tibet and the other in Gansu. It also owns a 666-hectare natural
herbs reserve in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou Chemistry and Physics Research Institute of the CAS
has long history of researching natural herbal medicines. As early
as 1986, it began research on the components, structure, and
pharmacology of a number of natural herbs growing in northwest
China and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Its research in this area has scored several achievements,
according to local medical experts.
</P>
<P>
With these two strong entities joining hands, the laboratory is
expected to make a great contribution to research in this area,
and tap the potential market for these medicines, the experts
added.

<HEADLINE> SLA's No.2 Official KIlled in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Akl Hachem, the second-highest
ranking official of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army(SLA), was
killed on Sunday when Lebanese guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb
in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place in the village of Dibel, 60 kilometers
southwest of Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied enclave. It
was alleged that Hachem had been designated successor of SLA
commander Antoine Lahd.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group, which is leading a
war of attrition to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA
militiamen from southern Lebanon, has claimed responsibility for
the noon attack.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Hashem's death serves as a severe blow to Israel
and its allies in southern Lebanon. But there was no immediate
comment from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Two Hezbollah guerrillas were killed in a clash with SLA troops
in southern Lebanon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Israeli warplanes launched attacks on suspected
guerrilla positions in retaliation for an attack on one of its
positions.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in southern Lebanon in
1985 to protect its north from attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

<P>
MOGADISHU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Two civilians including a
woman were killed on Saturday night when Somali gunmen attacked
and looted the office of the British aid agency of Accord in
Sablaleh district of Lower Shabelleh region, some 230 km south of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
However, the Islamic court militiamen tracking the group of
seven gunmen killed, wounded and captured three of the looters
respectively after an exchange of heavy gunfire. The rest four
gunmen escaped with the booty and a abducted pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness in Sablaleh town said the gunmen looted a
short-wave radio which the agency used for contacting its offices
in other parts of Somalia and in Kenya, a photocopy machine,
unspecified amount of money and most of the office furniture.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Responds to Coup Scare in Benin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Mali and
Nigeria have sent their foreign ministers to Cotonou, capital of
Benin, to find out the detail of coup scare in the country, "The
Guardian" newspaper reported here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Alhaji Sule Lamido, and Ibrahim
Siddibe, foreign minister of Mali which is the current chairman of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), flew into
Cotonou and were immediately granted audience by President Mathieu
Kerekou.
</P>
<P>
After several hours of closed door meeting, no official
communique was issued on the outcome of their discussion,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
After his return from an official visit to Kuwait, President
Kerekou was reported to state that there were plans to remove him
from office through a military takeover.
</P>
<P>
However, he categorically refused to deliberate his
"allegation", just saying that he would give details "at the
appropriate time".
</P>
<P>
A few hours after the departure of the Nigerian and Malian
foreign ministers, Gaston Zesson, Benin's minister of
communications, reaffirmed that "there is indeed a coup d'etat in
the offing to overthrow this administration."
</P>
<P>
Members of the diplomatic community in Cotonou are of the
opinion that the story of the coup scare is traceable to continued
agitation by soldiers and officers who served for 12 months in
Liberia as members of the West African peace-keeping force of
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
These soldiers have openly challenged the Benin government and
gave what appeared as an ultimatum that their 12-month allowance
should be paid.
</P>
<P>
According to La Gazzette Du Golfe, a weekly magazine, some
Scandinavian countries and France gave about 1.6 million U.S.
dollars to the United Nations as their financial contribution to
the upkeep of Benin soldiers sent to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, in turn, gave the same amount of the money
to the Benin government. But, the magazine claims that the money
has been "misappropriated" by some highly placed individuals close
to President Kerekou.
</P>
<P>
The Benin government has neither denied nor confirmed the story
 published by the weekly news magazine.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Marathon Talks Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The final-status marathon
negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel started sunday,
the last-ditch efforts to meet the February 13 deadline for a
framework agreement on a permanent peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams, with Israeli side led by Oded Eran and
the Palestinians delegation headed by Yasser Abed Rabbo, met Sunday
morning in an undisclosed place in the north of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Dany Yaton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's chief of
political and security staff, said the first session of the 10-day
marathon talks is expected to end Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The talks will start in earnest Wednesday after the arrival of
the U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of Palestine quoted Yaton as saying the two sides may
not meet the deadline as stipulated in an interim peace deal last
September, indicating that the issue will be discussed by the
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Yaton pointed out that there are not sacred deadlines, saying
what really matters is to achieve the goal and to narrow the gap in
the attitude of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Voice of Palestine, Abed Rabbo suggested
that the Palestinian side is likely to soften its original stance
towards the committment to the date of the frame accord.
</P>
<P>
He said the postponement of the fixed date is conditioned on the
seriousness of the Israeli government to solve the issues of the
final-status, including the fate of Jerusalem, the future of Jewish
settlements, borders and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo affirmed that the negotiations are currently held in
pessimistic atmospheres and the Israeli position gives no
indication of any possible progress.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official described the ongoing negotiations as
the most crucial and the most decisive since Israel is demanded to
implement the third phase of troops redeployment in the West Bank
which has been delayed for almost two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the attitudes of the two sides towards some key
issues of the final status talks are still wide apart.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Launch Intensive Talks on Final-Status Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators Sunday launched intensive talks on final-status issues
with an aim to reach a framework agreement on a permanent peace
deal by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran met his Palestinian
counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo at an undisclosed place in the north
of Jerusalem, Israel Radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will hold marathon talks in the next two weeks in
an effort to clinch a framework agreement on final-status issues by
February 13 as stipulated in a September interim deal.
</P>
<P>
With the deadline merely half a month away, doubts have been
cast over whether the two sides could meet their target since they
are still far apart over thorny issues such as the fate of
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Eran has stated several times in the last few days that it was
unlikely that the deadline would be met.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the main broker in the peace talks, also
admitted that Israel and the Palestinian might fall short of their
target on the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't meet it, they'll reach some understanding about
how to deal with that problem," a senior U.S. official said
Saturday after a 30-minute meeting between Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Davos,
Switzerland, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum
conference.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo said Saturday that the February 13 target date could be
postponed if the Israelis showed seriousness during the coming
round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the talks, Prime Minister Ehud Barak will meet
Arafat Thursday at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the
Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have criticized Barak for canceling his trip to
Davos Friday, saying he was attempting to avoid tripartite summit
with Arafat and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Some viewed the cancellation as a sign of Barak's reluctance to
invite increased U.S. involvement in the peace talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
After the talks with Rabbo, Eran will accompany Barak on his
trip to Cairo later Sunday, during which the Israeli prime minister
will brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is due to
arrive in the region Wednesday to give the talks a new push.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Promises No Guarantee for Early Weapons Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said Sunday he cannot guarantee an arms decommissioning by the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) by May, which was originally set in
the Good Friday Agreement signed in April, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing, told the BBC that "
it isn't up to me to guarantee" the disarmament.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his full commitment to disarmament, he blamed
the unionists for their threats to walk out of the coalition
government which will harm the peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
His comments came at a crucial time for the peace process as
both sides of the political divide waiting for a key report on
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that the report, to be released on Monday by
General John de Chastelain, head of the international
decommissioning body, will show the IRA arsenal remains intact.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble, a Ulster
Unionist, has said his party will withdraw from the recently
formed executive if the IRA does not begin to decommission by
January 31. He has also called on all paramilitary groups to
disband.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Unionists pressed the British government to
suspend the eight-week-old Northern Ireland power-sharing
government set up under the Good Friday Agreement in a bid to
allow for a review of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, Adams indicated that the IRA will stop the cooperation
with the weapons decommissioning body if the Northern Ireland
coalition government is suspended or brought down.
</P>
<P>
"We have a crisis this week because a progress report from the
decommissioning body has been turned into a unilateral deadline by
one of the parties because of its own internal situation and
because of the problems unionism generally has," said Adams.
</P>
<P>
He said the report by the head of the decommissioning body "
will have to be a positive one" as "progress has been made".

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zhongguancun Science and
Technology Park in Beijing, known as China's "Silicon Valley,"
plans to earn 110 billion yuan (over 13 billion U.S. dollars) this
year to realize a growth rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
If this target is met, the technology park will turn in tax
payments of 3.3 billion yuan (about 398 million U.S. dollars) for
2000.
</P>
<P>
The park also will make every effort to increase its profit to
600 billion yuan (about 72.3 U.S. dollars) by the year 2010, said
Beijing Vice Mayor Liu Zhihua at the first annual meeting of the
Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park, which just ended.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park ranked first
among China's 52 high-tech development zones by scoring profits of
86.4 billion yuan (about 10.4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, up 39.
6 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The State Council approved a proposal to accelerate the
development of Zhongguancun last June as the number of new
enterprises has increased, with some 1,227 new businesses
registered to open in the park.
</P>
<P>
To reach this goal, Beijing will work out a comprehensive
design report on the further development of Zhongguancun in May,
when the city is scheduled to host a week-long international
science and technology exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Israel Supports Multilateral Talks in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming multilateral
talks in Moscow are important to bring about peace to the Middle
East and Israel supports the resumption of the talks, said a senior
Israeli Foreign Ministry official here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the multilateral talks on February 2, which
held the first meeting in 1992 and were frozen in early 1996, are
part of the Mideast peace process and the talks will not only
strengthen the peace in the region, but also enhance regional
cooperation, said Yoav Biran, deputy director-general on the
Mideast affairs of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Israel also believes that the talks could help end the conflict
in the region, offer the added value to concentration on
construction and upgrade cooperation between regional countries and
the countries outside the region in the fields of economy,
environment, water, refugees, regional security, he said.
</P>
<P>
But two major players in the Mideast peace process, Syria and
Lebanon, have indicated that they will not attend the Moscow
meeting as asked by Russia and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David levy is to fly to Moscow Sunday
afternoon for the talks as head of the Israeli delegation.
</P>
<P>
"We do hope that Syria and Lebanon could change their minds and
send their delegation to the talks," Biran said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has no objections to discuss political issues at the
talks, but still believes that such issues should better be
discussed by bilateral means," he added.
</P>
<P>
On regional security, he said Israel has no objection to Egypt's
proposal to discuss the nuclear issue during the talks, but
stressed that there will be no change of Israel's position on this
matter.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has expressed its concern about Israel's suspected nuclear
arsenal and Israel's refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, and said recently that it will lobby for a nuclear-free
zone in the Middle East during Moscow talks.

<P>
DHAKA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Parliament passed
Sunday the controversial Public Safety (Special Provisions) Bill
2000 in amended form with provisions for the speedy trial and
punishment of nine offenses of serious nature.
</P>
<P>
Piloted by Home Minister Muhammad Nasim, the bill is aimed at
improving the prevailing law and order situation by curbing
certain crimes which disturb peace.

<P>
Nine offenses identified by the act are hijacking,toll
extortion, grabbing of tender, damage of vehicles and property,
obstruction to traffic, demanding ransom after kidnapping, causing

<HEADLINE> Chilean Plane Arrives in UK for Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chilean air force plane has
arrived in Britain and is expecting to take former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet home if he is released, the British Defense
Ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 707 landed Saturday at an airbase of the Royal Air
Force (RAF) in Brize Norton, northwest of London.
</P>
<P>
Before its arrival, it had been waiting on the Bermuda island
in anticipation of the release of Pinochet, who has been under
house arrest in Britain for the last 15 months.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge attempts to extradite him for trial on charges
of torture and conspiracy during his 16-year rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw has said he is "minded" to
release the general after a panel of medical experts decided he
was unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
But Pinochet has to wait for the results of a number of legal
challenges before he can fly home.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, one of three other countries seeking Pinochet's
extradition, and six human rights organizations have requested a
judicial review of Straw's proposal.
</P>
<P>
London's High Court is due to rule on their request Monday.

powerful serves and volleys by winning the match 6-1, 6-4 and 6-2

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' First Private Airline Into Startup in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Helios Airways, the first
privately-owned Cypriot airline, will fly its first flight in May
this year, the Sunday Mail newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Destinations on the cards include Belfast, provincial capital of
the British-ruled Northern Ireland, Dublin, capital of Ireland and
cities of Poland.
</P>
<P>
But the airline will for the moment deal mainly with the British
market and plans to work closely with British-based independent
Cypriot tour operators.
</P>
<P>
The airline will operate 12-14 flights per week in summer and
will be in the air 20 hours per day.
</P>
<P>
The airline hopes to carry some 50,000 passengers this year,
increasing to 190,000 in 2001 and reaching 215,000 in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The firm this week recruited some 50 staff members, including
pilots and cabin crew. Three of the co-pilots have been recruited
from Eurocypria, the Cyprus Airways charter firm.
</P>
<P>
The initial captain vacancies will go to foreign pilots on a
three-year contract until the Cypriot pilots gain enough experience
to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Helios is being run by a Swiss management team, but the company,
set up in September 1998, is 90 percent Cypriot-owned.

LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Sponsors of the Millennium Dome have demanded that the
ailing attraction be taken over by the Tussauds group, operators
of Alton Towers theme park. The dome's biggest backers,
responsible for 160 million pounds of funding, have mounted a coup
to hand control of the attraction to Britain's top theme park
operator and owner of the world-famous waxworks.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Visitors to Britain from the Indian sub-continent will have
to put up a 10,000-pound bond if immigration officials suspect
that they will intend to settle illegally.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- Two hundred and forty-three seconds of awesome boxing power
ended two weeks of controversy Saturday night when Mike Tyson
annihilated his British challenger, Julius Francis, in their
heavily hyped heavyweight fight.
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government on Saturday night pledged to look
into the issue of MP's security following the fatal stabbing of an
MP's aide at a constituency surgery in Cheltenham.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Beats Kafelnikov to Win Australian Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world No.1 beat second-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov 3-6, 6-3,
6-2, 6-4 to win his third grand slam title in eight months, his
second in succession and sixth overall.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a first set, into which Kafelnikov seemed to pour
all his energies, and the fourth-set unscheduled intrusion by
Australia's most notorious nuisance, Peter Hoare, there was little
threat to Agassi's supremacy.
</P>
<P>
Even after Kafelnikov won the first four games, Agassi gave the
impression that he wasn't that far from turning the match his own
way.
</P>
<P>
He began to prove it in the second set and by the third, the
result seemed beyond doubt.
</P>
<P>
By the time, Hoare, the man who has disrupted high profile
funerals, horse races and soccer matches, breached security and
pranced around the court with a video camera at the start of the
fourth set.
</P>
<P>
While giving away the first set in a grand slam final may be a
lot to give away, it is nothing compared to the position that
confronted Agassi at the end of 1997 when his ranking had slipped
from No.1 in 1995 to 141.
</P>
<P>
An overweight Agassi fled to the Challenger circuit, playing
games in school halls and fetching his own tennis balls between
points. Agassi ended the year as the world's 122nd ranked player
before embarking on a return journey in the express lane.
</P>
<P>
He finished 1998 by ranking No.6, and made the biggest one year
leap into the top 10 in open tennis history. Agassi won five
titles for the year and reached the fourth round at both the
Australian and U.S. Opens. He then began an unprecedented rise to
glory.
</P>
<P>
Agassi's victory on Sunday followed his success in last year's
U.S. and French Opens with a loss in between to Pete Sampras in
the Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
"There has been nothing in my career that compares with the
last eight months," Agassi said. "It's been a crazy life."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a disappointed Kafelnikov again expressed amazement
at Agassi's powers of recuperation, giving there American all
credit for the win.
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how he can recover from losing the first set and
continue to raise his game in the second and third and towards the
end of matches," he said.
</P>
<P>
With three of the past four grand slam titles to his name,
Agassi is a long way from thinking about retirement, even as he
approaches veteran status.

<HEADLINE> Underdeveloped Village Has Access to Television (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Needy farmers at Wangzhuang
Village, one of the poorest areas in northwestern China, have seen
entirely new things on television relayed to this outlying village
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Wangzhuang Village, located on an area with an elevation of 2,
900 meters in Longde County, northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region. Owing to lack of transport facilities, 220
households in the village had to climb over rugged mountains to
buy daily essentials and sell what they produce.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 60,000 backward villages in rural China have access
to television and radio broadcast as Wangzhuang did, said an
official with the State Administration of Radio, Film and
Television. He anticipates that additional 100,000 villages with a
population of 70 million will be able to watch television and
listen to radio by the end of this year, thus raising the country'
s radio and television coverage rate to 92 percent.
</P>
<P>
Brand-new satellite receivers and launching apparatus have been
erected besides row upon row of low-lying house built with sun-
dried mud bricks. Loudspeakers hung on poles at the entrance of
villages are rendering programs of advertisements and music.
</P>
<P>
"We are now able to watch television at our own homes at last,"
said the 45-year-old Liu Jingyun with a hearty smile while gazing
at the vivid, lively performance shown on television.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned from television new skills of growing maize
under plastic sheet covers and methods of applying fertilizer and
insecticides. I think the per-unit output of maize is sure to top
400 kg this year," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Television has brought gratifying changes to this small, out-of-
the-way village, where farmers began to talk about news from both
home and abroad, leaned to speak Putonghua, or standard Chinese
pronunciation, and do business as acquired from TV Ads.

<HEADLINE> Underdeveloped Village Has Access to Television (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to official statistics, as much as 150 million people
in China's outlying, mountainous areas had practically no access
to radio or television in late 1998. And little cultural and
educational progress made so far has hindered social and economic
growth in these areas.
</P>
<P>
To gain a turn for the better, the central government has
established a special fund worth 250 million yuan (30 million US
dollars) to provide all villages in the region with an easy access
to television and radio broadcast by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Anshe, director of the Broadcasting and Television Bureau
of Longde County, said his county government allocated 860,000
yuan (103,600 US dollars) last year to build new TV relay stations
across the county. Meanwhile, the state has donated 25 sets of
satellite receiving equipment and 1,450 television sets to the
county.
</P>
<P>
Expanded television coverage has led to a booming rural
consumer market. The number of color TV sets sold rose by 525 in
Longde County over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the State Development Planning
Commission, the sales volume of television and radio sets in China
's rural areas amounted to 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars)
for this year.
</P>
<P>
Bao Dake, an American scholar, said recently that the expansion
of television industry has help to do away with the seclusion of
vast rural areas in western China, broaden ordinary farmers'
visions, and increased their expectations and furthered the
contacts between China and the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's political advisor Osama el
Baz underlined Saturday that Egypt will work, after reaching a
peace settlement in the Middle East, for setting up a better system
for cooperation among the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
He added that the projected system would prevent any aggression
on Arab countries and Egypt will ask Turkey, after realizing peace
in the Middle East, to reconsider its alliance with Israel and will
work for freeing the region of all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt's permanent delegate to the U.N. Ahmed Abou el Gheit
said that contracts contributed by Egyptian companies to the oil-
for-food program have risen in value from 50 million U.S. dollars
to over 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite delays in implementing the oil-for-food deal due to
political disagreement between Iraq and the U.S., Egyptian
companies are the least harmed by the deferment.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is due in Cairo Sunday for
talks with Mubarak, whose country is the leading role in the Arab
world, on the latest developments in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were stalled while the
Palestinian-Israeli track was sluggish.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- President Mubarak received Sudanese Defense Minister Abdel
Rahman Serrel Khatm, who is to prepare for the visit of Sudanese
President Omar al Bahsir in the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
Khatm conveyed a message from Bahsir to Mubarak on the situation
in the war-torn Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Libya have jointly proposed an initiative for the
national reconciliation of Sudan.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is to hold talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on Sunday, with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the Erez checkpoint on
Thursday, and with Jordan's King Abdullah next week amid fading
hopes of meeting the February 13 deadline for the final-status
framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The ten-day-long marathon talks between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators will begin Monday in Eilat, a port city in
southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of talks were scheduled as a first phase, in an
attempt to formulate a draft framework agreement; a third round
aimed at bridging gaps is also expected.
</P>
<P>
After a third round, U.S. President Bill Clinton will decide
whether or not to hold a summit with Barak and Arafat to complete
the accord.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Four people died in weather-related accidents over the
weekend and dozens had to be treated for hypothermia as a result of
the storm that brought snow to Jerusalem, the Negev, and the
Galilee peaks, as well as the Golan and Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
However, the weather proved less trouble than had been feared
for the most past, apart from the traffic jams to and from
Jerusalem and the North caused by the tens of thousands of visitors
from warmer regions wanting a chance to play in the snow.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami decided to
appoint Orit Adato, the Commander of Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
Women's Corp, as the next Prison Service Commissioner. It is the
first time in Israel's history that a woman serves in this post.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Rachel Dolev, another senior female army
officer, was appointed as chief military censor. She was
recommended to Barak for the job by Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz, who
has vowed on several occasions to promote women within the ranks of
the IDF.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Offer Concessions to Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government had to make a
 concession to the buyers of its copper mines to avert the
impending closure of the mines, according to Finance Minister
Katele Kalumba.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia quoted him as saying that the
concessions are a matter of life and death to save the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) which will have otherwise been
shut down this year if it is not sold.
</P>
<P>
At a special seminar on budget held after Kalumba submitted his
2000 budget report Friday to parliament for approval, he said the
options left to the government are too ghastly to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
Interlocking debts which ZCCM has with various suppliers is the
main reason for the delay in concluding the sale deal with Anglo
American Corporation (AAC) scheduled for Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed his confidence that the remaining ZCCM assets
will be sold this year, saying "I am going to get the mines off my
shoulders even if it is after January 31."
</P>
<P>
He said even the measure to pump in 423 billion Kwacha (163
million U.S.

dollars) to reduce ZCCM's indebtedness is aimed at averting a
disaster which will have inevitably obliterated the manufacturing
industry completely.
</P>
<P>
In addition to 423 billion kwacha, equivalent to about four
percent of GDP, he also offered other concessions to successor
companies of ZCCM including mineral royalty rate reduction from
two percent to 0.6 percent of gross value.
</P>
<P>
Anglo American Corporation has deferred scheduled signing of
the final take-over agreement citing administrative and legal
hitches as the reason.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed an agreement last month under which the
assets of three big ZCCM mines -- Nchanga Division, Konkola
Division and Nampundwe Mine -- will be sold to AAC.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been working to privatize the
state-owned copper mines to attract foreign investment and
advanced technology and management to revive the ailing mining
industry.

<HEADLINE> First Snowfall in "Spring City" of Kunming (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Local residents are seen with
umbrellas over their heads after they left their homes this
morning, not because of rains but of heavy snowfall.
</P>
<P>
A rare, unexpected snowfall has turned Kunming, capital of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, reputed as "spring city" for
its pleasant climate, into a silvery world when early risers were
surprised to see it was all white outside their homes this morning.
</P>
<P>
"This is the heaviest snowfall in approximately two decades
since 1983," said Duan Xu, deputy director of the Yunnan
Provincial Meteorological Bureau. The snowfall, the first since
this winter season set in, started in the small hours today and
reached its climax around 6 A.M.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated snows on the ground were somewhere between 15
and 20 centimeters thick. Thin tree branches in the foliage along
the roads in the city of Kunming were bent with snows and got
broken.
</P>
<P>
"A northernward warm current from the Bengal Bay has met the
cold front from the north in the skies," explained Duan. So the
snowfall is conducive to relieving winter crops of drought. But
the greenhouses where vegetables grow suffered heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Locals who seldom see snowfall could hardly hold back their
excitement. Children were playing and chasing each other in the
snow fields. Even adults joined them stacking snowmen and even
attacked each other with snowballs.
</P>
<P>
The snowy weather, however, is worrisome to some others. The
operation of 26 electronic lines suspended and were under emergent
repair in Kunming. The power supply on its outskirts was cut
temporarily but local communications remained unaffected.

The Kunming International Airport had to close today, with all
88 flights canceled and about 12,000 passengers stranded at the
airport. The airport will probably resume operation tomorrow
morning.
</P>
<P>
Both railway and long-distance highway traffic came to a
standstill. All trains originally scheduled to depart Kunming this
morning were suspended till 10:20 A.M. when the first train set
off to Xichang city of neighboring Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
The highway linking Chuxiong City in the central part of the
province with Dali City, a tourist resort in the west, was sealed
off with some 3,000 passengers stranded.
</P>
<P>
Another highway from Anning City to Chuxiong City was to be
closed while thousands of vehicles lining up simply because of bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
Workers were working hard to clean away the snows on the rail
routes, highways, and airport runways in an effort to resume
normal traffic as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
During the traditional Spring Festival busy transport season,
which began on January 21 and ends February 29 this year, over 1.6
billion passengers are expected to travel by all transport means
for family reunion during the Spring Festival holiday which falls
on February 5 this year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Quake Victims Suffer from Sleet, Hailstone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A sleet with partial hailstones
hit Yao'an County in southwest China's Yunnan Province this
morning, which was jolted by an earthquake merely half a month ago.
</P>
<P>
No deaths nor injuries have been reported so far, according to
county officials.
</P>
<P>
The sleet began at 2:00 A.M. (Beijing Time) today, and
hailstone lasted for some 10 minutes and more in some nearby areas.
The bad weather has made things even worse for locals residents in
the quake-hit area, as many of them are still living in the tents
in the open.
</P>
<P>
The county government has immediately sent relief materials and
other daily essentials to the areas with poorer conditions, and
stalks and straw mattresses have been collected in the county for
keeping the quake victims warm.
</P>
<P>
The two successive quakes measuring 5.9 and 6.5 on the Richter
scale jolted Yao'an County on January 15, leaving five local

<HEADLINE> UAE GDP Grows By 10 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reached 190.4 billion
dirhams (about 51.9 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, up 10 percent
from 173 billion dirhams (47.1 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The GDP increase was pushed by the Gulf country's strategy of
economic diversification coupled with an upturn in oil prices in
the latter half of last year, according to an economic report
issued by the Ministry of Planning, the local Gulf News daily
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With oil producers sticking to output cuts and the current
upturn trend in oil prices expected to keep up, the UAE's GDP is
projected to reach 203.5 billion dirhams (about 55.5 billion
dollars) by the end of 2000, representing a 7.1 percent increase,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The economy's strong performance has led to a jump in the
country's reserves to 13.4 billion dirhams (3.65 billion dollars)
by the end of 1999 as against 3.5 billion dirhams (950 million
dollars) in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, national savings touched 34.4 billion dirhams (9.4
billion dollars) in 1999 from 26 billion dirhams (7.1 billion
dollars)in 1998.
</P>
<P>
All sectors of the economy benefited from the oil price rise
which averaged 17.4 dollars a barrel in 1999 as against 12.4
dollars per barrel in 1998, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Like other Gulf countries, the UAE relies on oil for the bulk of
its revenues. The country's confirmed oil reserves stand at 98
billion barrels, and it currently produces 2 million barrels per
day in compliance with a quota set by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Meet Arafat to Speed up Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
will meet this week to meet the February 13 deadline for a final
peace agreement framework, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held Thursday or Friday at the Erez crossing
between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip, is to focus on
major issues such as the future status of the Palestinian entity,
the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The February deadline was set in an agreement signed by the two
sides in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt last September.
</P>
<P>
With the deadline merely half a month away, doubts have been
cast over whether the two sides could meet their target since they
are still far apart over the thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
Oded Eran, Israel's chief negotiator on the final-status talks,
has stated that it is unlikely that the deadline will be met.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the main broker in the peace talks, has also
admitted that Israel and the Palestinian might fall short of their
target on the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't meet it, they'll reach some understanding about
how to deal with that problem, " a senior U.S. official said
Saturday after a 30-minute meeting between Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have criticized Barak for failing to go to
Davos, where the World Economic Forum conference took place, saying
he was attempting to avoid a summit between Arafat and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have agreed to start 10 days of
intensive talks in Israel on Sunday. U.S. special Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross is due to arrive in the region Wednesday to give
the talks a push.
</P>
<P>
Barak is to travel to Cairo Sunday afternoon for talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who plays an instrumental
mediating role in the Middle East peace process.

<P>
Virgil Bodeen, director of the American center, has confirmed

<P>
Sebaggala, who became Kampala's democratically-elected mayor in
April 1998, was arrested in the U.S. in June of the same year for
bank fraud and lying to U.S. customs officers. A court in Boston
convicted him in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
After he was convicted and jailed in the U.S, he was removed
from the mayoral post automatically according to Ugandan laws.

<HEADLINE> Leprosy Cases Drop in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has seen a
steady decline in the number of leprosy cases from 35,092 in 1983
to 4,279 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Sunday to mark the World Leprosy Day,
Tanzanian Minister for Health Aaron Chiduo said Tanzania is now in
a better position to reach the World Health Organization (WHO)'s
target to eradicate the disease in the world by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, where Leprosy is treated free of charge, is not among
the 10 countries which WHO has announced will not be able to reach
the target by the end of 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister informed Tanzanians that leprosy is now curable
within a period of one year and urged the infected to report for
treatment especially in those regions which still have a big
number of leprosy patients.
</P>
<P>
The campaign against leprosy has met with much success in the
western Kigoma Region and the southern Mtwara Region, said Chiduo.
</P>
<P>
He said the campaign will be enhanced between now and 2005 to
focus on more regions where emphasis will be laid on education and
sensitizing the people to report the cases to leprosy treatment
centers.
</P>
<P>
The minister promised to prepare sufficient anti-leprosy drugs
which will be imported and distributed to all regions in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Biosafety Protocol Adopted by Over 130 Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from more than 130
countries Saturday adopted a global Biosafety Protocol after an
all-night bargaining session in Montreal, Canada.
</P>
<P>
About 50 ministers attended the final discussions to reach the
deal, which was originally planned for Friday.
</P>
<P>
The success came after five years of dispute over the use of
genetically modified organisms (GMO) and failures in attempts to
reach an agreement in the past year in Cartagena, Colombia, and
Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
One of the key compromises already made is that a vague
labeling is required for genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
Under a compromise version of "Article 8.7", a label must go
with GMO exports indicating they might be a GMO product, though
without specifics.
</P>
<P>
The parties involved may continue negotiating a deal on the
labeling details in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The labeling compromise is considered part of the rights gained
by the European Union and less developed countries to possibly ban
imports of genetically modified products if they believe the
products are unsafe.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Environment Minister David Anderson said Saturday in a
statement that his country "recognizes the right of every country
to restrict the import" of living modified organisms that "would
harm its biodiversity."
</P>
<P>
"That is why Canada supports the precautionary approach which
allows nations to take action even in the absence of full
scientific certainty," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The historic agreement resulted from the conflict of concerns
about losses to the rising biotech industry, which already
generates billions of dollars in international trade, and about
human health as genetically altered crops have not been adequately
tested for safety.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace activists also fear that GMO could proliferate in
the environment, wiping out native species.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, which is yet to be ratified before taking effect
in the next few years, is reached under the auspices of the United
Nations Biodiversity Secretariat and chairmanship of Colombian
Environment Minister Juan Myar Maldonado, who had vowed not to
leave Montreal without a deal at Monday's opening session.

<HEADLINE> Top Scientific Research Body Draws Talents from Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), the top natural science research body in China, will invite
more overseas Chinese as consultants during the next few years.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 overseas scientists are expected to join the CAS
as consultants after signing contracts. The CAS is considering
appointing some of them to serve as tutors of post-doctoral
scientists.
</P>
<P>
"The CAS is selecting the candidates primarily based on their
academic and scientific achievements," a CAS official with the
personnel and education bureau was quoted as saying by China Daily
Business Weekly, adding that preference would be given to young
scholars.
</P>
<P>
To attract young scientific talents, overseas Chinese students
in particular, the CAS has initiated the "Hundreds of Talents Plan
" in 1994 with policy and financial support from the Chinese
central Government.
</P>
<P>
The CAS has recruited 331 excellent young scientists since then,
over 70 percent of whom were overseas students.
</P>
<P>
The latest readjustment to the plan involves perfecting the
overseas professional advisory system, setting up an overseas post-
doctoral tutorship plan, and establishing a communication network
among overseas scientists.
</P>
<P>
"The key point is to find talented people via various channels,
" said CAS President Lu Yongxiang at an annual conference held
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The CAS is expected to offer financial support to at least 200
senior academic visitors from at home and abroad, and to invite
some to give lectures in China annually.
</P>
<P>
At least 33 overseas scientists, between the age of 30 to 40,
were invited last year. The consultants, involved in almost every
field of science, were from North American and European countries.
Their major tasks were to design, review and assess part of the
CAS's key research subjects.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Looks Beyond State Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC), the country's largest commercial bank, will
make room in its plans for private and foreign clients this year,
said Liu Tinghua, the bank President.
</P>
<P>
And the bank, a traditional money supplier to large-scale State-
owned businesses, will continue its support to critical industries
and large-scale State-owned enterprises, reported today's China
Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The bank will gradually increase credit to foreign-invested and
private enterprises this year in accordance with China's opening
process and the growth of private businesses, Liu said at a recent
ICBC National Conference.
</P>
<P>
This is a part of ICBC's ongoing credit structure reform, which
gives priority to profitability and market demand.
</P>
<P>
"We should increase the proportion of loans to foreign-invested
and private enterprises in areas where these enterprises are
developing soundly," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
ICBC will offer Renminbi loans to foreign-invested companies
with foreign exchange savings as collateral.
</P>
<P>
However, in the overall credit structure, foreign and private
businesses still cannot compete with clients in the State-level
infrastructure pillar, high-technology and State-monopolized
industries, whose development are critical to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, new loans this year will mostly go to these
important industries and projects, said Liu. And to avoid
unnecessary financial risks, the bank will gradually reduce loans
to some traditional industries which record low profitability and
are not competitive on the global market.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the bank will extend coverage of credit line services
this year to win more high quality clients. It will also improve
credit approval procedures to better serve the 11,200 important
enterprises which have ICBC credit lines.
</P>
<P>
For low quality clients, the bank will develop an investment
banking business or co-operate with its non-performing assets
operator, Huarong, to retrieve credit through debt restructuring,
capital security, auctions and listings.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Photographs of Japanese Spy Some 70 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHENYANG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has published a collection of nearly 1,000 photographs
taken by a Japanese spy with the family name of Shimasaki before
the Japanese invasion of China in 1931.
</P>
<P>
The photographs are the convincing material evidence that
suggests that Japan's intrusion into China was a long-planned and
premeditated conspiracy, according to Prof. Wu Bing'an, a noted
Chines folk culture scholar.
</P>
<P>
Prof Wu said here today that his long and meticulous study
proves that the pictures were shot in the eight years from 1924 to
1932 by the Japanese spy posing as a news photographer.
</P>
<P>
The photos were divided into the categories of Chinese towns,
villages, common people, and folk customs, and many of them are
photos about Chinese ports, railway stations, transportation
facilities, central squares, commercial centers, and major mines
and factories.
</P>
<P>
The spy also photographed several cities of strategic
importance such as Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, the three
component parts of Wuhan city at the middle reaches of the Yangtze
from a variety of angles and distances.
</P>
<P>
The transportation and commercial shots were of great value to
Japanese military officers then for judging economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The photo book, which can serve as a textbook, will be
instructive not only to the young people, but also to the elderly
who lived through that miserable time," said Wu.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador to U.S. Warns Against "Taiwan Independence" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- "Taiwan independence" will
not mean peace but a war between the two sides of the straits,
Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a seminar to commemorate the fifth
anniversary of the publication of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
eight-point speech on the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government will
never make compromise on safeguarding the national sovereignty and
territorial integrity, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to separate China is doomed to failure, he said,
warning the separatist force in Taiwan must not "play with fire."
</P>
<P>
The core of the issue is reunification of the motherland, he
said, "two countries," "one China and one Taiwan" or "Taiwan
independence" will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Resolving the Taiwan issue accords with the will of all the
Chinese people and it should not be delayed indefinitely, Li
Zhaoxing said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have never been as urgent and historically
obliged as today to resolve the Taiwan issue and realize the
complete reunification of the motherland, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador reiterated the basic principle of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems," but he said China
will not promise to renounce the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing said Taiwan is the core issue in Sino-U.S.
relations and it must be handled properly for a sound bilateral
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act of the U.S. Congress is a
severe violation of the three communiques governing Sino-U.S.
relations and an infringement on China's sovereignty, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador urged U.S. Congressmen to immediately stop
interference in the internal affairs of China.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Coach Heard Fired by Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Gar Heard became the first
victim of Michael Jordan's new career as the Washington Wizards
coach was fired barely halfway through his first season.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just minutes after the Wizards held on
for a 103-98 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers tonight. Heard
had guided the Wizards to only a 14-30 mark but the team was 2-3
since Jordan became president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
Heard is believed to have two-plus years left on a three-year
deal he signed last June. He was chosen by Wizards general manager
Wes Unseld, who no longer has the final say on personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
Unseld made tonight's announcement. Jordan apparently is at the
Super Bowl, making an endorsement appearance. No immediate
successor was named.
</P>
<P>
When Jordan was introduced as part-owner and president of the
floundering franchise 11 days ago, he was asked about Heard's
status and responded, "Until we get on track, everyone is
disposable to some degree."
</P>
<P>
It was a tumultuous half-season for Heard, who adopted a stern
stance and feuded with stars Rod Strickland and Juwan Howard.
</P>
<P>
Early in the season,, Heard and Strickland clashed over the
point guard's frequent late arrivals to team functions.
</P>
<P>
Following a 130-120 double-overtime loss in Milwaukee on
January 11, Heard and Howard reportedly had heated words in the
locker room. Players and coaches intervened and when assistant
coach Tree Roillins spoke up on Heard's behalf, Howard reportedly
went after Rollins.
</P>
<P>
Heard, 51, also benched starting center Isaac Austin for not
playing well or hard and often sat starters who were not producing.
</P>
<P>
Heard played for seven playoff teams in his 11-year career. He
served as an assistant under Alvin Gentry in Detroit last season
and under Larry Brown for four seasons, three in Indiana and one
in Philadelphia. His NBA coaching career began in Dallas in 1987
and he was interim coach for the end of the 1992-93 season after
the Mavericks fired Richie Adubato.
</P>
<P>
The Wizards have made the playoffs just once since 1987.
</P>
<P>
As a player, Heard is best remembered for his game-tying shot
for the Phoenix Suns in Game Five of the 1976 NBA Finals against
the Boston Celtics.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Sri Lanka Reach Massive Military Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has concluded a multi-
million dollar government-to-government military deal with the
United States this week in a boost to fight separatist Tamil
rebels,local press reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"In one transaction, the Sri Lanka Government will purchase two
more Hughes AN/TPQ 36 Firefinder locating radar from the United
States," said the Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
The locating radar is said to cost 11 million U.S. dollars each,
said the newspaper, adding that the U.S. Bureau of Trade Controls
have given approval for this transaction.
</P>
<P>
This transaction is expected to go up for U.S. congressional
approval shortly as all U.S. military sales exceeding nine million
dollars require its approval.
</P>
<P>
There is no difficulty in getting its approval since the U.S.
Congress had approved the sale of two similar units in 1998, the
newspaper quoted Defense Ministry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
In another transaction, Sri Lanka will buy three brand new Bell
412 helicopters. Delivery is expected in the early part of this
year,said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A third transaction involves the purchase of high calibre
ammunition from a manufacturer in Spain who is producing it under
license from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The military deal is expected to greatly boost Sri Lanka's
fighting power in its war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam rebels who have been fighting for a separate Tamil state in
the north and east of the island since 1983.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the United States has widened its military
assistance to Sri Lanka. The U.S. Special Operation Command (
Pacific)personnel have been training Sri Lanka security forces to
enhance their fighting capabilities, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It added that training has also covered intelligence techniques,
explosives handling, casualty evacuation, aircraft safety/
maintenance and the law of armed conflict.

<HEADLINE> Beyer Beats Keiski to Retain WBC Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Germany boxer Markus Beyer
knocked his Swedish opponent Leif Keiski out with a body shot in
the seventh round of their bout in Riesa, Germany on Saturday to
retain his WBC supermiddleweight title.
</P>
<P>
Beyer, 28, on a 18-0 record with eight knockouts, dropped
Keiski three times during the first defense of his crown as he
dominated the fight.
</P>
<P>
The German caught Keiski with a lightning shot to the liver as
he was moving in midway through the seventh and the Swedish boxer
crumpled to the canvas in pain.
</P>
<P>
The sudden end came after Keiski, whose record fell to 28-2,
appeared to have climbed back into the fight after the two earlier
knockdowns.
</P>
<P>
Keiski landed numerous punches on Beyer, especially in the
fifth and sixth as the German suddenly appeared to lose control of
the fight after a furious start.
</P>
<P>
But Keiski couldn't match Beyer's quick hands, with a sudden
left dropping Keiski to his knees in the second round and a short
left in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Beyer had also knocked Britain's Richie Woodhall down three
times as he won the title in October, then struggled to finish the
12 rounds after breaking bones in both hands.
</P>
<P>
Beyer is next expected to make a mandatory defense against WBC
No. 1 challenger Glen Catley of Britain.

<HEADLINE> New Demonstrations Called in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A grassroot organization in
Ecuador on Saturday called for another series of demonstrations
starting on February 3 to protest against some economic policies
pursued by the government of new President Gustavo Noboa.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Saturday, Luis Villacis, president of
the Patriotic Front (PF), which groups labor unions, Indians,
peddlers and hoboes, urged labor unions, university students and
peasants to take to the streets to reject the eventual adoption of
the U.S. dollar as Ecuador's national currency.
</P>
<P>
Before his toppling as president, Jamil Mahuad had announced on
January 9 the gradual "dollarization" of the national economy as a
measure to help the country out of the long-time serious economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
After Mahuad was forced out of office on January 22 amid
massive demonstrations that included the occupation of the
Congress building, his successor Gustavo Noboa ratified the
continuation of the dollarization process and the modernization of
the state machinery.
</P>
<P>
Villacis said that "what is happening in Ecuador is the same
mange on a different dog. The policy has not changed" after
Mahuad's downfall.
</P>
<P>
The PF noted that the authorities have threatened labor union
leaders with jail terms if they carry out demonstrations against
the economic and social policy of the new government.
</P>
<P>
It also criticized the arrest of the colonels who supported the
toppling of Mahuad.

<HEADLINE> Economic Issues to Come First in Colombia's Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government and the country's largest guerrilla group agreed
Saturday that economic issues would top the agenda of their peace
talks and set a six-month timetable for the first phase of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The agenda was contained in a statement jointly issued by
representatives of the government and the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) as they were formally launching a new
negotiation site in Los Pozos, a village within the demilitarized
zone in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed on three themes for the peace negotiations:
economic development, international relations and political
structure and announced that they would discuss the economic
issues in the coming six months.
</P>
<P>
The search for Colombia's economic and social model will take
into account the country's needs "in the context of a globalizing
world," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reaffirmed commitment to solving Colombia's four-
decade-old armed conflicts through negotiations and to building a
nation of peace and justice.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Side Hints Consent to Delaying Peace Treaty Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Chief Palestinian negotiator
Yasser Abed Rabbo said Saturday that the Palestinian side is
likely to agree to postponing the deadline for signing a framework
of peace treaty with Israel, in a sign of softening its stance on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo stressed that the condition for putting off the February
13 deadline is that the Israelis must show seriousness in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that what is needed for the peace talks on the final
status of Palestine to reach an agreement is that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak makes a wise political decision. However, up
till now, no sign is visible that Barak intends to do this.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo announced that intensive talks will start Sunday at some
secret place in the Jerusalem or Ramallah area, contradicting a
Palestinian official who said earlier Saturday that 10-day closed-
door talks will start in Israeli Red Sea resort city Eilat.
</P>
<P>
Another high-ranking official said that the intensive marathon
talks would start only after Palestine leader Yasser Arafat has
met with Barak. He made this remark in Davos, Switzerland, when
accompanying Arafat at the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, the main broker of the Middle East
peace, after meeting Arafat in Davos, announced Saturday that
Arafat and Barak will meet sometime next week at Palestine-Israel
border inspection center Erez.
</P>
<P>
Israelis officials told the Voice of Israel that the date and
place for the two leaders' meeting are still undecided.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak are to hold talks on the possibility of
forging a framework for the future peace treaty and of
transferring the talks to Washington if the deal is not agreed by
the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh accord signed last September, the two
sides agreed to reach an outline accord by February 13 on key
issues including status of Jerusalem, borders, statehood of
Palestine, refugees, water resources and Jewish settlements. Based
on this framework, the final peace treaty is to be signed in
September.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, little progress has been made following the 20-
more meetings since the launching of the talks on the final status
of Palestine. Israel has repeatedly called for the delay of the
February 13 deadline while the Palestine side insisted on sticking
to it.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's Reto Goetschi won
the final two-man bobsled event of the season Saturday, but
compatriot Christian Reich took the World Cup title, the first of
his career.
</P>
<P>
With brakeman Cedric Grand on the gear, Goetschi posted the
fastest times in both runs at the season-closing World Cup event
in St. Moritz, Switzerland, including a season track record of one
minute, 4.33 seconds in the opening heat.
</P>
<P>
Goetschi recorded almost a same fast run in the second,
clocking in 1:04.39 for a winning aggregate time of 2:08.72.

opening run of 1:04.91, but after a well-operated second run in 1:
04.39, the pair were vaulted into second place with an aggregate
time of 2:09.30.
</P>
<P>
Reigning Olympic and world champion Guenther Huber of Italy
placed third with teammate Christian La Grassa, the pair clocking
2:09.42.
</P>
<P>
The duo, who started back in 24th place, took full advantage of
the increasingly fast ice surface due to warming temperatures in
the fashionable Swiss resort, to record the second-fastest time in
the opening heat with 1:04.90. A second run of 1:04.52 assured
the pair a place on the podium.
</P>
<P>
Rene Spies and Franz Sagmeister of Germany were fourth in 2:09.
67, ahead of the Swiss pair Marcel Rohner and Beat Hefti, fifth in
2:09.75.

<HEADLINE> Bank Of China to Improve Internal Management System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Bank of China (BOC) is to take
great efforts this year in the improvement of its internal
management system, so to make itself still more competitive as
banking markets open wider to foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuebing, BOC president, said that a sounder internal
control system will be in place within two years, which will be
characterized by clear definitions of responsibility and a
balanced interaction between all bank departments, according to
today's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"All operations and departments should strictly adhere to the
system," Wang said at a national conference held last week in
Beijing, which was attended by all the heads of its branches.
</P>
<P>
He also said that any irregularities will be dealt with
severely and all department heads have a clear responsibility to
provide adequate supervision.
</P>
<P>
To develop a sound management system has been one of BOC's top
tasks for years. And the improvements helped the bank earn 11.48
billion yuan (about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars) in profits last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the bank's loans were given to transportation,
telecommunications and hi-tech firms. Wang said BOC last year
helped the country's State-owned enterprises by setting up the
China Orient Assets Management Company.
</P>
<P>
The company has so far arranged 19.04-billion-yuuan )2.2
billion US dollars) in debt to equity swap deals.
</P>
<P>
The bank will strive to improve its financial services this
year and to expand its market shares in large and medium-sized
cities, said Wang.

<HEADLINE> Gas to Pipe into Shanghai from West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build a natural
gas pipeline from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in
Northwest China to Shanghai Municipality in East China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are expected to participate in the more than
60 billion yuan (about 7.23 billion U.S. dollars) pipeline
construction.
</P>
<P>
Total investment, involving gas exploration in Xinjiang, will
reach as much as 110 billion yuan (about 13.25 billion U.S.
dollars), according to today's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline's construction, which will take about six years to
complete, is scheduled to begin next year. The 4,200-km-long
pipeline will wind its way through nine autonomous regions and
provinces before entering Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to transfer over 20 billion cubic meters of
natural gas annually to Shanghai from Tarim Basin in Xinjiang,
home to one of China's largest oil and natural gas reserves with
more than 200 billion cubic meters of proven natural gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
"This echoes the central government's decision to speed up
development of the western areas," Chen Yongwu, deputy director
with the planning and development department under the State
Administration of the Petroleum and Chemical Industry, was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country will encourage investment from overseas in
infrastructural projects in these areas, and the natural gas
pipeline is among the key projects, according to a State Council
work conference last week.
</P>
<P>
"Xinjiang will be the first to benefit significantly from the
project because it will promote economic development and create
more jobs," Ablat Abdulreshid, chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Regional Government, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors, such as British Petroleum Co. Ltd. and Enron
Development Corp, are striving to become involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the country's oil giant,
expects to be the dominate shareholder. The central government
will also invest in the project.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas will be priced at less than 1.2 yuan (0.14 U.S.
dollars) per cubic meter in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to contribute significantly to
environmental protection in Shanghai Municipality, flagship of
China's market-driven economy.
</P>
<P>
China decided to let natural gas play a still bigger role in
its energy consumption to ease mounting pollution pressures and to
promote a sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Welcome Reincarnated Seventh Living Buddha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's respect
for religion and its religious policy are fully reflected in the
search, approval and ordination of the reincarnated Seventh Raiqen
living Buddha -- this is a view shared by Tibetan lamas and the
Tibetans as a whole.
</P>
<P>
All these actions were carried out in strict accordance with
religious rituals, said Losang Wangjiu, a lama at the Johkang
Temple in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, this proves the central government's true
attention for the religious work and the central government's
respect for freedom in religious belief.
</P>
<P>
"I will carry forward the patriotic spirit of the Sixth Raiqen
Living Buddha," said Losang Wangjiu, adding that he would cherish
the unity of the Chinese nation and firmly oppose the splitting of
the country.
</P>
<P>
With the consent of the State Administration of Religious
Affairs, the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government approved two-
year-old Soinam Puncog, born in Lhari county north of Lhasa,  as
the reincarnated Seventh Raiqen Living Buddha.
</P>
<P>
On January 16, a solemn ceremony was held inside the Johkang
Temple in Lhasa to identify the child and give him a Buddhist name
in front of a statue of Sakyamuni, known as the founder of
Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Five days later, another ceremony marking the arrival of the
Seventh Raiqen Living Buddha was held at the Raiqen Monastery in
Lhunzhub County in compliance with religious tradition.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth Raiqen living Buddha, Dandzim Jigme, died of illness
on February 13, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, the Raiqen
living Buddha holds one of the highest-ranking positions in
Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The tradition of patriotism and the spirit to preserving the
unity of the Chinese nation have long been cherished and adhered
to by Raiqen living Buddhas.

DAVOS, Switzerland, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
Wu Bangguo met U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and
Secretary of Commerce William Daley here Saturday on the sidelines
of the 30th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wu recalled that China and the U.S. reached
a win-win agreement last year on China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO). He urged an early approval by the U.S.
Congress to grant China the status of permanent normal trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky and Daley said President Bill Clinton and his
administration had made active efforts for reaching the agreement
last year and are now trying their best to grant China the
permanent trading status.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope for an earliest possible conclusion of
China's bilateral talks with other WTO members, such as the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Wu told the U.S. officials that China is actively engaged in
these talks, which have been going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is ready to conclude all talks with
concerned parties based on the spirit of mutual understanding and
flexibility.

LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- British boxer Joe Calzaghe
retained his WBO super-middleweight title on Saturday when he beat
compatriot David Starie on points after 12 scheduled rounds in
Manchester.
</P>
<P>
The main under-card battle before Mike Tyson's first UK fight
was a dour affair, with the champion always in control without
really dominating his opponent from Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
Starie failed to take the opportunity of a world title chance
as the television audience awaiting Tyson's much-hyped bout with
Britain's Julius Francis were denied any real entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The judges unanimously scored the fight to Calzaghe 116-113,118-
110 and 120-108, but boos rang around the Manchester venue as the
announcement was made.

<HEADLINE> Ottey Slams German Federation after Withdrawal from Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- After her withdrawal from an
indoor meet in the German city of Karlsruhe on Saturday, Jamaican
sprinter Merlene Ottey criticized what she described as threats to
the organizers by the German Athletics Federation (DLV).
</P>
<P>
The veteran Jamaican sprinter, in trouble with doping charges,
also cancelled an appearance on a German television sports show.
But she said she planned to race in the Spanish city of Valencia
next wek.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Karlsruhe meeting had said they had wished
the former world champion to run despite urgent appeals from the
DLV not to invite her. DLV president Helmut Digel denounced Ottey
's planned outing as "outrageous and scandalous".
</P>
<P>
Ottey issued a statement in response, saying she was "deeply
shocked" by the DLV'S position. She again denied she had ever
used illegal, performance-enhancing substances.
</P>
<P>
"The DLV's threats against the Karlsruhe meet are scandalous.
I'm reserving the right to take legal steps against the DLV and
its president," she said.
</P>
<P>
"That Mr Digel is calling on the public (to turn against me) is
an outrageous attack on my person."
</P>
<P>
Alain Blondel, one of the Karlsruhe meeting organisers, said
Ottey had made her own decision to withdraw "without anyone trying
to talk her (into it)".
</P>
<P>
Race director Siegfried Koenig expressed regret for Ottey's
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Ottey tested positive for the banned steriod nandrolone at a
Grand Prix meeting in Lucerne last July. She was later cleared by
her national athletics federation.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) is
reviewing that decision and Ottey is entitled to race until an
arbitration panel ruling expected at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF also appealed for Ottey not to be welcomed at the
Karlsruhe event.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Plans Clean Energy Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Liquefied natural gas (LNG) and
natural gas from offshore China will become a major energy
feedstock in southern province of Guangdong in order to meet the
growing demand for energy and to ease pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government of China has just approved a long-
expected LNG project of Guangdong which allows the province to
heavily, but not completely, rely on imported LNG, according to
today's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"The project is expected to play a key role in fueling
Guangdong's economy," Wei Liucheng, president of China National
Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC, the Guangdong provincial government, and some to-be-
selected foreign partners are expected to jointly develop the
giant project.
</P>
<P>
"It is also expected to be as a profitable business venture,"
said Wei.
</P>
<P>
Many global oil giants such as BP, Shell, and Mobile are
preparing to bid on the project. Some LNG providers, including
Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia, have shown a strong interest in
the program.
</P>
<P>
The project is considered essential because rapid economic
growth has resulted in an energy supply gap and serious
environmental protection problems for Guangdong Province, said Yao
Xinhuan, deputy director of the Guangdong LNG Project Leading
Group Office.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's energy consumption will reach 110 million tons of
coal equivalents by the year 2005 and 150 million tons by 2010.
The province is expected to gradually skew its reliance on small
coal-fueled power plants to gas-fueled stations for the sake of
environmental protection.

the publication of President Jiang Zemin's speech containing an
eight-point proposal on China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "To realize peaceful reunification, and
make concerted efforts to rejuvenate the Chinese Nation," says
that China's complete reunification process has entered a new
stage after Hong Kong and Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of "peaceful reunification, one country, two
systems" and Jiang's eight-point proposal, exchanges between
Taiwan and the mainland have on rise. As a result, the two sides
have made significant bilateral progress.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the "two states" remarks by Lee Teng-hui in July
1999, the paper criticizes some separatist forces which are bent
on dividing the island from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
-- Twelve ministries and departments pledged to make joint
efforts in combating illegal and pornographic publications in 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a tele-conference held Saturday, China will fully
take over publications of the Falun Gong evil cult and Qigong-
related publications advocating superstition and pseudoscience.

Participants hailed the eight-point proposition as a "
programmatic document for developing relations across the Taiwan
Straits and achieving peaceful reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, further progress has been made in

Imports and exports of farm produce were valued at 21.75

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China's strategy to develop its
western frontier has aroused the interest of the French firm of
Alstom, which is negotiating with potential Chinese partners in
Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, to
develop a manufacturing joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Lenfant, president of Alstom China Ltd., last week told
the China Daily Business Weekly that his firm was "fully aware" of
the Chinese government's intention to accelerate the development
of the west, which is rich in energy resources.
</P>
<P>
Although Alstom's commercial network covers the whole nation,
its business is concentrated on the eastern areas, according to
the report by the China Daily Business Weekly today. Alstom has
invested 120 million US dollars in China and has begun seven joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven Alstom-invested joint ventures, five located in
Shanghai, Qingdao in Shandong Province, and Hong Kong, manufacture
transport facilities including signaling systems, traction
equipment and rolling stock.
</P>
<P>
Two others, in Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province and Hong
Kong, produce power transmission and distribution products such as
switching gears.
</P>
<P>
The joint ventures employ 1,000 Chinese. He said that the

components, such as air-conditioners for trains, is more expensive
in China than in Europe.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will
benefit the plan, said Lenfant. As a member of a French business
group, he met with President Jiang Zemin last week in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
As the investment environment improves, Alstom will identify
new opportunities and "go fast", he added.
</P>
<P>
Alstom won the Shanghai Metro Line No. 3 project last year and
is expected to supply 28 six-car train sets. Lenfant said Alstom
will produce 160 trains in China, with 70 percent of components
made in the country. The trains will be 20 percent less expensive
than imported trains, Lenfant said.
</P>
<P>
China has succeeded in increasing the speed of its railway
trains to 160 km per hour. And Alstom expects to be part of that
acceleration program, Lenfant said. Lenfant described Alstom's
strategy in China as bringing the country technology first and
then working to reduce costs in manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Exp. and Imp. of Agricultural Produce Down in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China's export and import
volume of major agricultural produce went down still in 1999, as
an extended aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, China Daily
Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics carried by the Business Weekly, rice
exports went down 27.8 percent from those of 1998, to just over 2.
7 million tons, while imports reached 168,000 tons, down 31.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Maize export dropped 8.1 percent year-on-year, to more than 4.3
million tons. China's imports of maize in 1999 plunged a drastic
72 percent over 1998, to 70,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Exports of rice, maize and other agricultural produce to Asian
countries suffered a year-on-year drop of 2 percent 1999, on top
of an 11.4 percent decrease a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Although Asian countries have shown considerable recovery from
the turbulent Asian financial crisis, Chinese agricultural exports
to them were still sluggish, going down 9.95 billion US dollars
due to a relatively stronger yuan, the Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese edible oil exports fell 97,000 tons, a 69 percent
decrease, while imports hit 2.08 million tons, up 1.2 percent,
because of the slump of palm oil in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Sugar exports saw a year-on-year drop of 15.7 percent to reach
367,000 tons, while imports reached 417,000 tons, down 17.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, fruit exports were at 1.11 million tons, up 11.8
percent, and imports of such products amounted to 654,000 tons,
down 1.6 percent.

LAGOS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Burkina Faso's late equalizer
brought about a 1-1 draw with Zambia in a Group C game on Saturday
at the on-going African Nations Cup soccer tournament here.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Lota of Zambia slammed a shot in the 14th minute, which

<P>
In a dramatic fashion, Alassane Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso
penetrated the defense line by three Zambians in injury time to
level the score.
</P>
<P>
Because of their respective opening game defeats, both teams
desperately needed a win from this game. Zambia lost 2-0 to
defending champions Egypt whilst Burkina Faso went down 3-1 to
Senegal.

<HEADLINE> NBA All-Star Game Starters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A pair of first-time
selections, forward Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors and guard
Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers, were named on Saturday as
Eastern Conference starters for the 2000 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
Carter, the league's reigning Rookie of the Year, led all
players in fan balloting, receiving 1,911,973 of the more than 3.9
million ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
Joining Carter and Iverson in the starting line-up for the East
squad will be forward Grant Hill of the Detroit Pistons, Charlotte
Hornets guard Eddie Jones and Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Lakers, owners the league's best record at 34-9,
placed center Shaquille O'Neal and guard Kobe Bryant as starters
on the Western Conference squad. Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota
Timberwolves and Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs were elected
as the starters at forward as was Jason Kidd of the Phoenix Suns
at guard.
</P>
<P>
Starters for the 49th All-Star Game, scheduled for Sunday,
Febuary 13 in Oakland, California, were determined in fan
balloting that concluded earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Carter, who in just his second season has emerged as one the
league's most spectacular players, will becomes the first Raptor
ever to play in an All-Star Game since the franchise began play in
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Iverson, the league's leading scorer at 30.9 points per game,
received 1,843,011 votes, well ahead of Jones (734,940) at guard.
Mourning was second overall in the East with 1,878,588 votes, far
ahead of New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing (298,985).
</P>
<P>
Mourning and Hill, who had 1,371,304 votes, each will be making
their fifth All-Star appearance while it is the third for Jones.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal led all Western Conference vote-getters with 1,807,609
votes and was named to his seventh All-Star Game. David Robinson
of San Antonio was a distant second at center in the West.
</P>
<P>
Garnett (1,550,976) and Kidd (1,061) were named for the third
time. It was the second selection each for Bryant (1,022,897) and
Duncan (1,321,436).
</P>
<P>
Mutombo and O'Neal rank first and second in the league in
rebounding with averages of 14.6 and 14.4 per game, repsectively.
Kidd leads the league in assists at 10.1 per contest.
</P>
<P>
The closest race for a starter's spot was at guard for the
Western Conference, where Gary Payton of Seattle finished 124,296
votes behind Bryant.
</P>
<P>
NBA coaches will vote for the remaining members of the All-Star
teams in their respective conferences with the selections
announced on Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Coaches are not allowed to vote for players on their own team.
The coaches for the game will come from the teams that have the
best winning percentage in their respective conferences after
games played Sunday. Phil Jackson of the Lakers already has
secured the job as coach of the West.
</P>
<P>
Either Pat Riley of Miami (26-15) or Jeff Van Gundy of the
Knicks (25-16) will coach the East.
</P>
<P>
Miami plays Indiana tonight and the Knicks host Sacramento on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Indiana's Larry Bird, who coached the 1998 game and whose team
currently owns the best winning percentage in the East, is
ineligible since coaches are not allowed to participate in
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
The All-Star Game did not take place last season due to the
lockout.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Beats Gabon in African Nations Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Algeria ended Cabon's quarter-
finals hopes with a 3-1 Group B win at the African Nations Cup
tournament in Ghana's northwest city Kumasi on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A deadly mistake of Gabonese goalkeeper Germain Mendome gifted
Algeria to a 13th-minute lead as he missed a shot by Farid Ghazi.
</P>
<P>
Gabon's defender Eric Endo was sent off in the 26th minute of
the first half. Aided by the situation, Abdelhafid Tasfaout
slammed a brilliant shot in the 41st minute which increased
Algeria's lead to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
The score remained the same until injury time in the second
half, when substitute Bruno Mbanangoye headed home from close
range for Gabon.
</P>
<P>
And then Billel Dziri produced a superb left-foot shot which
flew past Mendome's hands, with 94 minutes on the clock.
</P>
<P>
With the outing of Gabon on two defeats, Algeria's progress now
depends on their final game with group leaders South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Morocco Draws with Tunisia in African Nations Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Morocco held Tunisia to a
scoreless draw in a Group D game of the African Nations Cup here
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the referee and other organizing committee officials had to
be escorted off the field for fear of possible attacks by angry
Tunisian players, who strongly protested what they claimed as
injustice of the referee.
</P>
<P>
In the 11th minute Morocco's Naybet brought down Tunisian
striker Tarek Thabet in the Morroccan box. The referee awarded a
free-kick on the edge of the penalty area when television replays
suggested Tunisia should have been given a penalty.
</P>
<P>
The result means Morocco need just one point - a draw - in
their next match against co-hosts, Nigeria to gain the entry of
the quarter-finals, while Tunisia's chances of remaining in the
tournament are now looking remote.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisians desperately needed a victory and their search for
a goal became more frantic as the game progressed. They put much
pressure on the Moroccan goal-mouth but gallant efforts by Adel
Sellimi and Zaied Jaziri were quashed by a stubborn Moroccan
defense.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia's coach, Francesco Scoglio, said: "I know a draw is not
good enough for us but we tried our best and our best was not good
enough."
</P>
<P>
The result leaves Morocco with four points and Tunisia with
only one - an outcome that seems to favor Nigeria currently placed
top of the group with four points.
</P>
<P>
Morocco is however handicapped for their next game because they
will be missing two of their key players.
</P>
<P>
Noureddine Naybet received a yellow card against Tunisia - his
second in the tournament so far - which means an automatic one-
match suspension.
</P>
<P>
And midfielder, Youssef Chipo, is suffering from a hip injury,
which looks certain to keep him out of the next game.

<HEADLINE> Oman Gives Support for Sudanese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Omani government on Sunday
expressed its support for the measures taken by Sudanese President
Omar Al-Bashir to maintain stability in his country.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the visiting Sudanese president in Muscat,
Oman's Sultan Qaboos Bin Said said his country would "spare no
effort" in supporting the latest progress led by Bashir in Sudan,
the official Oman News Agency (ONA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Bashir reshuffled the government in an effort to
further purge Hassan Al-Turabi, the former parliament speaker who
had long been seen as the real power in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The power struggle between Bashir and Turabi led to almost a
political crisis last month, when Bashir dissolved the parliament
and declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
All Gulf countries had expressed their backing for Bashir in his
efforts to sideline Turabi.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Oman backed the steps taken by Bashir to
correct and remove the problems and obstacles facing Sudan, ONA
quoted Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the two leaders, during their meeting, also expressed
satisfaction with the progress of bilateral relations. They also
pledged to further promote these relations, especially in
investment and trade spheres.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese president arrived in Muscat on Saturday for a
three-day visit to the Gulf country. He was accompanied by a high-
level delegation including Presidential Affairs Minister Bakri
Hassan Saleh and Foreign Minister Mustafa Othman Ismail.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the month, Bashir had visited Bahrain and the United
Arab Emirates to rally support.

Barikbin, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Barikbin said the refinery is designed to produce 125 million
tons of solvents annually in five categories and the value added of

<P>
BISAN Chairman Seyit Ali Yildirim said that he had made the
decision with a view to competing with world brands, adding that "
in every European country, everybody is using scooters as part of
daily life. We hope the Turkish market will be interested in
scooters also, as they are safer and cheaper than cars."
</P>
<P>

GAZA -- The final-status marathon negotiations between the
Palestinians and Israel started Sunday, the last-ditch efforts to
meet the February 13 deadline for a framework agreement on a
permanent peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams, with Israeli side led by Oded Eran and
the Palestinians delegation headed by Yasser Abed Rabbo, met Sunday
morning in an undisclosed place in the north of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Dany Yaton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's chief of
political and security staff, said the first session of the 10-day
marathon talks is expected to end Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The talks will start in earnest Wednesday after the arrival of
the U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross. (Israel-Palestine-

BEIRUT -- Akl Hachem, the second-highest ranking official of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA), was killed on Sunday when
Lebanese guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb in Israeli-occupied
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place in the village of Dibel, 60 kilometers
southwest of Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied enclave. It
was alleged that Hachem had been designated successor of SLA
commander Antoine Lahd.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group, which is leading a
war of attrition to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA
militiamen from southern Lebanon, has claimed responsibility for
the noon attack. (Lebanon-SLA Official-Killed)

JERUSALEM -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators wrapped up the
first round of intensive talks on final-status issues started
earlier Sunday with an aim of reaching a permanent peace framework
by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran for several
hours at an undisclosed location in northern Jerusalem, chief
Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo said the talks would
continue Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides launched the 10-day marathon talks Sunday morning
in an effort to clinch a framework agreement by February 13, the
target date set in the Sharm el Sheikh interim peace deal signed in
September.
</P>
<P>
With the deadline merely half a month away, doubts have been
cast over whether the two sides could meet their target since they
are almost as far apart as before over the core issues such as fate
of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli jet fighters bombed on Sunday several
Hezbollah positions inside the security zone in southern Lebanon in
retaliation for the killing of the deputy commander of the Israeli-
backed South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
The air strike was ordered Sunday afternoon shortly after the
SLA deputy commander, Colonel Akel Hashem, was killed in a bomb
attack.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the attack, Israeli Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh pledged to avenge his death. "The murder of Hashem can
not pass without retaliation and I believe that his death will not

<P>
He told reporters that he will turn over another "piece of
territory" to the Palestinians within 10 days. Israel was to hand
over a further 6.1 percent of the West Bank on January 20, in the
third phase of troop redeployment provided for by the Sharm el
Sheikh memorandum it signed with the Palestinians. (Egypt-Israel-

<HEADLINE> France's Vivendi and UK's Vodafone Set Up Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- France's Vivendi group and UK's
Vodafone Airtouch announced on Sunday that they have set up a
surprise alliance to create a European internet portal and
continent-wide fixed-line phone network.
</P>
<P>
The president of Vivendi Jean-Marie Messier and Vodafone chief
executive Chris Gent said at a surprise press conference here that
their ambition is to offer European consumers the possibility of
communicating by internet on a multitude of screens, television,
mobile phone and computers.
</P>
<P>
``With more than 70 million of European subscribers at the
start,and 100 million very quickly, we will accelerate the passage
of Europe to the second generation (wireless) internet, and to
present a brand which will be stronger than all the `Yahoo' of the
world,'' said Messier.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, which puts together the telecommunications
networks owned by Vodafone and many multimedia providers owned by
Vivendi,could be a counter action to the U.S. hyper-alliance of
AOL-TimeWarner which will create a world internet and
communication giant.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone has investment in 25 countries in the five continents
with 48 million customers and a mobile phone network in Europe
with 34 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Vivendi, the second largest telecoms company after France
Telecom,has 7.2 mobile phone subscribers, 1 million fixed-line
phone subscribers and as well as 20 million subscribers in cable
television and other media firms in France and other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two chief executives said that the starting scale of the
alliance will be ``impressing'' in Europe and will ``draw the
whole world.''
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is also set to become an 80 percent investor
in an early stage ``wireless internet'' project.
</P>
<P>
The wireless internet can, for example, allow someone to
communicate by his television with another by his portable phone.

<HEADLINE> Report: Over 128 Chechen Rebels Surrender Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Russian ORT public
television channel reported that 128 militants surrendered to pro-
government militias Sunday in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The surrender occurred following an agreement between a group
of rebel field commanders and Bislan Gantamirov, the former Grozny
mayor who now fight on the side of the federal troops. Grozny is
the capital of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
This came after Saturday's surrender of 95 rebels across
Chechnya, where federal troops are in the fourth month of their
campaign to root out the militants.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, some 70 rebels laid down arms and, through a
special corridor, were moved to detention centers they were
screened for their possible involvement in terrorist acts,
kidnapping and banditry, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Gantamirov said talks with the field commanders would continue
in the next two days and that more rebels might lay down their
arms and surrender.
</P>
<P>
The talks and the surrenders "have a psychological effect and
mark a turning point in the situation," Interfax quoted Gantamirov
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This will give an example to the hundreds of rebels, including
teenagers who had been deceived into fighting on the side of the
bandits, or joined them under the threat of death," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal troops were continuing to advance towards
the center of Grozny despite stiff rebel resistance.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is particularly fierce in Grozny's Leninsky and
Oktyabrsky districts, and on the approaches to Minutka Square in
the center of Grozny, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: SADC Becomes Emerging Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- With higher growth rates
than the rest of the sub-Saharan region, the 14-member Southern
African Development Community (SADC) has become an emerging market
with great potential.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest SADC Finance and Investment report, the
SADC has successfully achieved continuous economic growth since
the middle of the 1990s thanks to its peacekeeping efforts in
Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The SADC Secretariat has predicted a growth rate of three to
3.5 percent for the year 1999 in the bloc after it recorded a
positive growth of 1.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Mozambique boasted a growth rate of 11.2 percent,
followed by Botswana 5.6 percent and Mauritius 5.3 percent, and
Mozambican economic growth is expected to hit 10 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the economic development, the inflation rates in
Botswana, Mauritius, Namibia, Lesotho, Tanzania and South Africa
all dropped to the lowest level in history.
</P>
<P>
Attracted by continuous economic improvement, some western
countries have increased assistance to the SADC.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the United States provided an economic
aid worth 350 million U.S. dollars to help the SADC member states
build infrastructures like roads, ports, power plants and
irrigation works. Britain offered 50 percent of its foreign loans
to the SADC. France chose South Africa as a breakthrough-point
for its economic ties with the SADC.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and Japan are actively consolidating the
bilateral relationship with the SADC, paving the way for further
economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The SADC and EU have jointly announced that they will host a
series of conferences to boost foreign investment in southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The stable economic development in the sub-region also lays a
good foundation for the establishment of a SADC free trade area,
which will in turn tap the development potential in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
SADC Acting Executive Secretary Preg Ramsamy announced recently
that the long-waited SADC Free Trade Agreement will be implemented
in April this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement signed in July 1999, a free trade
zone should be established before 2004, and by 2008, tariff
imposed on non-sensitive commodities should be removed between the
SADC member states.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the free trade pact will surely speed up
economic development in the SADC or even in the whole Africa.
</P>
<P>
The recent significant development in the sub-region should
also be attributed to the exploitation of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
With the increase of natural resources exploration, the
overall growth in sub-Saharan Africa may hit four percent in the
year 2000, analysts here predicted. The GDP of Mozambique,
Botswana and Angola this year may well increase by 10 percent, 8.9
percent and eight percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The processing and export of mineral products have always been
the pillar for most SADC member countries like South Africa,
Botswana, Namibia, Angola and the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The rich natural resource is a unique gift endowed by the
nature, providing the SADC member states a wonderful condition to
develop their tourism, which has been identified as the key
economic drive for the region in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This ever-expanding service sector could by 2010 provide some
650,000 jobs through southern Africa. Over 1.6 million jobs could
also be created directly and indirectly by travel demand across
the region's broad economy.
</P>
<P>
The regional governments are expected to pool their resources
to effect rapid socio-economic development for greater economic
cooperation and adequate and effective moves toward economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
As the past year has witnessed, the continuation of the armed
conflicts in Angola and the DRC impacted negatively on the
economic stability, macro- economic management and investor
confidence in the directly involved countries as well as the SADC
region at large.
</P>
<P>
At an extraordinary summit in Maputo earlier this month, heads
of state of the SADC countries published a communique urging the
U.N. Security Council to send a full peace-keeping force to the
DRC to speed up the peace process.
</P>
<P>
And the U.N. Security Council has voted to send 5,500 military
personnel to the DRC to supervise the cease-fire between the
government troops and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has succeeded in soliciting
international support and isolating the UNITA rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi and taken an upper hand in the central highlands fighting
fields.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated peace in the DRC and Angola would surely
further promote the development in the SADC region.
</P>
<P>
However, stimulating economic growth remains a challenge for
the community.
</P>
<P>
The SADC member countries have to redouble their commitment and
act in a true African spirit to ensure that the new millennium
became the golden age for Africa.
</P>
<P>
SADC is a 14-country regional bloc comprising Angola, Botswana,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,
Seychelles, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Party Proposes Pullout From Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The newest and now biggest
opposition party in Zimbabwe, the Movement for Democratic Change,
said Sunday that it would pull the Zimbabwean troops out of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) if it won parliamentary
elections in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The DRC war "is a big drain on our economy and there is no
reason why we should be there," said Morgan Tsvangirai who has
just been voted as the first president of the five-month-old
movement at its two-day congress.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai, who was secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Congress
of Trade Unions (ZCTU), said that the DRC war is senseless and
there is not any strategic national interest for Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent hordes of troops to the third
largest African country in August 1998 to prop up DRC President
Laurent Kabila's army sieged by the rebels supported by Rwanda and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's involvement in the DRC conflict has been largely
attributed to the downturn of the southern African country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe's largest opposition party, which has been
accusing the government of the President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe
African National Union- Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) of mismanaging
the economy, is seeking a chance to take over the reins of power.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the congress, the labor-backed opposition party
also adopted a constitution built on principles of an open
democracy and supportive of a mixed economy with a strong social
conscience.
</P>
<P>
The constitution seeks to eradicate corruption, ensure an
equitable and fair distribution of natural resources as well as
resolve the land imbalance.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU President Gibson Sibanda was voted as vice-president of
the new party and another ZCTU national leader Isaac Matongo as
its national chairman.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Warns of Widening Gap Between North and South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King
Abdullah II has warned that the gap between the developed
countries and the developing countries will be widened in the
digital world.
</P>
<P>
"It is a setting for a widening digital gap between developed
countries, which are adapting to the new modes of technological
advances, and the developing world that is at risk of being left
behind," said the Jordanian king here Sunday at the 30th annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
While the former lead the way in terms of penetration of
personal computers, cellular telephones and Internet access, he
said, many countries around the world are still struggling with
getting hard-wired phones into houses.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the reality is that over half of the world'
s total population struggle to survive at less than two U.S.
dollars a day while the wealthiest 20 percent consume 66 times the
total resources of the world's poorest one fifth.
</P>
<P>
For the poor, he said, the promise of the Internet is at best,
hard to reach, and at worst, a bitter illusion that widens the gap
between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"As the world population grows to reach nine billion by the
year 2050, the pressures of scarcity and of uneven development
will inevitably lead to future conflict," King Abdullah II said.
</P>
<P>
"The new century will be full of challenges and opportunities,
and will therefore necessitate true vision, strong leadership, and
most importantly a commitment to embrace change quickly," he
stressed.

ATHENS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide war drill was
conducted in Greece Sunday, within the framework of the seven-day
military exercise codenamed "Alexandros 2000."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of air raid sirens sounded for one minute around the
country with the aim of testing responses to a national crisis.
</P>
<P>
A central alarm went off and in turn activated alarms in the
cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, Larissa and Patras, the semi-
official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A remote-controlled civil defense system then automatically
activated electronic sirens that are situated on the rooftops of
public buildings, police stations and factories throughout the
country.
</P>

The first-ever national trial run was held by the Greek Defense
Ministry and is being organized by the Public Order Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Italian Soccer: Lazio Narrow the Gap With Juventus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Juventus were held to a 1-1 draw
by bottom club Cagliari, allowing Lazio to narrow the gap at the
top of Serie A, the first division of Italian Soccer, to just one
point with a convincing 3-1 home win against Bari.
</P>
<P>
Cagliari centre-back Giovanni Sulcis was the man Lazio fans
were thanking this evening, earning his side the draw after Juve
had a dream start through Italy striker Pippo Inzaghi in the first
minute.
</P>
<P>
Juventus pressed hard after the equalizer but the closest they
came to scoring was a shot against the bar and a number of
scrambled saves.
</P>
<P>
Lazio also got off to the best of starts, a second-minute
penalty by dead-ball ace Sinisa Mihajlovic of Yugoslavia, before
Chilean striker Marcelo Salas got another in the 39th minute.
</P>
<P>
Bari pulled one back through Gionatha Spinosi in the 42nd
minute, but Czech Pavel Nedved ended the four-minute, three-goal
flurry by putting the match beyond doubt in the 43rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Lazio defended their lead in the second half - and hit the
woodwork three times in the match - to end the day on 39 points,
one behind Juventus.
</P>
<P>
Former Juventus, Middlesbrough and Marseille star Fabrizio
Ravanelli was not among the goals but the veteran striker won many
people's man of the match award with his workrate, passing and
movement.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday night's match at Milan's San Siro, Inter had the
veteran "divine ponytail" Roberto Baggio to thank for a 2-1 win
against Roma that propelled the Milanese team up level with their
crosscity rivals AC Milan, and with Roma itself, four points
behind Lazio.
</P>
<P>
Inter went one up through Italy striker Christian Vieri but
Roma pulled level with a thundering header from Brazilian veteran
defender Aldair, before Baggio brilliantly hooked a looping shot
into an empty net after a rebound from a shot by Francesco Moriero.
</P>
<P>
Rome kept fighting hard - a win would have put them just a
point behind their own city rivals, on 38 points - but Inter
gritted their teeth and held on grimly.
</P>
<P>
For AC Milan, Ukrainian Andrei Shevchenko scored a hat-trick in
six minutes as the champions won 3-0 at Perugia, pulling away from
Parma which went down to its second straight loss at Bologna
thanks to Giovanni Bia's 48th minute goal against his old club.
</P>
<P>
Shevchenko's three goals put him back on top of the marksmen's
standings ahead of Parma's Argentine ace Hernan Crespo.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Says European Economy Getting Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 30 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Romano Prodi said Sunday evening that European economy is "getting
better".
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Italian TV prime-time news Sunday night, Prodi said
that a weak euro is a real boost to EU exports.
</P>
<P>
The European economy has been accused of being too rigid to
show the growth needed to challenge the U.S. and restore the
wilting euro.
</P>
<P>
"The euro works," Prodi went on, and even though the U.S.
economy "is extremely strong," everything "will be put right" by
the coming European recovery.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the time will be used well" - a reference to
Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio's statement Saturday that "
time has grown short" to make much-needed structural reforms.

<HEADLINE> Tsohatzopoulos Stresses Federal Solution to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos stressed Sunday that only federal solution applies
in Cyprus, which has been divided since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the Athens newspaper "Sunday
Kathimerini," Tsohatzopoulos said that it is inconceivable for
Greece to take even one step back from the position on a federal
solution for the divided island republic.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided in 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island, in response to a Greek-
Cypriot coup aimed at uniting all of it with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece, along with the Cyprus Republic-led by President Glafcos
Clerides and the international community, supports the
reunification of Cyprus in a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation
formula, but the northern Cyprus-led Rauf Denktash, recognized
only by Turkey, demands that a confederation formed by two
sovereign states be set up in the Mediterranean island as a way
out of the Cyprus crisis.
</P>
<P>
In response to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's call,
Clerides and Denktash held the first round of the proximity talks
in New York last December and agreed to start the second round of
talks in Geneva next Monday, but the Greek Defense Minister said
Sunday that he expects no substantive progress to emerge from the
second round of proximity talks in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if Turkey remains intransigent on the Cyprus
issue, then it is not only Greece that will have to change its
stance before the European Union (EU).

<HEADLINE> Canada's Reform Party Leader Wins Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Reform Party leader Preston
Manning won a strong vote of confidence Sunday after Canada's main
opposition adopted a political alliance with Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Reform delegates voted 651 to 222, a majority of 75 percent, to
reject a proposed review of Manning's leadership.
</P>
<P>
The vote is considered progress in Manning's political strategy
for a more powerful party to challenge the ruling Liberal in the
election expected in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party has governed Canada since 1993, profiting
from both opposition divisions and the gradually improved economy.
</P>
<P>
The results of a three-day convention of the Reform Party have
yet to survive the final balloting slated for February and March.
Two-thirds of 70,000 Reformers must show their approval before the
Canadian Alliance can become a full-fledged political party.
