<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Denies Extraordinary Measures Taken against Possible Israeli Retaliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, denied today that it has taken any extraordinary
measure in fear of a possible retaliatory operation by israel for
the killing of four israeli soldiers in south Lebanon Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted security sources in south Lebanon as saying
earlier that Hezbollah officers in the south had left their houses
in accordance with an instruction issued by the Hezbollah
headquarters in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah also ordered an indefinite closure of all its
information and medical centers in the south, guarding against
possible military attacks by Israeli forces in revenge for the
Monday night ambush. During the ambush mounted by guerrillas on an
Israeli patrol in the Israeli-occupied encalve in south Lebanon,
one Israeli officer and three Israeli soldiers were killed and
nine others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Israel Radio report, the Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah said in a statement issued here tonight
that the measures taken by Hezbollah were "semi-formal measures."
</P>
<P>
"No extraordinary measure has been taken," the statement
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Palestinian group, which calls itself "the Islamic
Revolutionary Army in Palestine," announced today that it would
carry out more attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
The radical Palestinian group became known only after the
Monday night attack which it claimed it carried out in
collaboration with Hezbollah. It said in a statement issued in the
Lebanese capital tonight that it would continue its armed struggle
against Israel despite an announcement made by the Islamic
Resistance Movement, Hamas, on a three-month truce,
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Beirut-based daily Safir, three
guerrillas of the newly exposed Palestinian armed group vowed that
their fight against the Jewish state would continue until "all of
Palestine is liberated."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported in its today's issue that the interview
was conducted in a position "very close to the Israeli-occupied
border strip" in the south Tuesday following the Monday night
operation.
</P>
<P>
The three men gave clear indication that they were
collaborating closely with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and had a
similar Islamic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
They denied they lost any of their men during the attack.
</P>
<P>
Upon returning from the scene, they said they were given cover
by fighters of the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that the first statement issued by the
so-called "Islamic Revolutionary Army in Palestine" claiming
responsibility for the operation was broadcast by the television
AI-Marnar, Hezbollah's mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
Reports coming from Israel said that guerrillas fired on the
Israeli patrol near Israel's border and fled after wounding one
Israeli soldier.
</P>
<P>
Israeli reinforcements gave chase but a large land mine,
apparently planted by the guerrillas, exploded, causing further
Israeli casualties.
</P>
<P>
Two guerrillas were killed in the clash with members of the
Israeli patrol, and a third guerrilla fled, according to the
reports.

<HEADLINE> Alexander, Lugar Quit Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Republican presidential
runners have quitted the race for the White House and voiced their
support for the "apparent nominee" Senator Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
Former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander went first today,
telling a news conference in Nashville that he had ended his
candidacy. He congratulated the front-runner Dole and offered him
his support.
</P>
<P>
When withdrawing, Alexander said he had been going around the
country asking people, "Is Senator Dole the man that Republicans
want carrying our banner against Bill Clinton and leading us into
the next century?" He added with a chuckle, "And what I've
discovered is that for most Republicans the answer to that is
'yes.'"
</P>
<P>
Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana made his retreat announcement in
a U.S. Senate hearing room, surrounded by his family and a group
of supporters.
</P>
<P>
Lugar, who is in his fourth term in the Senate after serving as
mayor of Indianapolis for seven years, was unable to get his
campaign off the ground. His best showing was fourth place,
getting 14 percent, in Tuesday's Vermont primary.
</P>
<P>
Both Alexander and Lugar decided to quit the race one day after
Dole, the U.S. Senate majority leader, swept eight Republican
primaries and re-established himself as the prohibitive favorite
for the Republican nomination Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Maintains Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) - The Security Council today
maintained economic sanctions against Iraq following the 30th
review of its compliance with council demands.
</P>
<P>
Council president Legwaila J. Legwaila of Botswana told
reporters after a closed-door meeting that the council reviewed the
situation and reached no agreement.
</P>
<P>
Trade sanctions were imposed upon Iraq after its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under Resolution 687, the council meets every 60 days to
evaluate how Iraq is proceeding with council requirements before
the sanctions can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
As required by the Security Council in various resolutions,
Iraq has to destroy all its chemical, biological weapons and all
ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
It should also unconditionally undertake not to use, develop,
construct or acquire these weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
But up to now, there has not been sufficient progress by Iraq
in meeting these demands.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus not Satisfied with US Report on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
considered the Cyprus section of the U.S. State Department annual
report on human rights for 1995 not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
An official announcement, released here today, said that the
vocabulary of the report continues to put the legal authorities of
the Cyprus Republic on a par with the "pseudostate" in the
Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Cyprus Chapter of the State Department
report refers to the illegal regime in the occupied areas as
"Turkish Cypriot administration" and describes the legitimate
Cyprus Republic as the "government-controlled areas."
</P>
<P>
The announcement also said that the U.S. report, issued
Wednesday, fails to refer to the continued violations of human
rights, which are the result of the 1974 Turkish invasion and
occupation of one third of Cyprus' territory.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department annual report reviews the human
rights situation in every country in the world and has, in recent
years, been criticized by the Cyprus government for giving
recognition to the Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Acts of Violence "Carried out by Extremists from both Palestinian and Israeli Sides" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
today said the recent acts of violence "have been carried out by
extremists from both the Palestinian and Israeli sides with
foreign backing," according to reports reaching here from Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the statements following his meeting in Gaza with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who led an Egyptian
delegation to the inaugural session of the Palestinian legislative
council.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he possesses many documents which "substantiate
that those extremists have colluded to blow up the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said the whole world should close ranks
agaisnt violence which jeopardizes regional and international
peace, and called for convening an international conference on
combating terrorism as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On the recent Jerusalem bombing attacks, Arafat said "relevant
Israeli investigation have proven that the two perpetrators, who
had carried out the attacks, came from Hebron," an area he said is
under Israel's domination.
</P>
<P>
"On our part, we have succeeded in arresting one of the
masterminds and the state security court has sentenced him to life
imprisonment," Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat urged the Israeli side to take decisive steps against
those elements who are involved in the incidents and are under the
Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Arafat and Moussa discussed the latest
developments of the situation, the Israeli siege of the
Palestinian self-rule areas of the Gaza Strip and West Bank and
means to move forward the peace process despite extremists' desire
to sabotage it.
</P>
<P>
Moussa disclosed in a departure statement in Cairo that he was
carrying a letter from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to Arafat
on the current developments in the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unmanned Spy Planes Returning to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua)-- The U.S. Defense Department has
decided to send a souped-up version of the U.S. most sophisticated
unmanned reconnaissance plane back to Bosnia this week, Defense
Secretary William Perry said today.
</P>
<P>
Perry disclosed the decision when testifying on the Pentagon's
1997 defense budget proposals before the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on National Security.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon had four unmanned aircraft, nicknamed the
Predator, operating over the former Yugoslav republic last year.
But later, the Predators were pulled back after one of them
crashed and another was deliberately destroyed in the air because
of a malfunction.
</P>
<P>
The reconnaissance plane is controlled by a group of experts on
the ground who can guide the 27-foot-long drone to a target
several hundred miles away. The plane can transmit images via
satellite to ground commanders for military analysis.
</P>
<P>
The new version of unmanned aircraft, refitted with a more
sophisticated radar-imaging system, is expected to give
commanders of the U.S. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia a clearer and
more immediate picture of the positioning or movement of Bosnian
government, Croat and Bosnian Serb military forces, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The planes can also get a better view of weapons storage sites
of the military forces in the region, they said.
</P>
<P>
"This gives our forces an incomparable advantage in dealing
with the enemy forces," Perry said of the Predator's role in
providing timely intelligence on military forces in Bosnia. "We
know exactly where and who they are and what they're doing. They
do not have comparable information about us."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon officials said that the Predators will be based at
Taszar, Hungary, site of an airfield that American forces have
been using as a reception point for supplies and equipment flown
from Germany for the U.S. troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 American military personnel and 20 civilians will be
involved in the Predator deployment, they said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for Anti-Terror International Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat today in Gaza called for convening an international
conference on combating terrorism in Middle East and other parts
of the world, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
He spoke at the inaugural session of the 88-member Palestinian
Council, which the Palestinians refer to as parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We will not let violence and terrorism stop the peace
process," he said. "The enemy of peace everywhere must be fought."
</P>
<P>
Arafat proposed that the U.S., Russia, all Middle East
countries, the European Union and a number of U.N. Security
Council members meet to discuss methods of confronting the
regional and international scourge.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at terrorist acts of some Palestinian Islamic
groups and vowed that the current wave of bombings against Israel
will not derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his unsubstantiated accusation that Jewish
radicals are aiding the Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also criticized the Israeli authorities for total
closure on the Gaza Strip and West Bank and collective punishment
of the Palestinian people, emphasizing that the moves are not a
solution.
</P>
<P>
The president told the council that the building of
Palestinian entity will continue in order to create a Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala was elected president of the Palestinian Council with
57 votes, almost double the number received by the 77-year-old
Haydar Abdul Shafi, former head of Palestinian delegation to
peace talks in Madrid and Washington.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting was also attended by guests and observers
from a number of Arab states, some other countries and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in his speech that the
peace process is going through difficult conditions, but the
strength of the Palestinian people and wisdom of their leadership
will enable the nation to pass through this stage until the
establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to reconvene next week. President
Arafat will present his executive authority appointments. Under
the terms of the Oslo 2 agreement, some of his cabinet members
may come from outside the council itself.

LUANDA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Angolan police have decided to
work with their counterparts from the neighboring countries to
crack down on regional, organized criminal blocs, the national
news agency quoted a provincial police commissioner as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
Oliveira Santos from Huila Province said in Lubango that the

groups which are engaged in the theft of cars, transmission and
telephone lines, drug trafficking and robbery of rare animals in
Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Angolan police, together with Namibian cops, have in the past
two months strengthened ties in the border areas in the south to
crack down on crime so that cases of car theft have been reduced
greatly, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Namibian president Sam Nujoma was recently in Luanda to

<HEADLINE> UN Official in Baghdad for Dialogue with Iraqi Government on Weapons Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official arrived here today
to continue the political dialogue with the Iraqi government on
its weapons programs and conduct assessment of the monitoring
system under operation.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival, Charles Duelfer, deputy chairman of
the U.N. Special Commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction (UNSCOM), told reporters that although the
Iraqi government has been cooperative and provided them with more
declarations, he believes that "there are still documents in Iraq
that will help us."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the areas in which he needs more
documentation, he said, "Fundamentally, all areas. In the
chemical and biological area, we need to be able to get sure that
the produced agents are accounted for. We have also to be able to
get sure that the munitions have been accounted for. In the
missile area, there are some production elements that we think
need further examination, and we still are not quite certain that
we have accounted for all the missiles."
</P>
<P>
Duelfer said that they will present to the Security Council a
"factual" report on Iraq's weapons programs in April. However, the
time for the UNSCOM to present a final report to the Security
Council depends on how quickly they can get verified information
form Iraq in all areas, particularly in the areas where they have
still uncertainty, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that in spite of Iraq's allegation that it has
provided all the information and all details for a long period of
time, U.N. officials have found that there have been other key
points on Iraq's weapons programs which have yet to be disclosed.
The most obvious example is in the biological field, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official expressed his satisfaction with the
monitoring system installed in Iraq for the supervision of its
weapons production. The monitoring system is operating well but
need some adjustments, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations ordered Iraq to eliminate its major weapons
programs after Iraqi troops were expelled from Kuwait in
1991. This is one of the main conditions for a lifting of the
trade embargo imposed after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer also said that the work of UNSCOM is separated from
oil-for-food talks that are scheduled to resume Monday at
U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
Under those talks, Iraq would be allowed to export 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil in a initial six-month period.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Says 1995 Landmark Year for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- International Women's Day
this year is a point from which we can look ahead to the
redemption of the promises made in the course of 1995, a truly
landmark year for the advancement of women, U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his message to mark the International Women's Day, he said
that the status of women has improved markedly in the half-century
of the existence of the United Nations. However, there is still a
very long way to go. No society treats its women as well as its
men.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing was one of the
largest global gatherings ever held, with some 17,000
participants, including nearly 7,000 delegates representing 189
countries. More than 30,000 people participated in the
Non-Governmental Organization Forum, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Governments pledged themselves to dedicate activities and
resources to implement the Beijing Declaration and the Platform
for Action, he said.
</P>
<P>
They identified priority action, in areas such as health,
education and human rights of women, and established targets to be
met over the next five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the United Nations has a unique contribution
to make in ensuring that their contents, as well as their spirit,
find reflection in sustained and deliberate courses of action at
all levels.
</P>
<P>
"At the global level, the General Assembly, the Economic and
Social Council, the Commission on the Status of Women and other
constituents of the United Nations system, all have a special
responsibility and must work together to fulfil it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Families Making A Comeback in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The traditional American family
is making a comeback as the number of two-parent households with
children increased by 700,000 from 1990 to 1995, the New York
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the traditional pattern of American households
with children reversed a 20-year decline, the newspaper said
quoting a profile of the country population issued on Wednesday by
a research group.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the divorce rate slowed to 20.5
divorces per 1,000 married women in 1994 from 23 divorces per
1,000 in 1980 and that the increase in the number of births to
unmarried women slowed to a 2 percent annual average increase in
the early 1990's, down from a 6 percent annual rise in the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed these changes to the fact that the
baby-boom generation, which makes up a third of the country's
population, has entered middle age, and is beginning to settle
into the task of raising families.
</P>
<P>
Depicting the annual growth rate of 1 percent in overall
American population in the first half of the 1990's, the research
group predicted that with this rate the United States population
of 262.8 million could reach 300 million by 2010 and nearly 400
million by the middle of the next century.

<HEADLINE> RENAMO Admits Former Guerrillas Joining In Zimbabwe's Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 7 (Xinhua) --The Mozambican National Resistance
(RENAMO) has admitted for the first time that some of its former
guerrillas had joined the ranks of Zimbabwe's dissidents and
involved in their sabotage and terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
RENAMO's political representative in Manica Province, Jose
Companhia, revealed this to reporters two days ago,Radio
Mozambique reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party's former guerrilla members joining in
Zambabwe's dissidents was their own business, having nothing to
do with the RENAMO.
</P>
<P>
But Companhia condemned the men for their sabotage and
terrorist activities which have caused unrest and social
instability in Manica Province.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's dissidents have been engaging in such illegal
activities in Mozambican provinces of Manica and Sofala in
collaborating with some of the former RENAMO guerrillas, which
has attracted much attention from the Mozambican government.
</P>
<P>
President Joaqim Alberto Chissado noted recently, if
necessary, Mozambique's military forces will join the crack down
on the Zimbabwean offenders so as to drive them out of the
country as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Britain Likely to Buy American U2 Spy Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
(MoD) is considering to buy 6 to 12 U2 reconnaissance planes from
the United States, according to a report in The Times newspaper
today.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, with its 103 feet wingspan and maximum flying
altitude of about 90,000 feet, is being studied as possible
platform for an airborne stand-off radar system called Astor, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The MoD has been deliberating over the past few years on what
platform to use for the Astor system in a bid to monitor war zones
in which British troops are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The British Army has been demanding for a stand-off
surveillance system that can provide a comprehensive picture of a
conflict area.
</P>
<P>
Defense sources say that U2-deal worth 1.1 billion U.S. dollars
was one of the several options which is under serious
consideration.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that other aircraft considered for the Astor
system included the Islander, Camberra and Nimrod. Although the
Nimrod was favored, the Royal Air Force considered that its
maximum operational altitude to be too low.

<HEADLINE> African Governments Urged To Pay Tax On State Properties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (xinhua) --African governments should pay full
tax on state properties in local authority areas to increase
revenue for the local authorities, a regional seminar on property
tax in Sub-Aaharan Africa said in a communique issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The communique issued at the end of the seminar proposed that
government should review the criteria used to exempt some
properties from paying property tax.
</P>
<P>
Some government properties, such as universities, schools,
creches, hospitals which are run not for gain or profit, are
among those that are exempted from paying property tax, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
It said, ''Property tax is an increasingly important source of
local government revenues for the provision of services. It is a
visible tax base providing an opportunity to redistribute wealth
at local level."
</P>
<P>
''Given effective decentralisation, the property tax can
reduce significantly the dependence of local authorities on
central government grants,'' the communique noted.
</P>
<P>
The seminar recommended that government should reduce
political interference so that all those rated pay tax and
collectors do their jobs without fear or favour.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, delegates from Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe recommended the full devolution of authority decision
making functions and resources and that central government should
retain residual supervisory powers.

<HEADLINE> Economic Forecasting Gauge Falls in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A key index of future economic
activity in the U.S. fell 0.5 percent in January to the lowest
level in more than two years, a widely expected decline because of
a powerful blizzard that disrupted business.
</P>
<P>
The January Index of Leading Economic Indicators, released
today by the Conference Board, stood at 100.2, the lowest since
November 1993 when it read as 99.7.
</P>
<P>
The reading was compared with 0.2 percent in December and a
drop of 0.2 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Because the index is a forward-looking indicator designed to
forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance, the
January decline suggested economic weakness by summer.
</P>
<P>
Economists, however, tend to view the index as a true
indication of economic direction only when it moves in the same
direction for three straight months or more. Wall Street had
expected the index to fall 0.6 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Of the index's 11 components, six made negative contributions
to the overall figure. A decline in the average factory workweek
hurt the most, mostly because of the blizzard that hit the East
Coast and kept many workers at home.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a private New York-based research group,
recently took charge of the leading index from the Commerce
Department. The gauge was privatized to save the government money.
</P>
<P>
During the last six months, the leading index has declined 0.9
percent, registering drops in each month except December and
August. The index has a 1987 base of 100.

<HEADLINE> Unmanned Aircraft May Dominate Future Air Warfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Unmanned aircraft capable of
detecting targets from hundreds of miles away and destroying them
will dominate air warfare in the 21st century, according to U.S.
Air Force engineers and a report written by the service's
scientific advisory board.
</P>
<P>
Advances in communication technologies, materials and computer
processing has opened a world of possibilities to scientists eager
to exploit them.
</P>
<P>
The drive to make aircraft more affordable has prompted
designers to further improve the unmanned aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The future unmanned aircraft will become sleeker, much lighter
than piloted aircraft because of use of new materials and
technologies, the Air Force's engineers said.
</P>
<P>
Even the manned aircraft that remain in the U.S. fleet of the
future will look radically different from today's advanced
fighters and bombers such as the F-22 and the B-2, they said.
</P>
<P>
Like birds of prey, these futuristic manned machines will adopt
smart, sensor-imbedded skins to adapt to changing combat
environments and weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Future manned aircraft may be designed without tails or flight
control surfaces, expanding on the concept used for the B-2, in
which propulsion and aerodynamics become enmeshed, the engineers
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Demands PNA to Arrest Hamas Activist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel has given the name and
location of a Hamas activist, who is believed to have planned the
suicide bombing attacks in the past two weeks, to the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to arrest him, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed today at the Knesset (Israel's parliament)
by Israeli Public Security Minister Moshe Shahal, who said
that Israel is now waiting for his arrest by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, has claimed
responsibility for a series of suicide attacks in the last
two weeks in Israel, which killed more than 50 people and
wounded over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
Shahal told the Knesset that the PNA is understood to
have arrested only five out of 13 Islamic extremists on a
list that Israel had handed over to PNA President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He added that two of the five had been arrested by the
Palestinian police before and sentenced to long prison terms,
however, both of them were released later.
</P>
<P>
The list of the 13 wanted Islamic extremists was given to
Arafat by Israeli army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak
during their meeting after the first suicide bombing attacks
in Jerusalem and Ashkelon on February 25.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat called in Gaza today for an international
conference to combat terrorism in the Middle East and in the
whole world.
</P>
<P>
He made the call at the newly elected 88-member Palestinian
Council, which met for the first time in a auditorium in the Gaza
city.
</P>
<P>
"We will not let violence and terrorism stop the peace
process," said Arafat, "and the enemy of peace must be
fought everywhere." **

<HEADLINE> CBI: Business Interest Be Put at the Top of EU Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- UK business interest must be
central to the debate on the future development of the European
Union (EU), the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As it launched its Business in Europe campaign Wednesday in an
effort to ensure that the voice of business is heard "loud and
clear", the CBI called on John Major to seize the initiative at
the forthcoming Inter-Governmental Conference starting later this
month.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said that the current political debate on Europe in the
UK is not helping business interests. The UK needs a more
rational, informative debate on the issues that matter to
business.
</P>
<P>
It added that the extreme and often emotive arguments put
forward on both sides, particularly over Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU), obscure the real priorities of improving
competitiveness, growth and employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the campaign in London, Neall
FitzGerald, Chairman of the CBI's Europe Committee, said: "The
future success of Europe is of vital importance to us all. It is
crucial that business priorities are not lost in the fog of
rhetoric that surrounds most of the UK's debate on that future."
</P>
<P>
"This campaign is all about putting business interests back at
the top of the agenda. It will provide the objective, factual
information on European issues that companies want, promote better
understanding of business priorities and bring a much needed
clarity to the UK's Euro vision," he added.
</P>
<P>
The CBI campaign will culminate in "Business in Europe Week", a
series of major events in June attended and addressed by a range
of leading politicians and industrialists from across the EU.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Take Rushdie Case to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran declared here today that
it will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like
the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance,
said at a press conference here that Iran will ask the United
Nations to effectively put a ban on insulting religious
sanctities in a bid to prevent disputes such as Rushdie
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We think there is room for such an action at different
international forums including the U.N.," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking through an interpreter to an international corps of
reporters here to report on March 8th parliamentary elections,
he stressed that the concept of freedom in the West led to
violations of the rights of others.
</P>
<P>
While answering the question by Xinhua, Mirsalim said "Iran is
planning to take the issue of insulting religious sanctities,
which has resulted in the Rushdie issue, to the international
bodies, including to the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that there is a deviation inherent in the concept
of freedom in some of the Western societies that tramples the
rights of the most people in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the cultural community and the authors in the West
had been committed to respecting the religious beliefs of the
people, a problem such as Salman Rushdie would have never
emerged," he added.
</P>
<P>
He added that his ministry was committed to defend Islamic
culture and rejected allegations by critics that his ministry
took sides with the religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
"Being neutral does not mean anything. We have to defend
the Islamic culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian culture minister did not say whether Iran
intends to drop late religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa
against Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said during his
recent trip to central Asian states that Iran will resume talks
with the European Union (EU) on the Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
On 14 February 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini
issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on
British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest
against the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and
exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Liberal weekly Bahman reported in February that former deputy
guidance minister, Ahmad Masjed Jame'ie, resigned over differences
pertaining the new restrictions imposed on authors.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance came under
heavy attacks in 1995 by the religious conservatives that took
the ministry for allowing the publication of romantic novels.
</P>
<P>
In a sudden about-face in its publication policy, the
ministry declared that authors have to receive permission prior
to publication of their books.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Announces Peace Plan Despite Rebel Attack on Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- While Chechen militants launched a
large-scale offensive in central Grozny, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said today that his Security Council has approved a plan
to end the 15-month bloodshed in the secessionist Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
At a session in the Kremlin this morning, the Security Council
formulated and endorsed in principle a step-by-step program to
stabilize the situation in Chechnya peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told reporters after the meeting that the program
envisages a "peaceful achievement of stabilization," noting that
those involved in murders should be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
But he said he could not give a detailed interpretation of the
program until late March when "everything is ready."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fierce fighting is under way between 1,000 Chechen
rebels and Russian interior troops and pro-Moscow Chechen
policemen in almost all parts of Grozny, capital of Russia's
Chechen Republic. Heavy casualties were reported on both sides,
said news reports reaching here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Grozny worsened remarkably on Wednesday
morning when Chechen fighters loyal to separatist leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev launched a surprise offensive against the positions of the
Russian troops and seized control of parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
At least 70 Russian servicemen were killed, more than 130
wounded and 40 missing, the reports said. Over 130 Chechen
militants were killed and 200 wounded.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have stormed the TV center in central Grozny and
approached the local government building after Wednesday's seizure
of at least two police stations.
</P>
<P>
Russian tanks have reportedly been moved into the downtown
area, and reinforcements were rushed to besieged Russian positions.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the rebels have taken 84 civilian
workers hostage and kidnapped a number of Russians working in the
city.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Jordan's King Hussein held a meeting at the White House today,
pledging to stand against the forces of terrorism and for the
forces of peace.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein said at the start of the meeting with Clinton that
a wave of bomb attacks killing 57 people in Israel over the past
two weeks "was an action of a small group against the overwhelming
majority of people in our region who are seeking peace."
</P>
<P>
"The object is very clear. These people are trying to scuttle
the peace process and destroy all that has been achieved. And they
must never succeed," the king added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters that "I look forward to discussing with
him today what we can do together to stand against the forces of
terrorism and for the forces of peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
The president also praised PLO chairman Yassar Arafat for his
"real efforts" to curb violence in the region, adding that "but I
think that all of us will have to do more."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the terror attacks, Clinton and King Hussein are
expected to discuss the transfer of F-16 fighters to Jordan and
other matters pertaining to security in the region, White House
press secretary Mike McCurry said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Tourism in London Hit by IRA Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of violence by the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) since February 9 in London has hit
hotel bookings in this metropolitan city, according to a report
in the Independent newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The new IRA violence campaign has also cast a shadow over the
optimistic statement made by the British Tourist Authority on
Wednesday that a record number of overseas visitors came to
Britain last year.
</P>
<P>
The Authority said a total of 23.6 million tourists, 12 percent
more than the previous high of 21 million set in 1994, came to the
UK in 1995 and spent a record 11.7 billion pounds (17.8 billion US
dollars), up 18 percent on 1994.
</P>
<P>
These figures were boosted by a big rise in visitors from North
America, up by 10 percent to a record 3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
But since the collapse of the IRA ceasefire on February 9, many
London hotels have suffered booking cancellations and some say
that they have yet to recover business.
</P>
<P>
Bookings at the Britannia International, close to the IRA bomb
in Docklands, east London, are down.
</P>
<P>
General manager Eric Luch said that his hotel had a 20-25
percent cancellation rate at the time of the bombings,
particularly from the American market, and now the hotel has a 30
percent reduction in bookings.
</P>
<P>
Gillian McLorlan, reservations supervisor for the Grosvenor
House Hotel said that at the time of bombings, the hotel had
cancellations and now "we are not busy as we would expect for
April."
</P>
<P>
The London Tourist Board admitted that if the bombing campaign
was kept up it would damage the tourist market.

Zimbabwean Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affirs

the government and ZANU (pf) did not see anything in the current
constitution and electoral laws that impeded opposition parties
from orgbanising and expressing their views.

The opposition political parties maintain that the legal
framework favours the ruling ZANU (pf) party, making free and
fair elections impossible.

''There is nothing which they can say can be construed as an
impediment to anybody wishing to exercise any contrary views to
that of the ruling party,'' Mnangagwa said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties in Zimbabwe have expressed dissatisfaction
with the constitution and the electoral laws which they say give
too much power to the incumbent president as to make the
political playground tilted in favour of the ruling party.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Reform Intelligence Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A panel of American
intelligence experts have recommended reforms of the entire U.S.
intelligence community to meet the "new security threats" in the
wake of the Cold War, U.S. Congress sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the U.S.
Intelligence Community called in its latest report for a
limitation of the ability of U.S. military commanders to collect
information they need on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled "Preparing for the 21st Century: An
Appraisal of U.S. Intelligence" recommends that some major tasks
of the military spy agency be taken over by the civilian-run
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
</P>
<P>
The study was requested by the Republican-controlled Congress
and U.S. President Bill Clinton to determine what changes are need
to restructure the intelligence community in the post-Cold War
era.
</P>
<P>
The report said that spies serving the U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA) belonging to the Pentagon should be
reassigned to work for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
The panel insists that reform would save money by eliminating
the duplicative efforts.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the Pentagon and CIA should eliminate
at least 10 percent of the civilian work force, and invest the
savings into technology development.
</P>
<P>
Control of the intelligence directorate of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff should be moved from DIA to the Joint Staff, the
study said.

ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister Mortaza Sarmadi said today that important regional and
international issues will be discussed at the forthcoming Economic
Cooperation Organization (ECO) summit.
</P>
<P>
Talking to local reporters in the southern port city of Karachi
on the conclusion of his five-day visit to Pakistan, he said
matters on boosting trade and economic relations among the ECO
countries will be reviewed at the ECO summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit of ECO, a 10-country group including Pakistan, Iran,
Turkey, Afghanistan and six Central Asian countries, is scheduled
to be held in Ashkabad in May this year.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, he said Iran has always supported a
peaceful solution to the Afghanistan problem.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and Pakistan have always cooperated with Afghanistan
in finding a peaceful solution to their problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi said both Pakistan and Iran have always been discussing
this problem and helping them to resolve their dispute.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it was their problem and they should solve it
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We could only assist them and that's the only role which both
Pakistan and Iran have assured to them", he added.
</P>
<P>
He said "meaningful negotiations" is the best course for
reaching a peaceful settlement to the Afghanistan problem.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Iran differ in their views regarding Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan insists that the government of President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, whose office tenure ended in December 1994, is
illegitimate while Iran believes whoever is in power in Kabul is
the legal representative of the country.

ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan needs the World Bank's
assistance to initiate a long-term strategy to preserve water
lakes and Indus water in the southern Sindh province, said the
province's Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Meiko Nishmizu, Country Director of World Bank for
South-Asia Region, in Karachi, Sindh's provincial capital, Shah
said more than 62 percent of the land in Sindh has already been
affected by water-logging and salinity.
</P>
<P>
The chief minister said that water management is a serious
problem and requires priority attention of the World Bank by way
of advance technical assistance and expertise.
</P>
<P>
The chief minister suggested the initiation of a drainage
scheme from delta side instead of upstream of River Indus,
according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the construction of reservoirs and dams to store
hill torrents particularly during monsoon season.
</P>
<P>
The enormity of water, he said, causes flood and devastation in
the province, which is a natural draining point of the country.
</P>
<P>
The chief minister said this water, if stored, not only can be
judiciously utilized for drinking and irrigation purposes but also
for generating electricity.
</P>
<P>
He called for initiation of a tangible project by the World
Bank for storage of Indus water.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sindh government will be willing to provide its
skilled manpower for this project.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, women health care, education and other
issues in social development also came under discussion.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Considering Opening B Shares to Natives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen special economic zone
(SEZ) is considering allowing individuals and enterprises to buy
the B-class shares with foreign exchanges, a senior city official
attending an ongoing National People's Congress session said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li Youwei, secretary of the city committee of the Communist
Party of China, told Xinhua that Shenzhen is also thinking of
establishing one or two Sino-foreign funds to introduce overseas
capital to the domestic A-class share market.
</P>
<P>
A shares are denominated and traded in the local currency of
yuan and currently open for domestic investors only. B shares are
denominated in the US dollar but quoted in yuan and available only
to overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
Li described the city's financial market as "fairly sound",
saying that all local banks have been operating on pure
commercial lines.
</P>
<P>
There are 52 foreign-fund banks and bank offices in Shenzhen,
with loans outstanding valued at 3.6 billion US dollars at the end
of last year, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The booming city also plans to establish a securities
company with a capitalization of more than one billion yuan, said
Li, a member of the Preparatory Committee of the future Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
As China's first SEZ, Shenzhen will continue to take the full
advantage of neighbouring Hong Kong and live up to its role as a
showcase of the country's reform and opening policy and a
testfield for socialist market economy reforms, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also said his city will work to lead and promote
economic growth in the country's interior and facilitate the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We're studying how to do a good job in making Shenzhen
dovetail with Hong Kong so as to ensure its prosperity and
stability," the secretary told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In one of the envisaged measures to link the two cities, a
5.5-km cross-sea bridge will be built in Shekou with money from
both sides, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
He said that particular efforts should be made to connect the
two cities in the service sector including finance, trade and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
"If the work of connection is well done, Shenzhen will able to
attract more businesspeople and investment from Hong Kong and
continue to be a logistics base for Hong Kong," Li said.

LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Downing Street pledged today that
the government would "not be held back" from the Northern Ireland
peace process by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) which had refused
to restore its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The British government indicated that it would continue its
consultations with political parties in Northern Ireland which
have committed themselves to democratic and peaceful means in
resolving the conflict, and then it would convene the planned
all-party talks on the future of the troubled province in June.
</P>

The above-said comments made by Downing Street follows a
statement from an IRA leading member, saying that the Anglo-Irish
joint communique issued on February 28 in London offered them "no
incentive" to restore its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Sinn Fein's weekly newspaper "An
Phoblacht" ("Republican News"), He ruled out the possibility of
the IRA's arms decommissioning before a final settlement of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the unnamed IRA member said that under
no circumstances would the IRA "leave nationalist areas
defenseless".

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry today
clarified its official stance towards the bombings in Israel,
saying that the Tehran government condemns attacks of innocent
people.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Javad Zarif, Deputy Foreign Minister for International
Affairs, told 20 ambassadors of the Western block today that
Iran had no connection with the bombing incidents in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Zarif clarified that the report by Iran's official news agency
IRNA should not be interpreted as the stand of the Iranian
government.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the two powerful bomb attacks in Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv, IRNA called the bomb blasts in Israel "divine
retribution."
</P>
<P>
"The massive bomb blasts have not only shattered the 'Rambo'
image of Israeli secret services like Mossad, but they also herald
the beginning of the end of Israel," IRNA said.

The report said "the blasts prove that the Zionist state
stands utterly powerless to prevent the attacks by the heroic

<P>
It said that Israel "is now tasting its own medicine," adding
that "the wave of Hamas bombing attacks also has a clear message
to the Arab rulers who have been rushing to put their signatures

is: the spirit of Jihad is very much alive and moslems are
awake."
</P>
<P>
Under sharp criticism from the European countries, Deputy
Foreign Minister Zarif said that IRNA's report did not represent
the government's view but only journalist reporting.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Zarif today called in ambassadors
from European countries and Japan, Canada, Switzerland and
Australia and made explanation because France and Germany had
already stated that they would decrease relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry today issued an official statement, saying
"the Islamic Republic of Iran rejects the unfounded, yet
often-repeated U.S. allegations that Iran supports international
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"As one of the countries most victimized by terrorism, the
Islamic Republic of Iran, in accordance with its foreign policy
principles, has consistently called for a comprehensive and
non-selective approach to deal with the root cause of terrorism
phenomenon, and to this end, it has submitted concrete proposals
for international cooperation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, it added, the international community has thus far
evaded the responsibility to approach all acts of terrorism with
equal vigor, dynamism, assertiveness, and away from selectivity.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, the international community should
disregard political considerations and manipulations by hegemonic
powers, and always operate under the cardinal principle that, no
matter who the victims or the perpetrators may be, no act of
violence against innocent people shall ever be condoned or
supported," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "The Islamic Republic of Iran rejects the
unfounded allegations of involvement, direction and support for
the recent incidents in occupied Palestine which are deeply rooted
in the internal problems, policies, and violent practices of the
Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
"Such allegations are fabricated and disseminated by the Israeli
regime to obscure its domestic and international problems and
are repeated by the United States," the statement said.

Li Peng said, school teaching and researches should be geared
to the demand of a socialist market economy for talents, and
educational circles should improve the efficiency of school
management by deepening the education reform.
</P>
<P>
More emphasis should be put on basic and vocational education,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy giving students studying abroad the
exit-entry freedom has proved correct, he said. The government
welcomes those who come back to contribute what they have learned
abroad to the motherland's development, and will provide good
working and living conditions for them.

"We have already adopted a returned scholar's suggestion that
30 million yuan be allocated each year to finance researches by
young and middle-aged scientists," the premier said.

Li said China aims at increasing the proportion of education
funds in the total GDP to four percent of the GDP at the end of
the century, and the proportion of education funds in local
expenditures must not be lower than 15 percent on average.
</P>

Said Li Lanqing, a vice premier, who was also present at the
discussion, "A total of 20 billion yuan has been invested in
building housing for teachers in the past two years, and work
should continue in this regard."

<HEADLINE> Iran Clarifies Stance towards Bombings in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry today
clarified its official stance towards the bombings in Israel,
saying that the Tehran government condemns attacks of innocent
people.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Javad Zarif, Deputy Foreign Minister for International
Affairs, told 20 ambassadors of the Western block today that
Iran had no connection with the bombing incidents in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Zarif clarified that the report by Iran's official news agency
IRNA should not be interpreted as the stand of the Iranian
government.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the two powerful bomb attacks in Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv, IRNA called the bomb blasts in Israel "divine
retribution."
</P>
<P>
"The massive bomb blasts have not only shattered the 'Rambo'
image of Israeli secret services like Mossad, but they also herald
the beginning of the end of Israel," IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The report said "the blasts prove that the Zionist state
stands utterly powerless to prevent the attacks by the heroic
youth of Islam."
</P>

It said that Israel "is now tasting its own medicine," adding

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Urged to Allow Banks to Invest  in Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has been
urged to allow banks to invest money in Indonesia's capital
markets to offset foreign dominance.
</P>
<P>
Rosano Barack, chairman of the Indonesian Association of Listed
Companies, said that President Soeharto has asked him to seek ways
of increasing domestic participation in the country's capital
market.
</P>
<P>
Barack revealed this at a seminar here today, saying that
foreign investors dominate shares in the capital markets,
especially regarding blue chips.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar, Barack said one way to boost domestic
share purchase would be to call on the government to allow banks
to purchase shares in their names.
</P>
<P>
If banks were allowed to invest a certain percentage of their
paid-up capital in shares, those shares would not be in the hands
of foreign investors, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Under current rules of the Central Bank, banks are prohibited
from purchasing shares in capital markets.
</P>
<P>
The number of listed firms in Indonesia's bourses has steadily
increased from 155 in 1990 to 257 in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Considering Opening B Shares to Natives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen special economic zone
(SEZ) is considering allowing individuals and enterprises to buy
the B-class shares with foreign exchanges, a senior city official
attending an ongoing National People's Congress session said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li Youwei, secretary of the city committee of the Communist
Party of China, told Xinhua that Shenzhen is also thinking of
establishing one or two Sino-foreign funds to introduce overseas
capital to the domestic A-class share market.
</P>
<P>
A shares are denominated and traded in the local currency of
yuan and currently open for domestic investors only. B shares are
denominated in the US dollar but quoted in yuan and available only
to overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
Li described the city's financial market as "fairly sound",
saying that all local banks have been operating on pure
commercial lines.
</P>
<P>
There are 52 foreign-fund banks and bank offices in Shenzhen,
with loans outstanding valued at 3.6 billion US dollars at the end
of last year, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The booming city also plans to establish a securities
company with a capitalization of more than one billion yuan, said
Li, a member of the Preparatory Committee of the future Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
As China's first SEZ, Shenzhen will continue to take the full
advantage of neighbouring Hong Kong and live up to its role as a
showcase of the country's reform and opening policy and a
testfield for socialist market economy reforms, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also said his city will work to lead and promote
economic growth in the country's interior and facilitate the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We're studying how to do a good job in making Shenzhen
dovetail with Hong Kong so as to ensure its prosperity and
stability," the secretary told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In one of the envisaged measures to link the two cities, a
5.5-km cross-sea bridge will be built in Shekou with money from
both sides, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
He said that particular efforts should be made to connect the
two cities in the service sector including finance, trade and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
"If the work of connection is well done, Shenzhen will able to
attract more businesspeople and investment from Hong Kong and
continue to be a logistics base for Hong Kong," Li said.

<P>
JAKARTA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto here
today stated that law enforcement would save the country's forests
from the harsh exploitation by a handful of irresponsible
concessionaires.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we enforce the law, we would be able to save our
forests," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when receiving members of the
World Commission for Forest and Sustainable Development at the
Merdeka Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
About 200 members of the commission and other participants from
forest and other business circles attended the Asian region public
hearing since March 3.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto recalled that since the '70s, the Indonesian
government has been issuing licenses to concessionaires to exploit
some 30 million hectares of production forests.
</P>
<P>
However, some businessmen have violated the existing
regulations in exploiting the natural resources. Some of them are
even engaged in illegal tree felling outside their areas.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said that if the government learns about
irregularities in the exploitation of the country's forests, it
will take stern measures against the irresponsible
concessionaires.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng urged
local officials of northeast China's Jilin Province to boost
agriculture and reinvigorate this China's old industrial center.
</P>
<P>
During a panel discussion attended by Jilin deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC) now in session, Li listened
carefully to the NPC deputies' speeches about the province's grain
production, macro-control over grain market, purchasing of farm
products, revitalization of old enterprises, and development of
pillar industries and the Tumen River area.
</P>
<P>
"Jilin has its peculiar conditions and advantages for grain
production, and the central government places high hopes on the
province's agriculture," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged local officials to pay great attention to protecting
the initiative of farmers, and if conditions are available,
proper-scale farming should be introduced in some areas.
</P>
<P>
"Please assure the farmers that the state will purchase all
cotton and grain from them according to (the products') quality,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the premier required local officials not to
misuse grain purchasing funds for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
"Township enterprises must be developed if the farmers want to
get rich," he said, citing those engaged in processing of farm and
sideline products through taking use of local resources.
</P>
<P>
The province should give priority to expanding automobile and
petrochemical industries. In addition to support from the central
government, the province should increase its capability for
self-development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Old enterprises in Jilin, and in northeast China as a whole,
have made great contributions to national economy, but they are
confronting with a host of difficulties," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier expressed his hope that people from local business
circles renew their concepts to enliven the old industrial center.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Australian Government Needs to Step Further in Asian Relations (by Lin Zhenxi, Liu Dongkai) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The coalition government of
Australia will unveil itself to the world Friday, but there does
not seem to be a sufficient answer to the big question -- who are
they?
</P>
<P>
In the past 13 years, the Liberal-National coalition has had no
chance to represent Australia in the outside world, especially
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister-elect John Howard, who visited Asia only twice
in the past decade, has yet to get the Asian neighbors to know him
and his government.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he has yet to show that the coalition
government fully understands specific situations in different
parts of the region in dealing with Australian-Asian relations.
</P>
<P>
His promise to pay his first overseas visit as prime minister
to an Asian country is an obvious step towards this direction.
</P>
<P>
In its foreign policy package released in the election
campaign, the coalition put closer engagement with Asia as the
government's highest priority in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Howard confirmed this at a press conference after the coalition
won the election. He also promised consistence of Australia's
foreign policy in a change of government.
</P>
<P>
The foreign policy package retains every major feature of the
predecessor Labor government's policy, except that it more
explicitly emphasizes the importance of the Australia-US alliance
and the US military presence in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still a number of ambiguous points in the
package. One of them is how the coalition government will deal
with different values and principles held by foreign societies.
</P>
<P>
The package recognizes that many countries "place different
interpretations on the nature and the meaning of liberal democracy
and these differences will be respected."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the prime minister-elect told the local
press that the coalition would not sacrifice its "values and
principles" for better relations with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Notably, the foreign policy package puts special emphasis on
upgrading relations with North Asia, but it fails to mention the
northern half of the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that the outgoing Labor government had
left the door open on talks with the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) on resumption of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Differences in cultural origins and social systems make it much
more subtle for both sides in handling Australian-Asian relations
than it is the case in Australia's relations with Europe and North
America.
</P>
<P>
A proper way of dealing with these differences will be the key
to the Australian government's success in its Asian policies.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Foreign Minister-to-be Alexander Downer
will release a transition agenda for the coalition government to
implement its foreign policy priorities in the next 12 months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Switzerland's Ciba, Sandoz Announce Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's two biggest
multinational chemical groups, Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG, today
announced their plan to merge into one mammoth company in a bid to
improve their competitiveness in the world market.
</P>
<P>
According to Ciba and Sandoz, both based in the Swiss town of
Basel, the new concern would be named "Novartis" and would have
combined sales of 26 billion Swiss francs, or about 22 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With a world market share of 4.4 percent, Novartis would be the
second biggest pharmaceutical company in the world after
Glaxo-Wellcome PLC of Britain, which is the result of a
mega-merger deal less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In terms of agrochemicals, Novartis would become the number one
business worldwide, Ciba and Sandoz said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong Swiss franc, both Ciba and Sandoz performed
rather well last year.
</P>
<P>
Ciba's net profits rose 13 percent to 2.16 billion francs
(about 1.9 billion dollars) and Sandoz's net profits grew by 18
percent to 2.04 billion francs (1.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"To combine two strong and successful companies into an even
stronger and more successful new entity represents a fascinating
vision," said Ciba President Alex Krauer.
</P>
<P>
Novartis plans to focus on its core life sciences business,
spinning off their speciality chemicals and construction
chemicals operations.
</P>
<P>
Novartis would then have annual sales worth 26 billion francs
in the remaining pharmaceutical, agricultural and nutritional
areas, based on 1995 figures.
</P>
<P>
Ciba and Sandoz said in a statement that before one-time,
non-recurring transaction and restructuring costs, they expected
the deal would strongly enhance earnings from the first year.
</P>
<P>
The world's biggest corporate merger dwarfs previous
mega-mergers such as Walt Disney's acquisition last year of
Capital Cities/ABC television network in the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, it would result in a ten percent cut in jobs, or
14,000 job losses over the next three years, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
Sandoz shareholders will receive 55 percent of the new
company's shares and Ciba shareholders 45 percent under the
merger, which is to be formally approved by shareholders at
general meetings in April.
</P>
<P>
Registered shares in both Ciba and Sandoz soared on the news,
with Ciba up 235 Swiss francs at midsession to 1,365 francs and
Sandoz gaining 150 francs to 1,300.
</P>
<P>
Ciba's Krauer will become Novartis chairman and Sandoz chief
executive Daniel Vasella will be named head of the Executive
Committee, the companies said in a statement.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Lasse Kjus of Norway was assured
of his first overall World Cup title after finishing third in the
men's super-giant slalom Thursday in Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
The season's last super-giant slalom event title was chalked up
by Kjus' compatriot Kjetil Andre Aamodt.
</P>
<P>
Kjus, who won Wednesday's final World Cup downhill, built a
safe lead of 207 points on nearest rival Guenther Mader of
Austria.
</P>
<P>
Kjus now has 1,198 points compared against 991 to Mader, who
ended the race in seventh place and can only score a maximum of
200 points if he wins the last two races, a giant slalom on
Saturday and a slalom on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Atle Skaardal, coming in eighth, brought back another title for
Norway by securing victory in the World Cup super-G standings.
</P>
<P>
He finishes on 312 points in the super-G standings with Knaus
second on 267 and Kjus third on 264.
</P>
<P>
Aamodt, who won the overall title in 1994 but was suffering a
knee injury this season, had a perfect run and clocked a winning
time of one minute 33.15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Luc Alphand, the World Cup downhill champion, was
second at 1:33.21, followed by Kjus in 1:33.45.

ALMA ATA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan

that they will meet soon to sign an agreement on the two
countries' integration process in the economic and humanity fields.

They also talked about Kyrgyzstan's application for joining the
tripartite customs union created by Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan
early last year, and Nazarbayev said he supported such an
application.
</P>
<P>
When Nazarbayev voiced his concern about the situation in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, Yeltsin said the Russian

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Disclose Chechen Settlement Plan Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that he will soon outline the details of the Chechen
settlement plan, which was approved at a meeting of the Russian
Security Council earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters here after the meeting, which mainly
focused on the Chechen issue, Yeltsin said: "Today it was just a
discussion and some amendment may be made to the program."
</P>
<P>
The "comprehensive program" will be finally approved in a week
at the next session of the Security Council, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"When everything is polished off, maybe at the end of March, I
will address a press conference or TV viewers with a detailed
outline of the settlement plan," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The program, which aims to establish peace, also has a military
aspect, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"Combat operations should be stopped, and those criminals who
were involved in killings and terrorism acts should stand trial,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The program, which has been drawn up, absorbed some suggestions
by two special commissions -- a government commission headed by
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and a presidential council
commission headed by Emil Payin, Yeltsin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that today's meeting of the Security Council was
"difficult, because the problem itself is difficult."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the program was worked out very thoroughly and
carefully with many other people's views taken into account.
</P>
<P>
The 15-month-long Chechen war has been a big headache for
Yeltsin, who declared on February 15 that he will run a second
term of office in the June presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Grozny has flared up again since Wednesday after
more than 1,000 Chechen militants launched an offensive on Russian
troops in the Chechen capital.

GUANGZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China has delivered prompt and
adequate relief aid to frost-stricken regions in its southern
Guangdong Province, winning warm acclaim from local people.
</P>
<P>
Four strong cold spells hit Guangdong Province over a twelve
day period starting on February 18, casting thick snow over the
mountainous regions in the northern part of the province. The area
also recorded its lowest temperatures since 1949, when New China
was founded.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's agriculture suffered three billion yuan's worth of
direct losses, causing a disaster for over 1.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
However, the provincial government was quick in delivering aid
to disaster-hit regions.
</P>
<P>
The government provided 50 million yuan's worth of goods,
including 15,000 tons of grain and 63,000 cotton quilts. Large
quantities of padded coats were also sent to the region to help
people stay warm.
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no reports of any deaths in the province
resulting from the cold weather.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Court Employs IPR Piracy Advisors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Higher People's Court
today announced that it has employed 21 leading law experts as
intellectual property rights (IPR) advisors.
</P>
<P>
The experts are mainly from universities and research
institutes, such as the prestigious Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be the first time a Chinese court has taken
this course of action.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Liangang, President of the court, has asked his faculty
members to listen to the opinion's of the team of experts "in a
serious manner" whenever they handle IPR cases.
</P>
<P>
The court has seen a sharp increase in the number of IPR cases,
according to Sheng. Between 1993 and 1995, it handled 764 IPR
cases, exceeding the total number in the previous ten years.
</P>
<P>
Cases involving infringements of copyright, trademarks and
patents are very complicated in both legal and technological
aspects.
</P>
<P>
China, with a short history of copyright protection, therefore
has to take advantage of the wisdom of high-level experts, Sheng
explained.
</P>
<P>
"This will enable the court deal with IPR cases fairly and
justly," he said. The team of law experts will work part-time for
the court.
</P>
<P>
The court has also employed a patent and copyright institutions
as its appraisal bodies.
</P>
<P>
China has been running an intensive crackdown on copyright
piracy since last winter. An initial victory has been
announced.

KATHMANDU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's economy has shown
indications of notable improvement with the economic growth up 6
percent in the last five months, Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat
said today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to government-owned media today, Mahat said that the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew six percent while the
industrial production was up more than eight percent during the
period after the present coalition government came to power last
September.

According to him, the present government had signed agreements
for some 130 million US dollars worth of foreign aid and domestic
revenue mobilization had seen a 20 percent increase in the past
five months.

<P>
Inflation rate has reduced to seven percent from ten percent in
the same period, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nepal's imports increased 17 percent during the
last five months compared with 36 percent in the previous year,
saying the slowdown of import growth could help reduce the
country's trade deficit at more than 850 million dollars every
year.

The government has also created an encouraging atmosphere for
foreign investment, Mahat said, adding that it had approved new
investments of about 26 million dollars during the period.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Accuses Ruling Party Leader of Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese opposition Shinshinto
(New Frontier Party) today filed a criminal complaint against
Koichi Kato, secretary general of the coalition-leading Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), in connection with an alleged secret
donation in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Seven Dietmen from the largest opposition party accused Kato of
tax evasion and urged prosecutors at the Tokyo District Public
Prosecutors Office to investigate and indict him, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
In the petition, the lawmakers said Kato received 10 million
yen (100,000 U.S. dollars) in cash from the now-defunct steel
frame manufacturer, Kyowa Co., in January 1990, but did not report
the acceptance of the money to tax authorities and thereby evaded
income tax on the donation, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Shinshinto is calling for summoning Kato as a sworn witness to
the Diet to testify whether he accepted the money from Kyowa,
which is one of the borrowers of seven failed housing loan
companies, known as "jusen"
</P>
<P>
A former head of a Kato support group issued a statement Monday
saying he was present at a Tokyo hotel in January 1990 when Goro
Moriguchi, then vice president of Kyowa, gave the money to Kato
for his election campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
Kato denied the content of the statement at a press conference
later Monday, saying he is "suspicious about the motivation for
bringing up this issue at the crucial stage of Diet deliberations
over the failed jusen."
</P>
<P>
The three-party ruling coalition and Shinshinto have been at
odds over the government plan to spend 685 billion yen (6.85
billion dollars) in tax money to help liquidate the seven
insolvent jusen.

<HEADLINE> Warlord Aidid Accuses U.S., U.N. Of Intervening Somali Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Somali warlord General Mohamed
Farah Aidid has accused the United States and the United Nations
of intervening in Somalia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The condemnations came after the US Ambassador to the UN, Mrs
Madeline Albright, who is also Chairman of the UN Security
Council, warned against a severe starvation and hunger in Somalia
last month and blamed Aidid for the political deadlock in the
country since he claimed the president of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the spokesman of the Aidid's government, Radio South
Mogadishu accused Mrs Albright for misguiding and misinforming
the international opinion about Somalia's current politics and
humanitarian situation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman faulted Mrs Albright for spreading rumors that
Somalia has no government.
</P>
<P>
"Somalia has regained its dignity on the world community on
June 15 last year when its people had elected General Aidid as
the president of Somalia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He particularly mentioned that the US president Bill Clinton
and the UN secretary general Boutros-Boutros Ghali are those
cooperatively campaigning for what he called putting Somalia back
into anarchy and chaos.
</P>
<P>
The US and UN are envying what he called the progress being
made by the government of Somalia in the fields of
reconciliation, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Denying food shortage in Somalia, he said there has been the
best harvest in his country since the US/UN led multi-national
forces left Somalia in March last year.

<HEADLINE> HK Benefits from Interior Area, Says Noted HK Investor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A noted Hong Kong businessperson
said China's policy of reform and opening-up has been a driving
force for economic progress in its interior parts, so has Hong
Kong benefited from the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Tsang Hin Chi, 62, chairman of Goldlion Holding Ltd. and
chairman of Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of HK, said the
today's economic wonder in HK has benefited from the support of
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Tsang Hin Chi, who is now in Beijing to attend the on-going
session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), said China
is expected to experience a leap forward in its economic progress
in the coming five years and produce a positive impact on the HK
economy. And it will serve to ensure HK's prosperity after the
smooth transition of power and China's resumption of the exercise
of sovereignty over HK.
</P>
<P>
On the slowdown of HK's economic progress, he said, "it is the
British Hong Kong authorities that have dampened the morale of the
HK residents and affected their desire for consumption."
</P>
<P>
As the days for China's resumption of the exercise of its
sovereignty over HK are approaching, foreign investors are more
interested in investing in HK and China. The businessmen are
optimistic to the future of Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong businessmen's investment in Chinese provinces#,
Tsang said the decision by the Chinese government to open wider to
the outside world has set new demands for HK investment in the
country's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
The businessman has invested 700 million HK dollars in the
interior areas since he started his first business in Meizhou,
Guangdong Province with one million HK dollars in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he will pour more funds in energy and communication
projects and he plans to move his headquarters of the Goldlion
Holding Ltd. from Hong Kong to Guangzhou. A 29-storey highrise
will be completed soon in Guangzhou, he said.

<HEADLINE> Peng Ming-min Is Shielding Lee Teng-hui: Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Peng Ming-min is using his
"Visible Independence of Taiwan" to allow for the survival of Lee
Teng-hui's "Invisible Independence of Taiwan", a signed commentary
pointed out today.
</P>
<P>
The article, signed by Xinhua commentator Tai Hai, said that
the "presidential candidate" of the "Democratic Progressive Party"
is using the trick to help Lee Teng-hui win the election.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that Peng has recently raised the
tune to advocate the "Independence of Taiwan", saying if the
island is reunified with the mainland, a terrible consequence will
take place.
</P>
<P>
Unlike his previous tactics, Peng has even started to openly
"criticize" Lee Teng-hui, who has been criticized by the Taiwan
people for taking a pro-independence stance to sabotage the
relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
This is because Peng has now realized that it is very difficult
for him to win the forthcoming election. (A survey has shown that
less than 10 percent of voters in Taiwan support Peng). Therefore,
he has been forced "to give a hand to Lee", the article noted.
</P>
<P>
The method he has adopted is to "speak ill of" Lee, who
outwardly advocates the "reunification of China." In this way,
Peng is trying to make a clear distinction between him and Lee, so
that Taiwan people will believe Lee is the right man to "promote
the reunification of China", and Lee may win more votes, as most
Taiwan people do not support the "Independence of Taiwan", the
article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, both Lee and Peng are intent on "Taiwan independence"
-- the difference is that one uses "Visible Independence of
Taiwan" and the other uses the "Invisible Independence of Taiwan",
the article pointed out. Both men, the article continued, count on
the support of foreign anti-China forces.
</P>
<P>
No matter who the person is, if he seeks the "Independence of
Taiwan" at a cost of peace in the Taiwan Straits, as well as
the happiness of the Taiwan people, he will take the road to his
doom, the article concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
is held responsible for safeguarding national security in the
course of accomplishing China's grand goals for economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The view was shared by PLA deputies who are attending the
on-going session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Li Junlian, the navy's deputy Party political commissar, said,
"the armed forces should keep sober-minded at a time when the
international situation is complex, and particularly when some
Western countries are stepping up attempts to break up and
Westernize China."
</P>
<P>
"The PLA is duty-bound historically to contain Taiwan's
splittist activities and safeguard the peaceful reunification of
the motherland," Li added.
</P>
<P>
Li Yunshan, an NPC deputy from the strategic missile forces,
noted that in the current changeable international circumstances,
the people's troops should perform the sacred duty of safeguarding
the motherland's territorial integrity as well as the security of
its territorial seas.

Encouraged by Chinese President's inspection of the navy last
year, Wang Xugong, commander of the Naval Air Force, pledged that
the navy will further raise its combat efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Lu Tingyan, who is a deputy from the strategic missile forces,

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Local committees of China's top
advisory body have been active in political consultation,
democratic supervision and participation in state affairs,
said committee members at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Sun Qi, chairman of Liaoning Provincial Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said
over 30 research reports and proposals made by his committee drew
attention from leading officials last year.
</P>
<P>
The provincial committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
and the provincial government attach great importance to the work
of his committee, he said, citing a decision by the provincial
government to support and strengthen the committee's work.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yaguang, chairman of CPPCC Shaanxi Provincial Committee,
said supervision by his committee has been strengthened in the
northwestern Chinese province, particularly in supervision over
policy implementation.
</P>
<P>
He said in 1994 his committee found "not a few problems" in the
16 policies and measures the local government had issued on
educational reform. Proposals raised by Zhou's committee resulted
in an increase in funding for education.
</P>
<P>
Nie Ronggui, chairman of CPPCC Sichuan Provincial Committee,
said a major boost to the democratic consultation system in the
southwest province is: the local CPPCC committee is now notified
of and solicited for opinions on important documents, legal
regulations, work reports and administrative rules by the
provincial government and the provincial people's congress before
they are decided and issued.
</P>
<P>
Last year many of his committee's proposals were adopted by
local authorities.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Growth Target Is Rational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is sensible
to set the country's annual economic growth rate at eight percent
for the next five years, said a member of China's top advisory
body.
</P>
<P>
Although China can lay claim to the highest economic growth
averaging over 10 percent annually in recent years, Dai Yuanchen,
an economics professor said, it has also suffered from a series of
problems, especially soaring inflation.
</P>
<P>
Dai, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the
economic growth rate set by the government's draft outline for
economic and social development in the next five years is
conducive to a sustainable and healthy development.
</P>
<P>
The professor approved of the government's macroeconomic
controls in the past two and a half years to cool down the
overheated economy, with the result that a soft landing is in
sight.
</P>
<P>
"It is remarkable that the government was able to bring down
inflation from 1994's 21.7 percent to last year's 14.8 percent,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the central authorities to restrain local governments
from spending working capital on capital construction and
launching large projects, which will worsen conditions in large
and medium-sized state enterprises already plagued by fund
shortages.
</P>
<P>
At present, both the government and the public are fighting
against corruption, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, economic losses resulting from wrong decisions made
by local officials with an obsession to score political points are
far bigger than those caused by corruption," said the professor.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Traffic Congestion Eased in Five Year Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 million journeys
have been made on Beijing's underground railway during the past
year.
</P>
<P>
Major road improvements, more buses and a massive increase in
the number of taxis, have all added to the rapid development of
the capital's highways and transport systems.
</P>
<P>
City officials have now revealed the growth of traffic
facilities during the Eighth Five-year Plan period(1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
During this period, the length of Beijing's highways reached
11,650 kilometers, which includes 130 kilometers of 'motorway
standard' express highways. There are more than 160 overpasses
and flyovers around Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing ranks in top spot among Chinese
cities for the amount of roadway per square kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, the city opened several new express
highways, including Beijing-Zhangjiakou, Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu,
Beijing-Shijiazhuang, and an express highway to the Capital
Airport.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, the city improved the second and third ring
roads, converting them into traffic-light free expressways,
greatly easing urban traffic congestion
</P>
<P>
With the construction of more highways and the improvement of
old roads, the problem, which puzzled Beijing for a long period -
how to get into and out of the city - has been greatly eased.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990-1995 period, the number of buses in Beijing
reached 4,452. The number of routes for electric "trolley" buses
reached 260, up by over 38 percent over the Seventh Five-Year Plan
(1986-1990).
</P>
<P>
By the end of the eighth five year plan the number of taxis in
Beijing had reached 63,500 - representing an almost four-fold
increase since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The total length of the city's rail subway reached 41.6
kilometers, with 558 million passenger journeys being made
annually on the subway system.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Council Meets In Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Council opened
its first ever session in Gaza this morning, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The session began with a reading from the Koran and President
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat chaired
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Before the session, Arafat reviewed a guard of honor to the
drum of the Palestinian national anthem played by a military band.
</P>
<P>
The first task of the meeting is to elect a speaker, President
of the Palestinian Council, and heads of various committees.
</P>
<P>
The 88 members of the Palestinian Council were elected in
the general elections, which were held on January 20.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Palestinian Election Law, Arafat, who was
elected President of the PNA, is also member of the Palestinian
Council. The positions of President of the PNA and of President
of the Palestinian Council are incompatible.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural session took place against the backdrop of
tensions between Israel and the Palestinians as a result of
the recent wave of deadly suicide bombings launched by Hamas' armed
wing in Jerusalem and elsewhere in Israel. Because of the
strict closure imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
council members were escorted from the West bank by Israeli
army vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also likely to deal with the issue of
revocation of clauses in the PLO Covenant calling for Israel's
destruction. Under the terms of the Israel-PLO agreement signed
last fall, the covenant must be amended within two months of
the council's inauguration.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The area devoted to grain growing
in China will top 110 million hectares this year. To ensure a
bumper harvest Chinese farmers have now started the busy task of
spring ploughing.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to grow 29.7 million ha of winter grain,
400,000 ha more than last year, and more than 6.5 million ha of
winter rape, almost the same as 1995, says the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Local agricultural departments are increasing the use of new
technology in spring sowing work. Twelve provinces, including
Henan, Shandong and Hebei, have supplied local farmers with
quality seeds which are to be sowed in farmland.
</P>
<P>
A ministry source said that more than 30 million tons of
chemical fertilizers have been provided for farmers so far. The
supply of main crop seeds is sufficient to meet the farmers'
demands.

<HEADLINE> Transit Trade Causes Big Loss to Pakistan: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan lost about 4 to 6
billion rupees (116-174 million US dollars) of duties and taxes in
its transit trade to Afghanistan in 1994-95, a senior Pakistani
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information and Broadcasting Khalid Ahmed Khan
Kharal told the Senate that the loss was mainly caused by
smuggling of the transit goods back to Pakistan, which signed a
Transit Trade Agreement with Afghanistan in 1965.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that lack of data made it very difficult to
quantify the exact loss Pakistan's economy suffered in this area.
</P>
<P>
He said the volume of the transit trade through Pakistan to
Afghanistan totaled 8.138 billion rupees (236 million US dollars)
in the fiscal year from July 1994 to June 1995.
</P>
<P>
The estimated leviable duties and taxes on transit trade goods
amounted to 6.392 billion rupees (185 million US dollars), he
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Pakistani government prohibited the import of 17
items in transit trade to Afghanistan, goods that were not meant
for consumption in Afghanistan and made up about 70 percent of the
total transit trade.
</P>
<P>
The net result was that Afghanistan's import of these items
stood at zero in 1995-96, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, reports say some of the prohibited items were still
smuggled into the Pakistani market through transit trade and cars
were also smuggled through the same route.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government would look into the matter and
take stern actions against such activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of south China's
Fujian Province has given priority to improving residents' housing
conditions and sharply enhanced the average per capita living
space to nine sq m.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone the city built 530,000 sq m of housing and
provided residences for 3,100 households with housing
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that more and more residents of the city now
enjoy not only larger living space but also better housing
facilities. Statistics show that the rate of flats with complete
facilities including kitchens and toilets has now hit 63.9 percent
in the city.
</P>
<P>
In its move to speed up housing construction, the city has also
made headway in reconstructing the old city proper and dismantled
2.86 million sq m of old and dilapidated houses, enabling 39,000
households to move into new residences. To date, some two-thirds
of the old city has been reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the housing system has provided a great impetus
for the city's housing construction, particularly in terms of
financial support, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The city has so far recovered 21.33 million yuan by selling
publicly-owned apartments. It has set up a special housing fund
from this and has so far collected over 30 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Genping, head of the municipal real estate
administration, the city plans to build 1.5 million sq m of
residences in each of the remaining years of this century.

China ahs found that scholars who have returned from overseas have
become part of its backbones.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zheng Yongfei, one of those who returned to CUST, said that
it was fortunate that he returned home after studying in Germany
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zheng was selected as one of 100 millenial scientists for a
training project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
CUST has sent many of its 1,600 teachers abroad to study or
work, and 80 percent of them have returned to the university,
which has provided better working conditions and three-room
apartments for the returning scholars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most of them have been appointed as deans of
departments or directors of research centers at CUST.
</P>
<P>
In return, the returning scholars have set up a number of new
courses and written a number of research papers, helping students
at the university get to know more about recent developments in
science and technology, according to Feng Keqin, vice-president of
the university.
</P>
<P>
The returnees have also improved the university's academic
level as well as its teaching, he said. CUST has been one of
China's top four universities in number of scientific papers
published both inside and outside China for the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The stable political situation and fast economic development
will convince more outstanding Chinese studying overseas to return

<HEADLINE> Philippines, IMF Agree on Macroeconomic Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) today agreed on the country's
macroeconomic targets this year after the initial round of
discussions of the Philippines' 1996 economic program.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson and IMF team
leader Khadim al-Eys confirmed the agreement at a press conference
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed the Philippines has made substantial
progress in recent years in laying the foundation for sustained
growth.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team described as realistic Manila's target of 6.5-7.5
percent economic growth in view of the bright prospects of the
country's investments and exports, which increased 29 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The team expressed support for the Central Bank's goal of
bringing down inflation to about 5.5-6 percent by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
However, Singson admitted the average inflation rate for the
whole year of 1996 is expected to range anywhere between 7.5 to
8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the monetary targets, the IMF has suggested the lowering of
monetary ceilings, especially as the Philippine government did not
meet the targets set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But Manila stood pat on its targets, arguing it has been able
to keep monetary aggregates well below the earlier set levels.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the delay in setting the monetary targets is
mainly due to the fine-tuning of the targets.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that the remaining issues would be
resolved during the second round of discussions by May so that the
1996 economic program could be submitted to the IMF Executive
Board in June.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this, Khadim al-Eys said, "It would be misleading
to say that there has been a deadlock."
</P>
<P>
He said there was a "continuing and constructive dialogue" and
the IMF "needs additional time to digest the numbers and resolve
technical issues."

was banned Thursday by the Italian series A sporting judge from
the touchline for Sunday's match with Italian league leaders Milan
for insulting a referee.

<P>
Hodgson, the former Swiss national coach who joined Inter this

</P>
<P>
Hodgson will have to watch Sunday's match from the stands
unless an appeal by Inter to have the suspension overturned is
upheld.
</P>
<P>
The club said their appeal would be based on the fact that the
incident was a misunderstanding as Hodgson is English and does not
have a perfect command of Italian.
</P>
<P>
Inter have won their last four matches under Hodgson and are
chasing a UEFA Cup place next season.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Spring plowing, aimed at getting
land ready for sowing in the first season of the year, is going
full steam ahead in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
To beef up the momentum the provincial government has
remarkably increased policy-oriented loans to support cultivation
of land so that a good harvest is ensured.
</P>
<P>
Loans for this purpose amounted to 3.361 billion yuan (about
four billion US dollars), up over 40 percent from last
year. Government departments of planning, finance and credit have
also raised input into the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
This year Henan started the spring plowing program earlier than
last year. And crops like wheat, a Chinese staple, and rape have
been fertilized.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by departments in charge of agriculture show that
the total acreage of crops stands at 133 million mu (about 8.7
million ha) this spring, up 1.184 million mu from last spring. The
acreage of rape and vegetables are 4.51 million mu and 10.326
million mu, up 400,000 mu and 1.215 million mu, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the spring crops are growing well. And
seeds of maize, hybrid rice and cotton have been secured for
sowing, and are in ample supply.
</P>
<P>
Henan now has 83.28 million kg of maize, six million kg of
hybrid rice and 43.5 million kg of cotton.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the agricultural departments among 12,000
rural households in 25 counties indicated that 90 percent of the
farmers have purchased adequate fertilizer.

SHANGHAI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- This east China metropolis is
taking effective emergency measures to ease the traffic problems
caused by farmers flocking in seeking jobs following the Spring

</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Ocean-Shipping Group Corporation has added ships
running from Shanghai to Dalian in Liaoning Province and Wenzhou

MACAO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2,000 dead mice were
collected in a month's time in Macao, marking an initial success
in the anti-mouse campaign launched by the Macao Municipal
Government.
</P>
<P>
From January 15 to February 16, a total of 1,963 dead rats were
collected by the mouse-killing team of the government, according
to a report in today's Macao Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Most of the dead rodents were found in places like densely
populated buildings, garbage centers and warehouses.
</P>
<P>
A local official has urged citizens to keep their houses clean
so that rats could not easily find food or places to hide.
</P>
<P>
The anti-mouse campaign was launched in mid-1995 and is
expected to last until mid-1996. At least eight million Patacas
(about 1.05 million US dollars) has been spent on the event.
</P>
<P>

<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The operation of Hong Kong's
Correctional Services Department (CSD) to transfer 210 Vietnamese
migrants (VMs) from the North Section of the High Island Detention
Center (HIDC) to Victoria Prison was completed around 15:00 hours
today.
</P>
<P>
This group of VMs has been selected for return to Vietnam on
two Orderly Repatriation Program flights to be held over the next
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The operation has been advanced to this morning following the
holding of a CSD officer by a group of VMs at HIDC Wednesday. The
officer was released unharmed early this morning after being held
for 11 hours.
</P>
<P>
Passive resistance was encountered during today's operation,
with more than 10 targeted VMs and their supporters staying on the
hut roof at one stage. It took CSD officers two hours to remove
all the VMs from the roof. No injury was reported.
</P>
<P>
As is the practice, the whole operation was observed by
independent monitors.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the operation, the Acting Refugee Coordinator,
Gordon Leung, said he was pleased that no violence was
encountered.
</P>
<P>
"The government is totally committed to the repatriation of
all VMs as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The future of the VMs lies in Vietnam," he added.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Cotton Export Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 69,000 bales (185
kilograms each) of cotton in Uganda are projected for export
during the 1995/96 season, reflecting a 128 percent increase from
the previous season, reported a local daily today.
</P>
<P>
The paper "the New Vision" added that in the previous season
30,200 bales were exported, a 39 percent rise compared with the
1993/94 season in which 21,708 bales were exported.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's cotton output increased from almost zero in 1985 to
27,000 bales in 1989 and 60,000 bales in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The increase in export could be attributed to the measures
taken by the government to liberalize the cotton industry to
eliminate the monopoly of the Lint Marketing Board (LMB) which
had been the sole buyer and exporter of the crop.
</P>
<P>
Cotton was Uganda's main exports only after coffee during the
1950s and 1960s, but its production plummeted in 1970s and early
1980s during the political turmoil and civil war in the country,
because farmers replaced cotton farmland with coffee.
</P>
<P>
Thus the country's cotton production fell from a peak of
445,003 bales in 1965/66 season to almost zero in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Local Officials Urged to Enhance Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Local officials should spare some
time going around vegetable markets to acquaint themselves with
production and marketing of vegetables, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
said here today.
</P>
<P>
During a panel discussion of deputies from central China's
Hunan Province in the annual session of the National People's
Congress (NPC), Zhu, who show great interest in vegetable prices,
asked
</P>
<P>
the deputies from his home province lots of questions.
</P>
<P>
"We should attach importance to agricultural development and
bear in mind the interests of the farmers and ease their burdens,"
said Zhu, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The most important issue in economic progress over the next
five years is agricultural development, he said, adding that
"nothing can be done if people go hungry."
</P>
<P>
Zhu also urged local officials to do a good job in industrial
development by making the right choice as what to produce and
ensure the quality of the products. "We can achieve economic
results only by engaging in manufacture of products which sell
well on the market," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, an issue of vital importance for the
development of enterprises is reform and interior management.
Enterprise groups can be set up by means of economic laws instead
of administrative interventions.
</P>
<P>
To achieve rapid economic growth and attain the goals put
forward in the long-range objectives in the coming five to 15
years, he said, enterprises must strive for achieving the two
fundamental shifts -- from traditional planned economy to market
economy and from the mode of being extensive to that of being
intensive.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, these enterprises can neither achieve good
economic efficiency nor maintain a sustained and healthy economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
In addition to agriculture and state-owned enterprises,
deputies present at today's panel discussion also conferred on
such issues as construction of infrastructure facilities,
irrigation projects as well as regional development and
macro-economic control.

<HEADLINE> Students in Quake-Hit County Start New Semester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 50,000 primary and
middle-school students in the quake-hit Lijiang County in
southwest China's Yunnan Province have returned to school after
the winter vacation thanks to local government's relief efforts, a
local education official said.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring seven on the Richter Scale hit the
scenic Lijiang area on February 3 and destroyed 520 local schools,
133 of which were ruined, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The local government has speeded up its efforts to repair and
rebuild these schools.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,879 classrooms with a total floor space of 100,000 sq m
have been built with 1,200 cu m of timber and other building
materials transported from other parts of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official also attributed the quick opening of schools to
the help of people form all walks of life in the country.
</P>
<P>
Three local townships suffering minor losses sent 200 cu m of
timber after the quake and nearly 1,000 officers and men of the
People's Liberation Army and the armed police gave up the
traditional Chinese Spring Festival holiday to build 528
classrooms for 43 schools.
</P>
<P>
Students from China's largest city of Shanghai have donated
16,000 bags and 16,000 items of stationary to their counterparts
in the quake-stricken area.
</P>
<P>
Lijiang County, mainly inhabited by the Naxi ethnic group,
boasts a high level of education among China's ethnic monority
areas.
</P>
<P>
There are 736 college graduates among every 100,000 local
residents, statistics show.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- French Ambassador to
Tanzania has said that the evolution of relations between France
and Tanzania is entering a new era.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Alain du Boispean made this remark at a luncheon at
his residence here yesterday. He said that Tanzania's internal
stability and key role in efforts for peace and stability in the
region are among the major factors that France took into account
in seeking to bolster its relations with Tanzania.
</P>

The French ambassador said that despite budget cuts envisaged
in France's government budget in the coming years, there is
likely to be a substantial improvement in the aid accorded to
Tanzania under new arrangements, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, France has reserved its main development
cooperation efforts and project financing arrangements to
Francophone African countries, but was now diversifying its
international cooperation arrangements,he added.
</P>
<P>
Links between the Francophone countries and France will
continue to be strong, but other links shall be forged between
France and a breadth of Commonwealth countries in Africa, notably
in the Southern Africa sub-region, he observed.

<HEADLINE> China's Insurance Sector to Leap Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance is expected to
expand dramatically during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"Sustained and high-speed economic growth allows for further
development in China's insurance industry," said an official with
the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), the No.1 insurer
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"In the next 20 years the insurance industry is expected to
grow quicker than the economy as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
An official with the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
pointed out that "the business scale, kinds of insurance products,
the number of insurance institutions, the quantity and quality of
personnel in the insurance industry, and market regulation have
yet to keep pace with China's economic and social growth."
</P>
<P>
Since China resumed offering insurance services in the late
1970s, nearly one million enterprises and 100 million families
have taken out property coverage, and more than 300 million
individuals have taken out life coverage.
</P>
<P>
Last year China expressed the intention of adding 10 new
insurance companies to the current less than 30 insurers to better
serve the thriving economy and citizens, who are getting
wealthier. Late last month, the central bank approved the
preparations for the establishment of five new insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
A national insurance market has gradually taken shape, pushing
China's premiums to more than 60 billion yuan in 1995. Citizens
have a stronger sense of insurance as insurance has ventured into
every part of economic operations and daily life.
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Law, which went into effect last October, has
enabled China to regulate the insurance market with legal means.
</P>
<P>
China is also opening the insurance market in a step-by-step
way in limited areas. Three foreign insurance companies have been
approved to operate in China, and nearly 80 foreign insurers have
opened representative offices in this, perhaps the largest
insurance market in the world.
</P>
<P>
The PICC and the Research Center for Economic, Technological
and Social Development under the State Council will jointly hold
China's first large exhibition on insurance from March 8 to
12. More than 50 Chinese and foreign insurance companies will take
part in the exhibition.

STOCKHOLM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Ingeborg Helen Marken of Norway
scored her first World Cup victory on Thursday before the home
crowds in the season's last women's super-giant slalom event in
Lillehammer, Norway.
</P>
<P>
Marken, 21, whose best result was a runner-up in a combined
event last December in St Anton, Austria, used a faultless run
down the icy piste to clock a winning time of one minute 23.18

Newly-crowned World Cup queen Katja Seizinger of Germany failed

</P>
<P>
Seizinger, who had made sure of her first World Cup overall

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough Made In S.Africa's Constitution-Writing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua)-- South Africa's
constitution-writing process has achieved a major breakthrough
when the two major political parties reached agreement on a new
provincial model of government, "The Citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC) and the National Party
(NP) yesterday agreed to National Council of Provinces (NCOP)
to replace the senate under the country's final
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The ANC-NP agreement made the adoption of the final
constitution possible within the national assembly by a
two-thirds majority by the May 9 deadline, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The agreement meant that the continued Inkatha Freedom Party
boycott of the constitution-writing process would make no
difference to the actual adoption of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional assembly Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa, who is also
ANC's Secretary General, labelled the agreement "very historic".
</P>
<P>
The proposal of the NCOP, which would act as a second chamber
of parliament to guard over provincial interests, was finally
agreed to at private bilateral discussions between the ANC and NP
on Monday and tabled at the constitutional assembly's
streamlining negotiating committee yesterday.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the proposal, the NCOP wwill have the powers to
revise, initiate, amend, delay or reject national legislation
affecting the provinces, especially regarding jurisdictional
areas specifically assigned to the provinces constitutionally.

<HEADLINE> Hongyuan Beats Shougang to Place Second in CBA Preliminaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DONGGUAN, China, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Guangdong Hongyuan held
off a strong comeback during the second half to edge the Beijing
Shougang 68-60 on Wednesdday, ranking second in the CBA preliminary
contests.
</P>
<P>
The win, helped by 34-year-old center Guan Deyou who scored 17
points and grabbed eight rebounds, led to the host Hongyuan a 18-4
win-less preliminary result after the 22-round competitions in the
12-team league this season.
</P>
<P>
The Hongyuan, playing in the 4,500 home fans, had same game points
in the team standings with Liaoning (18-4), but was second because of
a scoring favorite.
</P>
<P>
The Shougang placed fourth with 17-5 and has to take on the August
First in the first four-team finals beginning on Sunday with a double
round-robin home-road format.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing, who trailed by 11 points at 28-39 in the first half,
rallied with a 10-0 run with 6:30 into the second half to narrow the
margin 40-41, then 60-64 on Bateer's layup in the lane with final 3:20
to play.
</P>
<P>
However, the Hongyuan replied with final points on a jump from Ma
Yongzhong, who hit 10 points off the bench in the second half, and one
tip-in from Guan Deyou to nail the game.
</P>
<P>
"We played good in the first half that makes me saticifaction,"
said Wang Lifa, head coach of the Hongyuan. "But we played not so good
in second half as Beijing's defense was so good and its two giants
Shan Tao and Bateer played well."
</P>
<P>
Shan, 2.17-meter center, scored a game-high 23 points and power
forward Bateer added 16 points and 13 rebounds for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"There was an unexpected case midway through the first half when
our players played too never to be normal on both defense and
offense," Beijing head coach Yuanchao said.
</P>
<P>
"But we recovered and closed the gap in the second half. And we
will try our best to play against the August First at home," Yuan
added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Toyota to Face Challenges in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese automobile giant
Toyota is anticipating challenges from new players on the
Philippine market but still appears confident of remaining as a
leading passenger car producer in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Toyota continued to take the lead on the Philippine
market by selling 38,000 units, accounting for 29.68 percent of
the total market demand.
</P>
<P>
But its share is expected to slip by 1.58 percentage points to
28.1 percent this year because of the entry of new players, Senior
Vice President of Toyota Motor Phils. Corp. Vicente Socco said
today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that new players led by European luxury car makers,
including BMW, Mercedes Benz and Volvo, are expected to nip into
Toyota's market share.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Socco said his firm is hoping for sales of about
45,000 units of passenger cars and commercial vehicles in the
Philippines this year, with a forecast demand of 160,000 units in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to keep its six-year lead on the Philippine market,
Toyota will open five new dealerships in the next two years to add
to its existing 12 outlets, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a new Toyota factory in Sta. Rosa, Laguna, will
increase the company's production capacity by 55.5 percent to
70,000 units yearly after it starts commercial operations in the
first quarter of 1997.

<HEADLINE> HK People required to Tackle Legal Affairs In China Through  Appointed Attestors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residents who have
legal affairs to be dealt with in China are required to handle
them according to China's attesting system.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jian, director of the Notarization Department of the Chinese
 Ministry of Justice, recently told Xinhua that the system
includes two procedures.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, all concerned attesting certificates must be presented
 by attestors in Hong Kong appointed by China. Secondly, those
certificates would not be valid unless they are examined,
registered, sealed and transferred by the China Legal Service
(Hong Kong) Ltd., set up by the ministry in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the system will continue in force after
July 1, 1997 when China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, the Chinese Ministry of Justice has started to
appoint some Hong Kong lawyers as attestors to provide services
for Hong Kong residents and companies, who have civil and economic
 legal affairs to be tackled in China. Such certificates handled
over the past 15 years piled up to 300,000 copies, according to
Xu.
</P>
<P>
There are presently 207 Hong Kong lawyers who are
China-appointed attestors, while in 1981 there were only
eight.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Discharged From Hospital After Check-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela was discharged this morning from Johannesburg's
Park Lane Clinic after medical tests showed him in very good
condition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on his leaving the clinic, where he
underwent two day's comprehensive medical check-up, Mandela said:
"The tests on the heart, on the internal organs and my blood, my
urine, have been very good indeed."
</P>
<P>
"The doctors say they do not expect anything that will arouse
concern," said the president, adding results of a stool test and
a bone marrow sample taken yesterday to test for tuberculosis
were not yet available.
</P>
<P>
"But I feel very well indeed."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was heading home in Houghton, Johannesburg, to
see his grandchildren and "perhaps to read some books".
</P>
<P>
He checked himself into Park Lane Clinic on Tuesday for the
most intensive medical tests to date in a bid to end speculation
about his ill-health.
</P>
<P>
Recent rumours about Mandela's ill-health circulating around
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange had sent the local currency Rand
to record lows on financial markets.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Official Refutes US Report on "Child Abuse" in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its report, Human Rights Watch\Asia cited a series of
figures provided by a man named Yang Jiezeng who claimed to be a
"director" of the Shanghai Child Welfare Institute in a report
delivered in October, 1964.
</P>
<P>
However, Yang's personnel file has no record of his having been
at the institute from 1963 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
It seems quite obvious that the figures quoted by Human Rights
Watch\Asia are totally useless, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The materials used by the Human Rights Watch]Asia were provided
by Zhang Shuyun, a laboratory technician at the institute. But,
Zhang had been criticized and subject to disciplinary action for
listing her personal travel expenses on an expense account for
official business and asking to be reimbursed and for taking care
of personal matters during office hours.
</P>
<P>
Because she resented this, Zhang framed up the charges to get
even with her superiors. The accusations about the form and the
specifics of the maltreatment and sexual harassment listed in the
fifth chapter of the Human Rights Watch\Asia report were the
product of Zhang's imagination.
</P>
<P>
The case of rape of an orphan girl by a former head of the
institute, Han Tiecheng, was proven to be false after it was
investigated.
</P>
<P>
The accusations against Sun Miaolin, who was a model worker in
the field of special education, of sexual harassment on an orphan
girl have likewise been proven to be false.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the official said, there are no cases of either sexual
harassment or physical abuse at the Shanghai Child Welfare
Institute. All those cited by Human Rights Watch\Asia were utterly
groundless.
</P>
<P>
There is no such a thing as oral contraceptive abuse among
orphan girls at the age of puberty at the institute because it has
a strict system of management and controls of medical affairs, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> HK, Shenzhen to Intensify Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, China's earliest
Special Economic Zone bordering Hong Kong, will play a part in
maintaining the territory's position as a world economic hub till
1997 and beyond, Mayor of Shenzhen Li Zibin said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar here on economic cooperation between
Shenzhen and Hong Kong, sponsored by One Country Two Systems
Economic Research Institute Limited, Li said that cross-border
cooperation will be conducive to Hong Kong, which wants to keep
the title of the global financial, trade, commercial and shipping
center.
</P>
<P>
The mayor called on the two places to intensify cooperation in
transport by sea, land and air to ensure a smoother flow of
personnel and goods. Shenzhen now is stepping up infrastructure
construction on seaport, airport, railway and highway.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the Yantian Port in Shenzhen, for instance,
when completed, will ease the congestion in the overloaded
container terminal in Hong Kong, which handles two million
Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) containers in excess of its
designed annual capacity. The Yantian port, not far away from Hong
Kong, will strengthen the territory's leading place in the world
shipping industry, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been a key power engine to fuel the fast
economic growth in Shenzhen over the past 16 years, Li said,
adding that the actual investment from Hong Kong added up to 6.14
billion US dollars between 1979 and 1995, accounting for 65
percent of the total overseas capital Shenzhen had
absorbed.

LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria-Benin border posts at
Seme and Owode have been closed down, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although no official reason was given, immigration sources
said on Wednesday at Seme that the closure was effected on Monday
in a reaction to the failure of the Beninoise authorities to
inform the Nigerian government before it closed its border last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Beninoise authorities closed the border last Thursday
because of the presidential election held on Sunday and re-opened
it on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The economic life at the border has been paralyzed with the
immediate vicinity littered with loads of imports and exports by
traders.
</P>
<P>
Items like raw beans, rice, garry, livestock, alcoholic drinks
and cosmetics were seen left around by their owners, who are
mostly Nigerian traders and who have been stranded at the border
area in the past days of closure.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- France does not believe
that the international community has a chance to help resolve the
conflict in Burundi by a concerted military intervention and
it will in any case not participate in such an exercise.
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador to Tanzania, Alain du Boispean made these
remarks at a luncheon at his residence here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told newsmen that France had repeatedly said that military
intervention would not work.
</P>
<P>
The international community should continue to explore
peaceful means of bringing the parties of the conflict in Burundi
to meet and bridge their differences, he stressed, noting that
the situation in Burundi showed an improvement compared to what
it was a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The urge for intervention stemmed from the intolerable
situation of having to cater for nearly 500,000 refugees from
that country massed in the nearby states, but it would make
matters worse if in fact attempted, the ambassador added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Official Refutes US Report on "Child Abuse" in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- An official with the civil
affairs department of China's leading business center recently
quoted facts that proved that the US's report on China's treatment
of handicapped children was distortion.
</P>
<P>
The official told Xinhua that data from a report of Human
Rights Watch\Asia, an American organization, was fabricated by
Zhang Shuyun who exaggerated a great deal.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the US report went on at length about
the history and status quo of the Shanghai Child Welfare Institute
and jumped to the conclusion the institute is far worse than its
predecessor, which was founded in 1911 by a member of the Roman
Catholic church named Lu Bohong.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the local government set about improving the place. It changed the
name in 1956 to the one it now bears and turned it into a social
charitable organization sponsored by the local government.
</P>
<P>
The institute now covers an area of 23,771 sq.m. and has total
floor space of 17,000 sq.m. It has 27 administrative staff
members, 25 medical personnel, 242 nurses, and 16 teachers.
</P>
<P>
It began accepting handicapped children in 1978, and now has
600 children under the age of 16, including about 500 who were
abandoned or are orphans, and the rest handicapped children sent
there by their parents.
</P>
<P>
All these children have the assurance of a happier life, better
health care, and education, the official pointed out, adding that
the Institute provides different children with different types of
education adapted to their needs.
</P>
<P>
Children in the institute also receive care from the whole of
society, the official said, citing figures that more than 700
families have taken part in caring for these children, and 103
families have taken orphans into their homes to let them enjoy the
warmth of a family.
</P>
<P>
The local government has been increasing funds for the
institute yearly, and in 1995 alone, funds amounted to over five
million yuan (about 600,000 US dollars), excluding other special
funds.

<HEADLINE> 5 New Zealand Firms to Invest in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Five New Zealand firms will invest
311 million US dollars in housing and shipbuilding projects in
partnership with Philippine companies, Philippine Trade and
Industry Secretary Rizalino Navarro said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Edison Industries, Inc. and Firth Industries, LTD., both based
in Auckland, will acquire technology for the manufacture of
pre-stressed concrete poles for power distribution facilities,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
Amtrust Management, Inc. and Pacific Development and Investment
Corp., LTD., will jointly acquire building technology and
syndicate financing for low-cost housing projects in Manila and a
family entertainment center in Makati.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao Shipbuilding Corp. and Sensation Yachts, LTD., have
formed a joint venture company to construct fast-work boats and
patrol boats at a shipyard in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the list of New Zealand investors can expand even
further into industry sectors where the Philippines can be
especially competitive," said Navarro.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities also lie in oil exploration, rubber processing
and food processing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Navarro and visiting New Zealand Trade Minister Philip Burdon
Wednesday signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at promoting
trade and investment between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the Philippines and New Zealand grew from 97
million US dollars in 1990 to 142 million US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' trade deficit widened from 79 million US
dollars to 102 million US dollars during the same period.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Spokesman on US Reaction to PLA's Missile-Launching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The issue of Taiwan is entirely an
internal affair of China, and no other country should interfere in
it, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while asked to comment on the reactions of
US Secretary of Defense William Perry and US Ambassador to China
James Sasser on the missile-launching training to be conducted
from March 8 to 15 by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the
East and South China seas.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that the current tension across the Taiwan Strait is
caused by some members of the Taiwan authorities who preach the
"independence" of Taiwan, and pursue a "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan" policy.
</P>
<P>
The US government, the spokesman said, has repeatedly violated
three Sino-US communiques by allowing Lee Teng-hui to visit the
US, elevating its relations with Taiwan and selling advanced
weapons such as F-16 jet fighters to the island.
</P>
<P>
These moves have encouraged the "pro-independence" forces in
Taiwan, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Chinese side has repeatedly made
solemn representations to the US side in this regard, urging the
US government to observe the principles of the three Sino-US
communiques by stopping its interference in China's internal
affairs, developing no official ties with Taiwan and proliferating
no weapons in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the US side should do more for the safety and
stability across the Taiwan Strait instead of encouraging the
"pro-independence" forces in Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Uses Nuclear Capability Peacefully: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- "Pakistan has nuclear
capability, but has decided at the highest level not to use it for
non-peaceful purposes," a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the Foreign Office this
afternoon, he strongly refuted the report that Pakistan was
preparing for a nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post daily quoted some US officials as saying
Wednesday that Pakistan was preparing to conduct its first
underground nuclear explosion in Pakistan's Baluchistan province.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Pakistan has issued a statement on such
issue, and I will not add any more to the statement, except to say
that Pakistan will take appropriate steps to safeguard its
security," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The statement described the Washington Post's story as
"speculative and based on faulty leaked intelligence reports."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has been in the vanguard locally and regionally to
advance the cause of nuclear non-proliferation," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Our many proposals, including the simultaneous signing of the
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan as well as
the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, have
fumbled because of India's negativism," he added.
</P>
<P>
The US government has also criticized India recently for
preparing for its second nuclear test.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's furniture exports
are projected to grow between 10 and 15 percent annually in the
next five years, Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said

1995.
</P>
<P>
He urged local furniture manufacturers to emphasize on market
research and to aim at middle- and high-end markets with
competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
The minister also the manufacturers to use computer technology

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Still Cautious in Approving New Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite the encouraging trade
statistics for December last year, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim said today that his government will not be too eager
to commit itself to new infrastructural projects.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after launching Internet World Asia '96 Exhibition
here, Anwar, who is also finance minister, said the government
would still adopt a cautious stance in approving new projects.
</P>
<P>
Anwar Wednesday announced that Malaysia recorded a trade
surplus of 653 million Malaysia Ringgit (about 261 million US
dollars) for December 1995 compared with a deficit of 40 million
Ringgit (about 16 million dollars) in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
"While the latest figure is encouraging, that does not mean we
will adjust our program. The projects that have not been approved
will have to be studied and we will certainly not be too
enthusiastic to approve new projects just because of December
figures," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that with the surplus in December, the country's
trade deficit for the year of 1995 declined to 9.2 billion Ringgit
(about 3.68 billion dollars) compared with a deficit of 9.8
billion Ringgit (about 3.92 billion dollars) in the first 11
months of last year.
</P>
<P>
It also brought down the country's current account deficit for
1995 to below the level of 18.1 billion Ringgit (about 7.24
billion dollars), which was estimated in the Treasury Economic
report.
</P>
<P>
Anwar told the press that several measures had been effective
in checking the country's trade deficit and they include putting
new projects on hold, striving for import substitution and
increasing local content in production over the past five or six
months.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman on US Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Chinese
foreign ministry said here today that China is "resolutely
opposed" to the US act of interfering in other countries' internal
affairs under the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Shen Guofang made the remarks when he was asked at a
weekly press conference to comment on the 1995 Human Rights Report
by the US State Department which criticizes China's human rights
situation.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China's Constitution and appropriate laws fully
guarantee the rights of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts made and progress achieved by China over the past
decades in protecting and promoting the legitimate rights and
interests of its people are known to all," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At present," he added, "China enjoys political stability,
economic development, social progress and ethnic harmony, and its
people live and work in peace and contentment while enjoying
unprecedented democratic rights."
</P>
<P>
However, Shen noted, the 1995 Human Rights Report by the US
State Department "defies this fact and makes unwarranted comments
on China's human rights situation, which was utterly out of
ulterior motives."
</P>
<P>
"The question of human rights is, in the final analysis, a
matter within the bounds of a country's sovereignty," he said.
"Every country has the right to protect and promote human rights
in light of its actual conditions. The United States does not
have the right to make irresponsible remarks on the internal
affairs of China or any other country."
</P>
<P>
"We are resolutedly opposed to such an act of interfering in
other countries' internal affairs under the pretext of human
rights," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
When the leaders of China and the US met in New York and Osaka
last year, Shen recalled, the US side expressed its hope for
avoiding having confrontation with China on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, by "slandering China's human rights record
through its Human Rights Report, the US side has obviously
contradicted its stated position."
</P>
<P>
"If the US side is sincere indeed to stay away from
confrontation, it should make good on its words by taking tangible
actions and break clear with its wrongful practice of making
unwarranted charges against other countries' human rights
situation and wantonly interfering in their internal affairs," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Trans-Century Goals Give Broad Vistas For Cross-Straits Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's development program for
the next 15 years heralds a bright future for national
revitalization, and gives broad vistas for the growth of economic
and trade ties across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
This is the view shared by Taiwan deputies to the National
People's Congress (NPC) and members of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
both bodies are currently in session in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
With China's on-going reform and opening-up drive exerting
influences on world economy, Taiwan is not exempted from the
impact as part of world economy, said Cai Zimin, an NPC deputy and
chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League.
</P>
<P>
"With Taiwan's small market within the island and scarce
natural resources," Cai explained,"its economic development must
be geared to the international market."
</P>
<P>
Since late 1980s, Taiwan's main export and import markets
shifted from the Unite States and Japan to southeast Asia and the
Chinese mainland, "which was both the need for Taiwan's economic
development and the factor behind the expansion of cross-straits
economic and trade ties over the past decade."
</P>
<P>
The two sides of the straits complement each other in
development levels, industrial structure, and capitals, said Cai.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland can help Taiwan with a relatively
well-developed industrial structure and advanced technologies in
space, aviation, machinery and electronics, and metallurgical
industries, said Cai, while the development of the mainland needs
Taiwan's funds, management experience, and marketing networks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Taiwan authorities' mainland policies in
recent years, CPPCC member Zheng Lizhi said, fighting against the
attempt for Taiwan's independence is essential for the promotion
of cross-trade economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin pointed out that the Chinese government
adheres to principle of "one China" and is against "two Chinas" or
"one China, one Taiwan"; meanwhile, the government insists that
political differences should not affect economic cooperation
across the straits, which represents the policy of the Chinese
government on cross-straits trade and economic cooperation, Zheng
said.

CANBERRA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
slightly higher against the US dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar inched up to 76.37 US cents from 76.32 US
cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was sidelined during the day as investors
waited to see the budget position to be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The threat of trade unions to push for new wage increases arose
investors' concern over rising inflation pressures, so they
refused to make big deals of the local currency until Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 1996-97 budget is expected to be in a deficit of nine
billion Australian dollars (6.84 billion US dollars), instead of
the 3.4 billion Australian dollars (2.58 billion US dollars)
surplus forecasted in the 1995-96 budget.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the Australian dollar could move
within the range between 75.70 to 76.70 US cents in the short
term, and that it would possibly go up to as high as 78.50 US
cents in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 80.63 yen against the Japanese
yen from 80.33 yen Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> China to Raise Grain Purchase Price: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China this year will raise state
grain procurement prices by 20 percent to help unleash farmers'
enthusiasm for grain production, Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Chinese and foreign reporters, Liu said the
possible impact of the proposed price hikes has been taken into
consideration when a 10 percent inflation is planned for this
year.
</P>
<P>
Enabling farmers under the poverty line to have enough to eat
and wear is one of two major tasks set for the new five-year
plan starting this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The other task, Liu said, is to ensure stable increases in the
annual output of grain, cotton, oil and other major crops.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the tasks, Liu promised that funding for
agriculture will be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Despite serious natural disasters last year, China scored a
record grain harvest of 465 million tons and the average per
capita income of its farmers rose by 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the government will promote the application of 10 key
farming techniques and introduce 1,000 from other countries in the
next five years to raise from 35 percent to 50 percent the
contribution rate to agricultural growth by advances in science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
He estimated China's demand for grain at 600 million tons in
the year 2030 when the Chinese population peaks at 1.6 billion. He
said he is "very confident" that the demand will be met so long as
China can increase its grain output by four billion kg annually,
or less than one percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, China's average annual increase of
grain production has been eight billion kg, or three percent on a
yearly basis, in the past 46 years.
</P>
<P>
China's self-reliance for grain supply does not mean China will
not participate in international grain trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that we import in lean years and export in good
harvest years," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Taking a question from a US reporter, Liu said that China's
grain imports from the US are about one third of its total annual
imports and that the proportion has been "fairly stable"
unaffected by other factors.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Discovers Large Deposits of Minerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have discovered
nine large and medium-sized deposits with a total of six million
tons of copper, gold, silver, nickel and chromium in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Of the deposits, seven are under exploration. The potential
value of these deposits is over 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deposits were discovered during a 17-year survey jointly
conducted by the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Geological and Mineral Resources starting from 1978.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia,
Russia and Kazakhstan have visited the deposits and shown great
interest in joint development. Some have already signed letters of
intent with Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan for the first-stage development, gold
production will be doubled each year. The output value of copper,
gold, nickel, and chromium will reach 760 million yuan (about 91.5
million US dollars) annually, with taxes and profits topping 200
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dequan, a geologist with the Xinjiang Geological and
Mineral Resources Department, said that development of these
deposits will ease shortage of rare minerals in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some departments predict that by the year 2010 China will lack
30 major minerals, especially copper, gold and chromium.
</P>
<P>
Geologists said that the newly-discovered copper deposit has a
high grade and is densely distributed, which is rare in large
copper deposits in the country. One gold deposit there has an
exceptional reserve of over 50 tons.

<HEADLINE> Budget Of Middle-Income Families In Zimbabwe Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's middle-income urban
families of six cannot afford the monthly budget for basic
necessities which has nearly doubled in the past 12 months, a
consumer watchdog has reported.
</P>
<P>
In its latest monthly survey, the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe
said an urban family of six needed monthly over 2,777 Zimbabwe
Dollars (about 300 US dollars) for basic groceries,
accommodation, education and health care as at the end of
November 1995.
</P>
<P>
In November 1994 the council found that an urban family of
six, which is the average family size in urban centers, needed a
monthly budget of 1,500 Zimbabwe Dollars (about 160 US dollars)
to cover the same needs.
</P>
<P>
The country's low-income families earning less than 500
Zimbabwe Dollars (55 US dollars) per month could not even afford a
quarter of the basic needs, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
An official of the council said the low-income urban dwellers,
making over 80 percent of the urban population, had to forgo a
lot of basics including health care, lunch and meat in their
diet.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that school fees commitments which had
required savings of 60 Zimbabwe Dollars (about 6.6 US Dollars)
per month now required over 330 Zimbabwe Dollars (about 36 US
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
A 20 kg bag of mealie-meal, the staple food in Zimbabwe, which
cost 30 Zimbabwe Dollars (3.3 US dollars) in november 1994, now
costs over 70 Zimbabwe Dollars (7.7 US Dollars) while the price of
bread has doubled since 1994.

<HEADLINE> 6-Year-Old Panchen Lama Starts Practicing Buddhism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Every day, the six-old-year new
11th Panchen Lama works hard on the Tibetan language, arithmetic
and Tibetan Buddhism scriptures, a senior Living Buddha from Tibet
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The 11th Bainqen Erdeni Qoigyijabu has started the life as a
Living Buddha since he ascended the holy throne," said Senqin
Losangjisam, a Tibetan deputy to the National People's Congress
(NPC) which is in annual session.
</P>
<P>
The young Panchen Lama was enthroned on December 8 last year in
the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, the residence for successive Panchen
Lamas in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Senqin Losangjisam himself is a senior Living Buddha in the
lamasery. He used to serve as an assistant to the 10th Panchen
Lama when the latter was hosting religious rites in the lamasery.
</P>
<P>
Being a member of the team to search for the reincarnation of
the deceased 10th Panchen Lama, Senqin Losangjisam participated in
the searching process and later in the ceremonious lot-drawing and
enthronement activities.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with historical conventions, the soul boy of a
deceased Dalai or Panchen Lama is determined by the practice of
lot drawing from a gold urn out of several candidates, who are
picked following scrupulous searchings. Then the soul boy will be
approved by the central government and enthroned.
</P>
<P>
Senqin Losangjisam is honorary director of the Democratic
Management Committee of the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, and takes
charge of the daily life and study of the little Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
According to Senqin, the Panchen Lama is early to rise and
early to sleep. Early every morning, he attends scripture
recitations held by senior monks in the lamasery.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama spends five to six hours a day studying
Tibetan, arithmetic, and the basic scriptures of Tibetan Buddhism.
One of his canon tutor is Bumi Qambalozhub with a honorable title
of Lha-ram-pa Gexe, the highest Buddhist rank in the research and
study of Lamist scriptures.
</P>
<P>
Another canon tutor, Nyima Sida, is a great master of the
science of logic in Hinduism. Many important works of the science
have been lost track in India. Fortunately, some works in Tibetan
language have carried forward the science to nowadays.
</P>
<P>
"The little Living Buddha is extraordinarily smart and cute,
and he is doing well in his studies," Senqin said. "Nevertheless,
he is still a child, who should not be let to overwork. He has to
play games and needs some time for rest, and he often goes for a
walk and is fond of toys."
</P>
<P>
The Living Buddha does not live with his parents, but can see
them often. He loves to have butter tea and Zanba (which is made
of roasted barley flour) for breakfast, and eat rice with
vegetable dishes for lunch and cakes of Tibetan flavor at supper.
But he never tastes sea food, spring onion and garlic.
</P>
<P>
"The little Panchen Lama is living amid an atmosphere alive
with Tibetan culture," Senqin said. "The 11th Panchen Lama will
surely be a patriotic great Buddhist master who is devoted to the
motherland and well-versed in Buddhism just like the previous
Panchen Lama. He will live up to the expectation of the central
government as well as to the monks and laymen in Tibet."

<HEADLINE> Abu Mazen: PNA Determined to Root Out Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said that the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) "is determined
to root out every bit of infrastructure" and "demolish the vicious
organizations" of terrorist who stage attacks against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), PNA President Yasser Arafat's top
deputy, made the remarks during an interview Wednesday night in
Gaza with The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
Abbas insisted the PNA has been "betrayed" by the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas), which the PNA mistakenly hoped would
involve into a democratic opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted Abbas as saying "There will be
no more dialogue with either of them (the political wing of Hamas
and the Izzadin Kassam military wing)."
</P>
<P>
"We will go after the Izzadin Kassam. You cannot trust
them. President Arafat said you cannot trust those people, and
that they betrayed us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been charged by Israel and others of failing to
make a strategic choice between its agreement with Israel and its
desire to remain on good terms with Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post indicated that Abbas's remarks seemed
designed to say that the PNA and Arafat are now making their
choice.
</P>
<P>
Abbas named "five key operational decision-makers" in Izzadin
Kassam arrested by the PNA in Gaza during the past few days,
adding that the Palestinian police are still searching for other
key terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 11 of the 13 suspects whose names were handed over
to the PNA by Israel remain at large.
</P>
<P>
Abbas suggested that there could be some surprise developments
in the fight against terror during the next few days.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that not all terrorists will be extradited to
Israel, but will be tried by PNA special military courts. "For
those who are guilty of these crimes of terror, no pardon will be
given," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the PNA would work with Israel to get rid of
terrorists, adding that Arafat said Israel security forces could
even accompany the PNA security in raids against terror targets in
cities controlled by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
However, Abbas warned Israel not to take any unilateral action
in Area A (major Palestinian towns in the West Bank handed over by
Israel to the PNA last year in accordance with the Oslo accords),
saying this would have dire consequences for peace.
</P>
<P>
Abbas also repeatedly warned against closing off the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip, expressing concern that it could be
"counterproductive," as it would increase Palestinian poverty and
turn away people from the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel has sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
following the recent suicide bombing attacks in Israel, which
were carried out by the Izzadin Kassam and had left more than 50
dead and over 150 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
A list of new security measures has been implemented in Israel
in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials warned that terrorists are planning
another suicide bombing attack on Israeli bus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli media reported that the Israeli army is
planning to establish a 2-kilometer wide strip to separate Israel
from the West Bank according to the government's decision.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Ready for Electronic Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East is now ready for
electronic commerce, in which a wide spectrum of business life
will be linked by computers to carry out all financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Gulf News, electronic trading is well
established in many parts of the world, particularly the United
States and the U.K..
</P>
<P>
Paperless trade, or, more formally, EDI (Electronic Data
Interexchange), is also growing at a phenomenal rate of nearly 500
percent in Europe between 1992 and 1997, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
General Electronic (GE) Information Services, one of the
world's electronic commerce leaders, predicts that the Middle East
is about to see a huge growth in electronic trade, with both
government and private sectors taking increasing interest in the
subject, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Electronic commerce has made very significant contributions to
productivity improvements by compressing overall business cycle
times and eliminating redundant, non-value added processes as well
as paper document," the paper quoted Shams Faiz, marketing manager
of the Saudi American GE Co, an affiliate of GE Information
Services, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EDI service in the Gulf region could benefit
users from all parts of the economy including oil, electricity and
water, customs, ports, trading, telecommunications, port and
banking.
</P>
<P>
He gave examples of the benefits of setting up such services,
including GE Power Systems which reduce the cost of processing
purchase orders from 100 U.S. dollars to 5 dollars and provide 50
percent more material with 25 percent less labour force.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, an exhibition of EDI EXPO'96 will be opened in
Dubai World Trade Center.

<HEADLINE> Energy-Saving Stoves Big Hit in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Yang Liumei, 47, is no longer
satisfied with her newly-built coal briquet stove; she insisted
that her family build a methane-generating pit this year.
</P>
<P>
This means that her family will spend less money buying coal
for cooking and heating.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally in southwest china's Yunnan Province women spent
most of their time gathering firewood, and then cooking while
tending the fire.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the per capita consumption of firewood in
rural Yunnan used to stand at some 650 kg annually. This not only
damages the environment, but is also a heavy burden for local
women.
</P>
<P>
But, entering the 1990s, the Yunnan Provincial Women's
Federation, together with concerned departments at different
levels, launched a series of energy-saving activities including
improving stoves to save firewood and building methane-generating
pits in the province's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Yunnan Provincial Women's Federation told
Xinhua that as these projects have close relations with their
personal interests, a great number of women from different
nationalities in the province have been attracted to energy-saving
training programs.
</P>
<P>
Yang Liumei was one of them. After listening to lectures in the
training centers, she rushed to the market and bought cement and
reinforcing bars, costing her just 30 yuan (some 3.6 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
With these materials, her family built a coal briquet stove to
replace the former wood-burning stove.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that by the end of 1995 more than 5.5 million
rural families had built energy-saving stoves, accounting for 73
percent of the province's total.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Seeks Sustainable Development for Qaidam Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Province in northwest China
is set to step up vegetation and forest protection in the Qaidam
Basin in a move to promote the sustainable development of the arid
area.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to afforest 73,000 hectares of sandy land
around eight cities and counties in the Basin areas and build an
ecological shelter-forest of 4,000 hectares and economic forests
totalling 667 hectares in the remaining years of this century.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province will build an environmental
protection project in Golmud, a key industrial city in the Basin,
to treat 35,000 tons of sewage daily.
</P>
<P>
The Qaidam Basin, almost the same size as Britain, is
calculated to have 39 kinds of mineral resources with potential
value topping 15 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government and the State Planning Commission
decided at the end of last year to speed up the pace of developing
Qaidam into an important base for salt chemicals and
petrochemicals, as well as a commercial grain production base.
</P>
<P>
However, according to local sources, the afforestation rate in
Qaidam stands at only 1.35 percent, far below the national average.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the past four decades the random reclamation of
wasteland here has caused large-scale destruction of vegetation
and led to a vicious circle in the local ecology. More than 40,000
hectares of farmland have been left uncultivated because of
desertification and salinization of the soil.
</P>
<P>
To achieve sustainable development in the Qaidam Basin, the
provincial environmental protection bureau, in co-operation with
other relevant departments, has worked out a comprehensive plan.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Suicide Attack Cell Uncovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A Hamas cell for three of the
recent recent suicide bombing attacks has been uncovered,
reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The cell was organized in Ramallah by a fugitive from the Gaza
Strip, who arrived in the autonomous city last month. He succeeded
in recruiting two students in the U.N.-run Teachers' Training
College and ordered them to seek suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
The man is still at large, but both of the students were
apprehended by the Palestinian police in cooperation with Israel,
according to a joint statement by the Israel Police and the Israel
Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesman.
</P>
<P>
One of the two students, Mohammed Abu Wardeh, 20, was
sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor Tuesday night at a
Jericho court. The other was identified as Abed Salimeh Sheik Eid,
26, of Rafah. Both are Hamas armed wing activists.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Jerusalem suicide bomber was identified as Raed
Shaghnoubi, 21, also a student at the college. The suicide bomber
who struck in Ashkelon was Ibrahim Husan Zarahna, 25.
</P>
<P>
Karmi Gillon, former head of the General Security Service,
said: "In the past year we have prevented any of these sorts of
organizational efforts, including those in the autonomous areas."
</P>
<P>
"We are talking of one cell that succeeded in carrying out
three horrible suicide attacks. At least here, we succeeded in
getting to the operators in a short amount of time, which
prevented further attacks," he told Army Radio.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the news of unearthing the Hamas cell, Prime
Minister Shimon Peres said: "The snake's head is still in the Gaza
Strip, and we will cut it off."
</P>
<P>
"It threatens the Palestinians and their future no less than it
does others," he told graduates of the IDF officer's training
course.
</P>
<P>
"For two days, the IDF and the security services have been
waging an uncompromising war against terror in general and
suicide bombers in particular," Peres said.

<HEADLINE> ICAO to Probe Aircraft Downing by Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTREAL, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) today decided to investigate the downing last
month by the Cuban air force of two aircraft piloted by Cuban
exiles based in the United States, which resulted in four deaths.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal-based ICAO council in a resolution today demanded
that the ICAO secretary-general "immediately initiate an
investigation of the incident."
</P>
<P>
It required the probe to determine "all relevant facts and
technical aspects" in accordance with a U.N. Security Council
presidential statement and report the results to it within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also urges all parties concerned to assist in
the prompt recovery, if possible, of bodies and personal effects
of the victims, and to cooperate fully in the ICAO investigation.
</P>
<P>
The resolution came after a lengthy council meeting requested
by the U.S. and Cuban governments and the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The resolution "strongly deplores" the incident and calls on
all states to ratify as soon as possible Article 3 of the
Convention on International Civil Aviation so as to prevent
recurrence of similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
Qian Zemin, the Chinese representative on the ICAO council,
underscored the principle that states must refrain from using
force against civil aircraft.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time he pointed out that each state has
"complete and exclusive" sovereignty over the airspace above its
territory and that civil aviation must not be used for any purpose
inconsistent with the aims of the Chicago Convention.
</P>
<P>
"We should also bear in mind that according to international
law, each sovereign state has the right to defend its sovereignty
and security," Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation fully supports a thorough investigation
into the incident, Qian said.

<P>
Soon after the welcoming ceremony, Prime Minister Bhutto and

market in Central Asia, because Pakistan is also moving forward to

<HEADLINE> Guangxi's Economy Leaps Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China is catching up with economically-booming
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The regional gross domestic product (GDP) went up at an average
annual rate of 16.9 percent during the 1991-1995 period, rising
from 20th place in the country to 15th place, and its per capita
GDP jumped from 29th place to 15th place, according to local
officials.
</P>
<P>
The multi-ethnic region is located in south China's karst area,
with adverse natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the country's overall fast-growing economy,
Guangxi has speeded up the construction of industrial enterprises
and infrastructure, and engaged in comprehensive agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years 60 percent of the region's construction
funds were poured into infrastructure and basic industries. A
number of group companies were formed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it scored an average annual increase of 9.6 percent
in agriculture, higher than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Guangxi has given top priority to the development
of such sectors as sub-tropical fruits, building materials,
machinery and aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
The region turned out 2.1 million tons of cane sugar and 2.45
million tons of sub-tropical fruits such as lychee and longan in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The region's Liuzhou Cement Factory, the largest of its kind in
China, produced 19.66 million tons of cement last year.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Government Pledges to Restore Fiscal Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Finance Minister Paul
Martin said today that the government will continue its efforts in
reducing deficits and helping Canadians attain a better and secure
future.
</P>
<P>
In his third federal budget speech, Martin vowed to "balance
the books" and put the debt-to-GDP ratio "on a constant downward
track". However, he didn't go far enough to specify when the books
would be finally balanced.
</P>
<P>
In the year Martin and the Liberals took office, the deficit
was 42 billion Canadian dollars, about 6 percent of the country's
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the figure was reduced to 37.5 billion Canadian
dollars, 5 percent of the GDP. "It is now clear that our target
for 1995-96 will be achieved - or bettered - and that we are on
track for our 3-percent target for 1996-97," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
To that end, the finance minister announced that the
departmental spending will be further cut by almost 2 billion
dollars and that spending on defence and international assistance
will also be further reduced.
</P>
<P>
The growth of spending on Inuit and Indian programming will be
restrained, the dairy subsidy will be phased out and the postal
subsidy program reduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
Martin noted that in this budget, the federal government will
try to reallocate its resources instead of raising personal,
corporate and excise taxes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also pledged that the government will take
further actions to restore confidence in the country's old age
security system and to provide a "secure, stable and growing
system" for medicare, post-secondary education and social
assistance.
</P>
<P>
To secure a better future for all Canadians, the government has
reallocated money to new investments in priority initiatives to
support youth, technology and international trade - areas which
are crucial to future jobs and growth, Martin added.

<HEADLINE> More Gansu Women Active in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of women in
both the urban and rural areas of northwest China's Gansu Province
are displaying their skills to the full in economic competition as
the building of a market economy picks up speed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995 alone more than 800 profit-making
enterprises and economic entities run by women were set up across
the province.
</P>
<P>
Faced with new challenges, women's organizations at different
levels across the province have launched a series of activities to
help urban and rural women acquire cultural knowledge and
technical skills.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the province ran literacy courses more than 6,500 times
in rural areas, involving over 130,000 women. Some 9,000 technical
training classes were held for some 530,000 women, and some
420,000 rural women have mastered various practical skills.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more and more women who were kept busy with
household chores in the past now rank highly among competitors in
various commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
Chang Huizhen, 28, from Toudun Village, Jiuquan City, started a
chicken farm ten years ago. Now the farm has 150,000 yuan (about
19,000 US dollars) in fixed capital and 250,000 yuan (some 30,000
US dollars) of working funds. Chang's farm now produces 250,000 kg
of fodder each year and its annual sales of eggs and chickens
stand at 60,000 kg and 7,500 kg, respectively.
</P>
<P>
As for urban women, Gansu gives them cultural education
combined with technical training. In 1995 the province ran more
than 5,800 training classes of various kinds for 156,000 women
workers, and more than 16,000 of them have become technical
crackajacks.

<HEADLINE> Wide-body Airbus to be Delivered to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to get its first
A340, the longest range airliner in the world, in May, today's
China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The wide-body and long-distance passenger plane, powered by
four engines, can seat 280 passengers. The airbus to be delivered
in May will be the first of five A340 ordered by China Eastern
Airlines under a contract signed in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Air China will also get three A340s according to a deal signed
by Airbus with China Aviation Supplies Corp (CASC) and Air China
last month, the Daily says.
</P>
<P>
Up to now the number of the Airbus-manufactured aircraft to be
sold and leased to China has reached 40.
</P>
<P>
In terms of passenger aircraft, Airbus products constitute less
than 10 percent of the Chinese market, but in terms of wide-body
planes, the company holds almost half of the market share, the
Daily quoted sources from CASC as saying.
</P>
<P>
Surveys by Airbus show that China is expected to demand 1,320
aircraft worth some 100 billion US dollars from now on to the year
2014.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu's Market Economy Taking Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu, a coastal province in
east China, has made headway in establishing and developing a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 the province had set up more than 7,000
markets, including 446 manufactured goods markets, 1,000 farm and
sideline products wholesale markets and over 200 markets for
production equipment and raw materials, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
At present, 95 percent of the locally produced goods are
regulated by the market instead of by central government planning.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the rise of rural industrial
enterprises has accelerated the development of markets.
</P>
<P>
One example is the Miaoqiao Township, which has expanded from a
base for the light and textile industries to the country's largest
woollen sweater market, with a transactional volume reaching eight
billion yuan (about one billion US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many local markets, following suit, have made themselves
national markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province has set up computerized interbank
lending and borrowing centers, foreign exchange centers and
hundreds of markets for job introduction.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, 11 more large-scale markets are
expected to appear in Jiangsu this year.

Although poaching for limestone is an offense, the police have

<HEADLINE> US to Send Warplanes to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States will send 30
warplanes to Jordan next month to reinforce U.S. forces in the
region in the temporary absence of an aircraft carrier in the
Gulf, the Defense Department announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft with some 850 U.S. troops are to depart in
mid-April for a two-month deployment, Pentagon spokesman Scott
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz now stationed in the Gulf is
scheduled to return to the United States next month and the
carrier Carl Vinson will not replace it until June.
</P>
<P>
"We want to demonstrate the ability to put ground-based
aircraft into the region to enhance our assets there, particularly
during times when we are going to have a gap in our carrier
presence," said a senior U.S. defense official.
</P>
<P>
The official also said the deployment in Jordan "is not tied
solely to a gap in our carrier presence and it's broader than
that."
</P>
<P>
Some reports say it is symbolic of vastly improving relations
between the United States and Jordan and a clear sign that
Jordan's leaders are increasingly turning their backs on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announcement was timed to coincide with the
arrival in Washington of Jordan's king Hussein.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein is scheduled to meet with President Bill Clinton
on Thursday to discuss the transfer of F-16 fighters and other
matters pertaining to security in the region, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said today.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of Defense Walter Slocombe told a House
Appropriations subcommittee today that the transfer of F-16s to
Jordan will "bolster a valuable force for stability in a volatile
region, and in turn, enhance the Israeli security."
</P>
<P>
"This program will both strengthen American influence in the
areas and reinforce, and promote further progress in the Middle
East peace process," Slocombe added.

WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher will travel to Moscow in late March for the
preparation of a visit to Russia by U.S. President Bill Clinton in
April, the U.S. State Department said here today.
</P>
<P>
The State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, told a press
briefing that Christopher is expected to meet with Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgen Primakov on March 22 to work out details of
Clinton's forthcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will go to the Russian capital to attend the nuclear
security summit of the world's seven leading industrial countries
(G-7) and Russia. The meeting was proposed by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin at the G-7 summit in Halifax, Canada, in June last
year.
</P>
<P>
On March 23, Christopher will take part in a meeting of the
foreign ministers of the five-member Contact Group on Bosnia in
the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the Moscow meeting will be the foreign
ministers from other three member states, namely Britain, France

Bosnia, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting is aimed at ensuring the implementation of
the U.S.-brokered Bosnian peace accord signed in Paris in December
1995.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Establish Land Acquisition Committees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
has called on the provincial governors to establish land
acquisition committees to help speed up the process of providing
land to the blacks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in eastern Zimbabwe on Wednesday, Mugabe
said the committees would be set up soon after the March 16-17
presidential election. Their duties would be to identify land
which could be acquired from the whites to give to the backs.
</P>
<P>
He said it was time for the government to speedily acquire the
land, most of which was in the hands of the white people. The
government would no longer use the method of first identifying
the landless people in a particular area and then seek funds to
buy a farm to resettle them, but would, with the help of the land
acquisition committees, identify suitable land in white hands and
give it to the blacks.
</P>
<P>
''We are now going to use the Land Apportionment Act method
they used to take away good land from the blacks. I want to
emphasize that we won't buy this land but will acquire it for
free. Where there have been developments, such as buildings,
dams and other infrastructure, that only can be compensated,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said because the black majority did not have land, most
of them found themselves living as squatters facing eviction
''and this is what we want to do away with''.

</P>
<P>
Tan Kecheng, director of the Guangzhou Foreign Trade and

</P>
<P>
However, the home market will be more open to these ventures as
well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ventures engaged in high-tech or funded by giant transnationals
in projects in which the Chinese government encourages overseas
investment will be allowed to explore the home market for a
certain proportion of their products.
</P>
<P>
Some ventures will not even need to export part of their
products to earn foreign currency as used to, if their products
can be substitutes for those that have to be imported.
</P>
<P>
Attention will also be given to the development of services for
overseas-funded ventures, such as counseling and intermediary
services.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city will continue its efforts to simplify
administration procedures for the ventures, and illicit fees
imposed on them will be banned.

schoolgirl in Okinawa last fall.
</P>
<P>
The Naha District Court sentenced U.S. Navy Seaman Marcus Gill,

</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had demanded a 10-year prison term for each of the
three, calling the crime unprecedented in its viciousness.
</P>
<P>
The incident triggered stormy protests among the local

march 14 to plan agitation strategies against the government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party said that its patience was running out as
the government had not shown enough concern towards fulfilling its
demands handed over last month.
</P>
<P>
UML President Man Mohan Adhikari on February 21 presented a
memorandum including the 30-point demands to Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba, asking his three-party government to fulfill these
demands within one month.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum demanded the government to control the rising
market prices, restore the public welfare programs by the previous
UML government and solve the recent problem of violent activities
by ultra-leftists politically, threatening that UML would launch
peaceful anti-government movement if the government fails to
initiate steps to fulfill these demands within the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the government and the UML party last week
began talks over these demands, but UML leaders have said that the
on-going dialogue was far from their satisfaction.

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing imported 276 cars in the
first three quarters of last year, a 71 percent drop from the same
period in 1994, according to the overseas edition of today's
"People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official with the Beijing Customs Bureau as
saying that the imported cars were worth 4.02 million US dollars,
down nearly 69 percent from the same period in 1994.

<P>
State-owned enterprises imported only seven cars during the
first three quarters of 1995, down from 498 in the same period of
1994.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the decrease in car imports is due
primarily to the collection of import duty on cars imported by
foreign-funded enterprises. Previously, cars imported by such
enterprises were exempt from import duty.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises imported 62 cars in the first nine
months of 1995, down 74 percent.

WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Jenny Thompson, double Olympic
gold medallist and former 100 meters freestyle world record
holder, failed to win an Olympic berth in this event after
placing third at the seven-day U.S. Olympic swimming trials in
Indianapolis, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The gold was won by the 23-year-old Amy Van Dyken, who was a
member of the national resident team that trains year-round at
the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
Van Dyken clocked 55.27 seconds and joined second-finisher
Angel Martino to qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Martino was timed 55.39 seconds. She was a member of the 1992
Olympic team and won a gold medal there in the 400-meter
freestyle relay and a bronze in the 50 meters freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who won gold medals at the 1992 Olympics on both the
400-meter freestyle relay and medley relay, was the fastest
qualifier in the morning preliminaries but finished third in
55.45.
</P>
<P>
But Thompson qualified for the 400-meter freestyle relay since
the top six swimmers in the 100 and 200 freestyles qualify for
the 400 and 800 freestyle relays.
</P>
<P>
The top two swimmers in 23 events qualify for the Atlanta
Olympic Games on July 19 through to August 4.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi opposition leader Sheikh
Hasina Wednesday made five demands, including a neutral non-party
caretaker government formed by March 10 and a new election in May,
for resolving the current political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The demands were contained in a statement issued to the press
Wednesday night by Hasina, president of the country's biggest
opposition party Awami (People's) League (AL).
</P>
<P>
The statement followed the latest offer of Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia to form a non-party government to supervise all future
general elections in the country and to hold the next
parliamentary polls as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said if Khaleda Zia sincerely wants to resolve the
crisis and ease the people's plight, she should take effective
steps to implement the five demands by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said that a neutral non-party caretaker government
should be set up by the president by March 10 after holding talks
with all the political parties in the country and a complete
election of the sixth parliament should be held in May.
</P>
<P>
She demanded that all opposition leaders and workers be
released from jail by March 9, asking for necessary compensation
for the people victimized by government repression.
</P>
<P>
She also demanded an end to all process of "farcical
re-polling," the cancellation of the February 15 elections and the
resignation of the present government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader urged the government to strengthen law
and order in the country to protect the safety and property of the
people.
</P>
<P>
She warned that she would call a country-wide, non-stop and
non-cooperation movement on March 9 if her demands were not
fulfilled.

<HEADLINE> Cheaper Lemons to Ease Hiking Cost of Dishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is rushing in
to please sour-faced consumers by putting cheaper lemons into
market today.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 lemons priced between 1.30 and 3.20 baht (five-13
cents) will be available at wholesale markets around Bangkok,
local newspapers quoted a Commerce Ministry source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lemon prices hit a record high in the country in the past weeks
and one lemon was sold at five to 10 baht (20-40 cents) on the
market.
</P>
<P>
The rising prices of the fruit, a seasoning in many Thai
popular dishes, were a consequence of last year's floods, pushing
high the cost of dishes in restaurants and households and
triggering complaints among residents in the city.
</P>
<P>
Yet local newspapers said that it is unlikely that lemons will
soon dislodge eggs from their position as the prime gauge of a
government's economic success.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to some governmental measures, an egg is generally sold
at 1.7 to 1.9 baht (6.8-7.6 cents) on the market, depending on
their sizes. The prices are a little bit lower than those under
the previous administration.

PHNOM PENH, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Second Prime Minister Hun Sen
Wednesday called for unity and cooperation between Cambodia's two
ruling parties and said he welcomes the formation of "another 100
new parties."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the comments at the closing ceremony of a meeting
of the Interior Ministry, according to The Cambodia Daily today.
</P>
<P>
His comments came two days after the First Prime Minister and
president of the National United Front for an Independent,
Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, complained of friction between his party and
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP).
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen acknowledged that "the two major political parties need
to reach perfect reconciliation and cooperation" and still have
to work to attain such a relationship.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "if the two major parties have a clash, it will
mean the situation in Cambodia would completely change in 24
hours."
</P>
<P>
Conflict within the ruling coalition could frighten off foreign
investors and shake the political system, he said, adding: "The
two major political parties are responsible for Cambodia's
(future)."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Interior has refused to recognize the
newly-established Khmer Nation Party (KNP) headed by Sam Rainsy,
former Finance Minister in the royal government.
</P>
<P>
Interior officials said the National Assembly would have to
adopt a law on the establishment of political parties before the
KNP could be officially recognized.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen called on the Ministry to draft a law to allow the
formation of new parties.

CHANGSHA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province
has made the selecting of women officials for different levels of
government a strategic goal and has had some achievements thanks
to its efforts.
</P>
<P>
The province now has three provincial-level women officials,
six at the prefectural level, 1,200 at the county level, and over
12,500 heads of sections in different government departments and
organizations who are women. These represent increases of 33.3
percent, 50 percent, 43.3 percent, and 27.6 percent respectively
over 1990's figures.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there is at least one woman cadre in a
leadership position in the party or the government at the
prefectural, city, and county level, and 78 percent of the
province's township party and government leadership have at least
one woman official.
</P>
<P>
The provincial organization and personnel departments have
developed regulations stipulating that women should account for at
least 30 percent of the number of officials across the province.
</P>
<P>
To improve the quality of women officials, departments at
different levels have started training classes for young and
middle-aged women cadres on political theory and science. Over the
past several years, more than 2,000 women officials in the
province have received training.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, over 600 women officials were sent out to make
on-the-spot studies of conditions or were sent to learn the

<HEADLINE> Growth of Poverty in Central America Alarming, Study Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Poverty in Central America has
increased at an alarming rate in the past two decades, with 70
percent of the region's population now living below the poverty
line, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
The joint study, by the Inter-American Institute of Cooperation
for Agriculture and Costa Rica's Center for Planning Studies,
warned that poverty in Central American countries is growing
faster than their populations.
</P>
<P>
Poor people account for 88 percent of the population in El
Salvador, 82 percent in Guatemala, 79 percent in Honduras and 69
percent in Nicaragua, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the region's poor are concentrated in El
Salvador and Guatemala, added the study, which defines poverty as
occurring when household income is insufficent for basic needs.
</P>
<P>
From 1980 to 1995, the number of people living below the
poverty line increased by 2.2 million in rural Central America,
while the number living above the poverty line dropped by 1.6
million.
</P>
<P>
The study said poverty in the region is growing because of "the
new poor" and increased destitution in rural areas, particularly
among women.
</P>
<P>
It said that rural women suffer most from low incomes, unskilled
work and lack of education.
</P>
<P>
The harsh rural environment forces farmers to migrate to cities
where they take low-paid temporary jobs.
</P>
<P>
In Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, more than
half of the economically-active urban population are migrant
farmers, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Worsening rural conditions and increasing urban-rural
migration, together with falling consumption and savings, low
investment and the decline in real wages have led to the
expansion of a large unofficial labor sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the early 1990s show that 7.5 million of Central
America's 20.5 million poor live in cities, and 3.9 million of
them live in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
Alhough the bulk of the poor live in rural areas, the number of
urban poor has grown fastest, the study said.
</P>
<P>
To reduce poverty in the region, the study said that Central
American countries had to maintain annual economic growth of at
least six percent and restructure their economies.

<HEADLINE> Thai Six Female Officers to be Promoted to Generals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's six female officers
will be promoted to the rank of general in the three services of
the armed forces, the Supreme Command headquarters and the Office
of the Permanent Secretary for Defense in the mid-year reshuffle
next month.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the Defense Council meeting
approved the promotions, a move aimed at recognizing women's
rights, Thai Defense Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was quoted
today by the local newspaper Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the past, it has been a traditional practice to bar female
officers from being promoted to the rank of general.
</P>
<P>
However, Chavalit said the promotion of women in the military
would be limited to only major-general, rear admiral and air vice
marshal, and their responsibilities will involve administrative
work and commanding units in the medical and nursing fields rather
than combat fields.

<HEADLINE> Officer Held Hostage at HK Detention Center Released  Unharmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A 34-year-old Correctional
Services Department (CSD) officer was released this morning
unharmed after being held hostage at a detention center by a group
of Vietnamese migrants.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Officer II Wong Fu-shing was released from the High
Island Detention Center (HIDC)!!after a series of negotiations
with his captors by a CSD negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman described his freedom as the result of
"immense patience by the CDS negotiation team who held protracted
talks with the Vietnamese migrants to secure Wong's release".
</P>
<P>
The hostage drama began yesterday afternoon when a group of
VMs, armed with home-made weapons, charged through the gates as
food was being delivered to the North Section of the Center.
</P>
<P>
In their attempt to gain entry to the South Section of HIDC,
the VMs had a scuffle with CSD officers who ordered them to stop.
A CSD officer was injured on the right forearm in the incident.
</P>
<P>
When the VMs ignored the order to stop, a total of 11 rounds of
tear-gas grenades were fired into the crowd to disperse them.
</P>
<P>
As the group retreated back to the North Section, they grabbed
Wong who was manning the North gate#,and held him hostage.
</P>
<P>
The VMs had demanded, among other things, that the Government
halt all Orderly Repatriation Program (ORP) operations and promise
not to take action against those involved in the hostage taking.
</P>
<P>
The CSD officer was injured in the scuffle and a Vietnamese
migrant was also slightly hurt.
</P>
<P>
The incident was thought to be connected with the news that
some 200 Vietnamese migrants would be transferred from the HIDC
today on preparation for their forced return.
</P>
<P>
They will be sent to Victoria Prison for pre-flight
documentation and medical checks prior to leaving Hong Kong in two
groups within the next two weeks, according to a Government
spokesman.

<P>
BONN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- German economists said today growth
in the eastern part of the country will slow down this year as
inflation and unemployment climb.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP) in eastern Germany will increase
by only 5 percent following the growth rates of 8.5 percent and
6.3 percent in 1994 and 1995, a report by a Hamburg-based
economics institute forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The report says this year more people will be out of work and
inflation will rise from 1995's 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in the
east.
</P>
<P>
As economic growth in western Germany slows down, the east will
find it even harder to catch up.

BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's decision to join the
International Center for Settlement of Investment Dispute (ICSID)
will help boost confidence among international investors,
according to a senior Thai official.
</P>
<P>
ICSID membership is a signal to investors that the Thai
government would be involved in managing payment should disputes
between local and foreign investors arise, Angkhani Vorasaph,
deputy permanent secretary of Finance Ministry was quoted by the
local newspaper Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Member countries can use their own laws as frameworks to solve
disputes. But in cases where the disputes cannot be settled, the
ICSID would set up an arbitration body to make a ruling of last
resort.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's legal system, especially the rules of the
Comptroller-General's Department, should be compatible with The
ICSID, which can enforce compensation orders.

<HEADLINE> China Can Feed Itself: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March (Xinhua) -- Chinese agricultural minister Liu
Jiang today dismissed overseas pessimistic predications that China
will not be able to feed its people in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people have the ability to feed themselves", Liu
told a press conference organized by the press center of the
ongoing sessions of the National People's Congress and the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
China will need more than 600 million tons of grain by the year
2030, when its population peaks at 1.6 billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
"That means, in the next 35 years, we need to increase our
grain output by nearly four billion kg annually, or less than one
percent on a yearly basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, in the past 46 years since the founding of
New China, average annual increase of grain production has been
nearly eight billion kg, or three percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we make serious efforts, I think, we can achieve
growth goals in our grain production," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister conceded, "We should not be blindly optimistic."
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng said last Tuesday that agriculture still
remains a weak link in the Chinese economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are materialists," he said. "While seeing the potential and
bright future of boosting grain production, we have to recognize
that difficulties exist for the achievement of our goals."
</P>
<P>
The minister briefly talked about measures that will be taken
to ensure continued growth in grain production.
</P>
<P>
"First, strictly protect farmland; second, do a good job of
improving medium- and low-yielding fields; third, increase the
rate of contributions to production increases by science and
technology; fourth, speed up the development of industries that
serve farming; fifth, adjust the farming structure and provide
guidance for consumption; and sixth, protect and further fire the
labor enthusiasm of farmers by deepening rural reform."

<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,200 birds have been
killed by a tanker spill off the Welsh coast last month, the
British government said today.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
showed that 19 species had died including 1,202 scoters and 643
guillemots, Gwilym Jones, junior minister at the Welsh Office,
said in a written reply to a parliamentary question.
</P>
<P>
Jones said that the death toll might be higher taking into
account the birds which either had been cared for by local
residents or had been washed out to sea.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian-registered Sea Empress crashed against rocks near
the West Wales port of Milford Haven, spewing half of its
130,000-tonne load before being refloated a week later.
</P>
<P>
The oil spill could endanger up to 100,000 birds, as well as
seals and dolphins, environmental experts say.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient tug power and the tanker's single, rather than
double hull, have been cited as reasons for the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Drought Ravages Farms in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A severe drought is threatening
most of north China, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted a report from the State Drought
Prevention Headquarters (SDPH) as saying that almost seven million
rural people and 5.2 million head of livestock are short of
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Some six million ha. of crops, more than 11.2 million ha. of
farmland ready for sowing and 227,000 square km of pasture lands
are suffering from the ravaging drought, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are busy revamping and building more water
and irrigation projects. So far, over one million ha. of farmland
have been irrigated, but it is unknown at this point how many
crops and arable land will be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
SDPH experts said precipitation over most of north China this
winter was less than three mm, which is 30 to 80 percent lower
than average.
</P>
<P>
The SDPH officials said that too much soil moisture has been
lost under a relatively high temperature and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Hebei, a province south of the Chinese capital, is facing the
worst drought, as there has been only one to three mm of
precipitation this winter, down 80 to 90 percent as compared with
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Shandong Province, One of China's major grain
and cotton producers, an average of only five mm of precipitation
has been recorded since last December, about 1.9 million ha. of
crops were affected.
</P>
<P>
Similar situation were also reported in the western parts of
northeast China's Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin provinces.
</P>
<P>
Even the second longest river in China, the Yellow River, dried
up in a few sections on the lower reaches on February 27, 17 days
earlier than last year, because of the serious drought.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have taken various measures to fight the
drought. Irrigation facilities damaged by last summer's floods
were improved and new ones were constructed to irrigate crops and
farmland in the upcoming weeks.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than one million ha. of crops, or 17 percent of
the total affected farmlands have been irrigated in Shandong,
Henan, Hebei, Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, many provinces in the south has been largely
alleviated by this winter's abnormally heavy snow and rain.

<HEADLINE> Germany Calls for Global Fight against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of Germany
today made an urgent appeal to the world to take tougher steps in
the war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Peter Hausmann, the spokesman for the federal
government, urged the Palestinian Authority to take every
necessary measure against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Middle East peace process must be kept on
track and the hope of peace could not be shattered by terrorism
and violence.
</P>
<P>
Hausmann also condemned the countries that support terrorism,
saying that Germany will consider the issue in developing
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Some German politicians believe that Iran and Sudan are the
primary countries who offered bases for Hamas, the radical
Palestinian movement responsible for four suicide bomb attacks in
Israel, which have killed 57 people in nine days.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian ambassador to Bonn Seyed Hossein Mousavian
told Deutsche Presse Agentur today that the charge against Iran of
offering Hamas bases is irresponsible and unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
As a victim of terrorism, he said, Teheran condemns all forms
of terrorism. He stressed that violence against innocent people is
by no means forgivable.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Farmers Bid Adieu to Hand-Crank Telephones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Over the past five years, great
changes have taken place in rural life in east China's Jiangsu
Province because of heavy local government investment in improving
rural telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Optic-fiber lines connect nearly all the province's townships,
and phones in rural areas are completely program-controlled.
Farmers have said farewell to the out-of-date telephones that had
a hand-crank.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1990, the province had fewer than 90,000
switchboards in its rural areas, whose handling capacity could not
meet the growing demands of farmers. About 65 percent of the
telephones in use were of the hand-crank type.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the province invested 5.52 billion
yuan in the sector, and last year spent 2.68 billion yuan, 12.4
times the total of the entire 1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
Not only are large-scale digital program-controlled
switchboards in wide use now in rural areas, but synchronous
transmission systems are in operation in some parts of the
countryside.

WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Wayne Ferreira of
South Africa knocked out New Zealand's Brett Steven to advance to
the quarter-finals of the 328,000 U.S. dollars Franklin Templeton
Tennis Classic in Scottsdale, Arizona on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira, ranked 10th in the world, met little trouble to beat
Steven in one hour 15 minutes for his second quarter-final of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise came when the 19-year-old American Justin
Gimelstob disposed of eighth seed Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden 2-6,
7-5, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Gimelstob, who was making his third ATP Tour appearance, got
his first tour quarter-final berth.
</P>
<P>
The 31st-ranked Bjorkman easily captured the opening set, but
Gimelstob found his form in the following two sets to win the one
hour 39 minutes battle.
</P>
<P>
Gimelstob entered the weeklong hardcourt event ranked 436th on
the ATP computer, but will jump into the 290's after improving to
4-2 in his brief career.

<HEADLINE> Xu Hangs On To His Bags Of Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Xu Xinping turned down the chance
of instant fortune when a German visitor turned up at an
exhibition in Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
It would have meant 34-year-old Xu parting company with his
amazing collection of rare and important coins.
</P>
<P>
And his collection was far more important to him than a bag
filled with 200,000 Deutsche marks.
</P>
<P>
"These coins belong to me, my family, but more important, they
belong to the motherland. I won't sell a single of them no matter
how much money is offered," vowed Xu.
</P>
<P>
The German, a coin collector, had turned up at an exhibition
of Xu's coin collection in his hometown of Qingdao in east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Xu inherited several pots of ancient Chinese coins from his
grandfather when he was a grade two pupil. At that time he often
gave coins to close friends. He even used them to buy things from
nearby stores.
</P>
<P>
When he grew up, Xu gradually became interested in collecting
coins. In 1988, he bought a book on ancient coins, and learned
about the history and profound national culture surrounding
coinage.
</P>
<P>
When Xu learned that a large quantity of ancient Chinese coins
ended up in foreign countries, he was especially determined to
concentrate his efforts to the protection of coins. He also
decided to carry out research into a complete history of ancient
Chinese coins.
</P>
<P>
Collecting coins in his spare time became Xu's favorite
hobby. After sorting out the coins inherited from his grandfather,
he began to seek, and collect more from his friends and among the
people.
</P>
<P>
Whenever he heard that somebody had ancient coins, Xu would pay
them a visit, no matter when and where. His aim was to buy,
sometimes with large sum of money, or by exchanging his own
coins. He not only used all his own salary to buy and collect
coins, but often asked for help from his wife and father.
</P>
<P>
So far, Xu has collected over several hundred thousand coins,
in more than 20,000 different varieties. His massive collection
includes coins made from gold, silver, copper, iron and
nickel. Many date from the Shang Dynasty (16 BC-11 BC) while
others are state-issued commemorative coins, issued during
different dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Xu has now started to collect various foreign coins currently
in circulation. He has collected thousands of varieties of coins
made by different printing plates, from more than 230 countries
and regions worldwide. He has even started to compile an
illustrated handbook on coins of different countries currently in
circulation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Releases Worldwide Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States today accused
many countries of committing "widespread abuses of human rights"
in 1995, but remained tongue-tied about its own problems in this
area.
</P>
<P>
A lengthy annual report released by the U.S. State Department
on human rights practices in 194 countries listed instances such
as extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, arbitrary
detention as well as discrimination based race, sex, religion,
disability and language.
</P>
<P>
It singled out some 25 countries, including Burma, China, Cuba,
Iran, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, India, Mexico, Syria and Russia, as the
major target of attack, charging them with "continuing
systematically to deny basic rights to their citizens."
</P>
<P>
It vilified China for alleged "widespread and well-documented
human rights abuses in violation of international norms." The
United States will again co-sponsor an anti-China resolution at
the U.N. Human Rights Commission conference in Geneva this year,
assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck told a news briefing
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Shattuck described 1995 as "a year of U.S. leadership on human
rights" around the world and said that the Clinton administration
has made human rights issue "a very high priority" in
U.S. relations with other countries. The report itself
acknowledged that it "will be used as a resource for shaping
policy, conducting diplomacy, and making assistance, training, and
other resource allocations."
</P>
<P>
Washington's practice of using human rights issues as an excuse
for increasing pressure on other countries and interfering in
their internal affairs has strained its ties with more and more
countries. But this self-proclaimed human rights champion is not
likely to do anything to restrain itself.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Ajax Amsterdam
shook off doubts following starting the Dutch season with
lackluster performance to score a 2-0 away victory over Borussia
Dortmund in the European Champions' Cup on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Borussia, short-handed for the last 24 minutes of their
quarter-final first leg after midfielder Matthias Sammer was sent
off for collecting two yellow cards, could hardly turn the table
in its away game in Amsterdam on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Eight minutes into play, Edgar Davids gave the Dutch side a
lead and 19-year-old striker Patrick Kluivert dashed the Germans'
hope of a late comeback seven minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Dortmund played without midfield ace Andreas Moeller, sidelined
for a month following a knee operation.
</P>
<P>
Ajax missed Dutch international defender Frank De Boer,
suspended after being booked twice in the European Super Cup.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid's 18-year-old striker Raul scored the only goal in
the game, giving his side a 1-0 win over Juventus.
</P>
<P>
Raul found the net in the 20th minute for the Spanish team,
which is to play the second leg in Turin.
</P>
<P>
The last time Juventus won the Champions' Cup was in 1985.
</P>
<P>
However, Real Madrid is gunning for their seventh Cup win,
although the last was 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nantes ended the unbeaten run of Spartak Moscow with a 2-0 home
victory.
</P>
<P>
The French club scored through Japhet N'Doram and Nicolas
Ouedec in the 28th and 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other quarter-final tie, Legia Warsaw of Poland
and Panathinaikos of Greece fought to a 0-0 draw.
</P>
<P>
In a pitch slick with ice, Warsaw still had some scoring
opportunities in front of their president Aleksander Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
An error by Zbigniew Mandziejewicz in the 65th minute allowed
Alexandros Alexoudius a rare chance for the Greeks, but he arrived
too late to take full advantage.
</P>
<P>
Panathinaikos had reached the 1971 Champions' Cup final, only
to lose to Ajax Amsterdam.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government and the
Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) will try to resolve
their differences over the autonomous operation of a follow-up and
verification committee in their second day of talks today.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiations that seek to pacify the
southeastern state of Chiapas said that the proposal to incorporate
the presidents of the Harmony and Pacification Commission (COCOPA)
made up of legislators and that of the National Commission of
Intermediation to the verifying entity will also be discussed at
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The second round of negotiations, at which "Democracy and
Justice" are being discussed, started on Tuesday in San Andres
Larrainzar, Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Gonzalez Yanez, the current president of the COCOPA,
said that the verifying commission will require full autonomy so
that it will have sufficient weight to follow up the agreements.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating parties were optimistic that differences will
be overcome so that the first peace agreements resulting from the
first round of talks in which the topic of "Indigenous Culture and
Rights" were tackled can be formalized.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1994, the EZLN took up arms in four
municipalities in Chiapas for the rights of the indigenous
peoples. After more than two years of fruitless meetings, the two
sides have now been able to report the first advances in the
pacification of the state.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The numbers of unemployed in Germany
climbed to 4.27 million in February, a record high since World War
II, due to the continuing economic slowdown and the long winter.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Federal Labor Office Bernhard Jagoda said in
Nuremberg today that the number of jobless in February was 110,000
more than in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in February was 11.1 percent, compared

He said the numbers of jobless in western Germany rose to 2.96
million in February, 240,000 more than in the same month last
year. Western Germany's unemployment rate in February was 9.6
percent.
</P>

<P>
PARIS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- French champions Nantes overwhelmed
the visiting Spartak Moscow 2-0 in the one-sided quarter-final
first leg match of the European Cup in Nantes on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nantes displayed dominance from the start and their attacks
turned out fruit when Chad's Japhet N'Doram, leading Nantes scorer
this season, opened the account with a header in the 28th minute.
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Ouedec proved he was the most dangerous striker in the
field by heading home the second in the 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
The French squandered countless chances throughout the game and
made the Russians take a further breath after playmaker Reynald
Pedros was sent off in the 75th minute for kicking Spartak
defender Dmitry Ananko.
</P>
<P>
Pedros, who was suspended for three games by UEFA last season,
will probably not play another European Cup match this season.
</P>
<P>
Spartak, who have lost nearly half their squad since their
last European Cup outing in mid-November, failed to find their
form since the Russian league resumed just recently.

<HEADLINE> No. 3 Cali Cartel Drug Lord Killed in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Fugitive Jose Santacruz
Londono, the No. 3 kingpin of the Cali drug cartel, was shot to
death during a shootout with the police in Medellin, Colombian
police sources confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation occurred on Tuesday night when a police
patrol intercepted a jeep which carried Santacruz and his
bodyguards, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Santacruz, 53, escaped from a maximum security prison in Bogota
on January 11 after spending six months there on charges of
homicide, terrorism and illegal enrichment.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Ernesto Samper expressed his satisfaction
with the operation and affirmed that it was an example of
Colombia's effort to fight drug traffickings.
</P>
<P>
According to Colombian police authorities, Santacruz was the
third most important kingpin in the Cali drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
The drug lord was captured on July 4, 1995 in a restaurant in
northern Bogota with two other men, but he escaped in January from
the "La Picota" maximum security prison where the Rodriguez
brothers, Gilberto and Miguel, the chieftains of the powerful Cali
drug group, are also inmates.
</P>
<P>
After the escape, the authorities launched operations to
recapture him in the capital and the country and offered a reward
of 1.5 billion pesos (15 million dollars) for the capture of the
drug trafficking kingpin.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Foreign Debt Reaches 27.488 Billion Dollars in  December 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Peru's Central Bank said today that
the external debt for the country rose to 27.488 billion dollars
in December 1995, an increase of 7.96 percent over the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the foreign debt was due to a larger number of
short-term loans, compared with medium and long-term ones, a
Central Bank report said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the net flow of the public foreign debt had a
deficit of 378 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Medium and long-term loans which include loans to the Central
Bank as well as the public and private sectors increased 4.06
percent in 1995 on rising from 21.593 billion dollars in December
1994 to 22.470 billion last December.
</P>
<P>
The biggest increase in the debt occurred in the private sector
which reached 1.088 billion dollars at the end of 1995, an
increase of 19.4 percent over December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Medium and long-term foreign debt for the public sector rose
last December to 10.345 billion dollars, i.e. 3.45 percent more
than the amount corresponding to 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government is negotiating with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) a program of broader facilities for the
1996-1998 period which includes the macroeconomic targets for
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement with the IMF is a prerequisite for initiating
the renegotiation of Peru's debt with the Paris Club which totals
approximately eight billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in Italy dropped
to 5.0 percent in February, the lowest point in 11 months, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rate fell gradually in three successive months from a peak
at 6.0 percent in November last year.
</P>
<P>
From April to November last year, the inflation rate witnessed
a rise from 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent, an unprecedented
phenomenon in the country in five years.
</P>
<P>
Over the last eight years, Italy's inflation rate, which once
slipped to as low as 3.6 percent, has remained above 5 percent for
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theodor Waigel warned last year that it
would be impossible for Italy to become one of the first countries
to enter the monetary union if it couldn't meet standards set in
the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the drop in inflation rate to government
intervention.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Raps U.S. Anti-Cuba Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government said
today the anti-Cuba "Helms-Burton" bill approved by the
U.S. congress aimed at tightensing economic sanctions against Cuba
and the countries that trade with the island was contrary to the
principles contained in the charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the Foreign Ministry criticized that the
United States is ignoring the principle of respect for the
sovereignty of states and that it is trying to apply internal
norms beyond its frontiers.
</P>
<P>
The communique pointed out that the Mexican government "regrets
that the preoccupations that it had expressed over this bill,
shared by the countries of the European Union and Canada, among
others, were not taken into consideration" by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Today, the U.S. congress has approved the "Helms-Burton Bill"
that tightens the economic embargo that Washington has imposed
against Cuba since 1961 following the two U.S. planes were shut
down by Cuban air force last month. Cuba accused the United States
of violating its air space.
</P>
<P>
Mexico feels that the bill in question "contains provisions
that could generate conflicts of a legal nature, violates the
free trade agreement (of North America) and the objectives of
the World Trade Organization," the document said.
</P>
<P>
It asserted to that respect that Mexico "will resort, in
conjunction with Canada, to the legal resources afforded by the
free trade agreement to contest the effects that this bill will
have on trilateral trade.

<HEADLINE> Henman Moves into Quarter-finals in Rotterdam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Tim Henman struggled to
advance to the quarter-finals of the 750,000 U.S. dollars world
indoor tennis tournament in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on
Wednesday with a straight-set win over Spain's Carlos Moya.
</P>
<P>
Henman, 21, who was the first player to be disqualified at
Wimbledon last summer after angrily slamming a ball which hit a
ballgirl on the head, needed 69 minutes to eliminate Moya 7-6, 6-4
with his base-line play.
</P>
<P>
The Briton, who worked his way to win the qualification to get
into the Rotterdam tournament, is probably due to play world
number on Pete Sampras on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The American disposed of Spaniard Tomas Carbonell in their
first round tie later on Wednesday and will meet Jakob Hlasek of
Switzerland in the second round on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Henman has played Sampras twice before and is aware that he
has little chance of progressing further in this competition.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
not said when he will formally announce his candidacy for
re-election, a White House spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"I asked him that last night," press secretary Mike McCurry
told reporters who have regularly raised the question, "and he
acted very bothered by the question and went back to signing some
books he was signing."
</P>
<P>
Deputy campaign manager Ann Lewis later said she believed
Clinton "may be beyond announcing." Clinton already had been
moving virtually uncontested through the Democratic party
primaries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Technically, legally, by every standard, he is a candidate,"
she said. "What we may be doing is looking toward more of a
campaign kickoff event in the spring."
</P>
<P>
Clinton already has amassed some 30 million dollars for the
primary season, and has been attending a series of campaign-like
events inside and outside of Washington.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil futures surged above 20
U.S. dollars a barrel today as reports showed U.S. stockpiles have
fallen to their lowest levels since 1977, when oil prices were
doubling.
</P>
<P>
Crude's strength also boosted heating oil and unleaded
gasoline, according to market sources.
</P>
<P>
Light, sweet crude oil for April delivery rose 65 cents to
20.19 U.S. dollars, the highest price for the contract closest to
delivery since February 20.
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that
crude stocks fell 2.698 million barrels last week to 297.484
million -- the lowest U.S. stockpile since mid-1977.
</P>
<P>
American oil refiners have been importing less oil this year to
cut storage costs, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The market shrugged off a report that OPEC had increased output
in February by 70,000 barrels a day to average 25.78 million

<HEADLINE> US House Approves Tough Sanctions on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House today passed a
legislation to further strengthen U.S. economic sanctions against
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the bill by a 336-86 vote a day after the
Senate passed it by a 72-22 margin, and the House sent it to
President Bill Clinton for signing.
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Senate Foreign Relations Committee
chairman Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Dan Burton, was
called Helms-Burton legislation that is aimed specifically at
driving foreign investors from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The legislation makes it impossible for any president to ease
sanctions against Cuba without an approval of Congress.
</P>
<P>
A central provision would create a new legal right to allow
Cuban Americans to sue in U.S. federal courts companies which are
doing business on land expropriated by Cuba that they formerly
owned.
</P>
<P>
A related provision in the bill would deny entry into the
United States of foreigners who buy, sell or improve the
expropriated property.
</P>
<P>
Canada, Mexico and other countries that maintain normal trade
relations with Cuba have protested the measure.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced on February 26 a series of punitive sanctions
against Cuba for the shooting down of two U.S. planes piloted by
Cuban exiles, and also promised to sign the bill after Congress
passed it.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States reiterated
today that it officially recognizes the present government of
Qatar, denying that it wants to see Qatar's former emir return to
power.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's current Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani deposed
his father, the former emir, in a bloodless palace coup last
summer when the former emir made a tour of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The United States has "a working relationship" with the present
regime in Qatar, a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
It is "inaccurate to say we want to overthrow the current
regime" in Qatar, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official was responding to a Kuwaiti newspaper report that
the U.S. government wants Qatar's former emir return to power to
ensure stability and security in the Arab Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Qatar government claimed that it had uncovered
and thwarted an anti-government plot by supporters of the deposed
emir who were backed by some foreign countries.

WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Retired Army General Barry
McCaffrey was sworn in today as U.S. President Bill Clinton's new
drug policy chief.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey, 53, was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The general was commander in chief of the U.S. Southern Command
in Panama for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
As head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
McCaffrey will coordinate the administration's drug strategy and
act as the president's primary spokesman on drug-related issues.
The job will remain a Cabinet-level post, and McCaffrey also will
hold a slot on the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey, who compared drug use to a cancer, pledged to
prevent another "decade of agony" that the nation endured in the
1970s when drug and alcohol abuse soared.
</P>
<P>
Clinton intended to boost McCaffrey's staff from 40 to 150, to
reverse the reductions he made when he entered the White House
three years ago when the staff was cut from 146 to 25.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
is considering new ways to help Rwanda after the withdrawal of a
U.N. peacekeeping force from the central African country.
</P>
<P>
"Although the UNAMIR (U.N. Assistance Mission for Rwanda) is
withdrawing the day after tomorrow, the United Nations is not
abandoning Rwanda," said council president Legwaila J. Legwaila of
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters outside of the Security Council chamber that
the Rwanda government has requested the United Nations to
establish a political office in Kigali, capital of Rwanda, and
that the council is considering the request.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMIR is winding up its work in Rwanda on March 8 after
helping Rwanda bring back order and peace in the wake of the 1994
massacre.
</P>
<P>
But to achieve final national reconciliation, the country has a
long way to go. U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
suggested in his lastest report on Rwanda that the world
organization continue assistance to the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures is to establish a political office to
promote national reconciliation, strengthen the judicial systems
and facilitate the return of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Elaborates on Sovereignty Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Though the U.S. government
may not want to provoke the February 24 incident, it did not take
effective measures to timely avoid those events from occurring,
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Robaina said
that the history of aggressions against Cuba and actions in
violation of her sovereignty and territorial integrity started 37
years ago, when small pirate airplanes dropped subversive
propaganda and bombed the capital of the country on October 21,
1959.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1990, 14 infiltrations and pirate attacks have taken
place against our country, carried out with boats coming from the
south of the United States and dozens of terrorist planes were
aborted by us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The last pattern in all this long history of aggressions has
been provocations by the airplanes belonging to the so-called
"Brothers to the Rescue" organization, which has violated the
Cuban airspace 25 times during the last 20 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
On "Brothers to the Rescue," he said that Cuba has more than
enough proof that the organization made plans to dynamite high
tension towers in Havana, to sabotage the Cienfuegos oil refinery
and to carry out attempts on the lives of the main Cuban leaders.
</P>
<P>
Its activities not only constitute hostile and provocative
actions against Cuba, but also constitute violations of the norms
which regulate international civil aviation and may endanger the
lives and safety of many people and airplanes, he said.
</P>
<P>
After shooting down the two small planes, Cuba quickly
expressed its willingness to collaborate with the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). "We request that the United
States also facilitate all the investigation and clarification
work," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the legal instrument to judge Cuba's action
was without legal force. Namely, Article 3-bis was only a proposal
identified as Resolution A 25-1, agreed upon at the 25th Special
Session of the ICAO, as the amendment in accordance with Article
94 of the Chicago Convention would only take effect after being
ratified by 102 members of the organization. It has been ratified
by 82 only.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright read a statement after the
presentation of the Cuban foreign minister. She stressed the
shootdown violated the prohibition under customary international
law against the use of weapons in these circumstances against
civil aircraft in flight. "This prohibition is longstanding and
does not depend on whether Chicago Convention Article 3 (bis) is
in force," she added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Intensifies Moves To Recover Indigenous Monuments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
intensified moves to recover nigerian indigenous monuments
illegally carted away by Europeans during the colonial period.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the Director-General of the
National Commission for Museum and Monuments, Dr. Yaro Gella, at
a news briefing here today on the on-going international
exhibition tagged "Valley of the Niger".
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gella said that part of the move by the government was to
ensure that the issue was on the agenda of the Organisation of
African Unity and the United Nations during their meetings this
year.
</P>
<P>
He explained that former attempts made by the unesco treaty of
1970 had not been successful because European countries and the
United States had refused to sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The director-general lamented that European countries which
preached justice and human rights were singing a different tune
by withholding the stolen monuments. Some of the countries had
made laws to protect the stolen monuments, he decried.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, for instance, he explained, a protectionist law
existed by which any monument, which entered into the country,
could not be reclaimed by anyone, if no complaint about the
missing item was received one year after its entry into Japan.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is aimed at bringing together the material
culture of peoples occupying a substantial part of the west
African sub-region. It consists of selected works of artistic
wealth of the forefathers, some of which were dated back to 4,000
years.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gella pointed out that the exhibition was not only a
demonstration of the spirit of cooperation among six west African
states, but also a symbol of north-south partnership on cultural
matters.
</P>
<P>
The antiquities on display came from Burkina Faso, Mali,
Niger, Guinea, Mauritania and Nigeria. enditem

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed as Storms Batter Southern US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Violent storms battered the
southern U.S. today, tearing down mobile homes, downing trees and
power lines, killing at least five people and injuring dozens of
others.
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, a tornado destroyed a mobile home park in Selma,
killing three people. In the Selma area, about 30 other people
were reportedly injured and treated at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a bomb had gone off," said Hank James, an
emergency coordinator of Dallas County. "Trailers exploded,
trailers overturned, trailers in trees."
</P>
<P>
The storm also devastated another mobile home park in
Montgomery, killing two people and injuring 13 others. About
20,000 customers were knocked out of power around Montgomery and
Selma.
</P>
<P>
In Arkansas, another tornado cut a five-mile path across Sharp
County late Tuesday, damaging at least 15 homes. About 6,000
customers were left without power near Mountain View, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Tornadoes and hails were also reported in Mississippi and
Georgia. At least six people were injured and a small airport near
Macon, Georgia, was damaged.

<HEADLINE> Forbes to Continue Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Millionaire magazine
publisher Steve Forbes today squelched wide speculations that he
would quit the Republican presidential race, and expressed his
determination to carry on the battle for getting the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Albany, New York, Forbes said
that he has won the endorsement of former U.S. Housing Secretary
Jack Kemp, a respected GOP regular, on the eve of New York's
primary Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It's very exciting today to be able to announce that Jack Kemp
is endorsing my candidacy for president of the United States,"
Forbes told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Kemp gave strong support to Forbes' flat tax idea, which the
GOP presidential front-runner Bob Dole and New York Governor
George Pataki have been sharply attacking.
</P>
<P>
Forbes, who has reportedly spent more than 25 million U.S.
dollars from his own pocket since he announced his contest last
September, came in third place in most of the eight Republican
presidential primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole swept the eight primaries
and reestablished his overwhelming lead in the GOP race for the
nomination at the party's National Convention in August in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
Two GOP presidential runners, former Tennessee Governor Lamar
Alexander and Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana, quited the race
earlier in the day to support Dole.
</P>
<P>
U.S. House GOP Leader Newt Gingrich and many other Republicans
have said that Dole has won the party's nomination.

<HEADLINE> Over 10 Million Women Infected with HIV by 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- UNAIDS, a joint United Nations
program against HIV/AIDS, said today that the HIV risk for
women is rising worldwide, with over 10 million of them infected
by late 1995, out of a total of over 24 million infected adults.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the global figure of female HIV
(Human Immunodeficiency Virus) carriers will top 14 million by the
year 2000, including about 4 million killed by AIDS (Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome).
</P>
<P>
Of the total of female infections, it added, more than 90
percent occur in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 7,500 infections occur daily worldwide, nearly
half in women, of whom more than four-fifths get the deadly virus
from a male sex partner, while others are infected due to blood
transfusion or use of contaminated needles.
</P>
<P>
According to UNAIDS, it is proved that sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) can help spread HIV. An untreated STD in either
partner increases the risk of HIV transmission during unprotected
sex by three to four times. Notably, 333 million new cases of STDs
occur each year.
</P>
<P>
Globally, a considerable increase in infected women was
reported over the past 10 years. In industrialized countries,
infections no longer occur in men only as it was in the past
practically. AIDS cases among French women was some 12 percent of
the total in 1985, and rose to around 20 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Spain, women's share of reported AIDS cases more than
doubled over the same period, up to 19 percent from around 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
In South America, Brazil posted a greater increase in female
AIDS cases. In 1984, only one woman was infected with HIV for
every 99 men, and a decade later women formed a quarter of the
infected total.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, where the HIV epidemic is almost going out of control,
one-third or more of prostitutes in cities in Cambodia, India and
Thailand are infected, and the risk is growing for ordinary women
too.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, it was reported, less than 1 percent of pregnant
women attending antenatal clinics were found to be infected in
1991, compared to more than 2 percent by the year 1995.
</P>
<P>
The worst situation is found in Africa. There are already six
women infected for every five men in Africa south of the Sahara.
In addition, African women accounted for close to four-fifths of
all female infections.
</P>
<P>
Things are even worse for African young women aged between 15
and 25 years. In countries where young people comprise 60 percent
of all new infections, young women outnumber their male peers by a
ratio of 2 to 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians in Bakassi Peninsula are
enjoying a better sense of security with the presence of Nigerian
soldiers there, the Defence Headquarters said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government formally deployed troops in the
peninsula to protect its citizens in 1993 after a major invasion
of the area by the Cameroonian gendarmes.
</P>
<P>
The two west African countries have long been at loggerheads
over the ownership of the oil-rich peninsula in the gulf of
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian defence spokesman Fred Chijuka told newsmen today
that the situation in the peninsula had remained calm since the
nigerian soldiers repelled an attack launched on them by the
Cameroonian troops last month.
</P>
<P>
Chijuka however reiterated Nigeria's belief in dialogue as a
way to solve the Bakassi dispute.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has been before the international court of justice
in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon first took the dispute to the world court in
February, 1994, when an armed clash happened between the two
countries. enditem

<HEADLINE> Angola's Situation Takes Turn for Better: UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The political and military
situation in Angola has recently taken a turn for the better,
commander of the U.N. peacekeepers General Philipe Sibanda said
in Kuito today.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan News Agency quoted him as saying during an
inspection tour of central Angola this is attributed to the
political will for peace by both the government and the
opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the U.N. peacekeeping troops have also
played an important role in helping the two sides build up
confidence in each other.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has been locked in nearly 20-year civil war with the
government since Angola became independent from Portugal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated President Eduardo Dos Santos and UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi on the most positive results they had made during
their meeting in Libreville on March 1, saying he is confident
that the peace process in Angola is sure to bear fruits.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda today toured the site where the U.N. peacekeepers in
central Angola are accommodated, visited a technical college for
mine-sweeping and presided over a ceremony in which a bridge
spanning Calay River was opened.

Ali Abdullah Saleh and several Yemeni government officials.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Hughes pointed out that the U.S. Administration calls upon
all parties concerned to cooperate with the French government for

</P>
<P>
France, Egypt and Ethiopia are making efforts to mediate a

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Commited to Implementation of Beijing Platform For Action (By Pei Shanqin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today said that Tanzania was totally commited to the
implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for
Action, adopted by the World Women's Conference held last
September in China.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks here this evening after
receiving the two documents from the Secretary-General of the
Fourth World Conference on Women, Mrs. Getrude mongella.
</P>
<P>
First of all, Mkapa said, his government was totally commited
to the creation of a socio-political, legal and regulatory
environment which will enable women to participate in
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
He said all Tanzanians should contribute ideas to effect that
commitment. "I wish to invite creative ideas from both women and
men in this country on how best to effect this desire and these
changes," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said Tanzanian women would have to face the
21st century as managers of large scale economic ventures and the
government would support all initiatives directed towards
improving their access to science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He said primitive technologies had turned Tanzanian women at
the turn of the 20th century into "beasts of burden" and the
government would try to avoid letting them enter the 21st century
with such technologies.
</P>
<P>
The president said political empowerment of women was itself
not an end as they also needed economic empowerment and pledged
his government's resolve to address itself to structural
constraints which inhibit women's interests.
</P>
<P>
On women's access to education and training, President Mkapa
said gender imbalance in socio-economic and political spheres
could not be redressed if the question of women education was not
delt with.
</P>
<P>
"Various affirmative actions in the past enabled the Tanzania
government to narrow the gap between boys and girls in primary
and secondary schools. Similar efforts have not, however, been
successful in tackling the problem in institutions of higher
learning," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He observed for example, that female enrolment representation
at Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Mbeya techical colleges between
1989/90 and 1993/94 was dismal. It was on the average of 6, 15
and one percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
He said graduation of female students at the University of Dar
es Salaam and Muhimbili College of Health Sciences during the
same period ranged between 15-18 and 20-30 percent respectively,
while at the Sokoine University of Agriculture it was 13-20
percent and at the Open University it was only nine percent
during its first intake in 1993/94.
</P>
<P>
"While my government will uphold the principal of merit in
terms of accessing higher levels of learning and training, it
will also welcome and support all initistives leading to
improving the performance of girls in primary and secondary
schools," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president called upon lawyers and law enforcers to take a
more creative role in supporting women legal empowerment and
challenged the mass media to help enhance women's legal knowledge
and awareness of their legal rights.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the government's commitment to encourage
and facilitate the gradual and systematic eradication of
gender-based discrimination and create a favourable institutional
framework for the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and
Platform for Action as spelled out by the women conference.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the United Nations Secretary General's special envoy
and the UN Under-Secratary General on Women and Development
Issues, Mrs. Getrude Monglella briefed President Mkapa on the
Beijing Decleration and Platform for Action and how successful
the Beijing conference was.
</P>
<P>
The function held at the Kilimanjaro Hotel in the city as part
of the celebrations to mark the International Women's Day, was
attended by women's representatives from governmental and
non-governmental institutions, ministers, members of parliament
and diplomats, including the Chinese Charge d'Affaires ad Interim
in the embassy, Mr. Chen Bannin, totally about 200 people in
number.  enditem
