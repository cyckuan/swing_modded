	   In Houston, Moises Alou drove in four runs and Sean Berry tied
his career-high with four hits as the Houston Astros continued
their scoring splurge.
	   Alou hit a two-run double in the first inning and a two-run
homer in the seventh, giving him eight RBIs over the past two games
and four homers in his last 11 at-bats. Jeff Bagwell added a
two-run homer in the eighth for the Astros, who have scored 48 runs
in their last four games.
	   Chicago's Albert Belle hit a 426-foot (128-meter) homer into the
Astrodome's left-field upper deck in the sixth inning. It was only
the 12th homer into the Astrodome's upper deck and the first since
Mark McGwire's homer on June 18.
 &UR; Royals 6, Cardinals 4 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Tim Belcher won for the fifth time in six
decisions and Jeff Conine and Dean Palmer each had three RBIs as
the Kansas City Royals continued their hottest streak of the
season.
	   Mark McGwire, who hit his major league-leading 37th homer the
previous night, went 0-for-3 with a walk and two strikeouts for the
Cardinals.
	   The Royals have won five of six and eight of 10. The Cardinals
have lost seven of eight and are a major-league worst 3-9 in
interleague play.
 &UR; Dodgers 7, Rangers 5 &QC; 
	   In Arlington, Texas, Eric Karros' two-run double capped a
three-run rally in the ninth inning off All-Star closer John
Wetteland.
	   Wetteland (2-1), named to his second All-Star team earlier in
the day, entered the ninth with a 5-4 lead. He gave up a one-out
single to Wilton Guerrero before second baseman Mark McLemore
booted Jim Eisenreich's potential game-ending, double-play
grounder.
	   One out later, Gary Sheffield singled home Guerrero. Karros then
hit a liner into the right-field corner, scoring Eisenreich and
Sheffield to hand Texas its first loss in 43 games when leading
after eight innings.

Deposed co-premier gets warm welcome in Phnom Penh market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Business came to a standstill
Thursday when Prince Norodom Ranariddh paid an election campaign
visit to a popular Phnom Penh market suffering hard times since he
was deposed as co-premier in a coup last year.
	   Vendors, scrambling to catch a rare glimpse of the prince, left
their stalls unattended and people eating breakfast abandoned their
steaming bowls of soup.
	   Ranariddh, ousted last year by his arch-rival, strongman Hun
Sen, has been allowed through diplomatic pressure to return and is
the leading opposition candidate in the July 26 polls. The response
by the shopkeepers indicated he remains popular.
	   ``I left my business to see him ... what a pleasure!'' said Eng
Kea, 61, who squeezed through the crowd to try to touch the
prince's hand. She succeeded: ``Twice! And his wife's, too.''
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 overseen by
thousands of peacekeeping troops, but was forced to share power
when Hun Sen, who led Cambodia in the 1980s, threatened civil war.
The coup shattered their tense co-premiership.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to win back legitimacy and aid
cut after his takeover. With no peacekeepers and a minimal U.N.
role this time, critics say Hun Sen has stacked the polls in his
favor.
	   A U.N. human-rights report Wednesday said that 104 alleged cases
of violence and intimidation, including four killings that appear
to be political, have been reported since mid-May.
	   Nonetheless, Ranariddh, son of the popular King Norodom
Sihanouk, is seen as Hun Sen's biggest threat.
	   Mobbed by several hundred vendors and shoppers, he had
difficulty maneuvering through the Tuol Tumpoung market's narrow
aisles.
	   The market _ widely known as the Russian Market because experts
from the former Soviet Union were frequent foreign visitors during
the 1980s _ is one of the capital's most popular shopping centers.
	   It once buzzed with the sales pitches of the shopkeepers, whose
ability to communicate in Russian, French, English and even Malay
helped promote sales to foreigners: locally made silks and
handicrafts, imported shoes, clothes and compact discs.
	   But sales plummeted after the coup and many traders at Tuol
Tumpoung still harbor resentment at Hun Sen's government. Hardship
was worsened by the economic crisis striking other Asian countries
whose investment impoverished Cambodia badly needs.
	   Many shopkeepers said Thursday that when they cast their ballots
July 26 it will be for Ranariddh, not Hun Sen.
	   ``I hope he can help us by bringing more tourists back to
Cambodia,'' said Kheng Heik, 41, who sells hammocks and mosquito
nets at Tuol Tumpoung.
	   Nearly 40 parties are contesting the elections for 120 National
Assembly seats. The main contenders are Hun Sen's formerly
communist Cambodian People's Party and the prince's royalist
FUNCINPEC.
	   Two smaller opposition groups _ the Sam Rainsy Party and the
Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party _ loosely allied with Ranariddh
can probably expect to pick up a few seats.

	   BOSTON (AP) _ Imagine a family with almost 100 million members
worldwide. Lined up side-by-side for a family photo, the relatives
would stretch one and a half times around the world.
	   Lee (or Li, depending on the Chinese transliteration) recently
edged out Chang (or Zhang) as the largest surname in China, and,
therefore, the world.
	   Nearly 500 Lees, representing more than 20 chapters of the Lee
Family Association throughout the United States, Canada, Hong Kong,
Taiwan and China, are meeting in Boston this week for their last
family reunion of the millennium.
	   The family is so big, it even has its own credit union _ worth
dlrs 22 million _ and maintains an extensive array of real estate
holdings.
	   It's all part of keeping things in the family, said Yon Lee,
English secretary of the Lee Family Association of New England.
	   The Lees are serious about their claim of relatedness. They say
they are all descended from the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao
Tzu, founder of Taoism, who lived 2,500 years ago.
	   A figurine of Lao Tzu sits atop the Lee Family Temple in the
city's Chinatown neighborhood. Lees pay as much as dlrs 3,000 to
have tablets of their deceased ancestors placed in the temple.
	   It is considered taboo to marry another Lee.
	   ``Technically speaking, when you're married to a Lee, you're not
expanding. You're downsizing. You have to bring other surnames into
the flock,'' said Yon Lee.
	   But prolific mating is not the reason behind the exorbitant
number of Lees in the world.
	   Steven Lee, Grand National President of the Lee Family
Association, traces the explosive growth of the family back about
1,300 years to the Tang dynasty, when an emperor named Lee bestowed
his surname upon favored subjects.

Clinton tells China not to sacrifice environment for economic

growth &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more quotes, background. &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUILIN, China (AP) _ Amid the craggy limestone peaks of Guilin,
U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday that the environment must
not be sacrificed for economic growth in China, one of the most
polluted countries on Earth.
	   ``China has a unique opportunity,'' he said, ``because you are
developing rapidly but later in time than other countries, to avoid
making the same mistakes we have made.''
	   In the sweltering heat, Clinton waved a colorful Chinese fan. He
called it ``an energy efficient air conditioner.''
	   He said the United States and China _ the two largest emitters
of heat-trapping greenhouse gases _ must join together to combat
global warming and pollution because they share the same planet,
the same oceans and the same air.
	   ``Without any loss of economic opportunity, we can conserve
energy much more than we do,'' Clinton said. ``We can use clean as
opposed to dirty energy sources much more than we do. And we can
adopt new technologies to make the energy we have go further much
more than we do.''
	   Clinton came to this fabled land of cloud-shrouded mountains and
winding rivers on a sweltering day to showcase the environmental
revival of a region once polluted but now coming back to its
natural beauty. The scene contrasts with China's polluted cities.
	   Clinton said the United States has made progress in cleaning up
pollution since the days when a fouled U.S. river caught on fire.
China, too, is making progress, he said.
	   Meeting with Chinese environmentalists, Clinton said that even
in America ``there is a big fight'' over environmental protection
because ``there are always people who are afraid if we take any
step it will hurt the economy.
	   He said that if Guilin wants tourists to come, ``you have to
have a clean environment. if you want a strong economy, you have to
produce healthy children. So at some point, we have to see these
things together.''
	   China's devastating environmental problems have been a recurring
theme on Clinton's trip, from a university speech Sunday to an
address Wednesday to American businessmen.
	   He spoke Thursday in Guilin's Seven Star Park. The stage for his
speech was built at the bottom of a gray and white limestone peak
called Rosy Clouds over Camel _ named for its outline suggesting a
camel's humps.
	   The president said the United States is trying to repair many
years of environmental mismanagement.
	   ``Our traditional energy use that causes pollution is about one
third in vehicles transportation, about one-third in buildings,
housing and office buildings, and about one third in factories,''
Clinton said.
	   ``In China, it's probably more in factories, but it would come
toward these numbers. In the vehicles, you have opportunities'' to
make progress with fuel-injected engines and engines power by
natural gas.
	   He said Wednesday that a major legacy of his visit will be
U.S.-Chinese cooperation on the environment _ something that ``ten
years from now people will look back and say that's one of the
biggest things they did.''
	   In a speech to American business leaders in Shanghai, Clinton
urged China to clean up corruption, open trade markets and combat
the environmental catastrophe hanging over the world's most
populous country.
	   He said it was wrong to believe _ as many do _ ``that there is
an iron, unbreakable link between economic growth and
industrial-age energy practices. ... It is simply not true.''
	   After a river boat ride in Guilin, the president will fly to
Hong Kong, last stop on his nine-day tour, to demonstrate U.S.
interest in preserving the autonomy of the former British colony.
It was returned to China on July 1, 1997, after 156 years of
British rule.
	   Jiang will wrap up a visit to Hong Kong of his own _ marking the
first anniversary of the handover _ just hours before Clinton
arrives.
	   In Guilin, Clinton launched a series of exchanges between U.S.
and Chinese experts on global climate change. Also being
spotlighted was U.S. assistance for a nationwide air quality
monitoring network in China and a dlrs 50 million Export-Import
Bank loan for clean energy projects.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told the group
that America's trade deficit with China could climb to dlrs 60
billion in 1998, up dlrs 10 billion from the previous year.
	   China contends the trade imbalance is only dlrs 16.4 billion,
excluding among other things trade through Hong Kong, but Beijing
agrees its surplus is growing.

visit &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with dedication ceremony &QL; 
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Beginning a wistful farewell to venerable,
heart-stopping Kai Tak, officials on Thursday dedicated a dlrs 20
billion hi-tech airport that will make arriving at Hong Kong much
like any other major city.
	   Chinese officials, who helped celebrate the first anniversary of
the return of mainland sovereignty the day before, presided over
the ceremony along with Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   The opening of the airport was another cause for celebration in
what is otherwise a sobering time for Hong Kong.
	   Although the relationship with China has developed better than
many expected, the territory is struggling with a severe economic
downturn that has raised unemployment and sliced deeply into stock
and property values.
	   A multi-colored Chinese dragon the length of the terminal and
including about 1,000 people inside, lion dancers and musicians
took part in the ceremony. But airport officials acknowledge that
the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok is designed
to be functional, not colorful.
	   After dedicating the airport, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
ended his visit to Hong Kong, boarding the ramp onto his jumbo jet
in a squall. Hours later, President Clinton was to use Chek Lap Kok
for his arrival on the last stop of his tour of China.
	   The approach to 73-year-old Kai Tak skims over some of the most
crowded neighborhoods on the planet. Officially, it closes Sunday
night. The new airport opens for regular business on Monday
morning.
	   Tung praised the new airport, the largest investment in the
history of Hong Kong, as a ``combination of the wisdom, diligence
and entrepreneurship of the Hong Kong people.''
	   He said other public spending on highways and educational
facilities would not only make Hong Kong a better place, but also
boost the economy.
	   Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen said the airport would make
exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland easier, as well as tie
Hong Kong more tightly into the world economy and enhance its
competitiveness.
	   He also gave Tung a vote of confidence, saying he was certain
Hong Kong could ride out its economic problems.
	   The airport project took seven years, and was a major cause of
dispute between China and Britain as they negotiated the handover.
But among those present for the dedication was Britain's Deputy
Prime Minister John Prescott.
	   Although the gleaming new terminal appeared complete on the
inside for the dedication ceremony, shops inside the departure hall
still were shuttered, and workers are likely to be putting the
finishing touches on the airport as Clinton arrives.
	   Several ceremonial flights have used the airport, located on an
island about 20 miles (35 kilometers) from the city, but airport
officials said Clinton will be the first passenger from outside
Hong Kong.
	   On a recent visit, the sleek, airy passenger terminal was filled
with the sounds of hammering and drilling as workers completed the
airport's retail stores.
	   Bare-chested workers strolled in groups in the sprawling
terminal with carts of building materials in tow. A handful of them
were catching afternoon naps by the windows.
	   Clinton, however, is unlikely to witness the last-minute work.
His entourage will leave the tarmac directly for their hotel,
bypassing the terminal.
	   The new airport was built on a manmade islet west of outlying
Lantau island. Building it meant flattening two uninhabited islets
and pushing back the sea for the runways. Half of the world's
dredging fleet converged here at one time to conduct the
reclamation work.

Tight-fisted Malaysia now looking to spend way to recovery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Having failed to curb its sliding
currency and kick start the economy by tightening its purse
strings, Malaysia now intends to spend its way to recovery.
	   Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim, announcing Wednesday a 5 billion
ringgit (dlrs 1.2 billion) stimulus package to revive stalled
projects, said the government had to aggressively intervene.
	   The package marks a retreat from the tight spending and credit
squeeze monetary authorities had insisted were needed to stabilize
the ringgit and cap inflation. It comes on the heels of a 7 billion
ringgit (dlrs 1.75 billion) government spending package.
	   ``The economy has to recover and if it takes the government to
provide the necessary stimulus, then we will have to do it,'' Anwar
said.
	   Alarm bells went off in Malaysia after the economy appeared to
be careening into recession, having shrunk by 1.8 percent in the
first quarter of 1998, compared with 6.9 percent growth in the
previous quarter.
	   ``Everyone is having a rethink about the strategy for
recovery,'' said Abdul Razak Baginda, executive director of the
independent Malaysian Strategic Research Center.
	   ``The whole thing about everything being dependent on a painful
process is not working.''
	   Despite tight monetary policies _ high interest rates and
lending curbs _ the ringgit fell to 4 to the dollar this week. It's
depreciated nearly 40 percent in the last year and the stock market
is still bleeding.
	   Wednesday's package was ``initial funding'' to revive abandoned
civic works schemes, Kuala Lumpur's monorail and other ``critical
infrastructure projects,'' Anwar said. The projects were mostly
jettisoned in an austerity drive in December which forced
widespread cuts in government spending.
	   Even before Malaysia's economy went into a tailspin, independent
economists warned the nation could ill-afford extravaganzas such as
a new hi-tech administrative township called Putrajaya and the
monorail.
	   Analysts now say the money would generate business for some of
the construction companies teetering on bankruptcy.
	   ``Many (companies) which didn't get funds will get government
loans,'' said Kanika Singh, an economist with Independent Economic
Analysis, a Singapore-based research company.
	   While Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia gave up their options
by going to the International Monetary Fund, Malaysia is still free
to chart its own course to recovery, said Abdul Razak. ``Malaysia's
adopting a trial-and-error method.''
	   The turnaround is a political victory for Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad who has railed against the IMF-style policies that
Anwar was backing.
	   The differences caused a rift among Mahathir and the finance
ministry. The deadlock was broken when Anwar altered his rhetoric
to support his boss' prescription of lower interest rates and
softer lending.
	   While Malaysia's central bank had appeared to heed international
advice on keeping a tight monetary policy, Mahathir differed. He
attacked the IMF for triggering the Indonesian turmoil and accused
the West of plotting to overthrow him and recolonize Malaysia.
	   This week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, on a
whistle-stop Asian tour, warned Malaysia against easing up on its
strict monetary policy.
	   ``If you have a looser monetary policy, you'd run the risk of
substantial depreciation of the currency,'' he said.
	   Indications of the policy turnaround came last week when
Mahathir appointed Daim Zainuddin, a long-time confidant, as a
Cabinet-level minister to supervise recovery. Daim has backed
Mahathir on relaxing monetary rules.
	   The latest moves were ``a precursor to a looser monetary
policies,'' said Singh.
	   By cutting the reserves that banks were required to maintain
from 10 percent to 8 percent last week, the central bank has
increased the money available for commercial lending.
	   But many banks, weighed down by bad debts, would still be wary
of lending, predicted Singh, forcing the central bank to make it
even easier to borrow, she said.

Lebanese guerrilla fire lands in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALIK MAOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAHARIYA, Israel (AP) - A number of mortar shells fired by
Lebanese guerrillas landed inside Israel Thursday, a military
source said.
	   One of the shells landed in the Israeli Arab village of Arab
el-Aramshe, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The shooting occurred after Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
launched a heavy mortar attack against Israeli forces and their
Lebanese allies inside south Lebanon.
	   Israel occupies a strip of land in south Lebanon to protect its
northern border against the guerrilla attacks.
	   Hezbollah also tried to capture a fortified position of the
Israeli-backed militia, the South Lebanese Army, but the SLA said
it repulsed the attack.
	   Two Israeli soldiers and one SLA member were wounded in the
exchanges of fire. They were flown to hospital in Israel.
	   Arab el-Aramshe lies on the Israeli border with Lebanon, and it
is possible that the shells were aimed at Israeli or SLA positions
inside Lebanon, but overshot their target.

Singapore Power, Singapore Telecom cut tariffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Power and Singapore Telecom have
announced tariff cuts in line with the government's promise to help
businesses cope with an economic slowdown.
	   For a one year period beginning July 1, customers will get a 0.3
cent (U.S. cent 0.17) rebate from Singapore Power for every
kilowatt of electricity consumed, the company announced Thursday.
	   The rebates, expected to cost Singapore Power about 81 million
Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 47 million), are given in support of
the government's off-budget package to help the economy, the
company said.
	   Singapore Telecom, meanwhile, from Aug. 1 will reduce by up to
20 percent its international direct dialing rates to seven
countries: Indonesia, Thailand, the Netherlands, France, Italy,
South Korea and Germany. It announced the move Wednesday night.
	   Singapore Telecom's Executive Vice President Lim Toon said that
the cut will allow customers to save about 20 million Singapore
dollars (U.S. dlrs 11.7 million) annually.
	   On Monday, Finance Minister Richard Hu introduced a 2 billion
Singapore dollar (U.S. dlr 1.17 billion) package aimed at helping
businesses cope with Singapore's economic downturn.
	   Among other measures, the government also lowered commercial
property rentals and increased government funding for some business
enterprises.

Group urges preservation of tiger habitats to stop attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Fearing more attacks by man-eating
tigers, a Malaysian environmental group has called for a crackdown
on illicit hunting and logging that have driven tigers to hunt
outside their natural habitat.
	   Concerns have grown since a tiger ate two villagers in northern
Malaysia after being wounded by hunters and left unable to hunt in
the wild. The tiger was killed by conservators.
	   ``The tragedy could have been averted,'' said Salleh Mohd. Nor,
president of the Malaysian Nature Society.
	   ``Tigers' habitats have been relentlessly logged, segmented or
converted into other land uses,'' Salleh said in a statement
published in Thursday's New Straits Times.
	   As a result of depleting forests, the animal's food sources have
dwindled and roads made by rubber and oil palm planters and loggers
have made the once dense jungle easily accessible to hunters.
	   The Malaysian tiger has been classified by the World Wildlife
Fund as an endangered species. Only 500 are believed still living
in the wild.
	   Although hunting of the animal has been banned since 1972, its
declining population has made it more valuable on the black market.
	   The situation in Malaysia, Salleh wrote, ``is quite serious.''
	   ``Monitoring and enforcement should be stepped up as a response
to this threat,'' said Salleh, calling for better control over
hunting, firearms abuse and the encroachment on forests.
	   The tiger that killed two men last week near the town of Sungei
Siput, about 140 kilometers (90 miles) north of Kuala Lumpur, was
found with several gunshot wounds that made it difficult for the
animal to hunt.
	   Salleh warned that the same scenario could easily occur again.
	   Wounded and maimed tigers ``will resort to killing easier prey,
including humans,'' Salleh said.
	   While the danger of tiger attacks still remains in the jungles
of Sungei Siput, it has also surfaced in the eastern state of
Terengganu, where prowling tigers have mauled more than 15 farm
cows in recent weeks.
	   The Terengganu Wildlife and Parks Department has installed 30
cameras throughout a stretch of jungle in an effort to track the
animals, the New Straits Times newspaper said.

China trip yields little business accomplishments for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-China &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By WALTER R. MEARS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ For U.S. President Bill Clinton, it was
all business _ but business is not all good.
	   Not with the U.S. trade deficit with China heading upward, and
with no real progress to report in reversing it.
	   Clinton made his business rounds Wednesday at the American
chamber of commerce, on the arena-size floor of the Shanghai stock
exchange and with a personal look at a homeowner's apartment in a
Chinese real estate development.
	   All cordial and complimentary, but with acknowledgments of the
problems lurking behind the diplomatic niceties.
	   Clinton said he was disappointed at the lack of headway made
toward easing the trade barriers that limit U.S. access to China's
markets and add to the increasing trade deficit.
	   That problem will be waiting for Clinton after he gets home on
the Fourth of July, a debating point for congressional opponents of
renewing normal trade relations with China. Critics contend that in
trade and on other issues, the White House policy of engagement
means yielding to what China wants.
	   Still, Clinton and his team put the best face they could on what
they couldn't get. U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley said he
hoped the summit had moved the Chinese closer to market-opening
steps that would lead to Beijing's admission to the World Trade
Organization, which deals with trade relations and rules on trade
disputes.
	   Nothing specific, though.
	   ``As far as concrete steps that have been taken in the last five
days, no,'' said Daley, who warned of a political backlash in the
United States over the increasing trade imbalance.
	   Commerce and trade were Clinton's issues of the day in booming,
if overbuilt, Shanghai, after summit sessions with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in Beijing where the two agreed only to keep
discussing their trade differences. The next round of negotiations
is slated for Geneva the week of July 20.
	   By U.S. estimate, the annual trade deficit is dlrs 50 billion
and going up, perhaps to dlrs 60 billion when the 1998 numbers are
final. The Chinese say that is far overstated because exports
flowing through Hong Kong aren't counted as offsets to U.S. imports
directly from China.
	   Either way, Daley said, ``The bottom line is, our exports have
not grown anywhere near the degree that their exports to the United
States have.''
	   ``The trade deficit is up somewhere around 13 or 14 percent,''
said Alan Turley, the U.S. delegation trade specialist. ``By both
our figures, it's increased.''
	   Before Clinton came to China, the administration had talked
pessimistically about trade-opening efforts. The results have
matched those low expectations.
	   For China to take a seat in the World Trade Organization, which
Clinton said he and Zemin want, the Chinese would have to erase an
array of regulations, protectionist measures and other restrictions
they deem essential to the development of their still-infant market
economy.
	   Clinton said they are entitled to leeway, time to phase in more
open trade rules. However, Daley said, ``The offers that have been
put forward just aren't sufficient at this point to allow us to
move forward.''
	   At post-Cold War summits, leaders usually boast of the business
deals they've made. That was muted this time. There were seven
commercial agreements, although dollar numbers came only from
Chinese officials, who said there were seven contracts valued at
about dlrs 1.9 billion. But dlrs 800 million of that represented
the confirmation of jetliner contracts with the Boeing Co. signed
at the last summit.
	   Turley wasn't putting a dollar value on the latest deals. ``I
think we're trying to get away from giving a number on this,'' he
said, because the contracts may prove to be worth much more than
their face values.
	   Of course they also could prove to be worth less.
	   Either way, they would hardly dent the trade deficit. But Daley
said there could be much more ahead as China builds bridges, power
plants, roads, airports.
	   There are estimates China will spend dlrs 375 billion on such
projects over three years, and far more in the future. By
comparison, the gigantic U.S. roads and public works bill just
signed by Clinton is for dlrs 203 billion over five years.
	   In the face of international competition for the
infrastructure-building contracts, the administration wants a piece
of that Chinese public works action. Daley will lead a U.S. mission
to China early in 1999, seeking opportunities for U.S. businesses.

<TEXT>
	   NAHARIYA, Israel (AP) - A number of mortar shells fired by
Lebanese guerrillas landed inside Israel Thursday, a military
source said.
	   One of the shells landed in the Israeli Arab village of Arab
el-Aramshe, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Six women in the village were treated for shock.
	   The shooting occurred during a heavy bombardment by
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas against Israeli forces and
their Lebanese allies inside south Lebanon.
	   Israeli forces and the Israeli-backed South Lebanese army (SLA)
responded with artillery and mortar fire.
	   Israel occupies a strip of land in south Lebanon to protect its
northern border against the guerrilla attacks. Israel calls the
strip the ``security zone.''
	   Hezbollah also tried to capture a fortified position of the SLA,
but the SLA said it repulsed the attack, the source said.
	   Two Israeli soldiers and one SLA member were wounded inside the
security zone, in the exchanges of fire. They were flown to
hospital in Israel.
	   Arab el-Aramshe lies on the Israeli border with Lebanon, and it
is possible that the shells were aimed at Israeli or SLA positions
inside Lebanon, but overshot their target.

Coral ``bleached'' along Thai coast; El Nino blamed

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The El Nino weather phenomenon is
believed to have played a role in ``bleaching'' coral in the Gulf
of Thailand, which causes the underwater formations to lose their
colors and weakens them, sometimes fatally.
	   The bleaching, which turns coral pale or white, is widespread
over most of Thailand's eastern coast, which lures tens of
thousands of divers from around the world each year to behold the
colorful coral and fish living there.
	   Marine scientist Suraphol Sudara told The Associated Press on
Wednesday that the scale of the problem was unprecedented in this
Southeast Asian country and could have been caused by the El Nino
weather patterns.
	   He expressed concern that pollution from industrialization along
sections of the coast over the past decade would inhibit the
recovery of the bleached coral.
	   Similar bleaching has been reported in the past few months from
such far-flung locations as East Africa, Florida and Australia's
Great Barrier Reef.
	   `It is the first time this phenomenon has happened on such a
large scale in Gulf of Thailand,'' said Suraphol, a researcher at
Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. ``I was shocked to see scores
of formations turned white.''
	   Coral reefs, some of which are still alive after 2.5 million
years, consist of thousands of small organisms and an outside cover
of a single-cell plant that gives off the distinctive bright
colors.
	   But coral is sensitive to pollution and temperature. A recent
study found that about 58 percent of the world's reefs are at risk
of degradation because of coastal development, destructive fishing
and pollution. More than 80 percent of coastal reefs in Southeast
Asia are at risk.
	   Bleaching can occur when the surrounding waters turn warmer than
usual, something caused by El Nino. Suraphol said the average water
temperature in the gulf had increased from 28-29 degrees Celsius
(82-84 F) to 32 degrees (90 F).
	   What is described as bleaching is actually the absence of the
algae Zooxanthellae, which normally live in the cells of the coral,
providing coloring as well as nutrition for the structures.
	   Depending upon a range of conditions, the affected coral may
recover or die within two to three years.
	   Suraphol said coral bleaching had affected Thailand's western
coast, on the Andaman Sea, a few years ago.
	   Last month, a Kenyan scientist said unusually high sea
temperatures have damaged up to 70 percent of the coral reefs and
other marine plants on the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa.
	   Bleaching was also robbing the color from the coral reef off the
Florida Keys, said scientists there.
	   In April, Australian marine officials said the coral of the
Great Barrier Reef was suffering some of the worst damage in
recorded history.
	   High water temperatures and freshwater runoff caused coral
bleaching in reefs off Queensland, said a spokesman for the Great
Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. In some areas, up to 80 percent
of coral had reportedly been affected.

Suspected drug dealer to be extradited, pending appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more detail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ An Australian citizen accused of being
in a gang which trafficked drugs between Thailand and Australia
will appeal to Australia's highest court after he was Thursday
ordered extradited to Germany, his lawyer said.
	   Gregory Parker, 59, lost the latest round of one of Australia's
longest-running extradition cases when the full bench of the
Federal Court upheld a government appeal and ordered his return to
Germany.
	   However, the court granted a 15-day stay so Parker could seek
special leave to appeal to the High Court, Australia's highest
judiciary body.
	   Parker's lawyer Michael Hodgman said outside the court he would
also ask Attorney-General Daryl Williams to stop the extradition
proceedings.
	   German authorities first issued a warrant for Parker's arrest in
1991.
	   According to Interpol documents presented to court, Parker was
born in Poland and has used 14 aliases.
	   He gained Australian citizenship in 1985 and officially changed
his name four times, acquiring an Australian passport in each of
his new names.
	   German officials allege seven offenses occurred in 1990 and 1991
when Parker, as part of a German-based gang, organized couriers to
fly to Bangkok, pick up heroin and take it to Sydney where it was
to be passed on to another accomplice for sale.
	   In most cases he recruited the couriers, supplied them with
tickets and money and drove them to the Frankfurt airport.
	   In the first hearing in 1992, a magistrate refused to extradite
Parker on the basis of the allegations provided in the original
warrant.
	   Nearly five years later, after German authorities had provided
more details, a second magistrate ordered Parker extradited.
	   Parker appealed to the Federal Court and won a reprieve. Judge
Peter Heerey found that, contrary to the 1987 Extradition Treaty
between Australia and Germany, German authorities failed to provide
all the required information about his identity and nationality.
	   On Thursday, three Federal Court judges found the treaty did not
give the magistrate jurisdiction to consider whether the
extradition request contained all available information.
	   Hodgman said the case raised ``very technical'' questions of
jurisdiction for the High Court to decide.
	   He said Parker, a Hobart businessman, was adamant that he was
innocent of the charges.

Hanson: Figures faked to cover Australia's ``Asianization''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment by demographer grafs 8-9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist leader Pauline
Hanson on Thursday accused the government of falsifying official
immigration figures to cover up the ``Asianization'' of Australia.
	   ``Our leaders are deceiving the Australian public by not
disclosing the true figures,'' the leader of the One Nation party
told Channel 9 TV.
	   One Nation immigration spokeswoman Robyn Spencer said the real
annual immigration figures for Australia were 159,000, not the
85,000 quoted in government figures.
	   ``The government figures do not include many categories. They
don't include New Zealanders for instance; just two years ago we
had 25,000 of those,'' Spencer said.
	   One Nation also said 70 percent of Australia's migrant intake
was Asian.
	   Quoting a leading Canberra demographer, Dr. Charles Price,
Hanson said Australia would be 27 percent Asian in 25 years.
	   ``Dr. Price estimated Australia would have 27 percent Asian
(population) in 23 to 25 years and we are talking about it because
we want to have a right to protect our ethnicity and racial culture
here,'' Hanson said.
	   However, Price, who heads the Australian Immigration Research
Center, said government figures provided by the Immigration
Department were not lies and certainly not a ``sham'' as claimed by
Hanson.
	   Price said he did not know where Hanson had got her figures on
immigration: ``I just don't remember this,'' he said.
	   Australian Bureau of Statistics projections show that by 2030 to
2040, the total percentage of all Australians of Asian ethnicity
would be 7 percent, figures Spencer described as a total sham.
	   ``As soon as (illegal migrants) get to the airport they destroy
their passports, any identification whatsoever, claim refugee
status, and they are extras here in Australia,'' she said.
	   Hanson said 500 Asian immigrants came through Sydney Airport
alone every week.
	   ``Security people at airports tell me they are pulling up
illegal immigrants all the time and Immigration Minister Philip
Ruddock knows this is going on,'' she said.
	   Hanson said she was not against Asians coming to Australia.
	   ``I had an Asian girl who worked in my (fish and chips) shop for
four months who was absolutely wonderful, and I have Asian
friends,'' she said.
	   ``But do you think that people who have come here from Poland,
England, Germany, want to come out to a country that's been
Asianized? They would have gone to Asia if they wanted this.''
	   Speaking on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio, Hanson declared
her immigration policy was non-discriminatory but said existing
arrangements had got ``out of whack'' with the blowout in Asian
arrivals in the period 1984-1995.
	   She said people were not comfortable with the current situation
as existed in places such as Cabramatta in Sydney and Surfers
Paradise, Queensland, where signs in Asian languages abounded.
	   ``Between 1984 and 1995, of all the immigrants coming to
Australia, 40 percent were Asian.
	   ``All I have ever said is that I want the balance restored.
Asians have and always will have a presence in Australia but there
must be a balance there.''
	   Hanson said many Australians felt very uncomfortable in
neighborhoods where the Asian presence was most noticeable.
	   ``The place I have in mind is Cabramatta because a lot of people
feel unsafe. They don't want to go there; they can't read the signs
on the shops; they don't know whether they are walking into a
butcher or hairdresser,'' she said.
	   ``Surfers Paradise is another example. A lot of Australian
tourists from down south, even Melbourne, have said they will not
go back to Surfers Paradise again because they feel like they are a
foreigner in their own land.''

China trip yields little business accomplishments for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-China &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 14th graf to CORRECT 2nd reference, Jiang not Zemin. &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By WALTER R. MEARS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ For U.S. President Bill Clinton, it was
all business _ but business is not all good.
	   Not with the U.S. trade deficit with China heading upward, and
with no real progress to report in reversing it.
	   Clinton made his business rounds Wednesday at the American
chamber of commerce, on the arena-size floor of the Shanghai stock
exchange and with a personal look at a homeowner's apartment in a
Chinese real estate development.
	   All cordial and complimentary, but with acknowledgments of the
problems lurking behind the diplomatic niceties.
	   Clinton said he was disappointed at the lack of headway made
toward easing the trade barriers that limit U.S. access to China's
markets and add to the increasing trade deficit.
	   That problem will be waiting for Clinton after he gets home on
the Fourth of July, a debating point for congressional opponents of
renewing normal trade relations with China. Critics contend that in
trade and on other issues, the White House policy of engagement
means yielding to what China wants.
	   Still, Clinton and his team put the best face they could on what
they couldn't get. U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley said he
hoped the summit had moved the Chinese closer to market-opening
steps that would lead to Beijing's admission to the World Trade
Organization, which deals with trade relations and rules on trade
disputes.
	   Nothing specific, though.
	   ``As far as concrete steps that have been taken in the last five
days, no,'' said Daley, who warned of a political backlash in the
United States over the increasing trade imbalance.
	   Commerce and trade were Clinton's issues of the day in booming,
if overbuilt, Shanghai, after summit sessions with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in Beijing where the two agreed only to keep
discussing their trade differences. The next round of negotiations
is slated for Geneva the week of July 20.
	   By U.S. estimate, the annual trade deficit is dlrs 50 billion
and going up, perhaps to dlrs 60 billion when the 1998 numbers are
final. The Chinese say that is far overstated because exports
flowing through Hong Kong aren't counted as offsets to U.S. imports
directly from China.
	   Either way, Daley said, ``The bottom line is, our exports have
not grown anywhere near the degree that their exports to the United
States have.''
	   ``The trade deficit is up somewhere around 13 or 14 percent,''
said Alan Turley, the U.S. delegation trade specialist. ``By both
our figures, it's increased.''
	   Before Clinton came to China, the administration had talked
pessimistically about trade-opening efforts. The results have
matched those low expectations.
	   For China to take a seat in the World Trade Organization, which
Clinton said he and Jiang want, the Chinese would have to erase an
array of regulations, protectionist measures and other restrictions
they deem essential to the development of their still-infant market
economy.
	   Clinton said they are entitled to leeway, time to phase in more
open trade rules. However, Daley said, ``The offers that have been
put forward just aren't sufficient at this point to allow us to
move forward.''
	   At post-Cold War summits, leaders usually boast of the business
deals they've made. That was muted this time. There were seven
commercial agreements, although dollar numbers came only from
Chinese officials, who said there were seven contracts valued at
about dlrs 1.9 billion. But dlrs 800 million of that represented
the confirmation of jetliner contracts with the Boeing Co. signed
at the last summit.
	   Turley wasn't putting a dollar value on the latest deals. ``I
think we're trying to get away from giving a number on this,'' he
said, because the contracts may prove to be worth much more than
their face values.
	   Of course they also could prove to be worth less.
	   Either way, they would hardly dent the trade deficit. But Daley
said there could be much more ahead as China builds bridges, power
plants, roads, airports.
	   There are estimates China will spend dlrs 375 billion on such
projects over three years, and far more in the future. By
comparison, the gigantic U.S. roads and public works bill just
signed by Clinton is for dlrs 203 billion over five years.
	   In the face of international competition for the
infrastructure-building contracts, the administration wants a piece
of that Chinese public works action. Daley will lead a U.S. mission
to China early in 1999, seeking opportunities for U.S. businesses.

Survey: Australian business confidence falls in June quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian business conditions and
confidence fell dramatically in the June quarter as the Asian
crisis continued to sap the domestic economy, according to a
leading quarterly business survey.
	   The National Australia Bank survey found the business confidence
index fell to minus 12.8 percent in the June quarter from 0.6
percent in the March quarter while the business conditions index
dropped to minus 6 percent from four percent.
	   NAB chief economist Alan Oster said as Asia was more clearly
impacting the Australian economy, the bank had revised down its
domestic economic growth forecasts for 1998-1999.
	   The survey found the most marked weakening in the June quarter
was in wholesaling, manufacturing and property services.
	   ``This would be consistent with the Asian crisis having a large
impact on the domestic economy _ both directly through its impact
on mining, manufacturing and tourism and indirectly through
confidence related effects on wholesaling and (albeit to a lesser
extent at this stage) retailing,'' Oster said.
	   The export sector was another hard hit area, with the index
falling to minus 17 percent from minus 14 percent in the March
quarter.
	   The reading for the June quarter was the weakest performance
since the survey had been collected.
	   For the first time in years most sectors in the survey appeared
to be in a weakening trend, he said.
	   Given its expectations of continuing deterioration in world
industrial production, the NAB also anticipates further slides in
commodity prices and hence, the Australian dollar.
	   ``With falling commodity prices and a worsening current account,
there is little up-side for the Australian dollar during the next
year.''

State approves tourism package to fight negative Hanson publicity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Queensland's state government on
Thursday approved a U.S. dlrs 3.1 million (5 million Australian
dollars) tourism rescue package to help offset damage to the
state's international reputation by the rise of the right-wing
populist One Nation party.
	   The success of the right-wing party, which opposes Asian
immigration, in winning 11 of the state's 89 Parliament seats in
the June election was widely reported in Asia and the rest of the
world.
	   The Cabinet approved a package which includes a U.S. dlrs
155,000 (250,000 Australian dollars) visitor hospitality campaign
to encourage Queenslanders to be friendly to tourists.
	   Tourism Minister Bob Gibbs said the campaign was likely to
include bumper stickers with a friendly slogan.
	   ``It's going to be based primarily around the fact that we want
to encourage Queenslanders to say 'G'Day' to people, to shake their
hands, to encourage, particularly our international visitors from
Asian destinations, and let them know that this is a friendly state
to visit,'' Gibbs said.
	   ``We should let them know that the adverse publicity forthcoming
as a result of recent political happenings should not be read to
interpret that we don't (want) people visiting our state. They're
welcome.''
	   The campaign will also include funds for new television and
cinema advertising, to promote the state's five tourism regions,
for rural and regional promotion, and for international campaigns
conducted in co-operation with other tourism marketing bodies, such
as the Australian Tourist Commission.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ With a handshake, David Trimble
and Seamus Mallon have launched a fragile partnership between
Northern Ireland's two largest Protestant and Catholic parties.
	   Trimble, considered a hard-liner when he was elected leader of
the Ulster Unionist Party three years ago, and Mallon, long toiling
in the shadow of his Social Democratic and Labor Party leader John
Hume, will try to guide the Northern Ireland peace agreement to
fruition.
	   They were jointly elected on a 61-27 vote after groundbreaking
debate at Wednesday's opening session of the Belfast Assembly, the
main pillar of April's agreement among eight parties.
	   ``I know in my heart that this is the opportunity for the people
in the north of Ireland once and for all to sort out our
problems,'' Mallon said.
	   But the progress was marred Thursday by police reports that
seven Catholic churches were damaged in overnight arson attacks
throughout Northern Ireland.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas attacked Israeli and
allied positions in southern Lebanon Thursday, wounding four
people. A Lebanese man was killed in Israeli shelling that
followed.
	   The guerrillas attacked 16 positions with rockets and
machine-gun fire in predawn raids, security officials said. Two
Israeli soldiers and two allied South Lebanon Army militiamen were
wounded and flown to Israeli hospitals, the officials said.
	   In Israeli shelling that ensued, a Lebanese man identified as
Abdel-Moneim Sweidan was killed, said the officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   A number of mortar shells fired by the guerrillas landed in the
Arab village of Arab el-Aramshe inside Israel.
	   Arab el-Aramshe lies on the Israeli border with Lebanon, and it
is possible that the shells were aimed at Israeli or SLA positions
inside Lebanon, but overshot their target.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, whose guerrillas are trying to oust Israel and its
allies from the strip in southern Lebanon they occupy.
	   The strongest guerrilla attack took place at Haddatha, 12
kilometers (seven miles) north of the Israeli border.
	   The Lebanese guerrillas briefly captured the Haddatha position,
then retreated after destroying it, the officials said.
	   Israeli helicopters fired rockets at guerrilla hideouts near
Haddatha, Lebanese radio stations said.
	   The occupied zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of
Lebanese territory _ was established by Israel in 1985 to protect
its northern border towns against guerrilla attacks. It is
patrolled by 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.

Tokyo shares finish higher on hopes for banking system, dollar
</HEADLINE>
rises &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices finished higher Thursday
prior to the release of a government rescue plan to stabilize
Japan's banking system. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 108.69 points, or 0.66
percent, closing at 16,471.58 points and rising for the seventh
consecutive session. On Wednesday, the index climbed 532.62 points,
or 3.36 percent.
	   The Nikkei index was up some 340 points early in the session,
but later shed some of its early gains on profit-taking following
recent continued advances.
	   Traders said stock prices eased in the afternoon amid growing
sentiment that the government's plan won't contain previously
unreleased details.
	   Expectations that the deal will boost Japan's weak economy
helped bolster sentiment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for much of
the day.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's governing Liberal Democratic
Party has been studying various proposals for a ``bridge bank''
system to clean up a pile of bad loans in the country's banking
system and keep credit flowing to healthy borrowers.
	   News of the plan has created the impression among investors that
Tokyo was seriously moving to mend its debt-ridden banking system.
Details were to be announced later Thursday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 0.29 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,270.46.
The TOPIX had gained 40.37 points, or 3.18 percent, the previous
day.
	   Major Japanese newspapers also said Thursday that the prime
minister was considering making temporary tax cuts permanent to
boost consumer spending, which also encouraged investors.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar gained ground as players turned
cautious about the contents of the upcoming measures.
	   The dollar bought 139.24 yen, up 1.00 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and also higher than its late New York rate of 138.07 yen
overnight.
	   The dollar's relative strength in relation to the Japanese
currency also helped the U.S. currency gain against the German
mark, traders said. The mark was boosted by renewed worries over
Russia's economy and diminishing prospects for a rise in interest
rates in Germany.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.300 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.380 percent, driving its price up to 111.20 yen from 110.62 yen.

Cuban experts worry about tourism increasing spread of AIDS

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Inez Maria Trujillo talks softly and massages the
feet of her AIDS-stricken granddaughter Norma Diaz while they sit
in lawn chairs at a sanitarium on the outskirts of Havana.
	   Diaz, 35, used to visit her family home on weekends, but is too
sick now. Her grandmother says death is drawing near.
	   ``Every day I fear it will be the day that I lose my baby,''
Trujillo whispers as Diaz sits listlessly, seemingly hearing
nothing, with an intravenous drip attached to her skeletal, white
arm.
	   In the last stages of the disease, Diaz is receiving medical
care, extra food rations and a comfortable place to stay where her
family can visit constantly, Trujillo said.
	   ``In other countries people can't afford this kind of treatment,
sometimes they have to live on the street,'' she said. ``Here, the
state takes care of everything.''
	   Four years ago, the communist island ended a controversial
policy that kept HIV-positive patients in perpetual quarantine.
Though there has been no talk of reinstating the policy, Cuban
medical specialists offer no apologies for it.
	   Instead, they credit the policy for one of the lowest AIDS rates
in the world at a time when many fear that a growing number of
tourists could spread the virus in Cuba, long isolated by a
three-decade U.S. embargo.
	   ``We get about a million tourists a year. Before it was 60,000
or 70,000 people,'' said Dr. Jorge Perez, director of the country's
first AIDS sanitarium, where Diaz lives. ``There is a danger.''
	   That danger was not so great in 1986, when Cuba's sanitarium
program was established. Until 1993, people with AIDS were
prohibited from leaving the clinics because of fears they would
spread the disease.
	   The World Health Organization and the Pan American Health
Organization harshly criticized the policy, saying that limiting
patients' movements violated their rights.
	   A 1988 study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that
at the time, Cuba and the Soviet Union had among the toughest laws
to fight AIDS. Then, about 150 HIV-positive Cubans were kept at the
sanitariums.
	   ``The policy was much more rigorous at first, but we didn't know
that much about the disease,'' Perez acknowledged in an interview
at the facility, where white one-story bungalows with concrete
porches are scattered across a sprawling lawn. ``We have learned
much since then.''
	   At the 12th World AIDS Congress in Geneva earlier this week,
Perez credited Cuba's health care system with helping people
survive many years after testing HIV-positive.
	   Of the 99 HIV cases detected in 1986, the first year the
infection was seen in Cuba, 41 patients remain alive, Perez told
Prensa Latina, the official Cuban news service.
	   Beginning in 1993, patients considered to be ``socially
responsible'' were allowed to move out of the sanitariums and
receive outpatient care.
	   The government evidently still reserves the right to keep
certain patients on the premises, especially during the six months
after they are diagnosed as HIV-positive.
	   After the quarantine policy changed, about 85 percent of the
patients opted to remain at the 13 sanitariums nationwide, where
they receive regular meals with extra helpings during a period of
severe economic crisis. Most who stayed were granted weekend home
visits, Perez said.
	   Today, the government says that only 1,980 people have tested
HIV-positive in this country of 11 million, or about 1 in 5,500. Of
those, 727 now have AIDS and 532 have died from the disease.
	   In contrast, figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention indicate between 400,000 and 650,000 Americans are
infected with the virus _ roughly 1 in 550 in the population of 270
million.
	   Cuba's government is even working on a vaccine prototype, and
last year began trials on 24 young scientists involved in the
research project. The prototype was produced by synthetic methods,
using genetic information from the virus, and reportedly poses no
danger to the volunteers.
	   Trial results may not be known for years.
	   Meanwhile, government education programs emphasize the use of
condoms, which remain in short supply for the general public.
	   The island's thousands of prostitutes, who cater to the growing
number of foreign tourists, buy their condoms at dollar stores and
reportedly require their clients to use two or even three at a
time.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian political leaders
are trying to find common ground with Kosovo's separatist fighters,
well aware that their influence is diminishing while support for
the guerillas grows.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the
Kosovo Liberation Army. But they did agree to meet again Sunday to
try to meld the guerilla struggle with their nonviolent
independence campaign.
	   In an indication of how compelling the need to enlist the
guerrillas has become, Ibrahim Rugova, the leader supported by most
of Kosovo's Albanians, also participated in the meeting.
	   Until now, Rugova had refused to cooperate with the armed
insurgents, preaching nonviolence as the only way to achieve
independence for the Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of the population.
	   Meanwhile, U.S. diplomats are making what State Department
spokesman James Rubin calls a ``full-court press'' to try to
prevent the outbreak of a more general war.
	   Backing off its demand for an immediate pullback of Serb forces
in Kosovo, the U.S. government said Wednesday there probably will
have to be a cease-fire before Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic withdraws the special units that have cracked down on
Albanian militants and civilians.
	   The shift, signaled by Rubin, was Washington's second major move
in the past week to try to revitalize its diplomatic approach to
the Kosovo conflict.
	   The other step was opening talks with armed Albanian insurgents
who had been denounced previously as acting like terrorists. The
contacts are expected to intensify next week when U.S. mediator
Robert Gelbard goes to Europe for a meeting with German, British,
French, Russian and Italian diplomats in Bonn on Wednesday.
	   In the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, Zivorad Igic, an aide to
Milosevic, criticized U.S. contact with the guerrillas as
``legalization of terrorism.'' Serbia is the dominant of the two
republics making up what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   The Pristina talks came as hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo to stave off rapid advances by Serbian
security forces in Kosovo's west.
	   Police said the rebels moved west to the Drenica region after
Serbian forces recaptured the area surrounding a strategic coal
mine from the KLA on Tuesday. Reporters at Belacevac and Hade, two
towns a few hundred meters (yards) from the coal mine, saw the
Serbs in control Wednesday with no signs of fighting.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the province's
ethnic Albanian leadership, said three fighters and two civilians
were killed.
	   Also Wednesday, U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke said that
international observers could begin making symbolic patrols of the
tense Kosovo province of Yugoslavia as early as this week.
	   ``The goal of the observer missions is to demonstrate an
international presence fast in the area, which may help calm things
down,'' Holbrooke said in Oslo, Norway.
	   International officials fear the ethnic Albanians' fight for
independence could erupt into bloodshed throughout the region.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Patches of black, sticky oil covered

mid-ocean. But a lot of oil has got to the beach and will cause
serious damage to the reef,'' said Dhanapala Weerasekera, chairman
of Sri Lanka's Marine Pollution Prevention Authority. He said a
major cleanup was planned with the help of private companies.
	   Salvage officials said the oil had stopped spreading by
Thursday, after covering an area at least seven kilometers (4.3
miles) across.
	   ``We have got the situation under control,'' said Ariyaseela
Wickramanayake, chief executive of Master Divers Limited, the
salvage company handling the cleanup.
	   The government did not issue any special order closing Colombo's
beaches because the coastline already was off limits to civilians
for security reasons stemming from the civil war with Tamil
guerrillas.
	   About 70-100 tons of crude oil spilled on Tuesday when a
pipeline burst at an oil unloading buoy seven kilometers (4.3
miles) from shore.
	   The crew of the Iranian tanker MV Theotakas, which was unloading
86,000 tons of oil at the time, stopped pumping after noticing the
leak.
	   The pipeline, through which the state-run Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation brings in all the country's oil, was repaired on
Wednesday, said Wickramanayake. Sri Lanka imports all its oil from
the Middle East.
	   Weerasekera said an emergency response vessel which should have
been on standby was instead being used as a tugboat at the
pipeline, and so was not equipped with chemicals which could have
been used immediately to break up the oil slick.

Tight-fisted Malaysia now looking to spend way to recovery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Unable to curb its currency's
slide or its economy's tumble with tight-fisted policies, Malaysia
now intends to spend its way to recovery.
	   Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim, announcing a 5 billion ringgit
(dlrs 1.2 billion) stimulus package to revive stalled projects,
said Wednesday the government had to intervene.
	   The package marks a retreat from the tight spending and credit
squeeze monetary authorities had insisted were needed to stabilize
the ringgit and cap inflation. It comes on the heels of a 7 billion
ringgit (dlrs 1.75 billion) government spending package.
	   ``The economy has to recover and if it takes the government to
provide the necessary stimulus, then we will have to do it,'' Anwar
said.
	   Alarms went off in Malaysia after the economy appeared to be
careening into recession. It shrank by 1.8 percent in this year's
first quarter, compared with 6.9 percent growth in the previous
quarter.
	   ``Everyone is having a rethink about the strategy for
recovery,'' said Abdul Razak Baginda, executive director of the
independent Malaysian Strategic Research Center.
	   ``The whole thing about everything being dependent on a painful
process is not working.''
	   Despite tight monetary policies _ high interest rates and
lending curbs _ the ringgit fell to 4 to the dollar this week. It
has depreciated nearly 40 percent in the last year and the stock
market is still bleeding.
	   Wednesday's package was ``initial funding'' to revive abandoned
civic works schemes, Kuala Lumpur's monorail and other ``critical
infrastructure projects,'' Anwar said. The projects were mostly
jettisoned in an austerity drive in December that forced widespread
cuts in government spending.
	   Even before Malaysia's economy went into a tailspin, independent
economists warned the nation could ill afford extravaganzas such as
a new high-tech administrative township called Putrajaya and the
monorail.
	   Analysts now say the money would generate business for some of
the construction companies teetering on the verge of bankruptcy.
	   ``Many (companies) which didn't get funds (from banks) will get
government loans,'' said Kanika Singh, an economist with
Independent Economic Analysis, a Singapore-based research company.
	   While Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia gave up their options
by going to the International Monetary Fund, Malaysia is still free
to chart its own course to recovery, said Abdul Razak. ``Malaysia
is adopting a trial-and-error method.''
	   The turnaround is a political victory for Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, who has railed against the IMF-style policies
that Anwar was backing.
	   The differences caused a rift between Mahathir and the Finance
Ministry. A deadlock was broken when Anwar altered his rhetoric to
support his boss' prescription of lower interest rates and softer
lending.
	   While Malaysia's central bank had appeared to heed international
advice on keeping a tight monetary policy, Mahathir differed. He
accused the IMF of triggering the Indonesian turmoil and the West
of plotting to overthrow him and recolonize Malaysia.
	   This week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, on a
whistle-stop Asian tour, warned Malaysia against easing its strict
monetary policy.
	   ``If you have a looser monetary policy, you'd run the risk of
substantial depreciation of the currency,'' he said.
	   Indications of the policy turnaround came last week when
Mahathir appointed Daim Zainuddin, a long-time confidant, as a
Cabinet-level minister to supervise recovery. Daim has backed
Mahathir on relaxing monetary rules.
	   The latest moves were ``a precursor to looser monetary
policies,'' said Singh.
	   By cutting the reserves that banks were required to maintain
from 10 percent to 8 percent last week, the central bank has
increased the money available for commercial lending.
	   But many banks, weighed down by bad debts, would still be wary
of lending, Singh predicted. That would force the central bank to
make it even easier to borrow, she said.

Deposed co-premier gets warm welcome in Phnom Penh market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Ranariddh urging Khmer Rouge,
political violence trials; Hun Sen relaxing with World Cup.
CORRECTS number of assembly seats, 5th graf &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia-Elections-World Cup &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh said
Thursday that Khmer Rouge leaders should be tried for the genocide
they carried out two decades ago, and perpetrators of more recent
political killings should also be tracked down.
	   Ranariddh brought his election campaign to a Phnom Penh market
suffering hard times since he was deposed as co-prime minister in a
coup last year. The man who ousted him, Hun Sen, relaxed at home
and said he preferred to watch soccer's World Cup.
	   Hun Sen is considered the front-runner in a July 26 vote that
critics say he has stacked in his favor through violence, fear and
packing electoral bodies with his supporters.
	   Ranariddh, the son of popular King Norodom Sihanouk, is his
biggest challenger and has been crisscrossing the country to meet
enthusiastic crowds.
	   Hun Sen has stayed on the sidelines, content to let some 40
parties challenging his Cambodian People's Party for 122 National
Assembly seats weaken each other.
	   The prince said that Cambodia would not be able to put behind
its bloody past unless surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge, which
caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people between 1975 and
1979, are put on trial.
	   ``I think we must form an international court as soon as
possible,'' Ranariddh said. ``We must try the Khmer Rouge leaders
for our history and our people.''
	   Longtime Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in April, but a few of
his die-hard lieutenants and a dwindling band of guerrillas remain
at large near the border with Thailand.
	   Hun Sen has vowed to capture them but also has been criticized
for pardoning several top members as part of peace deals.
Ranariddh, then co-premier, endorsed one of the pardons in 1996 for
one of the most notorious leaders, Ieng Sary.
	   Tensions between the premiers, fueled by attempts to woo
defecting Khmer Rouge guerrillas to their own military camps,
exploded in last year's coup.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to win back international
legitimacy and aid lost after the takeover, but has ignored appeals
to investigate killings of at least 90 supporters of the prince's
FUNCINPEC party.
	   ``The new government must find those killings of FUNCINPEC
members after the coup and those responsible for the killings that
still continue now,'' Ranariddh said.
	   A U.N. human rights report Wednesday said that 104 alleged cases
of violence and intimidation, including four killings that appear
to be political, have been reported since mid-May.
	   Hun Sen told reporters at his home outside Phnom Penh that he
prefers watching the World Cup to campaigning and picked Brazil as
his favorite to win.
	   Should he lose the elections, Hun Sen said, he would turn over
power ``in the most peaceful way.''
	   After U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993, he threatened civil war when
Ranariddh finished first, forcing his way into a coalition.
	   On Ranariddh's visit to the market, he was mobbed by hundreds of
vendors and shoppers, and had difficulty maneuvering through the
narrow aisles.
	   ``They hope a new government recognized by the international
community can regenerate not just peace but bring more tourists and
investors to upgrade people's living conditions,'' Ranariddh said.
	   Sales plummeted after the coup and many traders still resent Hun
Sen's government. Hardship was worsened by the economic crisis
striking other Asian countries whose investment Cambodia badly
needs.

Russian border guards expel Japanese fishing boat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards fined and expelled a
Japanese fishing boat that was discovered in Russian waters, a news
report said Thursday.
	   The boat was escorted out by a Russian border patrol ship on
Wednesday evening, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing
border guards command.
	   Japanese fishing boats frequently venture into Russia's waters,
especially around the disputed Kuril Islands, which Russia captured
from Japan at the end of World War II.
	   Russian border guards have often fired at the boats when orders
to stop are not obeyed.

Cambodian leader prefers soccer to election campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAKMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen said
Thursday he favors Brazil to win the World Cup and prefers watching
the soccer tournament to campaigning for elections he is highly
favored to win.
	   ``Now it's time to watch the World Cup,'' Hun Sen joked. ``At
the least, I record it so I can watch the matches later.''
	   Speaking to reporters at his home outside the capital, Phnom
Penh, a relaxed Hun Sen, confident of electoral victory, picked his
favorite for soccer's ultimate prize.
	   ``It may be a little premature to say, but I have strong belief
in Brazil,'' he said. ``Brazil, France, Argentina, and Italy may
advance to the semifinals, and Brazil might have the best chance.''
	   Hun Sen has barely campaigned for the July 26 elections,
preferring to stay on the sidelines. Opponents accuse him of
stacking the election in his favor and using violence and fear to
ensure he wins.
	   Hun Sen hopes the election will restore international legitimacy
and aid lost when he deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, in a bloody power struggle last year.
	   Ready to pick Brazil as soccer champion, Hun Sen was more coy
about predicting outright Thursday who would win the elections _
though he said, ``I don't have any competition.''
	   In the event his Cambodian People's Party loses, he declared
himself ready to hand over power ``in the most peaceful way.''
	   But after U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993, he threatened civil war
when Ranariddh finished first, forcing his way into a tense
coalition that was shattered in last year's takeover.

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas attacked Israeli and
allied Lebanese militia positions across southern Lebanon Thursday,
wounding four people. A Lebanese man was killed in Israeli shelling
that followed.
	   The guerrillas attacked 16 positions with rockets and
machine-gun fire in predawn raids, Lebanese security officials
said. Two Israeli soldiers and two allied South Lebanon Army
militiamen were wounded and flown to Israeli hospitals, the
officials said.
	   In Israeli artillery and mortar shelling that ensued, a Lebanese
man was killed in the village of Yater, said the officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   A number of mortar shells fired by the guerrillas landed inside
Israel, an Israeli military source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. One shell struck the Israeli Arab village of Arab
el-Aramshe, the source said. Six women in the village were treated
for shock.
	   Arab el-Aramshe lies on the Israeli border with Lebanon, and it
is possible that the shells were aimed at Israeli or SLA positions
inside Lebanon, but overshot their target.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, whose guerrillas are trying to oust Israel and its
allies from the strip in southern Lebanon they occupy.
	   The strongest guerrilla attack took place at Haddatha, 12
kilometers (seven miles) north of the Israeli border.
	   The Lebanese guerrillas briefly captured the Haddatha position,
then retreated after destroying it, the Lebanese officials said.
	   Israeli helicopters fired rockets at guerrilla hideouts near
Haddatha, Lebanese radio stations said.
	   The occupied zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of
Lebanese territory _ was established by Israel in 1985 to protect
its northern border towns against guerrilla attacks. It is
patrolled by 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.

Indonesia government preparing bill to limit demonstrations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government is preparing a
``freedom of expression'' bill that would place limits on
demonstrations, the official Antara news agency reported Thursday.
	   The report came as Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years
has led to almost daily protests and demonstrations.
	   The new bill, expected to be presented to Parliament soon for
approval, would ban demonstrations, rallies or public gatherings at
the state palace, places of worship and military agencies, Antara
said.
	   The report quoted Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah as saying
the new legislation also would require notifying police 24 hours
before a demonstration.
	   ``The maximum number of demonstrators is 100. If they are more
that 100, (they) should obtain written permission from the
police,'' Yosfiah said.
	   The proposed law also would require organizers to report the
location, route, duration and goals of any demonstration, as well
as their addresses.
	   ``In many countries in the world, demonstrations are regulated
by law, even if they are by only a small group,'' Antara quoted
Minister at the State Secretariat Akbar Tanjung as saying.
	   In recent demonstrations, workers and pro-democracy activists in
Jakarta and other big cities have been seeking improved worker
rights, lower food prices and independence for the former
Portuguese colony of East Timor.
	   Student protests for democracy and riots over big price
increases and unemployment helped force President Suharto to quit
after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   The government of new President B.J. Habibie signed a deal last
week with the International Monetary Fund that is expected to clear
the way for the resumption next month of billions of dollars in
aid.

World Cup: Parreira, Queiroz and Milutinovic head coaching list
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Carlos Alberto Parreira, Carlos Queiroz and Bora
Milutinovic are at the top of the list to fill the U.S. soccer
team's vacant head coaching position, the president of the U.S.
Soccer Federation says.
	   Alan Rothenberg called Steve Sampson's resignation as coach
``appropriat'' and said Wednesday he isn't interested in hiring
another American. He said U.S. players who criticized Sampson after
the U.S. was ousted from the World Cup in the first round won't be
fined, as Sampson had announced.
	   Rothenberg had dinner in Paris on Wednesday night with
Milutinovic, the U.S. coach from 1991-95 and the coach of Nigeria
in this year's tournament.
	   ``Bora, Queiroz and Parreira would be the three international
coaches who obviously have the most knowledge of our players, our
structure, the country. There's no question about that,''
Rothenberg said.
	   ``They're on the list automatically. After that, we start
talking with people we know less about. I think the single most
important thing is a record of success. The more exposure that
coach has with the United States and the more facility he has with
the English language, the better.''
	   Rothenberg, whose term as USSF president expires Aug. 23,
intends to hire the next coach before he leaves.
	   Rothenberg said he will not impose any fines against players who
spoke out against Sampson's decisions during the Americans'
last-place finish in the 32-nation field.
	   Last Friday, a day after the tournament-ending loss to
Yugoslavia, Sampson and general manager Tom King said fines against
the veterans would be forthcoming.
	   ``That's off the table,'' Rothenberg said. ``There's no sense
dwelling on the past. I understand some of the things those guys
were going through. I don't condone talking out of turn during the
tournament, but the guys who spoke out have been such important
contributors to our program. On balance, over the years, they've
given a heck of a lot more than whatever may have been a detraction
this time around.''
	   Sampson, the first American-born coach to lead the United States
in the World Cup, got the job in 1995 after Rothenberg fired
Milutinovic, and Parreira and Queiroz turned it down.
	   The decision to consider Milutinovic is somewhat surprising,
given that Rothenberg made the decision to fire him three years
ago.
	   ``He has a unique personality,'' Rothenberg said. ``It's obvious
he's a special coach.''
	   Milutinovic, the only coach to take four nations to the World
Cup's second round, led Mexico during the 1986 tournament and Costa
Rica in 1990. After Rothenberg fired him in 1995, he became
Mexico's coach for the second time, but was fired after World Cup
qualifying last fall.
	   Parreira led Brazil to the 1994 World Cup title, then turned
down Rothenberg's offer and instead took the job as coach of
Fenerbahce in Turkey. He then succeeded Queiroz as coach of the New
York-New Jersey MetroStars in Major League Soccer, quitting in
December to become coach of Saudi Arabia, his fourth World Cup
team. The Saudis fired him after an 0-2 start in the tournament.
	   Queiroz, a former coach of Portugal's national team, has spent
most of 1998 as a technical advisor to the USSF and is writing a
report on the state of soccer in the United States. He turned down
the U.S. job to sign with Sporting Lisbon in 1995, then became
coach of the MetroStars during the 1996 season, only to resign to
go to Grampus Eight in Japan.
	   He agreed last month to take over as coach of the United Arab
Emirates, but also has said he is interested in the U.S. job.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fulfilling a pledge they made when China
regained sovereignty a year ago, democracy advocates returned to
Hong Kong's legislature Thursday, promising to fight for prosperity
and a more representative government.
	   Emphasizing the economic woes brought by the recession gripping
much of Asia, about 80 protesters _ mostly struggling owners of
homes and small businesses _ gathered outside the legislature to
demand lower rents.
	   The new legislature convened as Hong Kong, and the rest of the
world, was taking stock of the territory's first year under Chinese
rule. Chinese President Jiang Zemin presided over Wednesday's
anniversary ceremonies, which were kept modest because of the
recession.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was to arrive later Thursday on the
final stop of his China tour. On his agenda Friday was a meeting
with the head of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, Martin Lee.
	   In a dispute with Britain, China disbanded the last legislature
elected under British rule, and replaced it with an appointed
assembly.
	   As they left the assembly a year ago, Lee and his backers went
to the balcony of the legislature to proclaim that they would
return.
	   ``We will not let down the people of Hong Kong,'' Lee declared
from atop the same balcony Thursday. ``We will do our utmost to
monitor all government policies and actions. We will continue to
work and create a better economic environment and create more
jobs.''
	   However, he said, Hong Kong could not be well-off economically
without being democratic.
	   ``Democracy and a prosperous society are interdependent,'' Lee
said.
	   Inside the chamber, members of the legislature took their oaths
of office one by one. One of their first duties was to elect the
body's president. The two candidates were Rita Fan, head of the
appointed legislature that the pro-democracy group had called a
rubber stamp, and Andrew Wong, head of the last legislature under
British rule.
	   The Democrats are Hong Kong's largest party, and Lee is the de
facto leader of the opposition to Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa in
a system of government based on appointed officials and a powerful
civil service left over from British rule.
	   Despite election rules ensuring a majority for a pro-Beijing
elite, the Democrats won 13 of the legislature's 60 seats. Along
with their allies, they swept the popular vote in the May 24
elections, and together will control a third of the assembly.
	   That gives them little real power. But they argue that a record
turnout was a vote of no confidence in Tung's administration, and
say they intend to use the moral authority from their large popular
vote to press for a more democratic system.
	   Current rules call for only a gradual increase in the number of
legislators elected by direct popular vote.

Security personnel fire warning shots to stop Irianese protesters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security personnel fired warning shots
Thursday to stop stone-throwing protesters demanding independence
for the former Dutch colony of western New Guinea, the official
news agency reported.
	   About 100 pro-independence activists were protesting for the
second day Thursday in Jayapura, the capital of the Indonesian
province of Irian Jaya, said Lt. Col. Hary Risdianto, spokesman of
the local military.
	   The Antara news agency said many shops were closed, and police
and soldiers had been mobilized since the morning to safeguard the
city, 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   It said the warning shots were fired as the protesters clashed
with security personnel in front of the Yasmin Hotel.
	   At least four cars were damaged and one of the drivers was
severely injured in the protests, Antara said.
	   ``It seems that they are inspired by the East Timorese
struggle,'' Risdianto said. ``They demanded independence, and they
plan to occupy the local council building.''
	   Speaking to The Associated Press by telephone, Risdianto could
not confirm the warning shots, but said the situation was under
control.
	   Irian Jaya was taken over by Indonesia in 1963. Most of its 1.5
million people are Melanesian and many still follow traditional
village lifestyles. Many are Christian in predominantly Muslim
Indonesia.
	   A small rebel group called the Free West Papua Movement has been
fighting a guerrilla war since then. Last week, it was reported to
have killed three settlers in an ambush outside Jayapura.
	   Tens of thousands of settlers, known as transmigrants, from
crowded parts of Indonesia have moved to the largely underdeveloped
province, triggering discontent.
	   Irian Jaya is one of three Indonesian provinces where native
people are struggling for independent states.
	   The other two are the former Portuguese colony of East Timor and
Aceh, a predominantly Muslim province on the northern tip of
Sumatra.

Bomb explodes in Tibet's capital, group reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A bomb exploded in Tibet's capital on the eve of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China, but it was not known
if there were any casualties, a monitoring group reported Thursday.
	   The bombing was the first in the Chinese-ruled Himalayan region
in 18 months and may signal renewed efforts by militant Tibetans to
resume separatist attacks despite appeals for non-violence by the
Dalai Lama, the exiled leader of Tibet.
	   The explosion occurred between 10 and 11 p.m. June 24 near the
Public Security Bureau building in Lhasa, the London-based Tibet
Information Network reported in a statement.
	   The blast blew out windows in buildings south of the police
headquarters, and police closed streets in the northern Lhasa
neighborhood until the next morning, the group said. It added that
unconfirmed reports put the number injured at three or four.
	   Dan Zeng, a Lhasa police spokesman, and a government spokesman
who gave his name as Mr. Wang said in telephone interviews they
were not clear about what happened and refused to provide
information. A worker at the Silver Bridge Hotel near the site of
the bombing said there was an ``incident'' on June 24 but could not
provide details.
	   It was not known who was responsible for the blast, and casualty
and damage reports were impossible to confirm, said the monitoring
group. It also could not be determined whether the bombing was
timed to coincide with Clinton's trip.
	   Clinton had promised to press Chinese leaders on Tibet. In his
discussions Saturday with President Jiang Zemin in Beijing, the
U.S. president urged China to reopen negotiations with the Dalai
Lama. In response, Jiang told reporters the Dalai Lama must first
recognize Beijing as Tibet's sovereign.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang reiterated
Jiang's conditions Thursday, apparently rejecting a statement by
the Dalai Lama's spokesman in India Monday saying the Tibetans were
ready for talks.
	   The Dalai Lama has condemned violent tactics to protest Chinese
rule and has said he seeks autonomy for Tibet, not independence.
The bombings and a hunger strike by exiled Tibetans in the Indian
capital of New Delhi indicate some pro-independence Tibetans have
begun to question the Dalai Lama's moderate approach.
	   At least four bombs went off in Lhasa in 1996. The last one, on
Dec. 25, injured five people and damaged government buildings.
	   The Chinese government condemned those bombings as terrorist
acts by followers of the Dalai Lama.
	   Chinese soldiers seized Tibet in 1950, the year after the
Communists took power in China. After an abortive uprising in 1959,
the Dalai Lama led more than 100,000 Tibetans into exile.

Rights group: 2,000 in Iraqi prisons for nearly 20 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Iraqi government has detained 2,000
Kurds and Shiite Muslims for nearly two decades without charges or
trial, an Iraqi human rights group said Thursday.
	   President Saddam Hussein was believed to have ordered the arrest
of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Shiites months before the Iraq-Iran
War began in September 1980, accusing them of being of Iranian
origin. The group said they have been held since then in
underground cells in the Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad.
	   ``Hundreds of our citizens who were rounded up in the early
1980s are still alive,'' the London-based Center for Human Rights
of the Iraqi Communist Party said in a statement.
	   There was no way to confirm the report, but a committee set up
in London by the detainees' families has long pressed their case,
even taking it up with U.N. investigators.
	   The statement carried the names of 60 prisoners and said a more
complete list would be handed over to Max van der Stoel, a former
Dutch foreign minister who heads a U.N. human rights commission
investigating charges against the Iraqi government.
	   Most of these detainees are threatened by malnutrition, chronic
disease and mistreatment, the group said.
	   Saddam deported nearly 270,000 Iraqis before the war with Iran,
saying they were of Iranian origin and might act as a fifth column.
But about 15,000 Shiite and Kurdish men of draft age were detained
rather than expelled from the country, said Kaw Rashid, a spokesman
for the group said by telephone from London.
	   Shiite Muslims and Kurds are a majority of Iraq's 22 million
people, but the government is largely made up of members of the
mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.

Finance minister: Malaysia's third-largest bank safe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's finance minister said
Thursday that worries about Malaysia's third-largest bank were
unfounded, at least for now.
	   Bank Bumiputra would not require government funds to prop it up,
said the minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``There is nothing that should be (cause) of undue concern,'' he
told reporters when asked whether the government-owned bank's
report for the latest fiscal year, due out soon, would show heavy
losses.
	   Anwar, who is also the deputy prime minister, said the bank may
require a capital injection if ``things haven't actually
improved.''
	   In early March, the central bank said Bank Bumiputra could be in
trouble and might require about 750 million ringgit (dlrs 183
million) to keep it in operation.
	   The central bank did not give details of the troubles, but like
many other Malaysian banks, Bank Bumiputra is believed to be
burdened by bad loans.
	   Analysts have projected that the non-performing loans in the
Malaysian banking system will hit 20 to 25 percent of total lending
by the end of the year.

Tajikistan troops crack down on suspected gangs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops pressed ahead with
a hunt for renegade fighters suspected of killings, kidnappings and
robberies on the outskirts of capital Dushanbe, officials said
Thursday.
	   Several guerrillas were killed and 15 were arrested during raids
Wednesday, government officials and the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. Two government troops were killed and six were wounded,
the reports added.
	   The group of some 100 renegade fighters previously supported
rebel warlord Rezvon Sadirov, who was killed last year, the Tajik
Interior Ministry said.
	   Sadirov opposed Tajikistan's peace settlement and was accused of
several hostage-takings and bombings in this impoverished Central
Asian nation before his death at the hands of government forces.
	   His supporters recently gathered in the village of Tezgar, some
20 kilometers (32 miles) southeast of Dushanbe, and carried out
raids on nearby settlements from there, Interior Ministry officials
said.
	   In a separate development Thursday, 152 former rebel fighters
returned to Tajikistan from neighboring Afghanistan, under an
agreement worked out by the Tajik National Reconciliation
Commission. The commission includes members of the hard-line
government as well as the former rebels.
	   Another group of 259 former rebels is expected to come home
later this week, the press service of the Russian border guards in
Tajikistan announced.
	   The government and main opposition group signed a peace
agreement in 1997, ending a five-year civil war in this former
Soviet republic.
	   Sporadic clashes have continued since then, but the government
has given amnesty to some rebels and brought others into the
cabinet.

All Blacks still favorites says Macqueen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby coach Rod Macqueen
has described suggestions that his team would start favorite
against the All Blacks on July 11 as ``ludicrous.''
	   Australia has won its three opening tests of the international
season while New Zealand won its two tests against England.
	   The All Blacks were disappointed with a 40-10 last start victory
over England while Australia was likewise downbeat after its second
test win against Scotland.
	   The two rivals open the tri-nations series, also including South
Africa, at the MCG.
	   New Zealand has lost veteran captain Sean Fitzpatrick, loose
forward Zinzan Brooke and center Frank Bunce while wing star Jonah
Lomu is out of form and expected to miss the match.
	   But Macqueen, whose team started the season with a record 76-0
win over England, does not consider the All Blacks underdogs.
	   ``The All Blacks are going to be a well prepared professional
side, whilst we have been reasonably happy with our preparation we
know we are going to have to step up a gear if we're going to be
successful,'' Macqueen said.
	   ``The reality is they have won the last two tri-nations, the
reality is we haven't beaten them since 1994, the reality is their
provincial sides have won the last three Super 12s and they have
three players who have retired.
	   ``From our perspective we have eight new players from last year
and whilst we're happy where we are with our preparations, to
suggest the All Blacks are underdogs would certainly be
ludicrous.''
	   Wallabies captain John Eales said that the All Blacks would
remain a formidable outfit.
	   ``We'd be absolutely foolish to think the All Blacks are
anything but the best side in the world,'' Eales said.
	   ``They've had three changes basically from last year ... but the
thing with New Zealand rugby is the depth _ they can take another
guy and there's not that much difference between one guy and the
next.''
	   Macqueen said the MCG test would be the benchmark for the
Wallabies to see how much they had improved this season ``but we
don't want to live or die by one game''.
	   ``We're looking at the long-term future of the side. I'm very
happy with the attitude of the players in that they are looking to
the future and striving for higher standards,'' Macqueen said.

Chaos at airport caused by faulty computer lines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chaos and long waits continued for
a third day at Malaysia's high-tech new airport as faulty phone
lines were identified Thursday as the cause of system failures.
	   Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said contractors had not
installed communication lines properly at the dlrs 2.3 billion
Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
	   Ling did not predict any immediate relief.
	   ``We expect the instability in the lines of communication to
happen again but it will be less and less as we go along,'' Bernama
news agency quoted him as saying.
	   Technicians worked through the night, but a computer crash
occurred early Thursday, Ling said.
	   Arriving passengers waited up to three hours for their luggage
even though relief staff were called in to manually load baggage
from the tarmac to baggage carriers.
	   Airport staff had to check in passengers manually, filling out
boarding passes with pens. For a 400-passenger jumbo jet, the
process could take up to three hours, Ling said.
	   Departing international and domestic flights continued to be
delayed for several hours. Monitors with flight times, gates and
airport directions flashed on and off throughout the day, officials
said.
	   ``Everything that involves computer lines has been affected,'' a
Malaysian Airlines official said in a telephone call that was
disconnected three times.
	   The airport, touted as the world's biggest and most modern, is
run by a 700 million ringgit (dlrs 175 million) database that links
all operations, from baggage handling to information monitors.
	   The sleek new 10,000-hectare (24,700-acre) airport is designed
to put Malaysia on the international map and help it compete with
Bangkok and Singapore as an international aviation hub.
	   Local papers that aren't usually critical of government projects
are being harsh on the new airport.
	   The New Straits Times, in an editorial, said KLIA should not
have been opened before it was properly tested.
	   ``It's rare for a symbol of national pride to transform itself
to a source of national concern within the short span of two
days,'' it said.
	   Sentiments of national pride for the KLIA have been replaced by
``alarm and embarrassment'' and ``a feeling of grievous shame,'' it
added.

Israeli newspaper publisher sentenced to eight months in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The publisher of the Maariv daily on
Thursday was sentenced to eight months in prison for ordering
wiretaps as part of a circulation war with a rival newspaper.
	   A Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court also imposed a fine of 1,100,600
shekels (dlrs 330,000) on the publisher, Ofer Nimrodi, said courts
spokesman Moshe Gorali.
	   Nimrodi will remain free on bail until he begins serving his
sentence Oct. 1.
	   The maximum penalty for illegal wire-tapping is three years, but
the prosecution agreed to an eight-month sentence as part of a plea
bargain agreement.
	   Nimrodi was convicted of ordering wiretaps on the phones of
senior staffers at the rival Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   In January, the former editor of Yediot Ahronot, Moshe Vardi,
received a two-month suspended sentence in connection with the
wiretapping of Yediot employees suspected of leaking information to
Maariv. Vardi resigned as editor after he was charged in 1996. He
has denied wrongdoing.

WTO: Australia should push ahead with reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1300 GMT July 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Government hesitation over further reform of
Australia's trade policy could cause uncertainty among producers
and consumers and hinder future trade efforts, according to a
review published Thursday.
	   The Australian government appears to have taken a more
interventionist role in encouraging foreign investment, which may
distort the country's trade regime, said the 172-page World Trade
Organization study.
	   ``There is a need for continued reform to address unnecessary
regulatory measures and structural rigidities,'' the review said.
	   Efforts launched earlier this decade to open up the Australian
economy have brought lower unemployment and higher productivity
rates, said the report.
	   Reductions in subsidies have followed on from the government's
commitment to reduce the country's budget deficit. Reform of
Australia's trade tariff structure and privatization of service
industries have stimulated exports and improved business
competitiveness.
	   In particular, government-run businesses are now subject to the
same rules as private enterprises.
	   But traditional industries continue to be relatively heavily
protected, including textiles, clothing and vehicle manufacturing.
	   Unemployment remains high at more than 8 percent. ``It is
crucial that the trade and structural reform process be continued
and completed to ensure strong growth in the long run,'' the report
said.
	   The WTO secretariat study was compiled as part of the World
Trade Organization's two-day review of Australia's trading
policies.
	   The Australian government told the WTO in a statement that it
will continue efforts to free up its trade regime.
	   But it said economic uncertainties in East Asia will impact on
Australian exports and economic growth. Australia would need to
guard against resurgence of protectionist measures by other
countries, it added.

Clinton's China visit draws mixed reactions in Asia

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
China highlighted touchy issues across Asia _ perhaps nowhere so
much as in India, which bristled at statements made by the American
leader and host Chinese President Jiang Zemin regarding nuclear
weapons.
	   Clinton was to fly to Hong Kong later Thursday, approaching the
end of a much-publicized visit that has sparked discussion of human
rights, trade policy, tensions on the Korean peninsula and other
hot topics in the region.
	   Clinton and Jiang issued a joint statement Saturday asking India
and Pakistan to make ``firm commitments'' not to deploy nuclear
weapons and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ``immediately
and unconditionally.''
	   India said it would not be dictated to by anyone. The Indian
foreign ministry accused Washington and Beijing of speaking with
the arrogance ``of a bygone era.'' India has been accused of
stepping up the South Asian nuclear arms race with a series of
nuclear tests in May that its longtime rival Pakistan answered by
conducting its own tests.
	   India said it detonated nuclear devices because of security
threats from China and Pakistan, with whom it has fought four wars
in 50 years.
	   India does not need help from the United States to sort out its
long-standing border disputes with China, said Brajesh Mishra,
principal adviser to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
	   The Clinton-Jiang meeting also put the spotlight on Tibet, which
China seized in 1950. The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of
Tibetans who heads a government-in-exile in India, applauded
Clinton for asking China to begin a dialogue on Tibet.
	   But other Tibetans in India announced plans for a demonstration
next week against China and the United States, expressing concern
that Clinton did not press for Tibet's independence and condemning
what they called the Clinton-Jiang plan to establish Chinese
dominance in Asia.
	   In Thailand, a leading newspaper urged the United States to
exert its influence to encourage China to avoid human rights
abuses.
	   ``Let's face it, no country on Earth, perhaps with the exception
of the United States, has the political clout to make a difference
in nudging the world's most populous nation into respecting basic
human rights,'' Bangkok's The Nation newspaper said in an
editorial.
	   In Japan, there was concern China's ties with the United States
were overshadowing Tokyo's close relationship with Washington.
Japanese newspaper editorials referred ominously to ``the new
U.S.-China era'' and ``America and China's new partnership for the
21st Century.''
	   In contrast, South Korea's mass circulation Dong-ah Ilbo
newspaper said in a commentary that improving U.S.-China relations
could have a ``positive impact'' on the Korean Peninsula.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace
treaty. The United States fought on the South Korean side while
China intervened on behalf of North Korea.
	   Four-way talks in Geneva among North and South Korea, the United
States and China to secure a permanent peace broke down in March
with no agreement on future negotiations.
	   Taiwan was dismayed at Clinton's public reiteration that
Washington will not support its entry into the United Nations, seen
as a setback to President Lee Teng-hui's drive for greater
international recognition. But Taipei welcomed Clinton's pledge to
continue arms sales to Taiwan.
	   Australia's Trade Minister Tim Fischer noted Thursday that
Clinton pressed for more open access to China's markets.
	   ``Those who call for improved market access might also,
themselves, provide that market access,'' Fischer said, referring
to Australia's difficulties with U.S. trade quotas on sugar and
other goods.
	   In Indonesia, preoccupied with a stagnant economy and political
uncertainty, recent comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin about Asia's economic future have been getting more attention
than anything Clinton had to say in China.
	   Rubin, on his own Asian tour, told reporters in Bangkok Tuesday
that a recalcitrant U.S. Congress needs to approve dlrs 18 billion
sought by the Clinton administration for the International Monetary
Fund so that it can quickly respond to new outbreaks of economic
upheaval.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese officials headed into a final round of
meetings Thursday to work out the details of a plan to rescue the
country's debt-laden banks and pull Japan out of its worst
recession since World War II.
	   The meetings were expected to last most of the day, but the
Cabinet and prime minister's office had scheduled press conferences
in the evening for their formal announcements.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's governing Liberal Democratic
Party had been studying various proposals for a so-called bridge
bank system to clean up mountains of bad loans in the nation's
banking system and keep credit flowing to healthy borrowers.
	   The bridge bank concept was first used by the U.S. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. in the late 1980s to deal with a spate of
bank failures following the savings and loan debacle.
	   Japan's financial institutions are saddled with 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans left from the collapse in the early
1990s of the ``bubble'' created by rampant stock and real estate
speculation.
	   ___
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Unable to curb its currency's
slide or its economy's tumble with tight-fisted policies, Malaysia
now intends to spend its way to recovery.
	   Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim, announcing a 5 billion ringgit
(dlrs 1.2 billion) stimulus package to revive stalled projects,
said Wednesday the government had to intervene.
	   The package marks a retreat from the tight spending and credit
squeeze monetary authorities had insisted were needed to stabilize
the ringgit and cap inflation. It comes on the heels of a 7 billion
ringgit (dlrs 1.75 billion) government spending package.
	   ``The economy has to recover and if it takes the government to
provide the necessary stimulus, then we will have to do it,'' Anwar
said.
	   Alarms went off in Malaysia after the economy appeared to be
careening into recession. It shrank by 1.8 percent in this year's
first quarter, compared with 6.9 percent growth in the previous
quarter.
	   ``Everyone is having a rethink about the strategy for
recovery,'' said Abdul Razak Baginda, executive director of the
independent Malaysian Strategic Research Center.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Power and Singapore Telecom have
announced tariff cuts in line with the government's promise to help
businesses cope with an economic slowdown.
	   For a one year period beginning July 1, customers will get a 0.3
cent (U.S. cent 0.17) rebate from Singapore Power for every
kilowatt of electricity consumed, the company announced Thursday.
	   The rebates, expected to cost Singapore Power about 81 million
Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 47 million), are given in support of
the government's off-budget package to help the economy, the
company said.
	   Singapore Telecom, meanwhile, from Aug. 1 will reduce by up to
20 percent its international direct dialing rates to seven
countries: Indonesia, Thailand, the Netherlands, France, Italy,
South Korea and Germany. It announced the move Wednesday night.
	   Singapore Telecom's Executive Vice President Lim Toon said that
the cut will allow customers to save about 20 million Singapore
dollars (U.S. dlrs 11.7 million) annually.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Strong sales of electronics helped
Philippine exports rise 22 percent in May from a year earlier to
dlrs 2.42 billion, the government said Thursday.
	   The increase was good news for the country's slowing economy
after a disappointing 9.7 percent export increase in April.
	   Higher interest rates and a weaker peso resulting from the
region's currency crisis have contributed to a recent slowdown in
economic growth, higher unemployment and a swelling government
budget deficit.
	   The National Statistics Office said electronics and components
accounted for 45 percent of the country's exports in May with
shipments of dlrs 1.09 billion, up 22 percent from the year-earlier
level.
	   Garments ranked second, accounting for 8.6 percent, or dlrs
207.2 million, of total May receipts, 9.1 percent more than the
year-earlier level.
	   The United States continued to be the top destination of
Philippine exports, followed by Japan and Singapore.
	   Imports are announced separately by the government each month.
	   The Philippines' trade deficit has narrowed sharply in recent
months, largely because of the damping effect of the region's
financial crisis on the country's economy.
	   In April the trade deficit shrank to dlrs 173 million from dlrs
860 million a year earlier.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' total foreign debt
reached dlrs 45.66 billion at the end of March, less than 1 percent
higher than the dlrs 45.43 billion registered at the end of
December, the central bank said Thursday.
	   The central bank said 58 percent of the country's foreign debt
was denominated in U.S. dollars, while 22 percent was denominated
in Japanese yen.
	   The central bank attributed the rise in foreign debt to
additional borrowings and the depreciation of the yen against the
U.S. dollar.
	   Loans owed to official creditors _ such as the International
Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank _ accounted for 43
percent of the total foreign debt.
	   ___
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian business conditions and
confidence fell dramatically in the June quarter as the Asian
crisis continued to sap the domestic economy, according to a
leading quarterly business survey.
	   The National Australia Bank survey found the business confidence
index fell to minus 12.8 percent in the June quarter from 0.6
percent in the March quarter while the business conditions index
dropped to minus 6 percent from four percent.
	   NAB chief economist Alan Oster said as Asia was more clearly
impacting the Australian economy, the bank had revised down its
domestic economic growth forecasts for 1998/99.
	   The survey found the most marked weakening in the June quarter
was in wholesaling, manufacturing and property services.
	   ``This would be consistent with the Asian crisis having a large
impact on the domestic economy -- both directly through its impact
on mining, manufacturing and tourism and indirectly through
confidence related effects on wholesaling and (albeit to a lesser
extent at this stage) retailing,'' Oster said.
	   The reading for the June quarter was the weakest performance
since the survey had been collected.
	   ___
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian exporters should divert
their products to markets other than Asia to reduce the impact of
the regional economic crisis on the domestic economy, a forecasting
group said Thursday.
	   The alternative would be a lower exchange rate, higher inflation
and higher interest rates accompanied by the possible downgrading
in Australia's international credit rating, the South Australian
Center for Economic Studies warned.
	   Any general recovery in Asia was likely to take several years
and exporters should look towards markets in Europe, the United
States and Latin America for increased trade, the center said in
its latest regular briefing paper.
	   ``With Japan now in recession, Hong Kong very wobbly and
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia likely to suffer sharply reduced
growth for two or three years, demand from these countries for
(Australian) products will remain weak for the foreseeable
future,'' the center said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index climbed for
the seventh consecutive session Thursday on hopes the government
will take aggressive action to deal with Japanese banks' mountain
of bad debts. The U.S. dollar climbed against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 108.69 points, or 0.66
percent, closing at 16,471.58. The market's main barometer now has
climbed a total of 1,516.98 points in seven trading days, including
Wednesday's 532.62-point gain, or 3.36 percent.
	   The index rose as high as 16,743.36 before profit-taking brought
it back down, traders said.
	   Buying enthusiasm also eased toward the close as investors
concluded that an impending announcement of plans to stabilize the
nation's ailing financial system would not contain previously
unreleased details.
	   Still, expectations that the plans would boost Japan's weak
economy encouraged investors for much of the day.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's governing Liberal Democratic
Party has been studying various proposals for a ``bridge bank''
system to clean up bad loans held by the nation's banks and keep
credit flowing to healthy borrowers.
	   Trading was heavy, with an estimated 924 million shares changing
hands on the exchange's first section, up from Wednesday's 876
million. Advances outnumbered retreats 776 to 421, with 95 issues
unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 0.29 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,270.46.
It had gained 40.37 points, or 3.18 percent, the previous day.
	   Also encouraging investors were reports in major Japanese
newspapers that Hashimoto was considering making temporary tax cuts
permanent to boost consumer spending.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 139.18 yen, up 0.94 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 138.07 yen overnight. It ranged between 137.78 yen and 139.48
yen in Thursday's trading.
	   Traders said the dollar strengthened in the afternoon on news
that U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had denied speculation of
possible joint U.S.-Japan currency market intervention to lift the
yen's value.
	   Rubin, speaking Wednesday to reporters traveling with him at the
end of a four-nation Asian tour, said: ``I've never even heard that
as a speculation.''
	   The two nations' central banks had intervened on June 17 after
the dollar hit an eight-year high of 146 yen.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.305 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.380 percent, driving its price up to 111.16 yen from 110.62 yen.

Commission recommends sanctions against Swiss banks

 &UR; By VERENA DOBNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A commission representing hundreds of U.S.
finance officials has cleared the way for sanctions against Swiss
banks suspected of holding the assets of Holocaust victims.
	   Alan Hevesi, chairman of the commission, said negotiations
between the banks and Holocaust survivors seeking their families'
assets ``reached a total stone-like impasse.'' The group decided
Wednesday to lift its moratorium on sanctions against Swiss banks.
	   California will become the first state to impose sanctions.
Treasurer Matt Fong, who oversees dlrs 32 billion in state funds,
said California will not seek new contracts with U.S. subsidiaries
of Swiss banks.
	   New York state, which with California has the largest pension
funds linked to Swiss banks, was to decide Thursday how and when
its sanctions will be imposed, said Hevesi, the comptroller of New
York City.
	   Hevesi said he hopes U.S. officials will allow a measured
process of sanctions to give negotiators time to resolve the
issues. That didn't mollify Swiss banking officials.
	   ``The Swiss banks are outraged,'' said Ulrich Pfister, a
spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. ``Sanctions are
unjustified and counterproductive. We will study all measures we
can take against them.''
	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe. But victims' relatives
say bank officials stonewalled survivors and their heirs after
World War II, claiming they could not find accounts or demanding
nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to relatives of
those who died in concentration camps.
	   Three Swiss banks made a take-it-or-leave-it offer of dlrs 600
million last month. It was rejected by Jewish leaders as being far
less than the dormant wartime assets Holocaust victims say the
banks stole from their families.
	   Melvyn Weiss, lawyer for more than 31,000 plaintiffs in a
class-action against Swiss banks, said Jewish groups have proposed
a dlrs 1.5 billion settlement that would cover claims against all
Swiss banks as well as the Swiss government.
	   ``We tried to get the Swiss government involved and bring peace
between these people. And the Swiss government, instead of being
proactive in helping to put this behind us, has been a negative
influence,'' Weiss said.
	   He and other lawyers representing class-action plaintiffs said
their clients are now likely to turn to a lawsuit pending in
federal court in Brooklyn against the Swiss banks. Last year the
banks filed a motion asking a judge to dismiss the charges, but no
decision has been made.
	   Hevesi heads a group that represents about 800 financial
officers of state and municipal governments around the United
States. The moratorium on sanctions had been in effect since last
December.
	   Robert O'Brien, managing director of Credit Suisse in New York,
spoke on behalf of his bank and the United Bank of Switzerland, a
recent merger of the New York branches of the Swiss Bank Corp. and
Union Bank of Switzerland.
	   ``Our two organizations have done the right thing,'' he said.
``There's no basis for taking action. We are still very actively
concerned about maintaining a dialogue.''
	   He noted that the Swiss banks have publicly apologized for any
wrongdoing, and that they have started a humanitarian fund with an
initial contribution of dlrs 70 million for the immediate needs of
Holocaust victims.
	   He said the banks have also opened their books for full
accounting to an independent commission headed by former Federal
Reserve head Paul Volcker, who is searching bank files to determine
the amount of unclaimed funds.

World Cup: Vieri vs. Zidane in quarterfinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ In a battle of neighboring soccer
giants, the World Cup quarterfinals open Friday with Italy vs.
France and a showdown between top scorer Christian Vieri and star
playmaker Zinedine Zidane.
	   The teams are expected to balance out in tactics and stamina,
leaving it up to individual skills like those possessed by Italy's
Vieri and France's Zidane to break open rock-solid defenses.
	   The winner earns a place in next week's semifinals here at Stade
de France against the Germany-Croatia winner. The losers go home.
	   France is worried that an ankle injury to its top striker,
Thierry Henry, could blunt its attack. Henry has three goals so
far. A decision on his availability will be made just before game
time at 4:30 p.m. (1430 GMT).
	   Italy went through to the final four years ago in the United
States only to lose to Brazil. France last made the quarterfinals
in 1986.
	   In its Mexican run that lasted into the semifinals, France, led
by Michel Platini, coolly disposed of Italy 2-0 in the second
round. It was their last World Cup meeting.
	   Zidane is now France's new Platini. Fresh from a two-game
suspension, he's ready to challenge the Italians with his darting
runs and defense-splitting passes.
	   ``We must control Zidane,'' said Italian coach Cesare Maldini.
Most likely Dino Baggio or Gianluca Pessotto will try to man-mark
Zidane as close as his shadow in the afternoon sun.
	   Vieri, who has scored five goals so far, will not get individual
attention. He will have the whole French defense to contend with.
In four matches French defenders, led by Marcel Desailly and
Laurent Blanc, have conceded one goal _ a penalty.
	   ``We've played against Ronaldo. We've played against many of the
greatest. They don't get special treatment,'' said Blanc.
	   Vieri remains confident. ``I am convinced we can get through,''
he said, adding ``I want to take advantage of this magic moment.''
	   But he also hinted that Italians may not be their usual
formidable self. ``It would be no shame losing against France.''
	   Sharing leadership of the offense with Vieri will be Alessandro
del Piero, the playmaker who is desperately trying to make his mark
on the World Cup.
	   Over the past decade, France has seen a lot of Gallic talent
flocking to the riches and fortunes of the Serie A. Over half of
the French players Friday will have played or are still playing in
Italy.
	   Zidane and captain Didier Deschamps play for Juventus Turin,
Desailly is just at end of a long stint with AC Milan and Youri
Djorkaeff will clash often with his Inter Milan teammate Giuseppe
Bergomi.
	   ``There is a very good mix now and everybody will know one
another on the pitch,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet.
	   France long had an inferiority complex about Italy but valuable
lessons have been learned.
	   ``The French playing in Italy have that fighting spirit. There
is no way we can lose to Italy,'' said midfielder Alain Boghossian,
who will move to Parma next season.
	   ``I have learned how to win,'' said Zidane. ``Italy has changed
me.''
	   And Zidane knows Italy's tactics will try to destabilize him.
After catching the red card for kicking a Saudi opponent, he will
be bent on avoiding further ill discipline.
	   It will be the 31st match between the two teams, with Italy
leading with 17 wins, seven draws and six losses.

 &UR; Japan approves plan to clean up bad debt crisis in nation's banks
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with announcement; RECASTS throughout
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's government on Thursday approved an
ambitious plan to assume control over failed banks and gradually
shut them down, a key component in initiatives to pull this country
out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   The so-called ``bridge bank'' scheme, patterned after the U.S.
bailout of failed savings and loan insitutions in the 1980s, is
designed to prevent bank failures from cutting off credit to
healthy borrowers and driving Japan deeper into economic
stagnation.
	   The plan, approved after a series of top-level meetings
Thursday, calls for government involvement in two-stages over a
maximum of five years to close down failed lenders.
	   Approval was announced by an official of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party. A fuller announcement was expected later
Thursday.
	   Japan's financial institutions are saddled with a staggering 76
trillion yen (dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans left from the collapse
in the early 1990s of the ``bubble'' created by rampant stock and
real estate speculation.

	   In the first stage of the rescue plan, Japan would dispatch

while looking for a buyer.
	   The second stage calls for transforming the most troubled
insitutions from state-run- to state-owned-enterprises operating
under a public bank holding company.
	   Initial reaction to the plan was positive.
	   Stock prices worldwide were bolstered by early reports of the
plan's contents. Tokyo stocks surged and the yen strengthened
against the U.S. dollar in morning trading.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's ruling LDP had been studying

pledged aggressive action to deal with the ailing banks at a
meeting of international finance officials last month.

dangerously low levels.

	   Also adding to the ruling party's sense of urgency is a set of
elections on July 12 for the upper house of Japan's bicameral
Parliament. Scoring points on the economy is seen as critical if
the party is to come out of those elections victorious.
	   To show they are serious about turning the economy around,

	   The government has also said it plans to introduce tax breaks
for bad-loan disposal and to allow banks to package their troubled
loans and sell them as securities.
	   Similar steps in the United Staes were seen as crucial elements
in cleaning up after the savings and loan crisis.

Kosovo leaders plot new course; U.S. presses talks effort
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rugova meeting a Norwegian official Thursday &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian political leaders
are trying to find common ground with Kosovo's separatist fighters,
well aware that their influence is diminishing while support for
the guerrillas grows.
	   But the Kosovo Albanians also are keeping links open with
international officials. Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova was
holding talks Thursday with a Norwegian official in the capital of
the secessionist province. Details were not immediately available.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the
Kosovo Liberation Army. But they did agree to meet again Sunday to
try to meld the guerrilla struggle with their nonviolent
independence campaign.
	   In an indication of how compelling the need to enlist the
guerrillas has become, Rugova, the leader supported by most of
Kosovo's Albanians, also participated in the meeting.
	   Until now, Rugova had refused to cooperate with the armed
insurgents, preaching nonviolence as the only way to achieve
independence for the Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of the population.
	   Meanwhile, U.S. diplomats are making what State Department
spokesman James Rubin calls a ``full-court press'' to try to
prevent the outbreak of a more general war.
	   Backing off its demand for an immediate pullback of Serb forces
in Kosovo, the U.S. government said Wednesday there probably will
have to be a cease-fire before Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic withdraws the special units that have cracked down on
Albanian militants and civilians.
	   The shift, signaled by Rubin, was Washington's second major move
in the past week to try to revitalize its diplomatic approach to
the Kosovo conflict.
	   The other step was opening talks with armed Albanian insurgents
who had been denounced previously as acting like terrorists. The
contacts are expected to intensify next week when U.S. mediator
Robert Gelbard goes to Europe for a meeting with German, British,
French, Russian and Italian diplomats in Bonn on Wednesday.
	   In the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, Zivorad Igic, an aide to
Milosevic, criticized U.S. contact with the guerrillas as
``legalization of terrorism.'' Serbia is the dominant of the two
republics making up what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   The Pristina talks came as hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo to stave off rapid advances by Serbian
security forces in Kosovo's west.
	   Police said the rebels moved west to the Drenica region after
Serbian forces recaptured the area surrounding a strategic coal
mine from the KLA on Tuesday. Reporters at Belacevac and Hade, two
towns a few hundred meters (yards) from the coal mine, saw the
Serbs in control Wednesday with no signs of fighting.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the province's
ethnic Albanian leadership, said three fighters and two civilians
were killed.
	   Also Wednesday, U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke said that
international observers could begin making symbolic patrols of the
tense Kosovo province of Yugoslavia as early as this week.
	   ``The goal of the observer missions is to demonstrate an
international presence fast in the area, which may help calm things
down,'' Holbrooke said in Oslo, Norway.
	   International officials fear the ethnic Albanians' fight for
independence could erupt into bloodshed throughout the region.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule.

World Cup: Denmark's giant-killers take aim at Brazil in
</HEADLINE>
quarterfinals &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ The odds may favor Goliath over David, but
Brazil isn't taking the Danish giant-killers for granted.
	   The defending World Cup champions don't want their favoritism to
work against them when they meet upstart Denmark in the Cup
quarterfinals on Friday.
	   ``Brazil can't beat itself,'' said team coordinator Zico. ``We
can't relax, think we've won before we take the field.''
	   The Danes, with nothing to lose, are happy underdogs in their
first Cup quarterfinal ever.
	   ``Nobody expects Denmark to do anything,'' said forward Brian
Laudrup. ``We like to be in that role. If we were to lose, people
would say we have done magnificently. If we win, it would even be a
bigger sensation.''
	   They've already raised eyebrows by getting this far. After
scraping through the first round with just four points, Denmark
reared up and thrashed favored Nigeria 4-1.
	   Suddenly everyone remembered how Denmark had sneaked up on the
field in the 1992 European Championship. Called in as a last-minute
replacement for Yugoslavia, the Danes knocked off the elite of
European soccer to win the title.
	   Can lightning strike three times?
	   ``We might be able to do it again. You never know,'' said
Laudrup. ``I think we showed the whole football world that we can
play attractive football as well.''
	   Laudrup and his older brother Michael are the key to the
quick-striking Danish attack and will get special attention from
Brazil.
	   ``The Laudrups know how to play football,'' said Brazilian coach
Mario Zagallo. ``They are players of a high technical level that
we'll have to be careful with.''
	   But Zagallo seemed more concerned with keeping his team's rising
confidence under control. Ronaldo and company were gearing up to
face Nigeria, their nemesis in the 1996 Olympics, and playing
Denmark instead could lower their guard.
	   ``Denmark plays and lets play,'' Zagallo warned. ``They're fast,
intelligent, and play with simplicity and efficiency.''
	   Still, he'd like nothing better than to go head-to-head with
Denmark. Chile tried and got stomped 4-1. And Zagallo doesn't think
much of the Danish defense.
	   ``They're dribblable,'' he said. ``They play in line, and that
makes it easier. The striker just has to move on the diagonal and
time his run to not get caught offsides.''
	   In a sign of his confidence, Zagallo for the first time
announced his lineup ahead of time. Brazil will field the same team
that started against Chile, he said.
	   But the team is not entirely trouble-free. Ronaldo complained of
knee pains and skipped practice Tuesday, although he trained
Wednesday and was listed to start.
	   Reports conflicted on the cause of the pain and whether it
hindered Ronaldo's mobility and his explosive standing start. In
practice, he grimaced and put his hand to his knee during wind
sprints.
	   ``He's been playing with the pain for a long time, but that
doesn't affect his production,'' said Zagallo. ``As long as he's on
the field and running with no problem, I see no reason for worry.''
	   Bebeto also remains in the starting lineup, despite growing
pressure to replace him with Denilson. Booed in recent games, the
1994 Cup veteran shrugged off the criticism.
	   ``The people who boo me are not Brazilians,'' he said. ``I think
it makes me stronger. I have faced sacrifices my whole life and
always overcome them.''
	   The Brazilians might have a weakness on the right side, where
Leonardo and Cafu have yellow cards. A second yellow would keep
them out of the semifinal and maybe even the final, assuming Brazil
gets that far.
	   And all Brazilians assume it, even if they don't say so.
	   Team captain Dunga this week announced he would retire from the
national team after the Cup.
	   ``These are my last three games for the `selection','' he said.
Nobody had to ask which three he meant.

Democrats fulfill pledge to return as new legislature opens

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fulfilling a pledge they made when China
regained sovereignty a year ago, democracy advocates returned to
Hong Kong's legislature Thursday, promising to fight for prosperity
and a more representative government.
	   Emphasizing the economic woes brought by the recession gripping
much of Asia, about 80 protesters _ mostly struggling owners of
homes and small businesses _ gathered outside the legislature to
demand lower rents.
	   The new legislature convened as Hong Kong, and the rest of the
world, was taking stock of the territory's first year under Chinese
rule. Chinese President Jiang Zemin presided over Wednesday's
anniversary ceremonies, which were kept modest because of the
recession.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was to arrive later Thursday on the
final stop of his China tour. On his agenda Friday was a meeting
with the head of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, Martin Lee.
	   In a dispute with Britain, China disbanded the last legislature
elected under British rule, and replaced it with an appointed
assembly.
	   As they left the assembly a year ago, Lee and his backers went
to the balcony of the legislature to proclaim that they would
return.
	   ``We will not let down the people of Hong Kong,'' Lee declared
from atop the same balcony Thursday. ``We will do our utmost to
monitor all government policies and actions. We will continue to
work and create a better economic environment and create more
jobs.''
	   However, he said, Hong Kong could not be well-off economically
without being democratic.
	   ``Democracy and a prosperous society are interdependent,'' Lee
said.
	   Inside the chamber, members of the legislature took their oaths
of office one by one. One of their first duties was to elect the
body's president.
	   Rita Fan, who had been president of the appointed legislature
that the democrats had called a rubber stamp, won by a vote of 36
to 24. The other candidate was Andrew Wong, president of the
directly elected legislature under the British colonial government.
	   The Democrats are Hong Kong's largest party, and Lee is the de
facto leader of the opposition to Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa in
a system of government based on appointed officials and a powerful
civil service left over from British rule.
	   Despite election rules ensuring a majority for a pro-Beijing
elite, the Democrats won 13 of the legislature's 60 seats. Along
with their allies, they swept the popular vote in the May 24
elections, and together will control a third of the assembly.
	   That gives them little real power. But they argue that a record
turnout was a vote of no confidence in Tung's administration, and
say they intend to use the moral authority from their large popular
vote to press for a more democratic system.
	   Current rules call for only a gradual increase in the number of
legislators elected by direct popular vote.

Airbus closing gap with Boeing: U.S. Air to buy 30 more planes

	   PARIS (AP) _ Airbus will sell as many as 30 more of its
jetliners to U.S. Airways, an industry source said Thursday, the
latest step by the European consortium toward equal footing with
the mighty U.S. jetmaker Boeing.
	   The U.S. airline, which has already ordered more than 100 planes
from Airbus, is ordering up to 30 widebody A330-300s, the source
said on anonymity, confirming a Wall Street Journal report earlier
Thursday.
	   The sale was to be formally announced at a joint news conference
midday Thursday by Airbus Managing Director Noel Forgeard and U.S.
Air Chairman Stephen Wolf.
	   The agreement includes firm orders for seven of the planes,
seven more subject to confirmation, and options on 16 others, the
source said. The deal could total dlrs 3.7 billion.
	   Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, declined to comment on the
report and U.S. Air officials could not immediately be reached.
	   The deal came as Airbus was negotiating a deal to sell at least
70 planes to British Airways, a sale that would break Boeing's grip
on the last major European carrier never to order an Airbus.
	   British Airways was expected to discuss the order during a board
meeting Friday.
	   The sale also comes on the heels of a major deal announced last
month to sell 76 single-aisle A320s and A321s to Spain's Iberia,
replacing aging Boeing 727s and DC9s. Airbus said it was its
largest ever order placed by a European carrier.
	   Until now, Boeing has held a 60-40 lead over Airbus and a 70-30
cut in deliveries, but it's shrinking fast. Some analysts have put
the figure at 55-45, or closer.
	   ``The latest orders bring parity'' between Airbus and Boeing on
the world jetliner market, said Paul Beaver of the influential
Jane's Information Group that watches the aerospace and defense
industries.
	   ``Other than the very large Boeing 747-400 series, Airbus has a
comparable for Boeing right across the scale,'' said Beaver. ``That
puts them really in contention for every order.''
	   Meanwhile, Boeing was struggling with ``bad deliveries, not
being able to manufacture aircraft to the right schedule, not
enough personnel, too much down sizing. That's all coming back to
roost,'' Beaver said.
	   Airbus has ``still got a long way to go'' to dominate the
market, Beaver said.
	   But the consortium is making progress toward reorganizing as a
private stockholding company. A reorganized Airbus able to issue
stock could raise new capital for expansion, including its super
jumbo A3XX.
	   The project is a dlrs 9 billion gamble by Airbus, hoping that
airlines will need a 500-seat plane in the coming years. Boeing has
bowed out of that race.
	   Airbus is a partnership of France's Aerospatiale, British
Aerospace PLC, Spain's Casa and Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace.

loans and sell them as securities.
	   Similar steps in the United Staes were seen as crucial elements
in cleaning up after the savings and loan crisis.

North Korean bodies to be returned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The bodies of nine men found in a
captured North Korean submarine will be returned to the North on
Friday.
	   The U.N. Command said Thursday the bodies will be returned in a
brief ceremony at the village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized
zone separating North and South Korea.
	   The bodies were discovered inside the submarine last week after
it was found entangled in a fishing net and seized in South Korean
waters.
	   South Korean officials said the submarine was on an espionage
mission and five of its crewmen were shot to death by their
commander and three spies, who then killed themselves to avoid
capture.
	   North Korea had earlier questioned the South Korean account, but
``offered no objection'' when presented with evidence at a meeting
with U.N. Command generals at Panmunjom on Tuesday.
	   ``The U.N. Command understood this to mean North Korean
acknowledgment of its explanation,'' the command said.
	   At a follow-up meeting Thursday, the two sides agreed on the
return of the bodies.
	   North Korea will be asked at future meetings to acknowledge the
incident, punish those responsible and assure against a recurrence,
the U.N. Command said.
	   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. The countries are still technically
at war, since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a
peace treaty.

Churches burn after handshake seals partnership between major
</HEADLINE>
Protestant, Catholic parties &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede to include overnight arson attacks, UPDATES with
reaction, further details; changes overline; deletes reference to
chapels; CORRECTS that disputed march is at Portadown, not Belfast;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Arsonists damaged nine Roman
Catholic churches across Northern Ireland in attacks lasting into
early Thursday, hours after the province's largest Protestant and
Catholic parties shook hands on a fragile new governing
partnership.
	   No arrests have been made for the attacks, which severely
damaged three churches, said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   Protestant churchmen, including leader of the Church of Ireland,
Archbishop of Armagh Robin Eames, and the Moderator of the
Presbyterian Church, Dr. John Dickson, condemned the attacks and
offered sympathy to Roman Catholic worshipers. David Ervine, leader
of the small Protestant party, the Progressive Unionists, labeled
the arsonists ``stupid, pathetic and sick.''
	   At Wednesday's opening session of Northern Ireland's 108-seat
assembly, David Trimble and Seamus Mallon were elected jointly on a
61-27 vote as first minister and deputy first minister, sealing
their partnership with a handshake.
	   Trimble, considered a hard-liner when he was elected leader of
the Ulster Unionist Party three years ago, and Mallon, long
overshadowed by his Social Democratic and Labor Party leader John
Hume, are charged with guiding the Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
	   ``I know in my heart that this is the opportunity for the people
in the north of Ireland once and for all to sort out our
problems,'' Mallon said.
	   In last week's election, Mallon's moderate Irish Catholic party
won 24 seats and Trimble's British Protestant party secured 28
seats.
	   Trimble, therefore, holds the post of first minister, but he can
expect to be hampered by 28 other Assembly members of Protestant
parties committed to foiling the agreement.
	   Most observers had assumed Hume, an architect of the peace
process, would seek the job of deputy first minister. But Hume
announced that his deputy, Mallon, should take the post.
	   Officially, Trimble outranks Mallon, but in practice _ just as
in the wider Assembly _ decisions require approval from both sides.
	   President Clinton, while touring China, urged Trimble and Hume
by telephone Wednesday to work together to prevent violence during
a march this weekend by the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's
largest fraternal organization, at Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms)
southwest of Belfast.
	   On Monday a government-appointed Parades Commission ordered that
Portadown's approximately 2,000 Orangemen not take their usual
route down Garvaghy Road, Portadown's main Catholic district, back
into town from their annual service at the rural Drumcree Anglican
church. Police and soldiers will block Orangemen outside the church
if they don't obey.
	   In an open letter published Thursday in the News Letter, a
Protestant newspaper, the Orange Order accused the commission of
trying to enforce a kind of ``cultural apartheid.''
	   Tensions were evident at Wednesday's first session of the
Belfast Assembly, where Protestant politicians in Ian Paisley's
Democratic Unionist Party zealously exchanged insults with Martin
McGuinness and Gerry Adams, leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party.
	   Paisley, 72, who had never engaged in face-to-face debate with
Sinn Fein before, said he hadn't gone back on his policy of
boycotting Sinn Fein. He drew a distinction between negotiating
with the party, which he refused to do by withdrawing from talks
last year, and ``condemning them and exposing them.''
	   McGuinness shot back at Paisley: ``You refuse to engage in
negotiations, but now you come trundling into this room because
you're afraid you're going to be left behind,'' he said. ``I'm
afraid I think you've actually been left behind.''
	   The Assembly won't meet again until Sept. 14, then it faces a
six-week deadline to fill positions in a 12-member administration,
to be called the Executive, with Trimble and Mallon at the helm.
The Executive is to take gradual control of six departments
including finance, health and education that have been run by the
British government since 1972.

Newborn baby killed by maternity home fire in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A three-day-old baby girl was killed and
another child was injured in a fire at a maternity home in eastern
Ukraine, news reports said Thursday.
	   The fire apparently began after a doctor covered a lamp in the
ward with a piece of cloth, which then started to burn after the
doctor left, according to the daily Fakty.
	   Police were investigating at the maternity home in
Novosvitlovsk.
	   Ukrainian television broadcast footage of the dead child's
charred body and said hospital fires were quite frequent in the
country, although they rarely resulted in casualties.
	   The girl that survived suffered facial burns and was undergoing
treatment, Fakty said.

World Cup: Italian influence pervades quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ There's a decidedly Italian flavor to the World Cup
quarterfinals _ and not just because the country's beloved Azzurri
are part of the Elite Eight.
	   Watch Zinedine Zidane, Didier Deschamps and Youri Djorkaeff work
to create scoring opportunities for France when they face Italy in
one quarterfinal Friday. Or Cafu and Aldair protect Brazil's net as
Ronaldo heads to the other end against Denmark.
	   Or Gabriel Batistuta and Hernan Crespo strike shots for
Argentina. Or Germany's Oliver Bierhoff rise to head a cross from
Christian Ziege.
	   All those talented players are among the 54 left in France '98
who ply their craft with clubs in the prestigious Serie A, Italy's
top soccer league. That's 30 percent of those still in the hunt for
the championship.
	   And several others, including Dennis Bergkamp of the Netherlands
and Bierhoff's strike partner Juergen Klinsmann, have spent time in
Serie A.
	   The German Bundesliga has the second-greatest representation in
the quarters, with 25 players.
	   ``Italy has contributed a lot. It has made us stronger,''
Deschamps said of the experience gained from playing here. He and
Zidane have helped Juventus of Turin win two straight Italian
league titles and when they line up at the Stade de France the
opponents will include club teammates Alessandro Del Piero,
Gianluca Pessotto, Filippo Inzaghi and Angelo Di Livio.
	   The influx of imports here is the result of several factors,
including stockpiling with an eye to rigorous cup schedules and
defections to national teams for World Cup qualifying.
	   Deep-pocketed owners such as media magnate and former Premier
Silvio Berlusconi (AC Milan), Fiat auto tycoon Gianni Agnelli
(Juventus), and film producer Vittorio Cecchi Gori (Fiorentina)
spare little expense for success and find more and more funds from
TV revenues.
	   The European Court of Justice's landmark Bosman decision in 1995
wiped out transfer rules and foreign player quotas, making it
possible for clubs to stock rosters with ``stranieri.'' Last
season, small-town Piacenza was the only one of 18 Italian clubs
without a single foreigner.
	   Each of the World Cup quarterfinalists has at least two players
now based in Italy, topped _ aside from Italy itself _ by Argentina
with 11.
	   And the foreign legionaires in Italy have made their marks so
far.
	   In the round of 16, Argentina's two goals in regulation play in
its epic clash with England came from Batistuta (Fiorentina) and
Javier Zanetti (Inter Milan). Germany moved past Mexico on a
winning goal by Bierhoff (Udinese). Edgar Davids (Juventus) fired
in the go-ahead score in the dying seconds of a 2-1 Dutch victory
over Yugoslavia.
	   While Serie A clubs have bought talent from abroad for a long
time, only in the past few years have top Italian players started
to move to foreign clubs. Coach Cesare Maldini's 22-man World Cup
roster features just two players who play club ball outside of
Italy.
	   But one, Christian Vieri of Spanish club Atletico Madrid, has
been Italy's most consistent performer at France 98 and is tied for
the World Cup lead with five goals.

Pakistan denies allegations that it planned first nuclear strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan on Thursday denied
allegations by a disgruntled scientist seeking asylum in the United
States that it was considering a first nuclear strike against
India.
	   In an interview earlier this week with The Associated Press,
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub called the allegations ''nonsense.'' He
said Pakistan had made ''elaborate plans'' to retaliate if
neighboring India attacked its nuclear facilities. But there was no
nuclear first strike strategy, he said.
	   He reiterated those remarks in reports published Thursday in
several English-language newspapers. His comments were in response
to interviews given in the United States by Iftikar Chaudhray Khan,
who says he was a nuclear scientist for Pakistan and now wants
asylum in the United States.
	   Khan said he left Pakistan to protest plans apparently made by
Pakistan last April to launch a first strike against India _ a
country that Pakistan has three times gone to war with in the past
51 years.
	   Khan,29, said Wednesday that he is willing to tell everything he
knows about his country's nuclear policy to U.S. officials in
return for political asylum.
	   After both India and Pakistan conducted underground nuclear
tests in May, the prospect of a fourth war on the volatile South
Asian subcontinent raised fears that it could escalate into a
nuclear conflagration.
	   Ayub said earlier that it is likely that another war would
involve the use of nuclear weapons, although he indicated Pakistan
believed India would be the first to use one.
	   Meanwhile in New York, Khan told The Associated Press that he
was in on a high-level meeting of scientists last April, one month
before the tests, where Pakistan decided on a first-strike
strategy.
	   Government officials in Pakistan said meetings to decide combat
strategy would not be open to scientists.
	   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
too early to assess the significance of Khan's defection or verify
his claim to be a former assistant to Dr. Altaf Hussain, director
of the Khushab Nuclear Research Center in Pakistan.
	   Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, who led Pakistan's nuclear test team,
told the independent daily newspaper, The News, that the only
record of an Iftikar Chaudhary Khan working at the Pakistan Atomic
Energy Commission was 19 years ago and that man resigned.
	   He also said there was no position of assistant research officer
in the atomic energy commission, a post Khan reportedly claimed to
have held.
	   ''Even if we did (have that position), an assistant research
officer would come in at Grade 16, and such junior officers are
never invited to top-secret meetings,'' Mubarakmand was quoted as
saying. ''They don't even know what happens in those meetings.''

Hong Kong share prices close higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong surged Thursday in
reaction to a cut in Chinese interest rates as well as reports that
Japan plans to boost its faltering economy with a tax cut.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 323.06 points, or 3.8 percent, to 8,866.16.
	   Turnover amounted to 7.98 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.02 billion), up from Tuesday's 4.47 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 573 million). The market was closed Wednesday for a
public holiday.
	   Brokers said China's decision to cut interest rates Tuesday
boosted the Hong Kong market, where many Beijing-backed Hong Kong
companies are listed.
	   ``Signs are everywhere that the Chinese government will support
Hong Kong and will do its best to bolster Hong Kong's economy,''
said Francis Lun, research analyst at Pacific Challenge Securities
Ltd.
	   Brokers said Japan's plans to bolster its economy before upper
house elections on July 12 also helped the Hong Kong bourse.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 2.60 Hong Kong
dollars to 35.59, and Cheung Kong rose 1.90 dollars to 40.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 5.00 dollars to
194.50, and Hang Seng Bank rose 2.10 dollars to 45.90.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 2.20 dollars to 43.10, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 75 cents to 30.00.

German man with rights to Lady Di name angry over museum gift shop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A German man who owns the rights to the name Lady
Di threatened on Thursday to take her brother to court over the
souvenirs on sale in the gift shop at the new Princess Diana museum
in her ancestral home in England.
	   ``We don't necessarily want to sue,'' said patent attorney
Christoph Kayser. But he said his client, Andre Engelhardt, was
concerned that T-shirts and other items sold at the museum would
hurt the value of his trademark rights.
	   ``The museum is OK,'' Kayser said. ``That can't be stopped by
trademark rights.'' But a gift shop ``doesn't serve the memory or
documentation of his sister the person. It's a business for earning
money.''
	   Engelhardt, 34, from Bavaria, registered for the German rights
to Lady Di immediately after her death last year and got an
international patent this year.
	   Kayser said the trademark gives his client the right to control
the use of the name Lady Di on ``high-end products'' such as
cosmetics and leather goods. It may also extend to other forms of
her name, such as Princess Diana, although that could be challenged
in court, Kayser conceded by telephone from his office in Hamm, in
western Germany.
	   He said his client was concerned the museum gift shop items
would cheapen Diana's name, thus hurting his trademark.
	   Diana's estate maintains the souvenirs sold at the museum shop
are associated with the late princess without ``cheapening her
memory in any way.''
	   Kayser said Engelhardt is ``not a Diana fan,'' but applied for
the trademark because he knew ``Diana would be a valuable product.
	   ``It just came to him intuitively,'' Kayser said. ``People would
want to remember her and there'd be a mark to be made.''
	   He said they recently signed their first contract with a German
firm to produce Lady Di clothing.

Attack on flight attendant results in five arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Five passengers on a South
African Airways flight from Angola to Johannesburg were arrested
after allegedly beating up a flight attendant and smoking in the
no-smoking section.
	   The men, a South African, an Australian and three Britons, were
arrested at Johannesburg International airport Wednesday evening,
said police Capt. Hannes Lombard.
	   The men, believed to be oil rig workers, assaulted the male
flight attendant during the SAA flight from Luanda to Johannesburg
and were detained as soon as the plane landed, Lombard said.
	   The men, all in their 20s, are charged with endangering an
aircraft flight, malicious damage to property and assault.

Indonesia government preparing bill to limit demonstrations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to include protests by prostitutes, pro-independence
activists, grafs 9-13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government is preparing a
``freedom of expression'' bill that would place limits on
demonstrations, the official Antara news agency reported Thursday.
	   The report came as Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years
has led to almost daily protests and demonstrations.
	   The new bill, expected to be presented to Parliament soon for
approval, would ban demonstrations, rallies or public gatherings at
the state palace, places of worship and military agencies, Antara
said.
	   The report quoted Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah as saying
the new legislation also would require notifying police 24 hours
before a demonstration.
	   ``The maximum number of demonstrators is 100. If they are more
that 100, (they) should obtain written permission from the
police,'' Yosfiah said.
	   The proposed law also would require organizers to report the
location, route, duration and goals of any demonstration, as well
as their addresses.
	   ``In many countries in the world, demonstrations are regulated
by law, even if they are by only a small group,'' Antara quoted
Minister at the State Secretariat Akbar Tanjung as saying.
	   In recent demonstrations, workers and pro-democracy activists in
Jakarta and other big cities have been seeking improved worker
rights, lower food prices and independence for the former
Portuguese colony of East Timor and Irian Jaya on western New
Guinea.
	   At least two demonstrations occurred Wednesday in Central Java,
including one by about 200 prostitutes seeking postponement of a
plan by the mayor to close down their ``resocialization'' complex
near the city of Solo.
	   In the protest at the local parliament building, the women
sought a three-month reprieve to enable them to collect savings for
new lives, the newspaper Kompas reported.
	   ``The economic difficulties have forced me to be a prostitute''
was among messages on banners unfurled at the protest, Kompas said.
	   Last week, a mob protesting against prostitutes burned down a
similar complex in West Java.
	   The latest protest came Thursday in the Irian Jaya capital of
Jayapura, about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) east of Jakarta.
About 100 activists demanded independence for the former Dutch
colony in western New Guinea.
	   Student protests for democracy and riots over big price
increases and unemployment helped force President Suharto to quit
after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   The government of new President B.J. Habibie signed a deal last
week with the International Monetary Fund that is expected to clear
the way for the resumption next month of billions of dollars in
aid.

Airbus closing gap with Boeing: U.S. Air to buy 30 more planes

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Airbus will sell as many as 30 more of its
jetliners to U.S. Airways, an industry source said Thursday, the
latest step by the European consortium toward equal footing with
the mighty U.S. jetmaker Boeing.
	   The U.S. airline, which has already ordered more than 100 planes
from Airbus, is ordering up to 30 widebody A330-300s, the source
said on anonymity, confirming a Wall Street Journal report earlier
Thursday.
	   The sale was to be formally announced at a joint news conference
midday Thursday by Airbus Managing Director Noel Forgeard and U.S.
Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf.
	   The agreement, which came as Boeing struggles with production
snarls, includes firm orders for seven of the planes, seven more
subject to confirmation, and options on 16 others, the source said.
The deal could total dlrs 3.7 billion.
	   Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, declined to comment on the
report and U.S. Air officials could not immediately be reached.
	   The order followed Airbus's announcement Wednesday that Air
France signed for 40 planes, half of them firm orders.
	   Airbus was also negotiating a deal to sell at least 70 planes to
British Airways, a sale that would break Boeing's grip on the last
major European carrier never to order an Airbus.
	   British Airways was expected to discuss the order during a board
meeting Friday.
	   The sale also comes on the heels of a major deal announced last
month to sell 76 single-aisle A320s and A321s to Spain's Iberia,
replacing aging Boeing 727s and DC9s. Airbus said it was its
largest ever order placed by a European carrier.
	   Until now, Boeing has held a 60-40 market share lead over
Airbus, but it's shrinking fast. Some analysts have put the figure
at 55-45, or closer.
	   ``The latest orders bring parity'' between Airbus and Boeing on
the world jetliner market, said Paul Beaver of the influential
Jane's Information Group that watches the aerospace and defense
industries.
	   ``Other than the very large Boeing 747-400 series, Airbus has a
comparable model for Boeing right across the scale,'' said Beaver.
``That puts them really in contention for every order.''
	   Meanwhile, Boeing was struggling with ``not being able to
manufacture aircraft to the right schedule, not enough personnel,
too much downsizing. That's all coming back to roost,'' Beaver
said.
	   Another London-based analyst saw the latest orders as evidence
Airbus could match Boeing in the next three years. ``But I suspect
Boeing will catch up again,'' said Guenter Endres.
	   Airbus was often beating Boeing in the sale of single-aisle
planes using lighter fly-by-wire technology. ``A lot of airlines
are feeling the A319s, A320s and A321s are a bit more up to date
than the Boeing 737s,'' Endres said.
	   Airbus has ``still got a long way to go'' to dominate the
market, Beaver cautioned.
	   But the consortium is reorganizing as a private company, which
would allow it to issue stock and raise new capital for expansion,
including for its super jumbo A3XX.
	   The project is a dlrs 9 billion gamble by Airbus, hoping that
airlines will need a 500-seat plane in the coming years. Boeing has
bowed out of that race.
	   Airbus is a partnership of France's Aerospatiale, British
Aerospace PLC, Spain's Casa and Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace.

Cyprus to send home passengers of drifting trawler
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus will send home 109 Arabs and
Africans whose vessel bound for Europe drifted for nine days in the
eastern Mediterranean before it was rescued by a Ukrainian ship.
	   None of the passengers, mostly men in their 20s and 30s, has
applied for asylum, Interior Minister Dinos Michaelides said in
remarks published Thursday by the daily Philelftheros.
	   The Syrian-flagged ``Rida Allah,'' Arabic for ``God's
blessing,'' left Tripoli in northern Lebanon on June 18 with a
six-man crew. It soon developed engine trouble, and its passengers
fought over scarce food and water. Two men died of thirst.
	   The ship was towed Monday to the southern port of Limassol, and
authorities found that none of the passengers had travel documents.
	   Cyprus does not have the legal framework to deal with requests
for political asylum, and, citing unspecified security reasons, has
not ratified the section of the European Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights that provides for the right of asylum
seekers to challenge an expulsion order in court.
	   ``Cyprus does not have the resources of, say, European Union
countries to play the role of a land of hope and promise,'' said
parliament member Prodromos Prodromou of President Glafcos
Clerides' Democratic Rally party. ``But there exists the political
will to modernize our laws and harmonize them with those in the
EU.''
	   Many of the survivors, who are being kept under guard at a
Limassol hotel, said they had no wish to return to their countries.
	   Some spoke of persecution and possible imprisonment if they were
to go back, others simply said they would rather not. They all had
paid thousands of dollars to middlemen in places such as Sudan,
northern Iraq, Syria and Lebanon for passage to Greece and Italy.
	   ``My personal opinion is to offer them all the humanitarian
assistance they need and send them back to where they set off
from,'' parliament member Marios Matsakis said.

ASEAN asked to press Myanmar on crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A U.S.-based human rights organization
has urged the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to press
Myanmar's military regime to halt a crackdown on the country's
leading opposition party.
	   Human Rights Watch said dozens of members of parliament from the
National League for Democracy, elected in 1990 but never allowed to
serve, are believed to have been arrested or threatened in recent
days.
	   The league and other opposition sources say that ``verbally or
in writing,'' authorities have asked elected candidates of the
party to sign pledges restricting their movements, and that those
who refused to do so were being imprisoned.
	   The crackdown came in apparent response to a June 23 demand by
the league that the country's military regime convene by Aug. 21
the Parliament that was never allowed to meet.
	   The demand marked the first time the party, headed by 1991 Nobel
peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, had set a deadline for the
military to convene Parliament. Her party won a large majority of
the seats in the poll.
	   Many Western nations have ostracized the military regime in
Myanmar _ also called Burma _ for its poor human right records.
Japan and ASEAN, however, have pursued a policy of ``constructive
engagement,'' arguing that close ties bring a better opportunity
for influence.
	   ``At the upcoming ASEAN ministerial meeting in Manila on July
24, we urge them to intervene with the Burmese government to seek
an immediate end to this pattern of harassment,'' said the
statement from Human Rights Watch received in Bangkok.
	   Although ASEAN members ordinarily shy away from ``interference''
in each others' affairs, Thailand's foreign minister recently
suggested it was time to change that policy.
	   An article in Myanmar's state-controlled press Monday suggested
that Suu Kyi could face a long prison term for her political
activities.
	   In what has been widely interpreted as a threat against her
life, it also warned that she could become another ``Ngo Dinh
Diem,'' the premier of what was then South Vietnam, who was
assassinated by military officers in 1963.
	   The allusion caused concern because of an incident June 25 in
which unidentified men assaulted members of the youth wing of Suu
Kyi's party outside her home in the Myanmar capital, Yangon, after
police tried to block them from holding a regularly scheduled
meeting.
	   Suu Kyi reportedly fell or was pushed to the ground during the
melee.
	   In November 1996, a pro-government mob attacked Suu Kyi's
motorcade, smashing car windows with sticks and crowbars and
slightly injuring one of her top aides. Some said later they had
been paid by the government to attack the car.
	   Another Myanmar opposition group, the All Burma Students'
Democratic Front, said in a press release received in Bangkok that
visitation privileges for 42 elected lawmakers from the league
already in prison have been withdrawn.
	   It also claimed that a special detached house in the women's
section of Insein Prison was being renovated last week, and was
``believed to be '' for Suu Kyi.
	   It said the house was built in December 1995 after the league
walked out on the military regime's constitutional convention,
claiming it was rigged.
	   Information about the crackdown has been difficult to confirm.
Human Rights Watch said ``international calls to Rangoon are cut
off as soon as mention of these incidents is made.''
	   Several queries faxed this week by The Associated Press in
Bangkok to the government's main spokesman have gone unanswered.

Three in Prague died of Legionnaires' disease, doctors fear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ All surgery at a top Prague
hospital has been suspended after the deaths of three patients whom
doctors suspect of contracting Legionnaires' disease there, a
spokesman said Thursday.
	   The three died at IKEM hospital in early to mid-June of
pneumonia they contracted during kidney transplant operations,
Jaroslav Horejsi said. Their bodies were later found to contain
Legionella bacteria they got from the hospital's hot water pipes.
	   While it has not been confirmed that the three died of
Legionnaires' disease, transplant operations were halted
immediately and all other surgeries last week as a precaution, he
said.
	   Transplant recipients are extremely vulnerable to all kind of
infections due to artificially suppressed immunity, the spokesman
noted.
	   ``It is not usual in Czech hospitals to check water for the
Legionella, and we found it only when trying to determine why the
three had died,'' Horejsi said.
	   After discovering the source of the bacteria, the hospital
heated the water to 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit) to
kill it. No further cases of the disease have been reported since,
he said.
	   Patients, however, have been asked not to take showers and no
visitors are being allowed.
	   The hospital will decide next week when to resume surgeries
after another check of the hot water pipes.
	   Legionnaires' disease is contracted mainly by inhaling airborne
water droplets containing the Legionella bacteria. Symptoms include
fevers and pneumonia.
	   It is named for its first known victims, members of the
Pennsylvania American Legion who contracted the disease during a
convention in 1976.

Judicial commission to investigate ethnic, political clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A three-member judicial commission will
investigate causes of sporadic and politically instigated ethnic
clashes that have claimed more than 1,500 lives since 1991, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The panel will be headed by appellate Judge Akilano M. Akiwumi,
and includes colleague Elkana O. Bosire and Sarah C. Ondenyo of the
High Court, the Daily Nation said.
	   The commission will attempt to establish the cause of the
clashes, identify the instigators and recommend prosecution where
necessary.
	   President Daniel arap Moi named the panel Wednesday, a day after
he said such an inquiry would help ease ethnic animosities.
	   The most serious clashes occurred in 1991-92 in Moi's home
province of Rift Valley. The clashes pitted Moi's Kalenjin group of
tribes against the Kikuyu, Luhya and Luo, East African nation's
largest tribes in that order.
	   At least 1,500 people were killed and an estimated 300,000 fled
their homes and small farms, the U.N. Development Program said.
	   The clashes coincided with the restoration of opposition parties
for the first time in two decades. The government and opposition
leaders accused each other fanning the riots.
	   In 1992, a parliamentary investigation concluded that
politicians close to Moi organized the clashes.
	   Clashes erupted again last August along the Indian Ocean coast
and opposition supporters were targeted. Government critics said
the violence was instigatated to denying opposition parties
victory. Moi's Kenya African National Union party won the
parliamentary seat in the worst affected area.
	   The violence at the coast was a major blow to the tourism
industry, Kenya's second largest earner of foreign currency.
	   Since the clashes, bed occupancy at the coast has steadily
dropped, and has stood at 21 percent in May, the Kenya Association
of Hotel Keepers and Caterers say. Some hotels have closed and
others have laid off some workers.
	   Some Kenyans dismissed the judicial panel as a public relations
exercise.
	   Paul Wamae, a former chairman of the Law Society of Kenya, said
the commission is incapable of the job ``since its members are
government employees and cannot possibly return objective
findings.''
	   Akiwumi, a native of Ghana, has served as a judge in Kenya since
1985 and is highly respected.

Clinton wants China to learn from U.S. environmental mistakes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS throughout; Clinton scheduled to arrive in
Hong Kong about 1300 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUILIN, China (AP) _ Standing before the spectacular limestone
peaks of a restored green paradise, U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged China Thursday to learn from U.S. mistakes and not harm the
environment for the sake of economic growth.
	   He pledged U.S. support to the cleansing of rivers, air and land
in China, which has five of the most polluted cities in the world.
	   ``Let us, Chinese and Americans, preserve what we have inherited
from the past and, in doing so, preserve the future we are working
so hard to build for our children,'' Clinton said.
	   After a boat ride on the picturesque Li River, Clinton was
flying to Hong Kong on Air Force One, the first passenger plane to
land at the city's new Chek Lap Kok International Airport. The
airport was being dedicated earlier in the day by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, who was in Hong Kong for the first anniversary of the
former British colony's return to Chinese rule.
	   Hong Kong's Chinese-appointed chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa,
was meeting Clinton, who also scheduled a meeting with the city's
de-facto opposition leader, Martin Lee. That session will be closed
to media, including photographers _ a restriction critics consider
a bow to Beijing. But the White House insisted it was ``normal
practice'' to prohibit full coverage of meetings with opposition
leaders.
	   In Guilin, where the government and citizens have replanted
trees, cleaned up the winding rivers and begun to wean themselves
from coal-burning fuels, the president marveled at the scenic
surroundings.
	   ``No place in China is more evocative of the beauty of your
country than Guilin,'' he told a group of more than 400 citizens
and environmental leaders gathered in the now pristine Seven Star
Park.
	   A hump-shaped gray and white limestone pinnacle, called Rosy
Clouds Over Camel, served as backdrop to his speech. In the
sweltering heat, Clinton cooled himself with a colorful Chinese
fan, referring to it as ``an energy efficient air conditioner.''
	   Clinton, praising Guilin's environmental leaders during a
roundtable discussion, said it's not too late for all of China to
reverse environmental trends that have put the country on track to
overtake the United States as the No. 1 emitter of greenhouse gases
within 20 years.
	   ``I believe that China has a unique opportunity _ because you're
developing rapidly, but later in time than other countries _ to
avoid some of the terrible mistakes we made,'' he said.
	   America, in the past generation, has worked hard to reverse
decades of environmental damage from the industrial revolution by
setting clean-air rules to clear up smog-shrouded cities and
clearing rivers so choked with pollution that one _ the Cuyahoga in
Ohio _ caught fire, Clinton said.
	   For two decades now, China has been undergoing its own
transformation from an agricultural society into an industrialized
economic power. As a result, Beijing and other large cities are so
smog-obscured they can no longer be seen from space by satellites,
the president said.
	   ``China's extraordinary growth has put the same kind of
pressures on your environment, and the costs of growth are rising
right along with your prosperity,'' Clinton said. ``You know better
than I that polluted air and water are threatening your remarkable
progress.''
	   The president praised steps taken by China to monitor air
quality, ban leaded gasoline in some big cities, reduce coal use
and otherwise restore and clean up the environment.
	   The United States and China launched a joint initiative on clean
energy last year. Clinton said the U.S. government would assist
Chinese air quality monitoring and make financing available for
clean-energy projects through the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

China warns U.S. on Taiwan arms sales, says they risk force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China called on the United States Thursday to
stop selling arms to Taiwan and said weapons sales increase the
chances Beijing will use force to take the island.
	   The appeal by a Foreign Ministry official came two days after
U.S. President Bill Clinton stated that Washington did not support
independence for Taiwan nor would it back the island's membership
in the United Nations.
	   Clinton's statement before community leaders in Shanghai gave
Chinese leaders their biggest foreign policy victory of the U.S.
president's nine-day China tour.
	   Clinton aides, however, immediately signaled that the
administration would live up to a U.S. law requiring Washington to
provide Taiwan with weapons for defense.
	   While welcoming the Clinton pledge, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang urged Washington Thursday to halt weapons sales, as
promised in a 1982 communique. He reiterated Beijing's longstanding
position that Chinese-U.S. relations would be smooth only if
Washington did not undermine China's claim to the island.
	   Beijing regards Taiwan, home to the Nationalists whom Mao
Tse-tung's Communists drove from the mainland in 1949, as a rebel
province to be reclaimed by force if necessary.
	   Tang reiterated that the use of force was seen as a last resort
to quash independence or foreign meddling, but he added that China
sees arms sales to the island as abetting separatism.
	   ``We are opposed to arms sales by any countries to Taiwan
because we want to forestall the use of force for reunification. We
want to have such a reunification through peaceful means,'' Tang
said at a twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Clinton's disavowal of U.S. support for Taiwan independence is
known in the esoteric language of cross-Taiwan Strait diplomacy as
the ``three nos'' _ no independence for Taiwan, no two Chinas, or
one Taiwan-one China, and no Taiwanese membership in any
organization for which statehood is a requirement.
	   It was the first time a U.S. president had explicitly backed
Beijing's policy. China's leaders hope Clinton's words will get
Taiwanese leaders to stop trying to win diplomatic recognition as a
separate nation and force them to the negotiating table.
	   ``The Taiwan authorities should have an objective view of
reality and come back to the principle of one China as soon as
possible,'' Tang said.

Two hostages freed in breakaway Russian republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen troops on Thursday freed two hostages who
had been kept in the breakaway Russian republic following their
capture in a neighboring region earlier this week, a news report
said.
	   Shamil Atguiyev and Dzhabrail Tagirov were kidnapped Monday in
neighboring Dagestan while doing farm work, deputy chief of
Chechnya's anti-abduction squad Magomed Magomadov told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Acting on a tip from Dagestan, the squad ambushed the kidnappers
as they tried to move the two hostages to a mountainous area, the
report said. Four suspected kidnappers were arrested.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions, usually for ransom, since the republic's
two-year war for independence from Russia ended in 1996.
	   Chechnya runs its own affairs, but its de facto independence is
not formally recognized by any nation.

Chaos at airport caused by faulty computer lines

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chaos and long waits continued for
a third day at Malaysia's high-tech new airport as faulty phone
lines were identified Thursday as the cause of system failures.
	   Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said contractors had not
installed communication lines properly at the dlrs 2.3 billion
Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
	   Ling did not predict any immediate relief.
	   ``We expect the instability in the lines of communication to
happen again but it will be less and less as we go along,'' Bernama
news agency quoted him as saying.
	   Technicians worked through the night, but a computer crash
occurred early Thursday, Ling said.
	   Arriving passengers waited up to three hours for their luggage
even though relief staff were called in to manually load baggage
from the tarmac to baggage carriers.
	   Airport staff had to check in passengers manually, filling out
boarding passes with pens. For a 400-passenger jumbo jet, the
process could take up to three hours, Ling said.
	   Departing international and domestic flights continued to be
delayed for several hours. Monitors with flight times, gates and
airport directions flashed on and off throughout the day, officials
said.
	   ``Everything that involves computer lines has been affected,'' a
Malaysian Airlines official said in a telephone call that was
disconnected three times.
	   Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang denounced the transport minister
for not having a grasp of the airport's problems.
	   The minister reportedly told reporters Wednesday that the
problem with communication lines was ``too technical for me and you
to understand. By the time I explain it, you will get confused and
I will get confused.''
	   Lim called the explanation ``gobbledygook.''
	   ``How frightening!'' Lim said in a statement. ``With such a
transport minister, who dare not explain what is wrong with the
state-of-the-art KLIA system for fear that he will get `confused,'
it is no wonder the KLIA is such a mess.''
	   The airport, touted as the world's biggest and most modern, is
run by a 700 million ringgit (dlrs 175 million) database that links
all operations, from baggage handling to information monitors.
	   The sleek new 10,000-hectare (24,700-acre) airport is designed
to put Malaysia on the international map and help it compete with
Bangkok and Singapore as an international aviation hub.
	   Local papers that aren't usually critical of government projects
are being harsh on the new airport.
	   The New Straits Times, in an editorial, said KLIA should not
have been opened before it was properly tested.
	   ``It's rare for a symbol of national pride to transform itself
to a source of national concern within the short span of two
days,'' it said.
	   Sentiments of national pride for the KLIA have been replaced by
``alarm and embarrassment'' and ``a feeling of grievous shame,'' it
added.

Rights group: 2,000 held in Iraqi prisons for nearly 20 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Iraqi government has detained 2,000
Kurds and Shiite Muslims for nearly two decades without charges or
trial, an Iraqi human rights group said Thursday.
	   President Saddam Hussein was believed to have ordered the arrest
of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Shiites months before the Iraq-Iran
War began in September 1980, accusing them of being of Iranian
origin. The human rights group said the prisoners have been held
since then in underground cells in the Abu Ghraib prison west of
Baghdad.
	   ``Hundreds of our citizens who were rounded up in the early
1980s are still alive,'' the London-based Center for Human Rights
of the Iraqi Communist Party said in a statement.
	   There was no way to confirm the report, but a committee set up
in London by the detainees' families has long pressed their case,
even taking it up with U.N. investigators.
	   The statement carried the names of 60 prisoners and said a more
complete list would be handed over to Max van der Stoel, a former
Dutch foreign minister who heads a U.N. human rights commission
investigating charges against the Iraqi government.
	   Most of these detainees are threatened by malnutrition, chronic
disease and mistreatment, the group said.
	   Saddam deported nearly 270,000 Iraqis before the war with Iran,
saying they were of Iranian origin and might act as a fifth column.
But about 15,000 Shiite and Kurdish men of draft age were detained
rather than expelled from the country, Kaw Rashid, a spokesman for
the group said by telephone from London.
	   Shiite Muslims and Kurds are a majority of Iraq's 22 million
people, but the government is largely made up of members of the
mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.

Pollock out as South Africa decided to bat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ South Africa's cricket team suffered
a major setback Thursday when all-rounder Shaun Pollock was ruled
out of the third test against England at Old Trafford.
	   The right-arm pace bowler was forced to withdraw from the match
just hours before the start of play due to the recurrence of an
injury to his left quadricep.
	   His injury cleared the way for Makhaya Ntini, who was the first
black South African fast bowler to play a test match, to win his
third cap.
	   South Africa, which has a 1-0 lead after two matches in the five
test series, also brought in Gerhardus Liebenberg to replace
injured opening batsman Adam Bacher.
	   Bacher injured his right shoulder while fielding in England's
second innings during his side's 10-wicket victory at Lord's in the
second test.
	   Proteas captain Hansie Cronje got the visitors off to a flying
start in the third test, winning the toss and electing to bat first
on a sparsely-grassed pitch expected to favor spinners.
	   England made three changes with opener Nick Knight, left-arm
spinner Ashley Giles and medium paceman Darren Gough replacing
Steve James, Mark Ealham and Dean Headley respectively.
	   Giles, the 25-year old debutant, will form a two-man spin attack
with off spinner Robert Croft.
	   England: Mike Atherton, Nick Knight, Alec Stewart (captain),
Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash, Dominic Cork,
Ashley Giles, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Angus Fraser.
	   South Africa: Gary Kirsten, Gehardus Liebenberg, Jacques Kallis,
Daryll Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes, Mark
Boucher, Lance Klusener, Allan Donald, Paul Adams and Makhaya
Ntini.
	   Umpires: Peter Willey (England) and Doug Cowie (New Zealand). TV

U.N. investigator: Cleric deaths may be part of organized attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. human rights investigator probing charges
against Iraq on Thursday voiced concern that killings of two
Iranian clerics could be part of an organized Iraqi attack on the
country's Shiite community.
	   Max van der Stoel said in a statement he had information
indicating that Ayatollah Mirza Ali Gharavi and Ayatollah Murtadha
Ali Mohammed Ibrahim Borujerdi were killed after suffering
harassment by Iraqi authorities.
	   ``The aim of the killings appears to be a political one with the
objective of silencing dissent and suppressing opposition,'' van
der Stoel said.
	   Gharavi, 70, his son-in-law and chauffeur were fatally shot by
gunmen on Thursday June 18 as they traveled from the Muslim Shiite
holy city of Karbala to Najaf, 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast
of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. No one claimed responsibility.
	   Gharavi and Borujerdi, who was killed on April 21, worked as
prayer leaders at Najaf's Imam Ali Mosque. Hundreds of Iranian
clerics study and teach in Najaf and Karbala, holy Shiite cities.
	   Shiite Muslims and Kurds represent the majority of Iraq's 22
million people, but the government is largely made up of members of
the mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.
	   Iraqi officials had repeatedly warned the two clerics to stop
leading prayers for Shi'a Muslims, said van der Stoel.
	   He said Gharavi and Borujerdi had both been harassed. Borujerdi
in particular had survived two attacks, one in which he was
severely beaten, and the other in which he was injured when a hand
grenade was thrown at him, van der Stoel said.
	   After Gharavi was killed, Iran warned Iraq it could have
negative impact on relations between the two countries.
	   Iraq responded by denying involvement in the incident, saying
its authorities would do their best to apprehend those responsible.
	   Van der Stoel said, however, that Iraq has so far failed to
thoroughly investigate the killings.
	   He urged the Iraqi government to do so and to respect the Shi'a
community's religious independence.

Japan announces plan to clean up banking industry crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Japanese Finance Minister, 4th graf;
yen's decline, 10th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's government on Thursday approved an
ambitious plan to assume control over failed banks and gradually
shut them down, a key component in initiatives to pull this country
out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   The so-called ``bridge bank'' scheme, patterned after the U.S.
bailout of failed savings and loan institutions in the 1980s, is
designed to prevent bank failures from cutting off credit to
healthy borrowers and driving Japan deeper into economic
stagnation.
	   The plan was approved by a special government panel after a
series of top-level meetings and announced by Finance Minister
Hikaru Matsunaga.
	   ``Our weak financial system and the accompanying credit crunch
have weighed on the economy,'' Matsunaga said. ``If this credit
crunch can be eliminated, we hope to see a strong economic
recovery.''
	   The plan calls for government involvement in two stages over a
maximum of five years to close down failed lenders.
	   Japan's financial institutions are saddled with a staggering 76
trillion yen (dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans left from the collapse
in the early 1990s of the ``bubble'' created by rampant stock and
real estate speculation.
	   In the first stage of the rescue plan, Japan would send
government accountants and lawyers to manage banks that go bust,
while looking for a buyer.
	   The second stage calls for transforming the most troubled
institutions from state-run- to state-owned enterprises operating
under a public bank holding company.
	   Initial reaction to the plan was positive.
	   Stock prices worldwide were bolstered by early reports of the
plan's contents. Tokyo stocks surged and the yen strengthened
against the U.S. dollar in morning trading, although the yen later
declined because of dwindling expectations of central bank
intervention to support it.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's governing Liberal Democratic
Party had been studying various proposals to strengthen the
financial system since it pledged aggressive action to deal with
the ailing banks at a meeting of international finance officials
last month.
	   The depth of the bank problem was driven home just last week,
when rumors that a leading institution, the Long-Term Credit Bank,
was teetering under problem loans sent the bank's stock prices
plummeting to dangerously low levels.
	   The bank has since announced plans to merge with Sumitomo Trust
in what could create one of the 10 largest banks in the world.
	   Adding to the governing party's sense of urgency is a set of
elections on July 12 for the upper house of Japan's bicameral
Parliament. Scoring points on the economy is seen as critical if
the party is to come out of those elections victorious.
	   To show they are serious about turning the economy around,
Hashimoto and other party leaders have said they are also
considering permanent cuts in residential and income taxes in 1999.
	   The bridge bank concept was first used by the U.S. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. in the late 1980s to deal with a spate of
bank failures following the savings and loan debacle.
	   The plan, which will be submitted for approval in Parliament
later this month, is one of the most important parts of a broad
scheme to strengthen Japan's shaky financial system.
	   The government has also said it plans to introduce tax breaks
for bad-loan disposal and to allow banks to package their troubled
loans and sell them as securities.
	   Similar steps in the United States were seen as crucial elements
in cleaning up after the savings and loan crisis.

Flash floods follow drought in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam, already reeling from a typhoon
and a major drought in the last eight months, is being hit by flash
floods now that the delayed rainy season has arrived.
	   Flash flooding has destroyed dozens of houses, drowned crops,
killed at least one child and left several other people missing in
the northern provinces of Yen Bai and Lao Cai and the southern
province of Ninh Thuan, the Vietnam News Agency reported Thursday.
	   Continuous rains estimated at 150-200 millimeters (six to eight
inches) per day swamped the north for the last three days of June,
the agency said.
	   Mud is covering a section of National Highway 32 about seven to
eight kilometers (five miles) long in the north, with soil up to a
meter (yard) deep on bridges.
	   A 50-meter (55-yard) bridge collapsed in Lao Cai. High water
breached the main dike at the Na Kham hydroelectric plant.
	   Some areas have been isolated, with estimates that it will take
two months to clear the way to the Lao Cai district of Mu Cang
Chai.
	   Flash flooding in the south destroyed 70 homes in Ninh Thuan
province, which also suffered damage to its irrigation system and
roads.
	   The heavy rains, which have inundated streets in Hanoi several
times, came on the heels of the worst drought in a century. Typhoon
Linda hit the country hard last November.
	   The government has estimated damage from the two natural
disasters at dlrs 1 billion and has blamed them, along with the
fallout from the Asian financial crisis, for a slowdown in the
economy.

Jane's: Syria is set to produce deadly VX nerve agent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Syria is set to produce deadly VX nerve agent,
Jane's Defense Weekly reported, quoting Israeli intelligence
estimates.
	   The respected military magazine said in a Tel Aviv-dated story
Wednesday that Syria is already able to produce other chemical
agents ``and is set to locally produce quantities of the VX
chemical agent.''
	   Israeli officials have previously accused Russia of helping
Syria acquire chemical weapons, including VX, which is so potent
that a single drop can be deadly.
	   Israel has long been concerned that Syria might put VX or other
chemical agents in missiles capable of hitting the Jewish state.
	   According to Jane's, previous attempts by Syria and Libya to
produce quantities of VX locally were strongly opposed, and both
countries were forced to call off their activities as a result of
international military and political pressure.
	   Last week, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler told the
Security Council that U.S. Army scientists have found traces of VX
nerve gas in Iraqi warheads from the 1990-91 Gulf conflict. He has
asked Swiss and French laboratories for confirmation.
	   Iraq has admitted producing VX, but denied that it used it in
weapons.
	   If the test results are confirmed, Iraq is likely to face stiff
opposition from the United States and Britain in its campaign to
get the Security Council to lift economic sanctions imposed in 1990
after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, touching off the Persian Gulf
War.

Muslim settlers denied resident status in tribal district
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HASAN SAEED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ In the first sign of the possible
impact of a peace accord in Bangladesh's troubled eastern hills,
all the Muslim settlers in one district who recently applied for
resident certificates were denied the documents, without which they
cannot vote, buy property or get government jobs.
	   The controversial peace accord ended an uprising by Buddhist
tribal groups who said an influx of Muslims was diluting their
culture. The accord stipulates that only property owners can get
resident certificates. Most Muslims in the area are tenants on
government land.
	   Atiqul Islam, deputy commissioner in the sparsely populated
district of Bandarban, 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of the
Bangladeshi capital, said in a telephone interview Thursday that
more than 100 Muslims living in the district applied for and were
refused resident certificates Wednesday.
	   As many as 300,000 Muslim settlers _ 40 percent of the
population _ live in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, comprising the
districts of Bandarban, Khagrachari and Rangamati. Reports from the
other districts were not immediately available.
	   ``Non-tribal people may be forced to leave their homes if they
are denied their human rights.'' said Nazemul Islam Choudhury, a
local Muslim leader.
	   Ninety percent of the Muslim settlers came over several decades
after they lost their homes and property elsewhere in Bangladesh in
floods. Most were housed in huge government camps as a security
measure during the tribal uprising, and so did not buy their own
homes.
	   The Dec. 2 accord grants the region wide autonomy. Local
governments are expected to be dominated by tribespeople.
	   Opposition parties led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia have
launched street protests calling for the peace accord to be
scrapped.

American collegiate golfers beat Japanese counterparts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASOGUN, Japan (AP) _ The American team won 10 of 12 singles
matches Thursday and beat its Japanese counterpart for the third
straight year in the annual 54-hole Fuji Xerox collegiate golf
championship.
	   Japan managed just 3 points on the final day, for one victory
and one tie, ending with a 43-17 loss overall. Each victory is
worth two points and each team gets one point for a tie.
	   Overall, the Americans lead 16-7 in the series, begun in 1975.
	   After tying 6-6 in the doubles matches Tuesday, the Americans
had surged to a 22-14 lead after Wednesday's singles matches.
	   In the final round, James Driscoll of Virginia shot the day's
best score, a 2-under-par 70, and beat Shugo Sakurai of Nihon
University, who had a 77.
	   With a three-round total of 5-under 211, Driscoll was third
overall among the men.

New figures show big increase in poverty in crisis-ridden
</HEADLINE>
Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Poverty in crisis-ridden Indonesia is
growing at an alarming rate, with almost 80 million people, or
about 40 percent, now living in squalor, the government said
Thursday.
	   The Central Bureau of Statistics warned that the number of poor
could jump to 95.8 million by the end of 1998 as the battered
economy deteriorates.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, has been
hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown and many fear further
outbreaks of violence if social conditions worsen.
	   Unemployment and inflation are rising fast, and many companies
are on the verge of bankruptcy as the value of the currency, the
rupiah, drops. There have been reports of some food shortages.
	   The bureau estimated that 79.4 million of the 202 million
Indonesians now live in poverty _ an increase of 60 million in two
years.
	   In 1996, the number of poor Indonesians was estimated at 22.5
million, or 11 percent of the population. This followed years of
poverty eradication programs under former President Suharto, who
resigned last month after a wave of protests and riots.
	   Indonesia signed a new deal with the International Monetary Fund
last week to restart a dlrs 43 billion economic rescue package.
	   The new deal contains measures, such as food subsidies, to ease
the crisis' blow to the needy.
	   It also contains a wide range of tough economic reforms.
	   Even so, recovery is likely to take years in Indonesia, where
political stability is still in doubt following Suharto's downfall
after 32 years in power.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has embarked on
democratic reforms, but foreign investors remain wary and the
rupiah is still weak.
	   The bureau said those under its poverty line are individuals
earning less than 52,470 rupiahs (dlrs 3.50) a month in urban areas
or 41,588 rupiahs (dlrs 2.70) month in rural areas.
	   The criteria also include those who cannot afford food with a
nutritional value of more than 2,010 calories a day, a figure akin
to a weight loss diet in more affluent countries.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Airbus will sell as many as 30 more of its
jetliners to U.S. Airways, the two firms said Thursday, in the
latest step by the European consortium toward equal footing with
the mighty U.S. jetmaker Boeing.
	   The U.S. airline, which has already ordered more than 100 planes
from Airbus, is to buy up to 30 more widebody A330-300s, officials
said in a joint statement.
	   ``U.S. Airways will have the most modern fleet in the air within
just a few years time,'' U.S. Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf said in
a statement ahead of a news conference in Paris with Airbus
Managing Director Noel Forgeard.

Air pollution surpasses danger levels as temperatures soar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Air pollution levels surpassed danger
limits in the capital on Thursday as temperatures hovered at 40
degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the second day in a
row.
	   Hospitals were on full alert to cope with heat-related
illnesses. The heat wave is expected to worsen by the weekend, with
temperatures reaching 42 degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit).
	   High temperatures and lack of wind combine to elevate air
pollution levels in the mountain-ringed Athens basin, home to
nearly five million people and 1.3 million cars.
	   Although no decision has yet been taken, the government has in
the past banned all traffic from the city center when air pollution
levels soared beyond danger limits.
	   Authorities set up special air-conditioned rooms for elderly
people and those with respiratory problems.
	   The government also opened state-run beaches, campsites and
air-conditioned hotel lobbies to the public.
	   One three-year old died earlier this week from heat stroke while
more than one hundred people have been hospitalized.
	   Heavy use of air-conditioners in the capital also pushed power
consumption to record levels, threatening to cause a blackout. On
Tuesday, nearly half of Athens was without power for four hours
after air conditioners overloaded the power grid.

UN agency says North Korea needs more food aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ North Korea will need another 500,000 tons of food
aid this year in addition to what has already been pledged, a U.N.
food agency said Thursday.
	   Based on a report by U.N. experts who visited the country last
month, the World Food Program said North Korea's food crisis ``is
far from over.''
	   The food supply situation ``remains precarious and is expected
to worsen over the next two critical months as stocks become
exhausted,'' the Rome-based agency said.
	   Hunger and malnutrition remain serious problems in North Korea
as a result of floods, drought and mismanagement of agriculture.
	   The U.N. agency called on donor nations and agencies to ensure
that food aid pledged -- some 800,000 tons -- arrives before the
next harvest in October.
	   It said it expected North Korea to buy 500,000 tons, leaving
another 500,000 tons in uncovered food needs.

Major cleanup planned for Colombo's beaches after oil spill

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Patches of black, sticky oil covered
stretches of the Sri Lankan capital's beaches Thursday after a
leaking pipeline spewed oil into the sea causing the worst spill
ever in this Indian Ocean island nation.
	   ``Fortunately, the prevailing monsoon has broken up the slick in
mid-ocean. But a lot of oil has got to the beach and will cause
serious damage to the reef,'' said Dhanapala Weerasekera, chairman
of Sri Lanka's Marine Pollution Prevention Authority. He said a
major cleanup was planned with the help of private companies.
	   Salvage officials said the oil had stopped spreading by
Thursday, after covering an area at least seven kilometers (4.3
miles) across.
	   ``We have got the situation under control,'' said Ariyaseela
Wickramanayake, chief executive of Master Divers Limited, the
salvage company handling the cleanup.
	   The government did not issue any special order closing Colombo's
beaches because the coastline already was off limits to civilians
for security reasons stemming from the civil war with Tamil
guerrillas.
	   About 70-100 tons of crude oil spilled on Tuesday when a
pipeline burst at an oil unloading buoy seven kilometers (4.3
miles) from shore.
	   Weerasekera said Tuesday's oil spill was the country's worst.
Previous spills have been too small to have been documented by
authorities.
	   The crew of the Iranian tanker MV Theotakas, which was unloading
86,000 tons of oil at the time, stopped pumping after noticing the
leak.
	   The pipeline, through which the state-run Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation brings in all the country's oil, was repaired on
Wednesday, said Wickramanayake. Sri Lanka imports all its oil from
the Middle East.
	   Weerasekera said an emergency response vessel which should have
been on standby was instead being used as a tugboat at the
pipeline, and so was not equipped with chemicals which could have
been used immediately to break up the oil slick.

Polish lawmakers lift ban on advertising beer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Parliament on Thursday lifted a ban on
advertising beer in Poland, arguing the five-year-old regulation
was too hard to enforce.
	   The decision, likely to receive the Senate's and the president's
approval, will put an end to discussions whether breweries infringe
on the law by advertising non-alcoholic beer.
	   The issue divided the government coalition of Solidarity, which
called for a total ban on beer advertising, and Freedom Union,
which opted for allowing beer ads. The vote was 219-194, with 16
abstentions in favor of Freedom Union's proposal.
	   Both parties agreed that the current ban was not effective and
advertisers could easily avoid it by indicating they advertise
alcohol-free beverages.
	   However, many of the advertised non-alcoholic beers were
unavailable in the stores and industry experts indicated sales were
minimal.
	   In 1993, Poland introduced a restrictive law that banned
advertising of beverages containing more than 1.5 percent alcohol.
Its supporters argued it could help reduce alcohol consumption in
Poland, which is among the highest levels in Europe.
	   But privatization of Poland's breweries since the country
toppled the communist system and launched market reforms, has
brought a change in Poles drinking preferences.
	   Beer recently has become the most popular alcoholic drink
replacing traditional Polish vodka, experts say.

World Cup: In France-Italy, friends turn foes for 90 minutes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-France-Italy &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ A bunch of friends are getting
together Friday to shoot the ball around, but it's not a
neighborhood pickup game. This is most important match of the World
Cup so far.
	   Listening to some of the French and Italian players, though,
this soccer match sounds more like a summer exhibition.
	   ``I really like him. What a joyful man,'' French defender Lilian
Thuram said of his Parma teammate Fabio Cannavaro.
	   ``He's a good friend and truly a great player,'' Italian goalie
Gianluca Pagliuca said in praise of his Inter Milan teammate Youri
Djorkaeff.
	   After spending most days of the year together, these friends
have been reduced to mobile phone calls over the past month from
separate national team training camps. Yet Friday they'll be
looking each other straight in the eye during the first
quarterfinal between Italy and France.
	   Italy hosts many French players each year in Serie A. But the
French intend to be as ungracious as possible on home turf at the
Stade de France.
	   ``We've been needling one another quite a bit already,'' said
Djorkaeff.
	   Likewise, the Italians will try to be unfriendly guests.
	   ``For 90 minutes Friday, there will be little friendship,'' said
Pagliuca, who has been leaving phone messages on Djorkaeff's
answering machine to discuss the match.
	   Instead of the usual psychological warfare before a game of such
importance, both sides have been lauding one another.
	   Whatever happens Friday, a half dozen Frenchmen know they'll be
spending the next 11 months in Italy.
	   ``And I don't want them ribbing me about the French loss the
whole year round,'' said French captain Didier Deschamps, who
together with star Zinedine Zidane, plays for Juventus Turin.
	   ``For the French playing in Italy, we will be even more
determined,'' said Parma's Alain Boghossian. ``There is just no way
we can lose. They'd be all over us when we return to our clubs.''
	   Don't ask Pagliuca. He knows.
	   In the last two France-Italy matches, Djorkaeff beat him each
time, a fact the goalie is not allowed to forget during the many
Inter training sessions.
	   ``Now, enough is enough,'' said Pagliuca.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Beginning a wistful farewell to venerable,
heart-stopping Kai Tak, officials on Thursday dedicated a gleaming,
new dlrs 20 billion airport that will make arriving at Hong Kong
much like any other major city.
	   Chinese officials, who had helped celebrate the first
anniversary of the return of mainland sovereignty the previous day,
presided over the ceremony along with Hong Kong Chief Executive
Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Opening of the huge facility, designed to secure Hong Kong's
place as a major Asian transportation center, was a cause for
celebration in what is otherwise a sobering time for the territory.
	   Although the relationship with China has developed better than
many had expected, the territory is struggling with a severe
economic downturn that has raised unemployment and sliced deeply
into stock and property values.
	   A multicolored Chinese dragon the length of the terminal and
including about 1,000 people inside joined in the ceremony, along
with lion dancers and musicians. But airport officials acknowledge
that the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok is
designed to be functional, not colorful.
	   After dedicating the airport, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
ended his visit to Hong Kong, boarding the ramp to his jumbo jet in
a squall for the first flight leaving the new airport. Hours later,
U.S. President Bill Clinton was to use Chek Lap Kok for his arrival
on the last stop of his tour of China.
	   The approach to 73-year-old Kai Tak skims over some of the most
crowded neighborhoods on the planet. Officially, it closes Sunday
night. The new airport opens for regular business Monday morning.
	   The new airport's eight-level passenger terminal, one of the
largest enclosed spaces in the world, features a metal wing-like
roof designed by British architect Norman Foster.
	   It was built on a manmade islet west of outlying Lantau island
by flattening two uninhabited islets and pushing back the sea. Half
of the world's dredging fleet converged here at one time to conduct
the reclamation work.
	   The glass-walled terminal gives a sweeping view of the mountains
and a glimpse of the ocean _ and plenty of sunlight _ unlike the
cramped, windowless passenger halls at Kai Tak. A driverless
shuttle train carries passengers under the central concourse.
	   Officials also claim it is the only airport where all air
bridges can accommodate jumbo jets.
	   Tung praised the new airport, the largest investment in the
history of Hong Kong, as a ``combination of the wisdom, diligence
and entrepreneurship of the Hong Kong people.''
	   He said other public spending on highways and educational
facilities would not only make Hong Kong a better place, but also
boost the economy.
	   Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen said the airport would make
exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland easier, as well as tie
Hong Kong more tightly into the world economy and enhance its
competitiveness.
	   He also gave Tung a vote of confidence, saying he was certain
Hong Kong could ride out its economic problems.
	   The airport project took seven years, and was a major cause of
dispute between China and Britain as they negotiated the handover.
But among those present for the dedication was British Deputy Prime
Minister John Prescott.
	   Although the terminal appeared complete on the inside, shops
still were shuttered and workers were likely to be putting the
finishing touches on the airport as Clinton arrived.
	   Several ceremonial flights have used the airport, located on an
island about 20 miles (35 kilometers) from the city, but airport
officials said Clinton will be the first passenger from outside
Hong Kong.

Two Lebanese freed in swap had already been free to go
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel held two Lebanese prisoners who had
completed their terms this spring for another three months so it
could use them in last week's swap with Lebanon, their Israeli
attorney said.
	   The Israel Prisons Authority had no immediate comment.
	   The two, Nabih Odeh and Ahmed Ismail, were among 60 Lebanese
prisoners freed by Israel on June 26 in exchange for the remains of
an Israeli soldier killed last year in an ambush in Lebanon.
	   Odeh and Ismail were both arrested in 1988 and sentenced to 15
years for planting roadside bombs. On April 1, they were ordered
released after serving two-thirds of their sentence, said Israeli
lawyer Leah Tsemel whose firm represented the two.
	   However, the two remained in prison beyond the release date.
Tsemel said she was told by the Prisons Authority at the time that
technical problems were holding up the release.
	   ``They (the Israeli authorities) knew there was going to be an
exchange. So they kept them to use them in the place of another two
whose sentences were not over,'' Tsemel said.
	   ``They purposely kept them for the exchange,'' Tsemel said.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
China highlighted touchy issues across Asia _ perhaps nowhere so
much as in India, which bristled at statements made by the American
leader and host Chinese President Jiang Zemin regarding nuclear
weapons.
	   Clinton was to fly to Hong Kong later Thursday, approaching the
end of a much-publicized visit that has sparked discussion of human
rights, trade policy, tensions on the Korean peninsula and other
hot topics in the region.
	   Clinton and Jiang issued a joint statement Saturday asking India
and Pakistan to make ``firm commitments'' not to deploy nuclear
weapons and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ``immediately
and unconditionally.''
	   India said it would not be dictated to by anyone. The Indian
foreign ministry accused Washington and Beijing of speaking with
the arrogance ``of a bygone era.'' India has been accused of
stepping up the South Asian nuclear arms race with a series of
nuclear tests in May that its longtime rival Pakistan answered by
conducting its own tests.
	   Pakistan called on Washington and Beijing to mediate competing
Indian and Pakistani claims to Kashmir. India has resisted outside
interference in the territorial dispute that has been at the heart
of their rivalry for five decades.

Most Asian markets surge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets surged Wednesday on
optimism that a plan to clean up Japan's troubled financial sector
will also revive regional economies.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 108.69
points, or 0.66 percent, closing at 16,471.58. The market's main
barometer now has climbed a total of 1,516.98 points in seven
trading days, including Wednesday's 532.62-point gain, or 3.36
percent.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 139.18 yen, up 0.94 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 138.07 yen overnight.
	   After the market closed, the Japanese government approved an
ambitious plan to assume control over failed banks and gradually
shut them down, a key component in initiatives to pull Japan out of
its worst recession since World War II.
	   The so-called ``bridge bank'' scheme, patterned after the U.S.
bailout of failed savings and loan institutions in the 1980s, is
designed to prevent bank failures from cutting off credit to
healthy borrowers and driving Japan deeper into economic
stagnation.
	   Anticipation of the plan had encouraged buying during market
hours.
	   Philippine shares also soared, buoyed by Wall Street's strong
performance overnight and upbeat regional stock markets. The
Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected issues rose 74.23
points, or 4.2 percent, to 1,856.19.
	   Thai stock prices closed sharply higher in line with regional
gains on the relative strength of the yen.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index gained 10.65 points, or 4.0
percent, closing at 277.98.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 323.06 points, or 3.8
percent, to 8,866.16.
	   Brokers said China's decision to cut interest rates Tuesday
boosted the Hong Kong market, where many Beijing-backed Hong Kong
companies are listed.
	   They said Japan's plans to bolster its economy before upper
house elections on July 12 also helped the Hong Kong bourse.
	   Share prices in Taiwan closed sharply higher for the second
consecutive session, boosted by an overnight gain on the U.S. stock
market and renewed strength in the Japanese yen.
	   The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 268.30
points, or 3.6 percent, to 7,817.11.
	   Singapore shares closed mostly higher on expectations for
Japan's financial clean-up plan. The benchmark Straits Times
Industrial Index Thursday closed 29.77 points, or 2.7 percent,
higher at 1,124.87.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed sharply higher for a
second straight day on the back of lower interest rates. The
NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 45.62 points, or 2.3 percent, to
2,054.20.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed higher in relatively heavy trading.
The Composite Index rose 9.832 points, or 2.2 percent, to 466.373.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher across the board.
The All Ordinaries Index rose 43.3 points, or 1.6 percent, to
2,742.7.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on renewed worries that more
banks could collapse because of a restructuring of South Korea's
financial sector. The key Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell
3.79 points, or 1.2 percent, to 311.77.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares prices closed higher. The key
Composite Index rose 6.97 points, or 1.4 percent, to 478.20.

NATO holds first seminar about democracy in Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO's chief assured
Bosnians on Thursday that they will continue to receive strong
international backing, but it's up to them to create a country of
European standards.
	   Secretary-General Javier Solana spoke at the opening of a
two-day NATO seminar in Sarajevo aimed at encouraging the
development of democratic practices in the country.
	   ``The key to a brighter future for Bosnia does not lie in
Brussels with the European Union or NATO. Nor does it lie in New
York with the United Nations. The key is right here with you. You
are holding it in your hands,'' Solana said.
	   ``There is no law that condemns the Balkans to be a region of
perennial turmoil and conflict,'' as long as there is the will in
Bosnia's next generation to change it, he said.
	   Participating in the seminar are political, defense, academic
and media leaders from all parts of Bosnia and all three ethnic
areas _ Croat, Muslim and Serb.
	   Solana said the world needs Bosnia as a model for ethnic
pluralism and tolerance, particularly for the neighboring Yugoslav
province of Kosovo where an ethnic and secessionist conflict is
escalating.
	   ``The reconstruction of Bosnia shows perhaps the most powerful
cooperative momentum in Europe's recent history,'' and that's why
the significance of Bosnia's evolution goes beyond Bosnia itself,
he said.
	   ``We have learned that we cannot be secure if our neighbors
remain insecure,'' the NATO chief said.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two policemen were shot and killed in an
elevator as they arrived to investigate an alleged dispute at an
apartment building Thursday, officials said.
	   The policemen, Volodymyr Obodovsky, 38, and Serhiy Krasylo, 28,
were murdered on the sixth floor of an apartment building in the
eastern city of Kharkiv, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Obodovsky and Krasylo were going to check one of the apartments
after they received a telephone call about a family quarrel that
allegedly started there.
	   The daily Fakty quoted a police officer in Kharkiv as saying the
call was staged in order to lure the policemen there. The killers
took the policemen's guns and disappeared.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police shot and killed three
robbers who had looted a goldsmith shop in Malaysia's central state
of Perak on Thursday, a news report said.
	   Acting on a tip, police went to a hotel room, where one man
opened fire after officers identified themselves, the national news
agency Bernama reported. Police returned fire, killing all three
men inside, it added.
	   In the room, it said, police found two pistols, 10 rounds of
ammunition and jewelry worth 1 million ringgit (dlrs 250,000). The
shooting came about 45 minutes after a robbery at the Soon Yik
Goldsmith shop in Ipoh city, 205 kilometers (123 miles) northwest
of Kuala Lumpur.

Philippine stocks surge, peso edges higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks surged Thursday on
a technical rebound aided by Wall Street's strong overnight
performance, upbeat regional stock markets and an uptick in the
local currency, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index jumped 74.23
points, or 4.2 percent, to 1,856.19, following Wednesday's 1.2
percent rise.
	   Traders said investors took heart from the Dow Jones Industrial
Average's 1.1 percent advance overnight, which was followed by
gains in other Asian markets.
	   The peso's moderate rise against the dollar also boosted
investor confidence in Manila shares, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.310 pesos for the day, down from
Wednesday's 41.528 pesos.
	   Traders said also aiding the peso's ascent was thin corporate
demand for dollars.
	   Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc., said the
strong stock market rally wasn't a surprise since investors have
been generally negative for quite some time toward the Asian
region.
	   ``More stimulus is forthcoming from Japan as it presents a
concrete plan to help its banking system,'' he said, referring to
Japan's proposed bridge bank plan, which was announced late
Thursday in Asia but was anticipated in the markets earlier. The
plan is intended to deal with bad loans in that nation's banking
sector.
	   A positive reaction to the bridge bank plan is expected to help
the Japanese yen shake off its recent sluggish performance against
the U.S. currency.
	   The weakening of the yen in past sessions has weighed on other
regional currencies and Asian stocks.
	   However, traders urged investors to remain cautious.
	   Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales of Abacus Securities
Corp., said profit-taking may set in as early as Friday as
investors don't want to be caught with heavy positions in the
market over the weekend.
	   Siao said the main index has been rising since Monday so
profit-takers may be eager to cash in on gains.
	   The index has risen 132.82 points so far this week.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Airbus will sell as many as 30 more of its
jetliners to U.S. Airways, the two firms said Thursday, in the
latest step by the European consortium toward equal footing with
the mighty U.S. jetmaker Boeing.
	   The U.S. airline, which has already ordered more than 100 planes
from Airbus, is to buy up to 30 more widebody A330-300s, officials
said in a joint statement.
	   Airbus said the deal was the first time a U.S.-based airline had
ordered a fly-by-wire widebody jet from the jetmaker. Boeing has
long dominated the market with its conventional technology, and
only recently began to compete with Airbus with the new technology.
	   ``U.S. Airways will have the most modern fleet in the air within
just a few years time,'' U.S. Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf said in
a statement ahead of a news conference in Paris with Airbus
Managing Director Noel Forgeard.
	   The fly-by-wire system is a fully computerized guidance system
that performs many tasks previously done by pilots.

Victims of radical Islamic arson attack commemorated in Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Thousands of people staged memorial
marches in several Turkish cities Thursday to mark the fifth
anniversary of a fatal arson attack by Islamic extremists.
	   The fire killed 37 leftist intellectuals who had gathered in a
hotel in the central city of Sivas to commemorate a 16th century
poet who was hanged for his opposition to religious oppression.
	   While the victims were trapped in the hotel, the attackers kept
firefighters from the scene and chanted slogans of an illegal
radical Islamic group.
	   The marchers Thursday carried banners bearing pictures of the
victims. In Istanbul, demonstrators threw red carnations into the
sea in memory of the dead.
	   Sivas is about 350 kilometers (220 miles) east of Ankara.
	   Last year, a court sentenced 33 Islamic extremists to death for
setting the hotel on fire. They have appealed.

Downplaying comments on one China, Taiwan's president praises
</HEADLINE>
Clinton &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In comments seemingly aimed at putting a
brave face on a foreign policy defeat, Taiwan's leader on Thursday
praised U.S. President Bill Clinton for maintaining his commitments
to this island.
	   Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui said Clinton was true to his
promise that his visit to China would not harm Taiwan's interests
or change U.S. policy _ particularly on arms sales to the island.
	   Lee said Taiwan affirmed Clinton's ``integrity in honoring his
guarantees,'' and added that he hoped better U.S.-Chinese relations
would make it easier for Taiwan to deal with the mainland.
	   But Lee's comments were at odds with concerns about Clinton's
remarks on Taiwan policy being expressed by government officials,
newspaper commentators and academics.
	   Lee made no mention of a statement by Clinton on Tuesday of what
is known as the ``three no's'' policy: no support for Taiwan's
independence, no recognition for a separate Taiwan government and
no backing for Taiwan's membership in international organizations
such as the United Nations.
	   Clinton did not put the policy in writing, or make concessions
on arms sales to Taiwan. But his statement was widely seen here as
throwing cold water on Taiwan's attempts to assert itself
internationally.
	   It was also seen as a concession to China, slanting U.S. policy
toward Beijing's view that Taiwan is a breakaway province to be
brought back within the fold eventually.
	   China says Taiwan has no right to international recognition, and
threatens to invade the island if it declares independence.
	   Though expressing nothing new in content, the policy statement
had never before been made explicitly in public by an American
president.
	   Taiwan has been united with China for just four years in the
last century, and last split when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists
fled here ahead of the Communist takeover of the mainland in 1949.
	   The Nationalists claim to back reunification, but not on
Beijing's terms.
	   Though roiled by Clinton's comments, Taiwan also sees his visit
as making China more amenable to talking. That would bode well for
negotiations between the sides that now show signs of resuming
after a break of more than three years.
	   On the day Clinton arrived in China, Beijing invited Taiwan's
top negotiator to make an informal visit in September or October.
Taiwan hopes that will pave the way for semiofficial organizations
from the two sides to resume their dialogue.
	   China suspended talks in June 1995 over a visit by Lee to the
United States. It considered the trip confirmation of its
suspicions that he was turning his back on the official policy of
reunification.

Air Lanka to increase flights to London, Paris, Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's national carrier Air Lanka
will increase flights to London, Paris and Frankfurt in October as
part of a management strategy to increase profits, an airline
official said Thursday.
	   A regular biweekly flight to Amsterdam, which started 15 years
ago, will be terminated this month because it is losing money, said
the official who did not want to be identified.
	   The decision to increase flights to take advantage of Sri
Lanka's peak tourism season was the first major decision made by
Emirates Airlines after it acquired a 40 percent stake and
management control of Air Lanka in April for dlrs 70 million.
	   The new management is also considering expanding operations to
include other destinations like Asia and South Africa. But these
changes will be made only in late 1999, the official said.

Hagi quits national soccer team after 16 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Gheorghe Hagi, the best Romanian
soccer player of his generation, has retired from the national team
after 16 years and a lukewarm performance in the World Cup, he said
Thursday.
	   Known for his superb technical skills and intelligence, Hagi,
33, peaked in the early 1990s. Called the Maradona of the
Carpathians, Hagi was a key figure in the World Cup 1990 and 1994
finals.
	   But his star dimmed in recent years and he was often plagued by
injury. Despite that, he is very popular in Istanbul where he plays
for Galatasaray.
	   He will continue playing for the club.
	   Debuting at 17, Hagi played 114 times for Romania and scored 33
goals. He was known as the ``brain in the team.'' He will still
keep his hand in Romanian soccer and has said that he wants to help
fight corruption in the national league.
	   After the 1989 fall of communism, he played for Real Madrid,
Brescia, Italy, Barcelona and Galatasaray.

EU inflation rate up slightly in May
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's annual inflation
rate stood at 1.6 percent in May, up 0.1 percent compared with the
year-earlier period, the EU's statistics agency reported Thursday.
	   But the EU inflation rate in May remained stable compared with
April, Eurostat said.
	   Inflation in the 11 countries that will take part in the single
currency when it is launched on January 1, 1999, remained stable at
1.4 percent compared with April. It also stood at 1.4 in May 1997.
	   The highest inflation rates in May were registered in Greece (5
percent) and Ireland (2.4 percent), while the lowest rates were in
France and Austria, both at 1 percent.
	   Compared with a year earlier, the largest increases in the rates
were in Finland (0.9 percent to 1.6 percent) and in Ireland (1.4
percent to 2.4 percent.)
	   Inflation dropped most in Denmark (2.2 percent to 1.4 percent)
and in Austria (1.3 percent to 1.0 percent).
	   Other Eurostat figures for May 1998 (May 1997 figures in
brackets): France, 1.0 (0.9); Belgium, 1.3 (1.4); Germany, 1.1
(1.4); Spain, 2.0 (1.3); Italy, 2.0 (1.8); Luxembourg, 1.3 (1.1);
Netherlands, 2.1 (1.6); Portugal, 2.2 (1.9); Greece, 5.0 (5.4);

Cyprus to send home passengers of drifting trawler
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus will send home 109 Arabs and
Africans whose vessel bound for Europe drifted for nine days in the
eastern Mediterranean before it was rescued by a Ukrainian ship.
	   None of the passengers, mostly men in their 20s and 30s, has
applied for asylum, Interior Minister Dinos Michaelides said in
remarks published Thursday by the daily Philelftheros.
	   The Syrian-flagged Rida Allah, Arabic for ``God's blessing,''
left Tripoli in northern Lebanon on June 18 with a six-man crew. It
soon developed engine trouble, and its passengers fought over
scarce food and water. Two men died of thirst.
	   The ship was towed Monday to the southern port of Limassol, and
authorities found that none of the passengers had travel documents.
	   Cyprus does not have the legal framework to deal with requests
for political asylum, and has not ratified the section of the
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights that
provides for the right of asylum seekers to challenge an expulsion
order.
	   ``Cyprus does not have the resources of, say, European Union
countries to play the role of a land of hope and promise,'' said
parliament member Prodromos Prodromou of President Glafcos
Clerides' Democratic Rally party. ``But there exists the political
will to modernize our laws and harmonize them with those in the
EU.''
	   Many of the survivors, who are being kept under guard at a
Limassol hotel, said they had no wish to return to their countries.

American paratroopers train with Uzbekistan counterparts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ American paratroopers have begun
training exercises with their Uzbek counterparts as part of a
NATO-led program to develop stronger ties with former Soviet
republics.
	   The exercises began Wednesday when 25 American paratroopers
jumped from a U.S. military aircraft into the Fergana region in
eastern Uzbekistan. The plane flew direct from Camp Lejeune, a
Marine Corps base in North Carolina.
	   The Americans were joined by 125 Uzbekistan soldiers from the
Central Asian Battalion, which includes soldiers from Kazakstan and
Kyrgyzstan as well. The exercises will run until June 14.
	   The training is part of NATO's Partnership for Peace,
established in 1994 as way to develop military links with former
Warsaw Pact nations and ex-Soviet republics.
	   American paratroopers have previously held exercises in the
region as part of the Partnership for Peace program.

China looks forward to fair elections in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China, which quickly backed Cambodian Premier Hun
Sen after he ousted a rival in a coup last year, said Thursday it
looked forward to peaceful, fair elections in Cambodia.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang called the election on
July 26 ``a major event in the political life of the Cambodian
people.''
	   ``China hopes that the election in Cambodia will proceed
smoothly in a peaceful, tranquil and fair environment,'' Tang told
reporters at a twice-weekly briefing.
	   Beijing has played a crucial role in Cambodia's troubled
politics over the past quarter-century. It backed Pol Pot's Khmer
Rouge, which swept to power in 1975. Four years later, China went
to war with Vietnam after Vietnamese troops ousted Cambodia's
radical communist government.
	   China continued to support the Khmer Rouge as part of a
coalition of forces trying to unseat the Vietnamese-installed
government led by Hun Sen. Chinese leaders have also maintained
ties with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, a relationship that
dates back to the 1950s' high tide of Third World fraternalism.
	   After Hun Sen forced out coalition partner Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, the king's son, in a violent coup last July, China
endorsed Hun Sen. Soon after the coup, the Cambodian leader closed
down Taiwan's representative office.
	   Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province with no right to
diplomatic relations and has been trying to halt Taiwanese efforts
to upgrade its unofficial ties in Southeast Asia.

Muslim scholars from more than 70 countries discuss globalization

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Islamic scholars, religious leaders and
ministers from more than 70 countries urged Muslims Thursday to
welcome scientific progress as long as it agrees with Islamic law.
	   The annual conference, sponsored by Egypt's Ministry of
Religious Endowments, is held annually in Cairo. This year's
meetings will focus on ``Islam and the 21st Century.''
	   ``Any scientific progress is welcomed by Islamic law, as long as
this progress is to serve the rights, moral qualities and what God
permitted for human beings,'' Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, the sheik of
al-Azhar, said in a speech that opened the meeting.
	   Al-Azhar is the leading center of religious study among Sunni
Muslims, and Tantawi is a prominent figure among Muslim scholars.
	   Dozens of people attended the meeting, most of them affiliated
in some way to Muslim governments. Also attending were delegates
from Europe and the United States and some Christian leaders.
	   Delegates were not specific about issues in which progress might
contradict Islamic law, but in the past debates over cloning and
organ transplants have divided Muslim scholars. Another issue is
the Internet, a technology with almost universal support but one
that worries some by providing access to pornography.
	   Fears over globalization and the threat of Western influence to
non-Western countries were also worries for many at the meeting.
	   ``If globalization means melting and losing identity, cultures
and heritage, and superpowers' control of smaller or weaker
countries, Islam rejects this,'' said Ahmed M. ElHattab, assistant
secretary-general of the Islamic Society of North America.
	   ``But is Islam against the understanding of globalization and
against the understanding of brotherhood, coordination and
integration among the people of this planet? I believe that Islam
urges this,'' added ElHattab, who headed the American delegation.
	   Pope Shenouda III, the head of the Coptic Christian church, said
devout people should welcome development _ within limits.
	   ``The world is developing and we should develop with it,'' he
said. ``We do not develop values and principles, these are
constants. We develop in technology, telecommunication.''

Ex-sports tycoon Tapie loses final appeal in fraud case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's highest appeals court on Thursday upheld a
six-month jail term for fraud against Bernard Tapie, the ex-sports
tycoon and former leftist government minister.
	   The Court of Cassation ruled that Tapie evaded taxes by
deliberately misleading authorities about his luxury yacht, the
Phocea. The court also upheld a 12-month suspended sentence.
	   However, it was not clear whether Tapie, 55, would be jailed.
	   Tapie, the former owner of the soccer team Olympique Marseille,
has already served more than five months in jail for bribing soccer
players on an opposing team to throw a 1993 match.
	   His lawyers said Thursday they would seek to have the new
sentence annulled on account of time already served in jail,
despite the fact that both cases were different.
	   Judicial sources said it might take several weeks for a ruling
to be reached.
	   Last year, an appeals court upheld a lower court ruling against
Tapie for him to serve six months in jail, as well as a 12-month
suspended sentence. Tapie took the case to the Court of Cassation.
	   Tapie, a former urban affairs minister and owner of Adidas, was
convicted of evading more than 12 million francs (dlrs 2 million)
by declaring the Phocea as a business expense from 1989 to 1991.
	   The appeals court in 1997 also upheld a 30-month suspended
sentence against Tapie for diverting company funds for the 74-meter
(242-foot) boat.
	   He was convicted of having used an 80 million franc (dlrs 13.7
million) loan to the company Alain Colas-Tahiti from SDBO, a
subsidiary of the debt-ridden state bank Credit Lyonnais. Some of
the funds were used to prop up Olympique Marseille.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A commission representing hundreds of U.S.
finance officials has cleared the way for sanctions against Swiss
banks suspected of holding the assets of Holocaust victims.
	   Alan Hevesi, chairman of the commission, said negotiations
between the banks and Holocaust survivors seeking their families'
assets ``reached a total stone-like impasse.'' The group decided
Wednesday to lift its moratorium on sanctions against Swiss banks.
	   California will become the first state to impose sanctions.
Treasurer Matt Fong, who oversees dlrs 32 billion in state funds,
said California will not seek new contracts with U.S. subsidiaries
of Swiss banks.
	   Hevesi, the comptroller of New York City, and New York State
Comptroller H. Carl McCall said they would outline Thursday morning
a series of sanctions that would begin taking effect in 45 to 60
days unless a settlement was reached, according to a report in The
New York Times.
	   Hevesi, Fong, McCall and officials from Pennsylvania and
Delaware said Wednesday that they would recommend to 800 other
state and local officials that comprise the commission to begin
applying sanctions to prod the Swiss government into joining new
negoatiations.

China, Kazakstan to sign border agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China and Kazakstan will sign a third and final
agreement demarcating their border at a weekend summit, the Chinese
Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	   The agreement will boost Chinese efforts to monitor the porous
1,600-kilometer (1,000-mile) frontier and stanch the flow of arms
and money to Muslim separatist groups in Xinjiang, China's restive
northwestern region bordering Kazakstan.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin will meet with Kazak President
Nursultan Nazarbayev in Almaty, the former Kazak capital, on Friday
and Saturday. The border agreement follows two others in 1994 and
1996 and settles disputes on two sections of the frontier, said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang.
	   ``The border issue between the two countries will be settled in
a comprehensive and thorough manner. This is of great significance
for promoting long-term and stable friendly relations between the
two countries,'' Tang said at a twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Jiang was also supposed to take part in a summit with the
leaders of Russia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, their
third such meeting in three years.
	   It was unclear what if any agreements would come out of the
meeting. Russian President Boris Yeltsin pulled out of the summit
last month, citing the economic crisis in Russia.
	   At their five-nation summits in Shanghai in 1996 and Moscow in
1997, the leaders agreed to reduce troop levels along their
frontiers and ease tensions.
	   Chinese leaders have deftly courted the governments of the
neighboring Central Asian nations to undermine support for
independence by Uighurs, the Turkic-speaking, Muslim ethnic group
that dominates Xinjiang.

Anglican priest tells court he had sex with two boys

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Anglican court told a court
Thursday he had oral sex with two street boys, adding he regretted
his actions, his lawyer said.
	   Michael Taylor, 35, said that he was under stress at the time
and the incident came after his parents died, his lawyer Jean
Talupca said after the hearing.
	   The vicar was caught by police and film cameras in an apartment
used by prostitutes in a seedy area of Bucharest last August
wearing only his underpants and sitting next to a naked boy on the
bed.
	   Although he initially pleaded guilty, he then said he was
innocent, claiming he had made a bargain for his release with
police.
	   Judge Tatiana Zorila will likely pronounce the sentence in a
week. Her decision will be published the next day.
	   He faces a jail sentence of two to seven years.
	   Talupca suggested one of the boys was a prostitute, citing three
cases in which the boy was accused of receiving money for sex.
	   Prosecutors accused Taylor, from Essex in eastern England, of
visiting Romania often and being involved in sex tourism, Talupca
said.
	   Taylor did not allow journalists in the courtroom.
	   Character witnesses from England were at the trial and one of
them handed Zorila a batch of support mail, attesting to Taylor's
allegedly good character.
	   Since the fall of communism in 1989 which revealed 100 unwanted
children languishing in state orphanages, Romania has attracted
foreign pedophiles, who hang around rail stations and pick up their
prey.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A huge car bomb exploded in a crowded
downtown area of Hungary's capital on Thursday, killing three
people and injuring more than 20, officials said.
	   The bomb was attached to a Mercedes-Benz that blew up shortly
after noon on busy Aranykez Street, in an area packed with shoppers
and pedestrians.
	   Two men and a woman were killed and another person was in
critical condition, the state news agency MTI said.
	   The blast smashed shop windows as far as 100 meters (yards)
away, and blew in the windows of a nearby McDonald's restaurant
filled with lunch-time customers.
	   Fire engines and ambulances rushed to the scene and police
cordoned off the area.

Short circuit blamed for chandelier's fall near new president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A short circuit, not assassins or
evil spirits, caused a chandelier to nearly fall on Philippine
President Joseph Estrada on his first day in office, his executive
secretary said Thursday.
	   ``It was a case of ill fortune,'' Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora said of Tuesday's incident. ``We are not looking at an
assassination attempt.''
	   Estrada had ordered his security staff to investigate the case,
which he called ``very suspicious.'' He also asked his spiritual
adviser to sprinkle holy water in the room to ward off bad luck.
	   Estrada said he would ask for a blessing of the rest of the
palace later.
	   Estrada, who was sworn into office as the country's 13th
president on Tuesday, was leaving the presidential palace music
room to induct new members of his Cabinet when the chandelier
dropped to the floor.
	   The superstitious new president jokes about rumors of ghosts in
the palace and tries to avoid being referred to as the country's
13th president because of the bad luck associated with the number.
	   Also Thursday, Zamora said Estrada is having a special
presidential assistance office expanded to allow people greater
access to him.
	   Estrada, a former B-movie star who won by landslide on a
pro-poor platform in the May 11 elections, has promised to open the
presidential palace to the public and listen directly to them.
	   ``There are many who come in without appointments,'' Zamora
said. ``These people will be entertained.''

EU approves state aid to Chemieanlagenbau Stassfurt AG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission on Thursday approved 42.39 million marks (dlrs 23.4
million) in state aid to the German chemical manufacturer
Chemieanlagenbau Stassfurt AG.
	   ``The aid will allow the restructuring of the company and make
it profitable in the long term,'' the EU executive body said in a
statement.
	   It said the funds are in line with EU rules on state aid for the
rescue and restructuring of firms in difficulty. The Commission is
empowered to veto state aid plans which it judges hinder fair
competition rules in the 15-nation bloc.

Bus careens off road killing 16 people, injuring 26 others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A bus plunged off a mountain road in
northwestern Pakistan on Thursday killing 16 people and injuring
another 26 others, many of them seriously, the state-run news
agency reported.
	   The bus apparently was overcrowded with passengers hanging on
the sides and sitting on the roof. The driver reportedly lost
control of the vehicle while trying to negotiate a sharp turn in
the road, said The Associated Press of Pakistan, quoting police
officials in the remote region.
	   The wounded were taken to the nearest hospital in Mansehra, some
200 kilometers (120 miles) northwest of the federal capital of
Islamabad.
	   The accident was under investigation, the police said.

Russian Central Bank reserves rise to dlrs 16 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boosted by Russia's recent international bond
offering, the Central Bank's hard currency reserves have risen to
dlrs 16 billion, up from dlrs 14.7 billion the week before, the
bank announced Thursday.
	   The reserves had been shrinking for months as the government
spent dollars to buy rubles and prevent a devaluation of the
Russian currency. There have been concerns that the government will
have to give up the defense of the ruble if its reserves dip too
low.
	   But a successful bond offering helped boost reserves.
	   Still, the Russian government wants a new International Monetary
Fund loan of at least dlrs 10 billion to shore up the Central
Bank's reserves. The Kremlin fears that if the ruble is devalued,
it will lead to higher prices.
	   Meanwhile, Russian commercial banks announced that they have
financed the production of 80 metric tons (88 tons) of gold this
year, and may export as much as 50 metric tons (55 tons) of the
total, news reports said Thursday.
	   Commercial banks intend to use gold mainly as collateral for
hard-currency loans, Interfax news agency quoted Sergei Yegorov,
president of the Association of Russian Banks, as saying.
	   Until recently, the government was the main source of funding
for the gold industry.

DNA tests ordered for immigrants to determine Jewish roots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Russian immigrants whose Jewish parentage is in
question have been asked to submit to DNA tests, the Interior
Ministry confirmed Thursday.
	   Community activists said the practice was humiliating. They said
dozens of immigrants have already been asked to take the tests and
that those who refuse to cooperate risk eventual deportation.
	   The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the tests are
administered only as a last resort to verify an immigrant's Jewish
background.
	   The minister of immigrant absorption, Yuli Edelstein, said he
had not heard of the practice and would look into the matter.
	   In the last decade, nearly 800,000 immigrants came to Israel
from the former Soviet Union. Under Israel's Law of Return, those
who can show that they have a Jewish grandparent are eligible for
citizenship as well as government benefits.
	   With the economic boom of the 1990s, Israel has become an
attractive place to live, and government officials have expressed
concern about reports of widespread fraud of documents that allow
immigrants to settle in Israel illegally.
	   Immigrants, in turn, have complained of humiliating treatment by
Israeli authorities.
	   Alex Tanzer, who heads an immigrants' rights committee, said he
has received dozens of complaints about government requests for DNA
testing. He said immigrants risk deportation if they refuse to
cooperate.
	   ``They (the authorities) need to stop insulting people. To be
asked to have your Jewish genealogy checked is painful. If the
testing must be done it should be requested before immigration,''
Tanzer said.

Dutch woman sentenced to 8 years for manslaughter in ``house of
</HEADLINE>
horrors'' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEUWARDEN, Netherlands (AP) _ In a highly-publicized case, a
52-year-old Dutch woman was convicted of manslaughter Thursday for
killing two men and burying their bodies in her garden.
	   The defendant, identified only as M. van der E. in line with
Dutch privacy rules, faces 8 years in prison and psychiatric
treatment.
	   An unidentified 26-year-old male accomplice was sentenced to
three years in prison for manslaughter and for helping Van der E.
bury one of the victims.
	   The woman ran a boarding house which has been dubbed by Dutch
newspapers as the ``house of horrors'' following the two deaths.
	   According to the Leeuwarden district court verdict, the woman
bludgeoned the two men to death with a hammer in June and December
of last year.
	   One of the victims was a guest at the boarding house in the
northern Dutch town of Anjum, but the relationship between Van der
E. and the other victim was unclear.
	   The bodies of the victims, aged 38 and 26, were discovered by
police in the garden and exhumed last December.
	   No motive for the killings has been established.
	   ``That's the big question, we don't know any motives,'' said a
court spokeswoman who gave her name only as C. Pietersen.
	   ``There was enough to convict her but she denied everything,''
Pietersen added.

Khatami calls for dialogue with the European Union
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami said Iran wants
to improve relations with the European Union and is calling on
Italy to act a bridge between the two sides, the official Iranian
news agency reported Thursday.
	   Speaking at a Wednesday banquet for visiting Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi, Khatami said that ``Italy can continue to
act as a bridge in Iran-EU relations as it has done before,'' the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Khatami said relations should be based on ``mutual respect and
safeguarding common interests,'' the agency reported.
	   Prodi left Iran Wednesday after a two-day visit.
	   On Wednesday, Prodi said he hoped his visit to Iran would help
ease the country's international isolation.
	   Khatami has tried to improve ties with the West since taking
office in August. He has promoted cultural and sports exchanges
with the United States and eased social restrictions imposed by the
clergy after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
	   Prodi, the first EU leader to travel to Iran since a 1992 visit
by Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, said Wednesday that
strengthening cooperation with Iran was a priority for his country.
	   Prodi also met Wednesday with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, Iranian television reported
	   The 15-nation EU broke off regular meetings with Iranian
officials and withdrew its ambassadors in April 1997 after a German
court implicated the Tehran government in the 1992 assassination of
four Iranian dissidents in Berlin. The envoys returned late last
year and in March the EU agreed to resume dialogue with Iran.
	   Iran has had no diplomatic ties with the United States since
Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and
held Americans hostage for 444 days.
	   Tehran is seeking to increase trade with Italy, its fourth
biggest trading partner. Trade between the two countries totaled
dlrs 2.3 billion last year.

Russia cracks down on Gazprom, country's largest company
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prime minister threatened Thursday to
seize assets from the country's largest company, Gazprom, unless
the natural gas monopoly starts paying its back taxes, news
agencies reported.
	   The government and its new tax czar are trying to dig Russia out
of its financial crisis, caused largely by the government's
inability to collect taxes. Tax cheats include the country's
largest companies, as well as most of its citizens.
	   Gazprom controls production and distribution of Russia's vast
natural gas supplies, and is one of Western Europe's largest
suppliers.
	   The state owns 40 percent of the company, but allowed the former
chairman to manage that stake as part of a deal that has come under
increasing criticism.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko ordered officials Thursday
cancel the deal and tighten Kremlin control over the company.
	   It was not clear whether the actions would be rescinded if
Gazprom pays its estimated 2.45 billion rubles (dlrs 400 million)
in back taxes.
	   ``If Gazprom pays, everything will be all right,'' said Deputy
Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, without elaborating.
	   Gazprom says it cannot pay the taxes because its customers _
many of them government-funded enterprises _ have not paid their
bills.
	   The moves come after heavy pressure from the International
Monetary Fund to reform the gas pricing system and allow
competitors access to Gazprom's pipeline network.
	   As a precondition for a dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion loan,
the fund is demanding the government to step up its poor tax
collections. Russia desperately needs the money to help stabilize
its plummeting financial markets.
	   In addition to the states, Gazprom's other owners are believed
to include powerful political and business figures, including
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Foreign investors also
hold a small stake.

Myanmar blames tourist shortfall on `subversives'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar-Crackdown &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Admitting that a major tourism campaign
came up short, a leader of Myanmar's military government has blamed
``internal subversive elements'' for discouraging visitors.
	   The government launched Visit Myanmar Year in November 1996,
hoping to attract at least 250,000 visitors over the following 12
months.
	   Pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi
appealed to foreigners to stay away, saying tourism ``could benefit
only small groups of people'' and prolong military rule.
	   Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the top four generals of the ruling
State Peace and Development Council, attacked her stance in remarks
to a tourism development committee reported Thursday by the
state-run press.
	   ``Due to the negative propaganda of the internal subversive
elements, visits of tourists did not come up to expectations and
the local entrepreneurs had suffered great loss,'' Khin Nyunt was
quoted as saying.
	   Khin Nyunt said local and foreign entrepreneurs had invested
large sums of money in hotels and transport, expecting that Visit
Myanmar Year would draw large numbers of foreigners to one of
Asia's most picturesque countries.
	   Khin Nyunt said that tourism benefits the public rather than the
government, an implicit criticism of Suu Kyi that was the second in
the press this week.
	   On Monday, an article suggested the government ``can no longer
tolerate'' her political activities and held out the prospect of a
long prison term.
	   Suu Kyi has been under house arrest or close confinement for
most of the past nine years. The military has ruled Myanmar, also
known as Burma, since 1962.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Anglican priest told a court
Thursday he had oral sex with two street boys, adding he regretted
his actions, his lawyer said.
	   Michael Taylor, 35, said that he was under stress at the time
and the incident came after his parents died, his lawyer Jean
Talupca said after the hearing.
	   The vicar was caught by police and film cameras in an apartment
used by prostitutes in a seedy area of Bucharest last August
wearing only his underpants and sitting next to a naked boy on the
bed.
	   Although he initially pleaded guilty, he then said he was
innocent, claiming he had made a bargain for his release with
police.
	   Judge Tatiana Zorila will likely pronounce the sentence in a
week. Her decision will be published the next day.
	   He faces a jail sentence of two to seven years.
	   Talupca suggested one of the boys was a prostitute, citing three
cases in which the boy was accused of receiving money for sex.
	   Prosecutors accused Taylor, from Essex in eastern England, of
visiting Romania often and being involved in sex tourism, Talupca
said.
	   Taylor did not allow journalists in the courtroom.
	   Character witnesses from England were at the trial and one of
them handed Zorila a batch of support mail, attesting to Taylor's
allegedly good character.
	   Since the fall of communism in 1989 which revealed 100,000
unwanted children languishing in state orphanages, Romania has
attracted foreign pedophiles, who hang around rail stations and
pick up their prey.

10 Catholic churches attacked as hatred rises over Orange march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout; UPDATES with 10th church, three Catholic homes
attacked
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Arsonists attacked 10 Catholic
churches overnight, wrecking three, in a coordinated campaign
linked with rising sectarian passions over Northern Ireland's most
divisive march.
	   Police and politicians blamed the attacks on thugs determined to
punish British authorities for instructing the Orange Order,
Northern Ireland's major pro-British Protestant fraternal group,
not to march through the main Catholic section of Portadown this
weekend.
	   Nine churches targeted after midnight Thursday were in isolated
and predominantly Protestant rural areas between Belfast and
Portadown 30 miles (50 kms) to the southwest. Another church in
overwhelmingly Protestant east Belfast suffered minor damage late
Wednesday.
	   Also early Thursday, two Catholic homes had gasoline bombs
thrown at them on the predominantly Protestant east side of
Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second-largest city. Another
Catholic-occupied home on north Belfast's staunchly Protestant
Shore Road had flower pots thrown through its windows. None of the
occupants was injured.
	   No group claimed responsibility for any of the attacks, but
police linked the attacks to members of an outlawed pro-British
gang, the Loyalist Volunteer Force. The LVF, based in Portadown,
called a cease-fire in May after coming under intense police
pressure but opposes the entire peace process.
	   ``It is appalling that people have returned to this type of
activity at a time when new political horizons are emerging,'' said
Adam Ingram, Britain's minister responsible for security and
victims in Northern Ireland.
	   The Protestant and Catholic politicians elected Wednesday to
head Northern Ireland's new compromise government, David Trimble
and Seamus Mallon, jointly condemned the violence.
	   ``At a time of hope for the future of Northern Ireland, society
can ill afford these acts of sectarian madness,'' said Trimble,
leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, which has formal links with
the Orange Order and supports its right to march where it wants.
	   ``The individuals behind these attacks have no respect for
themselves nor their God,'' said Seamus Mallon, the moderate
Catholic deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party.
The SDLP wants Orangemen to negotiate with Catholic militants, who
for the past three years have tried to block the Portadown march.
	   Even the Rev. Ian Paisley _ bitter opponent of the accord and
leader of his own virulently anti-Catholic church _ called the
arsonists ``criminal and disgraceful. They cannot make any claim to
be true Protestants, for Protestantism's genius is civil and
religious liberty for all,'' he said.
	   Orange leaders have called for their approximately 80,000
members not to commit acts of violence in response to the
government's determination to prevent about 2,000 Portadown
Orangemen from marching this Sunday from a rural Anglican church
past Catholic homes on Portadown's Garvaghy Road.
	   But Orangemen are plotting a campaign of civil disobedience _
launching surprise parades and blocking roadways across Northern
Ireland _ in hopes of stretching police reserves and forcing
authorities to reverse the decision. Such tactics inevitably lead
to violent confrontations with the 13,000-strong police force and
19,000 British troops based in Northern Ireland.
	   In 1996, police caved in to the Orangemen after four nights of
Protestant mayhem, clearing Catholic protesters off Garvaghy Road
and triggering three nights of Catholic riots.
	   Last year police opted to club Catholic protesters off the
roadway, getting the Orange parade through easily but triggering
four nights of widespread Catholic rioting, during which several
Protestant churches were burned.
	   Meanwhile Thursday, Belfast media speculated that British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who was a catalyst for April's agreement among
eight parties on how Northern Ireland should be governed, might
return to Northern Ireland before the weekend to try to mediate a
compromise in Portadown.
	   But Blair's spokesman, Alistair Campbell, said that if the prime
minister does travel to Northern Ireland it will be to voice
support for the broader peace process, not to intervene between the
Orangemen and Catholic protesters.

	   KITA-GUNMA, Japan (AP) _ Hsieh Chin-sheng shot a 7-under-par 64
Thursday, taking a one-stroke lead over eight other golfers in the
first round of the 100 million yen (dlrs 719,000) PGA Philanthropy.
	   The 35-year-old Taiwanese, who has yet to win on the Japan tour,

	   Chen Tze-chung of Taiwan shot a 65, and shared second place with
Shigeki Maruyama and six others.
	   Colombia's Eduardo Herrera, Kaname Yokoo and five others were
another stroke back at 66.
	   American Todd Hamilton and Australian Stewart Ginn were in a
group of 14 sharing 17th at 67.

EU inflation rate up slightly in May
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's annual inflation
rate stood at 1.6 percent in May, up 0.1 percent compared to the
year before, the EU's statistics agency reported Thursday.
	   But the EU inflation rate in May remained stable compared with
April, Eurostat said.
	   Inflation in the 11 countries that will take part in the single
currency when it is launched on January 1, 1999, remained stable at
1.4 percent compared with April. It also stood at 1.4 in May 1997.
	   The highest inflation rates in May were registered in Greece (5
percent) and Ireland (2.4 percent), while the lowest rates were in
France and Austria, both at 1 percent.
	   Compared with a year earlier, the largest increases in the rates
were in Finland (0.9 percent to 1.6 percent) and in Ireland (1.4
percent to 2.4 percent.)
	   Inflation dropped most in Denmark (2.2 percent to 1.4 percent)
and in Austria (1.3 percent to 1.0 percent).
	   Other Eurostat figures for May 1998 (May 1997 figures in
brackets): France, 1.0 (0.9); Belgium, 1.3 (1.4); Germany, 1.1
(1.4); Spain, 2.0 (1.3); Italy, 2.0 (1.8); Luxembourg, 1.3 (1.1);
Netherlands, 2.1 (1.6); Portugal, 2.2 (1.9); Greece, 5.0 (5.4);
Sweden, 1.6 (1.3); Britain, 2.0 (1.6).

Mindful of Indonesia's economic crisis, U.S. Embassy tones down
</HEADLINE>
party &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Last year, U.S. Independence Day
celebrations were festive at the ambassador's home: a jazz band,
food stalls, crowds on the sweeping lawn.
	   On Thursday, in deference to Indonesia's economic crisis, the
annual party was a muted affair. Prices and unemployment are rising
rapidly in the nation of 200 million people.
	   Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy held the party at lunchtime on a
workday, two days before Independence Day on July 4. A few hundred
guests, some in suits and others wearing traditional Indonesian
batik shirts, nibbled on snacks in his Dutch colonial-era
residence.
	   Last year, more than 1,000 people mingled under a big tent on
the lawn during the nighttime party. They strolled among stalls
offering donuts and fried chicken.
	   U.S. officials toned down the celebration this year to avoid a
show that might be considered gaudy in a country where millions of
jobless face food shortages.
	   In recent weeks, small groups of protesters have demonstrated
outside the U.S. Embassy, accusing the United States of conspiring
to delay the disbursement of loans to Indonesia.
	   The United States is a key player in the International Monetary
Fund, which is expected to restart a dlrs 43 billion aid program
for Indonesia. The loans were suspended because of political
turmoil last month that led to the ouster of authoritarian
President Suharto.

Dutch woman sentenced to 8 years for manslaughter in ``house of

horrors'' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEUWARDEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A 52-year-old Dutch woman was
convicted of manslaughter Thursday for killing two men and burying
their bodies in her garden.
	   The defendant, identified only as M. van der E. in line with
Dutch privacy rules, faces 8 years in prison and psychiatric
treatment.
	   An unidentified 26-year-old male accomplice was sentenced to
three years in prison for manslaughter and for helping Van der E.
bury one of the victims.
	   The woman ran a boarding house which has been dubbed by Dutch
newspapers as the ``house of horrors'' following the two deaths.
	   According to the Leeuwarden district court verdict, the woman
bludgeoned the two men to death with a hammer in June and December
of last year.
	   One of the victims was a guest at the boarding house in the
northern Dutch town of Anjum, but the relationship between Van der
E. and the other victim was unclear.
	   The bodies of the victims, aged 38 and 26, were discovered by
police in the garden and exhumed last December.
	   No motive for the killings has been established.
	   ``That's the big question, we don't know any motives,'' said a
court spokeswoman who gave her name only as C. Pietersen. ``There
was enough to convict her but she denied everything.''

OAU team mediating border war meets Eritrean president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki told a
team of African negotiators that he wants a peaceful end to his
country's border dispute with Ethiopia, the Eritrean News Agency
reported Thursday.
	   Isaias told envoys from the Organization of African Unity the
border must be demarcated to achieve a lasting solution, ENA said.
	   The agency said Isaias ``affirmed that Eritrea remains firmly
committed to a peaceful solution,'' and again called for an
immediate end to hostilities and direct talks with Ethiopia.
	   The OAU team, which arrived in Asmara Tuesday, also met an
Eritrean committee responsible for negotiations and formally
received the country's position on the conflict.
	   The team, scheduled to leave Eritrea Friday, is made up of
ambassadors to the OAU from Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti.
	   Fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia erupted May 6. Since then
several countries and international organizations have attempted
mediation.
	   The OAU has supported a plan originally drafted by the United
States and Rwanda which calls for Eritrea to unilaterally withdraw
from contested territory.
	   Eritrea has refused, insisting it is rightfully on land defined
by boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   Isaias has called for a cease-fire, demilitarization of disputed
territory monitored by independent observers, and demarcation of
the border.
	   Ethiopia, which has accepted the U.S.-Rwanda proposal, refuses
to engage in peace talks until Eritrea withdraws.

Hagi quits national soccer team after 16 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Gheorghe Hagi, the best Romanian
soccer player of his generation, retired from the national team
Thursday after 16 years and a lukewarm performance in the World
Cup.
	   Known for his superb technical skills and intelligence, Hagi,
33, peaked in the early 1990s. Called the Maradona of the
Carpathians, Hagi was a key figure in the World Cup 1990 and 1994
finals.
	   But his star dimmed in recent years and he was often plagued by
injury. Despite that, he is very popular in Istanbul where he plays
for Galatasaray.
	   He will continue playing for the club, he said Thursday.
	   Debuting at 17, Hagi played 114 times for Romania and scored 33
goals. He was known as the ``brain in the team.'' He will still
keep his hand in Romanian soccer and has said that he wants to help
fight corruption in the national league.
	   After the 1989 fall of communism, he played for Real Madrid,
Brescia, Italy, Barcelona and Galatasaray.

Thai power company not ready for Myanmar gas imports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The governments of Thailand and Myanmar
have resisted years of pressure to stop a natural gas pipeline, but
now that it's ready to come on stream, Thailand will be able to use
just a small portion of the gas.
	   That adds a financial snag to disputes over human rights and the
environment that the pipeline has fueled, since the state Petroleum
Authority of Thailand is obliged to pay Myanmar for all the gas for
which it originally contracted.
	   The gas, from Myanmar's offshore Yadana field, was meant to feed
an 1,800-megawatt power plant in the western Thai province of
Ratchaburi starting Wednesday, but the state Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand has delayed completion for financial reasons.
	   Even when the plant starts operation, it is likely to need less
gas than initially thought because of a drop in electrical demand
in Thailand, which is undergoing its most painful economic
contraction in recent memory.
	   The pipeline is finished on the Myanmar side and should be ready
to go on the Thai side in a few weeks, the petroleum authority
said.
	   A 25-megawatt generator at the Ratchaburi site will be able to
take only a very small portion until the plant is scheduled to come
on line in December.
	   A spokesman for the petroleum authority's gas division, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said Thailand can take delivery of the
extra gas later but meanwhile will need to borrow money to pay for
it and take a loss on the interest. He refused Thursday to estimate
how much.
	   Thai calls for renegotiating the contract have so far gone
nowhere. The dlrs 1 billion pipeline is the biggest infrastructure
project ever undertaken in Myanmar and is key to the military
government's economic plans.
	   The pipeline is a joint venture among France's Total, Unocal of
the United States, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand and
Myanmar's state oil company. The Western companies have endured
consumer boycotts and court challenges to get it built.
	   Critics say the project will help sustain army rule in Myanmar,
also known as Burma, and that minorities on the Myanmar side were
forcibly relocated, raped and killed to secure the area from ethnic
rebels.
	   There have also been charges that forced labor was used to help
construct supporting projects, vigorously denied by the oil
companies.
	   On the Thai side, environmentalists criticized the project for
cutting through virgin forests. Ironically, authorities blamed
their protests for causing possible delays in the project.

ICRC representative decorated for Lebanon-Israel swap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Beirut delegate of the International
Committee of the Red Cross was honored Thursday for his efforts in
a swap between Lebanon and Israel of prisoners and remains.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri decorated Jean-Jacques Fresard, a
Swiss, with the High National Order of Cedars in the Rank of
Officer at a special ceremony at the premier's office. The award is
one of Lebanon's highest honors.
	   ``You worked hard and in silence and we cooperated during those
past nine months for solving this problem which was of particular
difficulty for us,'' Hariri told Fresard.
	   Fresard was the main intermediary in the long negotiations that
led to Israel's return of the bodies of 40 Lebanese guerrillas and
the release of 60 prisoners held in its jails in exchange for the
remains of an Israeli soldier.
	   Last week, Fresard accompanied the remains of Israeli Sgt.
Itamar Ilya, who was killed in a botched commando raid in southern
Lebanon last September. He returned on the same French military
plane with the coffins of 40 Lebanese guerrillas.
	   Fresard then led a convoy of 60 prisoners who were released from
Israeli detention and handed over to Lebanese authorities in
southern Lebanon.

Hard man soccer player convicted of assault

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Soccer star Vinnie Jones was sentenced to 100
hours community service and fined 1,165 pound (dlrs 1,934) by a
magistrate Thursday when he was convicted of assault.
	   Jones, who earned a reputation as a soccer ``hard man'' for
being sent off 12 times in his career, had denied assaulting his
27-year-old neighbor and causing criminal damage on Nov.11, 1997.
	   The 33-year-old former Welsh international joined Queens Park
Rangers as player-coach in a 500,000 pound (dlrs 800,000) transfer
deal from Wimbledon in February, three months after the incident.
	   Jones said he had been concerned since the attack about his
position with QPR.
	   ``They stood by me and now hopefully I just want to get on with
my life and enjoy my training,'' he said on Thursday.
	   In a colorful career the midfielder, famed for his long throws
and fierce challenges, has been fined for incidents on and off the
field.
	   He was fined 20,000 pounds (dlrs 33,200) for commentating on a
video which glorified soccer violence and cheating and was reported
to the English Football Association for biting a reporter's nose in
a bar in Dublin.

Australian fly-half signs with Leicester

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Wallaby Pat Howard, his test
hopes seemingly blocked, has joined English club Leicester.
	   Howard, who has played 20 tests at fly-half or inside center, is
currently out of calculations with Stephen Larkham considered a
long-term hope at pivot and Tim Horan and Daniel Herbert playing
well in the centers.
	   Howard, 24, admitted the move to England probably signaled the
end of his hopes of playing in next year's World Cup. He has spent
three seasons with the ACT Brumbies in the Super 12 competition.
	   ``I am available to play for Australia and I accept that moving
away will affect my chances of making next year's World Cup
squad,'' Howard said. ``I am still very keen to represent my
country.''
	   He will join Leicester in August but said it was a difficult
decision to leave Australian rugby.
	   However, the 24-year pharmacist said the chance to also further
his studies at Cambridge University was an opportunity to good to
pass up.

Japan announces plan to clean up banking industry crisis
</HEADLINE>

bank official quotes 10th-14th grafs; ADDS details on plan thruout &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's government approved an ambitious plan
Thursday to assume control over failed banks and gradually shut
them down, a key component in initiatives to pull the country out
of its worst recession since World War II.
	   The so-called ``bridge bank'' scheme, patterned after the U.S.
bailout of failed savings and loan institutions in the 1980s, is
designed to prevent bank failures from cutting off credit to
healthy borrowers and driving Japan deeper into economic
stagnation.
	   Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga announced the widely
expected plan after it was approved by a special government panel.
	   ``It is of utmost importance that we restore confidence in our
banking system both inside and outside of Japan,'' Matsunaga said,
adding that the measures could help spur a broader economic
recovery.
	   The plan is an attempt to deal with the 76 trillion yen (dlrs
546 billion) in bad loans left over from the collapse earlier this
decade of a speculative ``bubble'' in real estate and stock prices.
	   It calls for a new government financial industry watchdog to
begin inspections later this year to assess the extent of problem
loans at lenders. Banks found to be insolvent will be managed by
the Financial Supervision Agency while a healthy merger partner is
sought.
	   When no suitor can be found, insolvent ``bridge'' banks will be
taken over by a state-funded holding company and then sold off or
liquidated.
	   The process is to be completed within a maximum of five years
and funded with up to 13 trillion yen (dlrs 93 billion) in taxpayer
money allocated from Japan's Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures
bank deposits.
	   Also announced Thursday were steps to strengthen special
institutions that have been set up to absorb and sell off bad loans
held by banks.
	   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rallied ahead of the
announcement, but some analysts questioned whether the plan will be
effectively implemented.
	   ``I really think it's going to be a big disappointment,'' said
Betsy Daniels, a banking industry analyst in the Tokyo office of
Morgan Stanley.
	   ``They can serve up any sort of menu of opportunities to
restructure faster but it's not going to be meaningful until they
actually close down some institutions,'' she said.
	   But some welcomed the move.
	   ``Other measures cannot control the situation,'' said Yoshihiro
Sakamoto, an adviser at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi Ltd. and a former
trade official. ``We have to use the credibility of the
government.''
	   The plan was the result of a series of brainstorming sessions by
officials from Japan's Finance Ministry and Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's governing party. The task force was assembled last
month after Japan promised trading partners that it would take
aggressive action to deal with its banking crisis.
	   Adding to the governing Liberal Democratic Party's sense of
urgency is a set of elections on July 12 for the upper house of
Japan's bicameral Parliament. Scoring points on the economy is seen
as critical if the party is to come out of those elections
victorious.
	   The bridge bank concept was first used by the U.S. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. in the late 1980s to deal with a spate of
bank failures following the savings and loan debacle.

Airbus closing gap with Boeing: U.S. Airways to buy 30 more planes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details from news conference, trims.
 &UR; AP Photos planned
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Airbus will sell as many as 30 more of its
jetliners to U.S. Airways, the two firms said Thursday, in the
latest step by the European consortium toward equal footing with
the mighty U.S. jetmaker Boeing.
	   The U.S. airline, which has already ordered more than 100 planes
from Airbus, is to buy up to 30 more widebody A330-300s, officials
said in a joint statement.
	   Airbus said the deal was the first time a U.S.-based airline had
ordered its fly-by-wire widebody jets. Boeing has long dominated
the market with its conventional technology, and only recently
began to compete with Airbus with the new technology.
	   ``U.S. Airways will have the most modern fleet in the air within
just a few years time,'' U.S. Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf said in
a statement ahead of a news conference with Airbus Managing
Director Noel Forgeard.
	   The fly-by-wire system is a fully computerized guidance system
that performs many tasks previously done by pilots.
	   The agreement, which came as Boeing struggles with production
snarls, includes firm orders for seven of the planes, seven more
subject to confirmation, and options on 16 others.
	   Delivery of the first plane is scheduled for the first quarter
of next year, officials told the news conference. Another six are
scheduled for the year 2000.
	   Wolf said they picked Airbus over Boeing because the A330s had
``slightly better cargo and passenger capabliity,'' as well as a
better ``economic package.''
	   He said the company intended to buy all 30 planes, but said the
final price was lower than the listed dlrs 3.7 billion. The final
sum was not disclosed.
	   The order followed Airbus's announcement Wednesday that Air
France signed for 40 planes, half of them firm orders.
	   Airbus was also negotiating a deal to sell at least 70 planes to
British Airways, a sale that would break Boeing's grip on the last
major European carrier never to order an Airbus.
	   British Airways was expected to discuss the order during a board
meeting Friday.
	   The sale also comes on the heels of a major deal announced last
month to sell 76 single-aisle A320s and A321s to Spain's Iberia,
replacing aging Boeing 727s and DC9s. Airbus said it was its
largest ever order by a European carrier.
	   Until now, Boeing has held a 60-40 market share lead over
Airbus, but it's shrinking fast. Some analysts have put the figure
at 55-45, or closer.
	   ``The latest orders bring parity'' between Airbus and Boeing on
the world jetliner market, said Paul Beaver of the influential
Jane's Information Group that watches the aerospace and defense
industries.
	   With the sale to U.S. Airlines, Airbus claimed they now have 52
percent of the commerical airline market so far this year. The only
time they have posted more than 50 percent over a whole year was in
1994.
	   Boeing was struggling with ``not being able to manufacture
aircraft to the right schedule, not enough personnel, too much
downsizing. That's all coming back to roost,'' Beaver said.
	   Another London-based analyst saw the latest orders as evidence
Airbus could match Boeing in the next three years. ``But I suspect
Boeing will catch up again,'' said Guenter Endres.
	   Airbus was often beating Boeing in the sale of single-aisle
planes using lighter fly-by-wire technology.
	   But Beaver cautioned that Airbus still had ``a long way to go''
to dominate the market.
	   The consortium is reorganizing as a private company in order to
issue stock and raise capital for expansion, including for its
super jumbo A3XX.
	   The project is a dlrs 9 billion gamble by Airbus, hoping that
airlines will need a 500-seat plane in coming years. Boeing has
bowed out of that race.
	   Airbus is a partnership of France's Aerospatiale, British
Aerospace PLC, Spain's Casa and Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace.

Philippines' Estrada backs off temporarily from fight with Subic
</HEADLINE>
chief &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Thursday he will follow a court order that temporarily blocks him
from ousting a combative foe as administrator of a bustling
freeport.
	   Estrada, who was inaugurated as the country's 13th president
Tuesday, began his six-year term by sacking Richard Gordon as
administrator of the Subic Bay freeport, north of Manila, to settle
an old score.
	   Gordon, an aggressive former mayor, resisted Estrada's order and
closeted himself in the freeport. Hundreds of Gordon's supporters
blocked the freeport's gates with trucks and debris and stood guard
with clubs in hand, triggering a standoff many feared could turn
bloody.
	   Estrada had replaced Gordon with Rep. Felicito Payumo, a
long-time Gordon critic.
	   On Wednesday, an Olongapo City court near Subic issued a
three-day restraining order against Payumo's appointment and set a
hearing Monday on Gordon's motion questioning the legality of
Estrada's order.
	   It was not immediately clear whether Payumo would be allowed to
take over after three days.
	   ``I assure him that he will stay there as long as the court
decides,'' Estrada said. His aides, however, said they would seek
other legal ways to unseat Gordon from the freeport, a former U.S.
naval base left by the Americans in 1992.
	   Estrada urged Gordon to remove barricades at the freeport's
gates, saying they were scaring off people and investors.
	   At the height of the dispute, U.S. air cargo company Federal
Express diverted three planes from its Asian hub at Subic to
Manila.
	   The barricades were removed by Gordon's supporters shortly after
the Olongapo court issued its order, local officials said.
	   Gordon insists he still has six years remaining in his term
because he was re-appointed by former President Fidel Ramos in
February.
	   The move by Estrada, a former actor and senator who opposed U.S.
bases in the Philippines, appears to be in retaliation for efforts
by Gordon's followers to prevent Estrada from filming an anti-bases
movie at Subic in 1991.
	   The industrial zone now employs about 67,000 workers, more than
double the number during the time it was a U.S. base.

German man with rights to Lady Di name angry over museum gift shop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from trademark owner &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A German man who owns the rights to the name Lady
Di threatened on Thursday to take her brother to court over the
souvenirs on sale at the new Princess Diana museum in her ancestral
home in England.
	   ``I won't allow my brand to be stepped on,'' said Andre
Engelhardt, 34, by phone from his home in the Bavarian village of
Grosskarolinenfeld.
	   His attorney, Christoph Kayser, said they ``don't necessarily
want to sue.'' But he said they were concerned that T-shirts and
other items sold at the museum would hurt the value of Engelhardt's
trademark.
	   ``The museum is OK,'' Kayser said. ``That can't be stopped by
trademark rights.'' But a gift shop ``doesn't serve the memory or
documentation of his sister the person. It's a business for earning
money.''
	   Engelhardt said he registered for the German rights to Lady Di
immediately after her death last year, paying 800 marks (about dlrs
450). He got an international patent _ including North America and
most of western Europe _ this year for another 20,000 marks (dlrs
11,000).
	   The trademark applies to the use of the name Lady Di on
``high-end products'' such as cosmetics and leather goods, the
lawyer said. Engelhardt says it also includes other forms of her
name, such as Princess Diana.
	   But Kayser, in a telephone interview from his office in Hamm, in
western Germany, conceded that would likely have to be determined
in court.
	   Engelhardt said he is preparing to file a lawsuit in London
against Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, over the the museum gift
shop, charging that the items sold could damage his trademark by
cheapening Diana's name.
	   Diana's estate maintains the souvenirs sold at the museum shop
are associated with the late princess without ``cheapening her
memory in any way.''
	   Engelhardt, a former bar owner who deals in trademarks, is ``not
a Diana fan,'' according to his lawyer, but applied for the
copyright because he knew ``Diana would be a valuable product.
	   ``It just came to him intuitively,'' Kayser said. ``People would
want to remember her and there'd be a mark to be made.''
	   Kayser said they recently signed their first contract with a
German firm to produce Lady Di clothing.

Ex-sports tycoon Tapie loses final appeal in fraud case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REPEATING to clarify in 8th that Tapie is former Adidas chief &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's highest appeals court on Thursday upheld a
six-month jail term for fraud against Bernard Tapie, the ex-sports
tycoon and former leftist government minister.
	   The Court of Cassation ruled that Tapie evaded taxes by
deliberately misleading authorities about his luxury yacht, the
Phocea. The court also upheld a 12-month suspended sentence.
	   However, it was not clear whether Tapie, 55, would be jailed.
	   Tapie, the former owner of the soccer team Olympique Marseille,
has already served more than five months in jail for bribing soccer
players on an opposing team to throw a 1993 match.
	   His lawyers said Thursday they would seek to have the new
sentence annulled on account of time already served in jail,
despite the fact that both cases were different.
	   Judicial sources said it might take several weeks for a ruling
to be reached.
	   Last year, an appeals court upheld a lower court ruling against
Tapie for him to serve six months in jail, as well as a 12-month
suspended sentence. Tapie took the case to the Court of Cassation.
	   Tapie, a former urban affairs minister and former owner of
Adidas, was convicted of evading more than 12 million francs (dlrs
2 million) by declaring the Phocea as a business expense from 1989
to 1991.
	   The appeals court in 1997 also upheld a 30-month suspended
sentence against Tapie for diverting company funds for the 74-meter
(242-foot) boat.
	   He was convicted of having used an 80 million franc (dlrs 13.7
million) loan to the company Alain Colas-Tahiti from SDBO, a
subsidiary of the debt-ridden state bank Credit Lyonnais. Some of
the funds were used to prop up Olympique Marseille.

Swiss react with dismay, anger to U.S. sanctions move
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Swiss Banks-Sanctions &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's political, business and Jewish
leaders expressed concern, dismay and anger Thursday over the
decision in New York giving a green light to state and city
sanctions against Swiss banks over World War II dealings.
	   The Swiss government demanded that Washington ``meet its
international obligations'' and intervene to halt the imposition of
any boycott.
	   The banks themselves said they were ``outraged.''
	   The Swiss Confederation of Hebrew Congregations, the country's
main Jewish organization, said it regretted the ``unproductive
decision.''
	   Thomas Lyssy, vice president of the confederation, said the body
continues to regard the negotiations between banks and Holocaust
victims as a ``private economic matter'' and that governments
should keep out.
	   The conservative Swiss People's Party, the junior partner in the
four-party governing Federal Council, or cabinet, described the
threats as ``extortion.''
	   The centrist Radical Democrats said the moves were ``Wild West
methods'' that have no place between civilized countries. The
right-of-center Christian Democrats said the New York decision was
``incomprehensible.'' The fourth member, the left-of-center Social
Democrats, said politicians should keep out of the dispute.
	   The government issued a statement calling sanctions
``counterproductive, unjustified and illegal.''
	   ``The cabinet will not allow itself to be influenced by such
pressure tactics,'' it said.
	   The U.S. and Israeli governments have repeatedly praised
Switzerland and its banks for their ``unprecedented and
far-reaching steps'' to make good on any World War II wrongs in
their dealings with the Nazis and treatment of Holocaust assets,
the statement said.
	   ``Sanctions endanger the realization of these steps and ... in
no way serve the interests of Holocaust victims,'' it added.
	   The government said it would support Swiss firms if they take
legal steps against any sanctions and was studying further steps,
especially through the World Trade Organization.
	   The Social Democrats, the largest grouping in Parliament, said
that, despite its opposition to government involvement in the
dispute, it would back a protest to the WTO.
	   The trade body can require member countries to honor their
commitment to global trading rules.
	   Adalbert Durrer, president of the Christian Democratic party,
said the moves flew in the face of U.S. claims to support open
markets.
	   ``Apparently the United States expects this (open markets) from
everyone else, but not from itself,'' Durrer said.
	   The Swiss Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the threats led
to ``an unsettling situation,'' but that it opposed Swiss
countermeasures because the country needs good relations with the
United States.
	   ``The Swiss banks are outraged and deeply disappointed,'' said
Sylvia Matile, spokeswoman for the Swiss Bankers Association, the
banks' umbrella organization.
	   The banks have ``done more than has been demanded of us'' in
unprecedented efforts to find and return the assets of Holocaust
victims.

Malaysian PM beckons long-term investors to his country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Despite his angry rhetoric against
some foreigners, Malaysia's prime minister said Thursday his nation
remains an attractive destination for ``serious investors'' from
abroad.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said foreign investors who
brought with them billions of dollars in foreign capital continued
to support the country's manufacturing sector, the national news
agency Bernama reported.
	   He pledged that his administration would offer whatever
assistance was needed by foreign companies keen on setting up shop
in Malaysia so that they could undertake ``an array of activities''
such as research and development.
	   ``These serious investors are different from fund managers who
only roamed from one country to another making investments only for
instant gains,'' he said, adding that foreign direct investors
liked the political stability here.
	   ``They know that Malaysia is a good place to invest,'' he added.
	   Mahathir criticized mutual fund managers for shifting their
investments elsewhere at the slightest signs of ``loss in
confidence'' in the region, which has been battered by a prolonged
economic crisis.
	   Since the crisis started last year, Malaysia's currency, the
ringgit, has plunged nearly 40 percent against the dollar and the
stock market has remained in the doldrums.
	   The premier has repeatedly accused foreigners of trying to
``recolonize'' his nation by destroying the ringgit and wreaking
havoc in Malaysia's economy.

German foreign minister to Albania, Macedonia next week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will consult
with leaders in Albania and Macedonia next week on the crisis
across their borders in the separatist Serbian province of Kosovo,
his office announced Thursday.
	   The trip is scheduled for July 8-9.
	   Albania and Macedonia, which border on Kosovo, are key to
international efforts to prevent the fighting in Kosovo from
spreading and destabilizing the entire region, the statement said.
	   Of particular concern to the German government is the refugee
situation after massive action by Serb security forces against
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian civilian population.
	   According to the statement, 13,000 refugees have fled Kosovo
into Albania.
	   German concerns are heightened because about 150,000 ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo who were to be returned to their homeland
currently are in Germany, with an additional 1,000 to 2,000
arriving monthly, the statement said.
	   Kinkel, in cooperation with the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, wants a regional refugee program set up to handle the
needs of those fleeing the fighting in Kosovo. The ministry has
thus far made available to Albania 1.4 million marks (dlrs 777,000)
in immediate aid, the statement said.
	   Germany also took in some 350,000 refugees from Bosnia after war
broke out there in 1992. Since the NATO-led peace force moved into
Bosnia in late 1995, more that 130,000 have returned home, but more
than 200,000 remain in Germany.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to
try to halt growing resistance to Serb rule.

Ex-sports tycoon Tapie loses final appeal in fraud case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Has also moved on news wires. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's highest appeals court on Thursday upheld a
six-month jail term for fraud against Bernard Tapie, the ex-sports
tycoon and former leftist government minister.
	   The Court of Cassation ruled that Tapie evaded taxes by
deliberately misleading authorities about his luxury yacht, the
Phocea. The court also upheld a 12-month suspended sentence.
	   However, it was not clear whether Tapie, 55, would be jailed.
	   Tapie, the former owner of the soccer team Olympique Marseille,
has already served more than five months in jail for bribing soccer
players on an opposing team to throw a 1993 match.
	   His lawyers said Thursday they would seek to have the new
sentence annulled on account of time already served in jail,
despite the fact that both cases were different.
	   Judicial sources said it might take several weeks for a ruling
to be reached.
	   Last year, an appeals court upheld a lower court ruling against
Tapie for him to serve six months in jail, as well as a 12-month
suspended sentence. Tapie took the case to the Court of Cassation.
	   Tapie, a former urban affairs minister and former owner of
Adidas, was convicted of evading more than 12 million francs (dlrs
2 million) by declaring the Phocea as a business expense from 1989
to 1991.
	   The appeals court in 1997 also upheld a 30-month suspended
sentence against Tapie for diverting company funds for the 74-meter
(242-foot) boat.
	   He was convicted of having used an 80 million franc (dlrs 13.7
million) loan to the company Alain Colas-Tahiti from SDBO, a
subsidiary of the debt-ridden state bank Credit Lyonnais. Some of
the funds were used to prop up Olympique Marseille.

Hezbollah attacks Israeli, SLA positions, wounds four
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with air raids, Hezbollah comment, CLARIFIES that man
died of heart attack during shelling. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas launched a series of
attacks against Israeli and allied militia outposts across southern
Lebanon Thursday, briefly overruning one position. Israel
retaliated with air attacks and artillery shelling.
	   Two Israeli soldiers, two allied South Lebanon Army militiamen
and a guerrilla of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah were wounded in the
offensive along the front line, Lebanese security officials said. A
65-year-old Lebanese civilian died of a heart attack during the
fighting, they added.
	   Israel confirmed that two of its troops and two SLA fighters
were wounded and taken to hospitals in Israel.
	   An Israeli military spokesman in Jerusalem said one of the
wounded Israelis sustained serious injuries.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said 18 Israeli and SLA
positions were attacked with rockets and machine-gun fire.
	   Thursday's attacks were the largest since a similar onslaught
targeted 25 Israeli and SLA positions on Feb. 4.
	   Israel's air force came to the aid of troops under fire, the
security officials said. A helicopter gunship fired three missiles
at guerrillas near the SLA outpost of Haddatha, which was captured
for 12 minutes by Hezbollah as its defenders huddled in underground
bunkers to avoid the intense shelling that preceded the attack.
	   A jet bombed a nearby valley in the morning, the officials said.
	   Witnesses in the village of Haddatha, which is several hundred
meters (yards) from the fortified SLA position, said they saw one
seriously wounded Hezbollah fighter being evacuated.
	   Hezbollah named the operation at Haddatha after Hadi Nasrallah,
son of the guerrilla group's leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah. The
younger Nasrallah was killed in fighting in September and his body
was among those of 40 guerrillas exchanged last week for the
remains of an Israeli soldier.
	   Haddatha, 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of the Israeli
border, borders the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon.
	   Several mortar shells fired by the guerrillas landed inside
Israel, an Israeli military source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. One shell struck the Israeli Arab village of Arab
el-Aramshe, and six women in the village were treated for shock.
	   Arab el-Aramshe lies on the Israeli border with Lebanon, and it
is possible that the shells were aimed at Israeli or SLA positions
inside Lebanon, but overshot their target.
	   The occupied zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of
Lebanese territory _ was established by Israel in 1985 to protect
its northern border towns against guerrilla attacks. It is
patrolled by 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.

South Africa make slow progress to 59 for two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Darren Gough drew early inspiration
for England but Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis were equal to the
task, taking South Africa to 59 for one at lunch on day one of the
third test Thursday.
	   On a slow Old Trafford pitch that made stroke play difficult,
Kirsten and Kallis defied England for 83 minutes after Gough had
removed opener Gehardus Liebenberg.
	   Gough, bowling for England for the first time in 12 months,
uprooted Liebenberg's off stump in a fiery seven-over spell from
the Warwick Road end.
	   South Africa won the toss and elected to bat, Kirsten and
Liedenberg hitting four boundaries in the first three overs.
	   But Liebenberg, returning to the side to replace the injured
Adam Bacher, was beaten by a full-pitched delivery from Gough and
was out for 16.
	   It seems Gough has fully recovered from a broken index finger he
sustained while batting in the first test at Edgbaston.
	   Veteran opener Kirsten struggled to hit the ball out of the
square and took 40 minutes and 31 balls to move from 11 to 12. He
was 24 not out at lunch.
	   Kallis, 15 not out, was patient in trying to comes to term with
the pace of the sparsely-grassed pitch.
	   England skipper Alec Stewart wasted no time in introducing his
spin duo _ off spinner Robert Croft and left armer Ashley Giles _
squeezing out seven overs between the two in the first session.
	   Earlier, all-rounder Shaun Pollock was ruled out of the South
African XI with a recurrence of a strain to his left quadricep. He
was replaced by Makhaya Ntini.

Last of detained dissidents freed as Clinton heads for Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police freed the last of seven dissidents
rounded up in connection with U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit
as he left China proper for Hong Kong Thursday, a human rights
group reported.
	   Police in eastern Hangzhou city released Zhu Yufu at around 10
a.m. after holding him for 48 hours and warned him to stop working
for an illegal opposition party, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Another democracy campaigner, Li Xiaolong, was set free in
Guilin on Wednesday, a week after being detained and the day before
Clinton arrived in the scenic southern city, the group said.
	   Earlier in his trip, Clinton said he was disturbed by reports of
dissident arrests. He raised the police action with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at their summit Saturday. Jiang later told
reporters local authorities acted to preserve security.
	   The detentions marred the beginning of Clinton's nine-day tour,
partly designed to showcase China's more modern, tolerant side to a
skeptical American public.
	   China's persistent but persecuted dissident community has tried
to use Clinton's visit to test Beijing's limits on dissent. At
least twice in the past week, dissidents in Hangzhou have tried
unsuccessfully to register the China Democracy Party with
authorities.
	   Police took Zhu into custody Tuesday for handing out leaflets
about the party. Defiant despite the police warning, Zhu said
Thursday that registering the party was a completely legal act and
he would continue his work, the rights group reported.
	   Li's release Wednesday was unexpected. Police had previously
told his family he would be held in custody until after Clinton's
departure from Guilin Thursday.
	   Speaking before one of Guilin's famous limestone peaks, Clinton
pledged to help China clean up its rivers, land and air, severely
polluted during two decades of breakneck economic growth. He left
Thursday night for Hong Kong, the former British colony where
Chinese resumed control a year ago.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Blackwolf Run Golf Course is so
demanding that many of the world's best woman golfers contend an
even-par 284 could top the leaderboard of the tournament that began
Thursday.
	   ``We're used to playing courses where 10-, 12-under wins a
tournament,'' Karrie Webb said. ``It is just not going to be
possible this week. Birdies aren't going to be rolling in out
there.
	   ``Normally, when you play in regular tournaments, par after par
after par isn't such a good thing,'' Webb added. ``But out here it
is.''
	   Amen, said Laura Davies.
	   ``You have got to think for 18 holes,'' Davies said. ``You have
got to be on your guard all the time. If you make 72 pars, you
might well win it.''
	   Pete Dye, the renowned golf course architect who designed the
6,412-yard (5,861-meter) layout where the 53rd U.S. Women's Open is
being played, bristles at such suggestions.
	   ``They will break par,'' Dye insisted. ``Those girls play great
golf and they won't have any trouble out there.''
	   Players who have practiced on the course acclaimed for its
natural beauty and strategic demands, however, know that birdies
will be difficult on the unyielding layout that includes water
hazards on the final three holes.
	   The course is so tough, especially with wind, that several
golfers, including Nancy Lopez, said even-par would be a great
score.
	   And they were well-warned, too.
	   After winning the Andersen Consulting World Championship of Golf
event at Blackwolf Run last summer, Ernie Els said the 150 golfers
in the Women's Open ``had better practice putting in a bathtub.''
	   Defending champion Alison Nicholas said she liked the daring
setup.
	   ``It's a fabulous golf course, isn't it? It is tough and it is
going to be a challenge. I think the winning score is going to be a
lot higher than last year,'' said Nicholas, who finished at
10-under-par 274 at Pumpkin Ridge in 1997.
	   Nicholas saw the course in May, ``and I knew then that I was
just going to have to have my A-game, no question,'' she said.
``But it is a beautiful setting, and a major championship should be
tough.''
	   Lopez said she likes Blackwolf Run, which puts a premium on
long, accurate drives and sports tricky undulating greens.
	   ``Every hole has a different personality,'' Lopez said. ``It is
not a golf course that flows from one hole to another. You remember
the holes. To me, when you remember the holes, it's a good golf
course.''
	   Tammie Green said she used all 14 of her clubs in practice,
``which I think makes a great golf course.''
	   ``Every hole out there has something difficult about it, whether
it is the tee shot or whether it is the shot coming into the greens
or once you get there,'' Green said.
	   Blackwolf Run requires golfers to be on top of every aspect of
their game, Lopez said.
	   ``You have got to hit perfect club, perfect direction,'' she
said. ``In a lot of Open courses, you can get away with the shot
that is just a little right of the pin or a little left. But you
can't do that here. You have to hit it right where you want it or
you are going to be chipping and putting a lot.''
	   Two-time Open champion Annika Sorenstram said the course suits
her game.
	   ``It is very long. The greens are huge, undulated. Those are
probably the three things that I think are different than the
courses that we play all year, especially coming from last week
(ShopRite Classic) where we probably had the smallest greens all
year,'' she said.
	   And this being the Open, the field of 150 golfers vying for dlrs
1.5 million in prize money got some extra time to test the course.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Suggesting he planned to veto the
government-proposed plan to consolidate Poland's provinces, the
president was meeting major party leaders Thursday for last-minute
consultations.
	   Aleksander Kwasniewski first spoke to leftist leader Leszek
Miller, who argued that president should veto the government plan
to replace 49 provinces with 15 bigger ones.
	   The president later received Solidarity chairman Marian
Krzaklewski, who strongly supports the government plan.
	   Later Thursday, the president was meeting another government
coalition leader, Tadeusz Syryjczyk of Freedom Union, as well as
peasant leader Janusz Dobrosz.
	   The general reform plan, which is to do away with the
communist-era administration and take effect Jan. 1, has broad
support among politicians, but the government and the leftist
opposition disagree over the number of provinces.
	   Kwasniewski's refusal to sign the bill into law would force the
government to reconsider its plan and seek an agreement with the
opposition.
	   The president has called for a solution that would have broad
parliamentary and social support and has indicated he planned to
veto the government plan.
	   But following Thursday's meeting, Miller said the president did
not confirm he would reject the bill.
	   After Kwasniewski's meeting with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
Wednesday, Government Spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin indicated that a
compromise over the number of provinces was possible. He refused to
provide details.
	   The original Cabinet plan provided for reducing the number of
provinces from 49 to 12 and for giving local governments more
power.
	   But following protests from cities that would lose their capital
status and under pressure from the opposition, the government
agreed to increase the number to 15. Government experts indicate
that further increases in the number of provinces would produce
municipalities that are too small to be self-financing.
	   However, leaders of the leftist opposition as well as
Kwasniewski, their former party chief, argue that Poland should
return to its pre-1975 division into 17 provinces, which is less
controversial than fewer provinces.

	   ``I'm leaving Nigeria with the stage set for the release of all
political detainees,'' Annan said. ``All political detainees will
be released and the government will make an announcement at the
appropriate time.''
	   Annan confirmed that he met with Abiola on Tuesday and said he
was good health and alert.
	   Abiola was elected president of Nigeria in 1993 in an election
later annulled by Nigeria's military regime. The junta, led by Gen.
Sani Abacha, jailed Abiola a year later when he declared himself

NATO chief says world won't tolerate another Bosnia in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Solana and Rugova comments, Yugoslav
officials shutting down Pristina radio station, other; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's top official declared
Thursday that the world won't allow a repeat of the Bosnian war in
Kosovo, where the top ethnic Albanian official pleaded again for
intervention.
	   But Secretary-General Javier Solana, speaking in Sarajevo during
a tour of the Balkans, said the focus for now is not on Western
military action but on diplomatic efforts to obtain a cease-fire.
	   NATO forces, which staged a display of air power in the region
last month as a warning they may intervene, are continuing their
preparations for possible further action, Solana said before
leaving for Tirana, Albania.
	   ``The situation we had in Bosnia should not be repeated,'' he
said. ``The international community will not allow that to
happen.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have been pressing for military
intervention to halt the months-long campaign by Serb security
forces to crush militant resistance in the secessionist province of
Serbia, populated predominantly by Albanians.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanians' leader, said after meeting
a visiting delegation of U.S. congressional staffers Thursday that
the latest Serb actions are ``aimed at ethnically cleansing
Kosovo.''
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is grave because of constant attacks
by army and police forces and a continuation of ethnic cleansing of
Kosovo,'' he said. ``An international intervention is needed to
protect the people of Kosovo and create conditions for the start of
dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.''
	   Rugova also met with Norway's Kai Aide, an ambassador of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as part of
continuing efforts to persuade the West to act swiftly on Kosovo.
	   Officials in Serb-led Yugoslavia maintain the action is aimed at
wiping out ``terrorists'' and restoring order to the restive
province. They also accuse the Kosovo Liberation Army of attacks on
Serb civilians.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the KLA.
But they did agree to meet again Sunday to try to meld the
guerrilla struggle with their nonviolent independence campaign.
	   In an indication of how compelling the need to enlist the
guerrillas has become, Rugova also participated in the meeting.
Previously he has refused to cooperate with the armed insurgents,
preaching nonviolence as the only way to achieve independence.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule.
	   In the latest fighting, the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug
reported a clash Thursday in the flashpoint of Kijevo _ a Serb
village west of Pristina that KLA guerrillas surrounded last month.
Further details were not immediately available.
	   Tanjug also said the militants staged attacks overnight on
villages in the region of Klina, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   U.S. diplomats are making what State Department spokesman James
Rubin calls a ``full-court press'' to try to prevent the outbreak
of a more general war.
	   Backing off its demand for an immediate pullback of Serb forces
in Kosovo, the U.S. government said Wednesday there probably will
have to be a cease-fire before Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic withdraws the special units that have cracked down on
Albanian militants and civilians.
	   The shift, signaled by Rubin, was Washington's second major move
in the past week to try to revitalize its diplomatic approach to
the Kosovo conflict. The other step was opening talks with the KLA.
	   The director of a Pristina radio station said Thursday the
station had been shut down by Yugoslavia's Communications Ministry
two days after it started broadcasting reports by the Voice of
America and the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Dorijan Nuaj, who is ethnic Albanian and Serb, similar to the
makeup of the 10-day-old station, said police also seized much of
his broadcasting equipment because he was operating without a
license.
	   ``There are 300 radio stations in Yugoslavia without a
license,'' Nuaj said. ``They only closed mine down for political
reasons.''

Tension reported on Egyptian-Sudanese border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Egyptian forces have harassed Sudanese
residents of a desolate region along the Red Sea claimed by both
Egypt and Sudan, a daily newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Al-Usbou quoted the Sudanese commissioner of the Halaib
province, Nafei Ali Nafei, as saying that Halaib serves as ``a
pressure tool'' Egypt uses when tension rises between the two
countries. He did not provide details on the harassment.
	   An Egyptian Foreign Ministry official refused to comment.
	   Ties between Egypt and Sudan soured after Egypt accused Sudan of
being behind an assassination attempt against President Hosni
Mubarak in Ethiopia in 1995. Sudan denied the allegations.
	   The charges inflamed a long-running dispute between the
countries over ownership of the Halaib triangle.
	   Relations began to improve earlier this year after high-ranking
officials from both countries exchanged visits.

EU to sue France over polluted drinking water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's executive
Commission said Thursday it will take France to court for failing
to improve the quality of drinking water in the western region of
Brittany.
	   In a statement, the Commission said that in several parts of
Brittany _ the Cotes d'Armor, Finistere, Morbihan and Ille et
Vilaine regions _ river water used for drinking purposes
consistently registered nitrate levels of more than 50 milligrams
per liter (.008 avoir ounces per gallon).
	   Under EU rules on the quality of water, the level of nitrate
must not exceed that level, the Commission said.
	   ``The different measures taken by the French in order to resolve
the problem of the quality of drinking water in Brittany ... are
insufficient and have been delayed,'' it said.
	   It noted that if, in exceptional circumstances, polluted water
with levels higher than those authorized by EU legislation must be
used for drinking purposes, then it should at least be treated to
comply with EU norms.
	   In Brittany, 80 percent of drinking water is taken from rivers
and reservoirs, compared with an average of 37 percent throughout
the rest of France, the Commission said.

Israel's Supreme Court debates uprising compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Supreme Court began hearing arguments on
whether Israeli soldiers engaged in warfare when they quelled the
1987-1993 Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation.
	   The decision of the special nine-judge panel, expected in
several months, will determine whether Israel will have to
compensate thousands of Palestinians injured in the uprising, one
of the lawyers in the case, Eliahu Avraham, said Thursday.
	   Current law exempts the state from liability for damages caused
by soldiers in times of war.
	   In Wednesday's hearing, the attorney representing the state,
Talia Sasson, argued that the soldiers' actions during the uprising
qualified as ``combatant activity,'' the Haaretz daily said.
	   However, Avraham said that as occupier at the time, Israel had
the duty to protect the population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   ``The occupied territories cannot be viewed as battle grounds,''
Avraham told The Associated Press.
	   A bill that would expand the definition of wartime activity and
would likely deny most Palestinian victims the right to claim
compensation has passed a first of three readings in Israel's
parliament.
	   Sasson said about 900 law suits by uprising victims are pending
in the courts. In all, some 5,000 claims have been filed since the
end of the uprising, Sasson said. Of those, 4,000 ended in rulings
or settlements.
	   According to Haaretz, Israel has paid about dlrs 31 million in
compensation so far.

Socialists leave Basque coalition gov't over links with radicals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Socialist party has pulled out of
the three-party Basque regional government because of links between
the coalition's principal member and an outside group allied to the
armed separatist organization ETA.
	   The Socialists, the leading opposition party in Spain's national
parliament, announced the split accusing the Basque Nationalist
Party of getting too close to Herri Batasuna, the political wing of
ETA.
	   Most parties in Spain have agreed to isolate Herri Batasuna
until it condemns ETA's violence. ETA, whose name stands for Basque
Homeland Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its
campaign for Basque independence.
	   On Thursday, Basque regional government chief and Basque
Nationalist Party member Antonio Ardanza appointed three new
councilors to replace the Socialist representatives who resigned a
day earlier.
	   The split came just under four months before fresh regional
elections are held on Oct. 25.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party won 22 of the 75-seats in the 1994
ballot, has shared power with the Socialists who won 12 and the
Basque Union, which won eight.
	   In recent months the Basque Nationalist Party have promoted
attempts to bring Herri Batasuna into the fold so as to encourage a
political solution to the region's conflict.
	   The Basque region, located close to Spain's border with France,
is one of 17 semiautonomous regions in Spain.

Pet python caught after four days of search
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After a two-day search by more than 80 people, and
warnings to parents to watch their small children, a 3.6-meter
(12-foot) African python was recaptured Thursday near where it had
slipped away when its owner took it sunbathing.
	   The search actually lasted four days. Owner Tsuneo Ito had
searched Monday and Tuesday before reporting the snake missing.
	   The snake is not poisonous, but pythons are known to prey on
small animals such as rabbits and chickens, eating them whole, said
police spokesman Tomoyuki Watanabe.
	   That had raised fears that the snake could attack babies in the
area, and police had warned local families to be alert, Watanabe
said.
	   A policeman, one of 20 in the search, found the snake coiled in
shrubs about 300 meters (330 yards) from the spot where it had
slithered into a river Monday in Sayama, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
northwest of Tokyo, Watanabe added.
	   A net was placed around the 31-kilogram (68-pound) snake, and
two experts from a zoo came and took it away in a bag.
	   Ito had kept six pythons, including one 4.5 meters (15 feet)
long, in a plywood enclosure in his two-room rented house.
	   He regularly took them in a cardboard box on his bicycle to the
river bank for sunbathing, without incident until Monday's escape
while Ito was not watching, Watanabe said.
	   After the escape, Ito turned over the other five snakes to a
snake study facility, Watanabe added.
	   He said police were questioning Ito on suspicion of violating
the local pet code by failing to receive prior government approval
to keep snakes.
	   The maximum penalty for violators is six months in prison, or a
fine of 100,000 yen (dlrs 720).

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A huge car bomb exploded in a crowded
downtown area of Hungary's capital on Thursday, killing four people
and injuring more than 20, a police official said.
	   The bomb was attached to a Mercedes-Benz that blew up shortly
before noon on busy Aranykez Street, in an area packed with
shoppers and pedestrians.
	   Three men and a woman were killed and another person was in
critical condition, said a police spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy.
	   One of the men died in the ambulance.
	   The blast smashed shop windows as far as 100 meters (yards)
away, and blew in the windows of a nearby McDonald's restaurant
filled with lunch-time customers.
	   Most of the injured were eating at the burger place when the
huge plate glass windows were shattered.
	   Two cars caught fire, but firemen extinguished the flames before
the gas tanks exploded.
	   The bombing was the latest manifestation of a crime wave
including a recent shooting in the same street in April that
wounded a Finn tourist.
	   Police are investigating some 140 bombings that have taken place
since 1991 but cannot stop a turf war among mostly Russian,
Ukrainian, Romanian, Turkish and Arab gangs.
	   Earlier this year, even homes of leading politicians were
targeted by a bomber.
	   No one has been apprehended.
	   Prime Minister Gyula Horn says 80 percent of crime in Hungary is
linked to foreigners.
	   Authorities set a five-million forint (dlrs 23,000) reward for
information leading to arrests in the case.

As usual, some get All-Star snub
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Kerry Wood didn't mind, Brian Jordan did and
Rafael Palmeiro expected it.
	   All three players were passed over Wednesday when All-Star game
reserves for both leagues were named for next week's game in
Denver.
	   Wood was among the most noteworthy omissions by NL manager Jim
Leyland, who selected five of his former Florida players, but
couldn't find room for Jordan, the NL's leading hitter.
	   ``What are you going to do?'' Jordan said. ``What are you going
to do?''
	   Wood, who tied a major league record with 20 strikeouts in a
nine-inning game this season, got the news he wasn't an All-Star
after striking out 13 in eight innings of a win over Arizona on
Wednesday.
	   ``I wasn't expecting to make it,'' Wood said. ``Maybe next
year.''
	   Another Cub too good not to go was Sammy Sosa, who has 33
homers. He finished sixth among NL outfielders in the fan vote, but
was placed on the team by Leyland.
	   Despite having a banner year, Palmeiro didn't get a nod from
Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove, who made Boston's Mo Vaughn the
backup for starter Jim Thome at first.
	   ``Some guys are going to be left out when you have so many great
players at one position, as we have at first base in the American
League,'' he said.
	   Leyland named five members of the 1997 World Series championship
team that were traded away in an offseason payroll purge by Florida
management. Moises Alou (Astros), Kevin Brown (Padres), Robb Nen
(Giants), Gary Sheffield (Dodgers) and Devon White (Diamondbacks)
will now join Edgar Renteria, the lone representative from this
year's club, for a Marlins reunion.
	   ``It's nice that we're pretty well-represented from our
championship team,'' Leyland said.
	   Meanwhile, the New York Yankees, snubbed by fans in the
starter's vote, had five players picked. However, 11-game winner
David Cone and Hideki Irabu, the AL's ERA leader, both were left
off, as were Boston's Nomar Garciaparra, Chicago's Frank Thomas and
Texas' Rick Helling (11 wins).
	   Cone might have been eliminated because he'll make his next
start on Sunday, and would not have been available to pitch.
	   ``A lot of things aren't fair about the All-Star game,'' he
said.
	   David Wells, whose perfect game on May 17 is this season's top
moment, was among the Yankees chosen to represent the team with
baseball's best record. Shortstop Derek Jeter, third baseman Scott
Brosius and outfielders Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill also were
selected.
	   ``I think it's a recognition of what we've done as a team,''
said Brosius, a first time All-Star. ``It's a team honor for all of
us.''
	   Hargrove also has five of his players, with pitcher Bartolo
Colon, catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. and shortstop Omar Vizquel joining
Thome and outfielder Kenny Lofton, both elected as starters.
	   Vizquel, who has won five straight Gold Gloves, is one of 14 AL
players who'll play in their first All-Star game.
	   San Diego will have five players on the team, including pitchers
Brown, Andy Ashby and Trevor Hoffman. Greg Vaughn was selected as a
backup outfielder and Tony Gwynn was voted to start.
	   Leyland rounded out his pitching staff with Rick Reed of the
Mets, a replacement player three years ago; Philadelphia's Curt
Schilling; Cincinnati's Jeff Shaw; and Montreal's Ugueth Urbina.
	   Pedro Martinez and Tom Gordon of the Red Sox were selected for
the AL staff, which also includes former Boston pitchers Roger
Clemens (now with Toronto) and Aaron Sele (now with Texas). Other
AL pitchers are Rolando Arrojo of Tampa Bay, Troy Percival of
Anaheim, Brad Radke of Minnesota and John Wetteland of Texas.
	   Arrojo and Oakland outfielder Ben Grieve were the only rookies
selected for the game. The hometown Rockies, who have outfielder
Larry Walker in the starting lineup, added a pair of reserves in
third baseman Vinny Castilla and outfielder Dante Bichette.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police sealed off a section of Hong Kong's
waterfront after they found 50 bullets in the harbor Thursday
evening, a police spokeswoman said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was scheduled to arrive at a nearby
harbor-front hotel hours after the bullets were found, and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin attended a banquet next to that hotel
Wednesday evening.
	   But the spokeswoman said the bullets were unlikely to be linked
to the leaders' visits.
	   ``These bullets have been in the water for a while. They're
rusty,'' she said, speaking on the customary condition of
anonymity.
	   A man fishing at a pier found the bullets in a plastic case and
called police, she said.
	   Wednesday night, three men carrying handguns escaped a police
chase in the same area, but a police spokesman had said it was
unlikely the incident was related to Jiang's visit.
	   Jiang left Hong Kong Thursday after a brief visit to mark Hong
Kong's first anniversary of its handover to China on July 1.
Clinton was scheduled to arrive several hours later for a visit to
conclude his tour of China.

DNA tests ordered for immigrants to determine Jewish roots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background, graf 6
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Russian immigrants whose Jewish parentage is in
question have been asked to submit to DNA tests, the Interior
Ministry confirmed Thursday.
	   Community activists said the practice was humiliating. They said
dozens of immigrants have already been asked to take the tests and
that those who refuse to cooperate risk eventual deportation.
	   The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the tests are
administered only as a last resort to verify an immigrant's Jewish
background.
	   The minister of immigrant absorption, Yuli Edelstein, said he
had not heard of the practice and would look into the matter.
	   In the last decade, nearly 800,000 immigrants came to Israel
from the former Soviet Union. Under Israel's Law of Return, those
who can show that they have a Jewish grandparent are eligible for
citizenship as well as government benefits.
	   The tests would help the Interior Ministry determine claims by
immigrants by showing whether the immigrant and a Jewish parent or
grandparent listed on the birth certificates were indeed related.
	   With the economic boom of the 1990s, Israel has become an
attractive place to live, and government officials have expressed
concern about reports of widespread fraud of documents that allow
immigrants to settle in Israel illegally.
	   Immigrants, in turn, have complained of humiliating treatment by
Israeli authorities.
	   Alex Tanzer, who heads an immigrants' rights committee, said he
has received dozens of complaints about government requests for DNA
testing. He said immigrants risk deportation if they refuse to
cooperate.
	   ``They (the authorities) need to stop insulting people. To be
asked to have your Jewish genealogy checked is painful. If the
testing must be done it should be requested before immigration,''
Tanzer said.

Estrada says 22-day Philippine Airlines pilots' strike was illegal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Thursday a devastating 22-day pilots' strike at Philippine Airlines
was illegal and indicated he would not personally intervene in the
company's labor problems.
	   Hundreds of pilots and ground personnel dismissed by the airline
demonstrated Wednesday near the presidential palace, urging Estrada
to help them recover their jobs.
	   ``We are still governed by the rule of law so we have to follow
the law,'' Estrada said, referring to the strike, which ended
Friday. ``If the strike is called illegal, what can I do?''
	   The labor secretary under previous President Fidel Ramos, who
stepped down Tuesday, ruled the strikers had violated a June 9
return-to-work order and therefore could be fired.
	   The current labor troubles at PAL, owned by Estrada's close
friend, business magnate Lucio Tan, began when its more than 600
pilots went on strike June 5, aggravating financial losses arising
from Asia's currency storm and scuttling an ambitious dlrs 4
billion modernization program.
	   The union was protesting an airline plan to retire some pilots
with 20 years of service or 20,000 flight hours, which is allowed
under a collective bargaining agreement.
	   PAL fired all the striking pilots after they ignored the
return-to-work order.
	   The pilots continued their strike until Friday, arguing that
their lawyer had received the order only the previous day. They
tried to return to work but were rejected by the airline, which
said they would be accepted back only if they reapplied as new
applicants.
	   Capt. Sotico Lloren, president of the pilots' union, said about
90 pilots have complied with the management condition.
	   Airline officials say the company lost more than 2 billion pesos
(dlrs 50 million) in revenue because of the strike.
	   At the height of the walkout, the airline laid off 5,000 of its
more than 13,000 workers to scale down its operations and stave off
more losses, causing the airline's flight attendants and ground
personnel to threaten to strike as well.
	   PAL said more employees may be laid off under an airline
rehabilitation plan that calls for a leaner work force, disposal of
40 out of 54 planes, suspension of more than two-thirds of its
routes and sale of some subsidiaries. PAL says it now needs only
200 pilots.
	   Estrada has said he prefers that the government keep its hands
off the airline and opposes a government bailout of PAL, saying the
government is short of cash.

Ending discrimination key to tackling epidemic, experts say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AIDS-Immune System &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Efforts to stem the spread of the AIDS virus will
fall short while fear of the virus continues to fuel
discrimination, speakers at the World AIDS Congress said Thursday.
	   People who are HIV-positive face discrimination ranging from the
denial of the right to marry, to being refused medication and other
treatment, via AIDS tests without their consent and disadvantages
in employment, delegates said.
	   Their fear of being branded as outcasts is still responsible for
a lack of recorded cases of discrimination, too few legal
challenges, and the virus being spread by people who don't know
they have it, they added.
	   ``People won't come forward if they face being killed in the
streets,'' said Susan Paxton of APN-plus, an organization
documenting human rights abuses of people with HIV/AIDS in Asia.
	   Her group is using HIV-positive people in eight Asian countries
to interview others about their experience of discrimination, in an
effort to overcome their fear of their confidentiality being
breached.
	   Although backing programs to provide condoms and clean needles
to high-risk groups, Mandeep Dhaliwal of Indian group Lawyers'
Collective insisted that ``they alone have proven to be
insufficient.''
	   A study of 100 people in Jalisco state, Mexico, counseled after
suffering HIV-linked discrimination, showed that only 21 went to
court with their complaints, said Armando Diaz Camarena of the AIDS
Prevention Council group.
	   But he and Dhaliwal stressed that legal action can succeed.
	   Antonio Matamoros of Costa Rica's National University told the
conference of a successful legal challenge by AIDS patients to make
the country's health system pay for the expensive drug combinations
that can stop progression to sickness and death.
	   The U.N. AIDS agency says that more than 30 million people
worldwide are infected with HIV and only one in 10 of them knows
it.
	   In February, the United Nations published guidelines to help
governments and other organizations improve their approach toward
people with the virus.

Minister fires TV channel chief after false report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The chief of Egypt's Channel 2 television
was fired Thursday, apparently after wrongly reporting the death of
a prominent actor, the official Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Information Minister Safwat el-Sharif, whose ministry overseas
television and radio broadcasting, named Magida Qutob to replace
Malak Ismael as head of Channel 2, the agency reported.
	   The channel, one of the most popular in Egypt, reported June 17
that Farid Shawqi, a famous film and theater actor, had died after
surgery. Shawqi's family protested, and Egyptian newspapers said
that Ismael had ordered its broadcast without first checking with
the television's news department.
	   Both Ismael and Qutob are veteran television broadcasters.

	   The Concord newspaper, a Lagos-based daily owned by Abiola,
reported Thursday that the international community was pressuring
Abiola to give up his claim to Nigeria's presidency.
	   The National Democratic Coalition, furious over reports that
some countries want Abiola to give up his claims to the presidency,
demanded to know ``why a man should be asked to contest an election
twice before he can claim his mandate.''
	   Annan, who is from Ghana, was the highest-profile diplomat to
visit Nigeria since Abacha provoked widespread outrage by executing
leading playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November 1995.
	   Abacha's death last month from a heart attack, and the
assumption of power by Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, provided the
opportunity for political change in Nigeria, Annan said.
	   Abubakar appears to be making a concerted effort to move away
from his predecessor's policies.

Lighting kills four, injures three in central Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BACOLOD, Philippines (AP) _ A bolt of lightning killed four
people inside a house and injured three children playing outside in
the rain, a relative said Thursday.
	   Little damage was done to the house in the accident Wednesday in
Manapla in Negros Occidental province, said Ricardo Barredo,
stepfather of Noralyn Salazar, one of the victims and the mother of
the three children.
	   Barredo said he was working on his farm about a kilometer
(half-mile) from Salazar's house when he saw lightning hit the
building.
	   He ran toward the house and saw Salazar's three children
sprawled outside writhing in pain from burns on their heads and
arms, he said.
	   Inside the house, he found Noralyn and her three sisters burned
to death, he said.
	   Elnico, the eldest of Salazar's children, said the lightning hit
a window in the house and struck his mother and her sisters, who
were watching them play outside.
	   He said the children were burned by the same lightning bolt.

Myanmar drug police make big seizure of amphetamines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Police seized nearly 400,000 amphetamine
tablets hidden in cars stopped at a checkpoint in northeastern
Myanmar last month, the country's state-controlled press reported
Thursday.
	   The seizures, in Kengtung, 640 kilometers (400 miles) northeast
of the capital Yangon, reflect the growing trade in the stimulant,
which some regional drug authorities say represents a bigger threat
than heroin.
	   Kengtung is in the middle of the Golden Triangle, the area where
the borders of Myanmar _ also called Burma _ Thailand and Laos
meet.
	   The Golden Triangle long has been one of the world's biggest
sources of opium and its derivative, heroin.
	   In recent years, many of the laboratories that produce heroin
also have turned to making methamphetamine, which is easier to make
and can have a higher profit margin.
	   The raw ingredients are usually smuggled in from China, and the
finished product is marketed in Thailand, where methamphetamine
abuse has become a plague.
	   Myanmar's anti-drug police searched three cars at checkpoints in
Kengtung on June 16 and 17 and found 390,000 stimulant tablets
hidden in the gas tanks and special compartments.
	   Four people including the alleged owner of the tablets were
arrested, the state-owned newspapers reported.
	   The reports did not say where the drugs were headed. But
Kengtung is only 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of the Thai
border.
	   On June 4, more than 1 million amphetamine tablets were seized
in another search of a car at a checkpoint in Kengtung. The car was
heading to the Myanmar border town of Tachilek, a major point for
smuggling into Thailand.
	   In his speech for International Drug Abuse Day last Friday, Home
Affairs Minister Col. Tin Hlaing expressed concern about the rising
number of seizures of psychotropic tablets in Myanmar and warned
that measures should be taken to prevent the abuse of stimulant
tablets.
	   Drug trafficking carries a maximum penalty of death in Myanmar.

Swiss react with dismay, anger to U.S. sanctions move
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Swiss Banks-Sanctions &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's political, financial and Jewish
leaders expressed anger Thursday over the decision in New York
giving a green light to state and city sanctions against Swiss
banks over World War II dealings.
	   The Swiss government demanded that Washington ``meet its
international obligations'' and intervene to halt the imposition of
any boycott.
	   The Swiss Confederation of Hebrew Congregations, the country's
main Jewish organization, said it regretted the ``unproductive
decision.''
	   The confederation regards the negotiations between banks and
Holocaust victims as a ``private economic matter'' and governments
should keep out, said Thomas Lyssy, vice president of the
confederation.
	   The conservative Swiss People's Party, the junior partner in the
four-party governing Federal Council, or cabinet, described the
threats as ``extortion,'' while the centrist Radical Democrats said
the moves had no place in affairs between civilized countries.
	   The government issued a statement calling sanctions
``counterproductive, unjustified and illegal.''
	   ``The cabinet will not allow itself to be influenced by such
pressure tactics,'' it said.
	   A commission representing about 800 state and local officials
said in New York on Wednesday that it would recommend that its
members begin applying sanctions to prod the Swiss government into
joining new negotiations.
	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe. But victims' relatives
say bank officials stonewalled survivors and their heirs after
World War II, claiming they could not find accounts or demanding
nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to relatives of
those who died in concentration camps.
	   The U.S. and Israeli governments have repeatedly praised
Switzerland and its banks for their ``unprecedented and
far-reaching steps'' to make good on any World War II wrongs, the
statement said.
	   ``Sanctions endanger the realization of these steps and ... in
no way serve the interests of Holocaust victims,'' it added.
	   The government said it would support Swiss firms if they take
legal steps against any sanctions and was studying further steps,
especially through the World Trade Organization.
	   The Social Democrats, the largest grouping in Parliament, said
that, despite its opposition to government involvement in the
dispute, it would back a protest to the WTO.
	   The body can mediate trade disputes between member countries.
	   The Swiss Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the threats led
to ``an unsettling situation,'' but that it opposed Swiss
countermeasures because the country needs good relations with the
United States.
	   The banks themselves were ``outraged and deeply disappointed,''
said Sylvia Matile, spokeswoman for the Swiss Bankers Association,
the banks' umbrella organization.
	   The banks have ``done more than has been demanded of us'' in
unprecedented efforts to find and return the assets of Holocaust
victims.

Former deputy apologizes for some _ not all _ racist remarks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - A former deputy for the
ultranationalist Republican Party on Thursday publicly excused
himself for anti-Semitic remarks but said he felt ``no need to
apologize to Gypsies.''
	   Josef Krejsa is known for his xenophobic articles in the
extremist Republika weekly, of which he was the former
editor-in-chief. In an interview with Czech public radio, he said
he would like to apologize to former colleagues in parliament as
well as ``all the people of Jewish origin whose religion I've
slandered.''
	   Krejsa claimed that in the past, he had made his anti-Jewish
remarks because of his affection to Arabs but that he has now
``seen the light'' and realized how silly he had been.
	   However, he refused to apologize to Gypsies, saying ``one can't
live with them.''
	   ``My stories on Gypsies were a political satire and those who
didn't like them shouldn't have read them,'' he said.
	   In his articles, Krejsa called Gypsies ``burned toast'' and
``rubbish not worth recycling.''
	   There is speculation Krejsa's sudden change of heart may have
been motivated by fear of prosecution, as he wasn't re-elected in
June elections and automatically lost his immunity.
	   ``I don't believe he means his apology in earnest because he's
always had a good laugh about his racist remarks,'' said
human-rights activist Jindrich Sidlo.
	   In the elections, the Republican Party failed to clear the
five-percent hurdle needed to make it into parliament, which leaves
several high-ranked party members in danger of prosecution for
spreading racial hatred.

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
announced Thursday that ``the stage is set'' for the release of all
of Nigeria's political prisoners, including Moshood Abiola, the
nation's leading opposition figure.
	   ``I'm leaving Nigeria with the stage set for the release of all
political detainees,'' Annan said. ``All political detainees will
be released and the government will make an announcement at the
appropriate time.''
	   Annan confirmed that he met with Abiola on Tuesday and said he
was in good health and alert.
	   Abiola, 60, was elected president of Nigeria in 1993 in an
election later annulled by Nigeria's military regime. The junta,
led by Gen. Sani Abacha, jailed Abiola a year later when he
declared himself president.
	   Annan said Abiola had decided to relinquish his claim to the
presidency and cooperate with Nigeria's junta in preparing for a
peaceful transition to democracy.
	   ``I found him more realistic than some of us outside, Chief
Abiola realizes that a lot has changed,'' Annan said. Annan said
Abiola's first priority upon leaving prison is to rebuild his life
and then determine what political support he still has after more
than four years in prison.
	   Annan, who is from Ghana, was the highest-profile diplomat to
visit Nigeria since Abacha provoked widespread outrage by executing
leading playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November 1995.
	   Abacha's death last month from a heart attack, and the
assumption of power by Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, provided the
opportunity for political change in Nigeria, Annan said.
	   Abubakar appears to be making a concerted effort to move away
from his predecessor's policies.
	   Abiola also met with Emeka Anyaoku, the Nigerian-born
secretary-general of the commonwealth of former British colonies.
The Commonwealth, a 54-nation organization comprising Britain and
its former colonies, suspended Nigeria from its ranks after
Saro-Wiwa was executed along with eight other activists.
	   The Concord newspaper, a Lagos-based daily owned by Abiola,
reported Thursday that the international community was pressuring
Abiola to give up his claim to Nigeria's presidency.
	   The National Democratic Coalition, furious over reports that
some countries want Abiola to give up his claims to the presidency,
demanded in a statement released in Lagos to know ``why a man
should be asked to contest an election twice before he can claim
his mandate.''

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Lebanon on Thursday concluded a
maritime transport agreement which allows for closer cooperation in
the field.
	   The agreement provides for speedier handling of passengers and
goods at the two countries' ports and eases bureaucratic
procedures, Jordan's Transportation Minister Sami Gammo said.
	   He said the accord also allows for the exchange of information
and training of naval cadres in the two countries.
	   Lebanese Ambassador William Habib said under the agreement,
Jordan-bound goods from Europe can be transited through Lebanese
ports and goods from from Asia would go through Jordan before
arriving in Lebanon.
	   Habib and Gammo exchanged the ratified documents of the
agreement in a brief ceremony in Amman, the state-run Petra News
Agency reported.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices shored up, but turnover
slipped on the stock exchange this week because of sluggish
activity, a market report said Thursday.
	   Brokers said investors stayed away from the floor for most of
the week because of uncertainty over the peace process between
neighboring Israel and the Palestinians.
	   The market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
nudged up by 3.66 percent to 173.17 points.
	   It said shares of commercial banks increased by 3 percent,
industrial firms by 5.79 percent, the insurance sector by 2.19
percent and services companies by 0.69 percent.
	   Turnover dropped by 5.6 percent to 4.57 million dinars (dlrs 6.4
million), the report added.
	   Stocks of 107 firms were traded during the week.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 2,094.5 points at the end of the trading week, 11.1
points, or 0.53 percent lower than the previous week, The National
Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report, the company said investors were not buying
because they expect even lower prices through the summer.
	   Some 159.69 million shares changed hands this week, down 44.85
million or 21.93 percent from the week before. The value of these
shares also fell 24.50 percent to 41.28 million dinars (dlrs 134.90
million). It was 54.68 million dinars (dlrs 178.69 million) last
week.
	   Of the 76 companies listed on the exchange, 55 were traded with
only two closing higher and 38 closing lower. Fifteen were
unchanged.
 &UR; ___
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus' loss-making national carrier has
proposed staff cuts of up to 700, wage cuts of 10 percent for
pilots and cabin staff and a three-year wage freeze starting next
year, according to news reports published Thursday.
	   Cyprus Airways employs close to 2,000 people and made a loss of
four million pounds (dlrs 7.52 million) last year, down from 5.2
million pounds (dlrs 9.7 million) the previous year.
	   The government, which received a blueprint of the reform plan on
Wednesday, owns an 82 percent stake in the company, which is listed
on the Cyprus Stock Exchange.
	   On Monday, the island's 56-seat parliament will debate the plan,
already opposed by some of the unions representing Cyprus Airways
employees.

Union to sue to freeze Philippine Airlines' Australian assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Action will be taken in the Federal
Court to freeze the assets of Philippine Airlines in Australia, a
union said Thursday.
	   The airline recently announced the firing of more than 5,600
staff in a worldwide cutback.
	   It advised the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that
it will close its entire operations in Australia and wind back to
five international routes that do not include Australia.
	   The Australian Services Union said about 70 jobs would be lost
in the airline's offices in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne.
	   ASU assistant national secretary Greg McLean said the union is
concerned to see that staff members receive their proper
entitlements, including redundancy and superannuation, and that
outstanding industrial issues were cleared up.
	   Meetings Thursday with airline management and superannuation
trustees had brought assurances but the union was concerned about
the potential flight of money from Australia to Manila, McLean
said.
	   ``We are joining in some action on Monday morning in the Federal
Court. There are some steps being taken to wind the company up,''
he said.
	   ``We'll be seeking to have the assets of this company frozen.''
	   He said the union had learned that on Tuesday night, the airline
``moved some hundreds of thousands of dollars out of the country.''
	   McLean said the airline had some assets in property held by the
company in Sydney and there are also some funds in banks.

Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets surged Wednesday on
optimism that a plan to clean up Japan's troubled financial sector
will also revive regional economies. In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average gained 108.69 points, or 0.66 percent, closing at
16,471.58. The market's main barometer now has climbed a total of
1,516.98 points in seven trading days, including Wednesday's
532.62-point gain, or 3.36 percent. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was
quoted at 139.18 yen, up 0.94 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and
also above its late New York rate of 138.07 yen overnight. After
the market closed, the Japanese government approved an ambitious
plan to assume control over failed banks and gradually shut them
down, a key component in initiatives to pull Japan out of its worst
recession since World War II. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's government on Thursday approved an
ambitious plan to assume control over failed banks and gradually
shut them down, a key component in initiatives to pull this country
out of its worst recession since World War II. The so-called
``bridge bank'' scheme, patterned after the U.S. bailout of failed
savings and loan institutions in the 1980s, is designed to prevent
bank failures from cutting off credit to healthy borrowers and
driving Japan deeper into economic stagnation. The plan was
approved by a special government panel after a series of top-level
meetings and announced by Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga. ``Our
weak financial system and the accompanying credit crunch have
weighed on the economy,'' Matsunaga said. ``If this credit crunch
can be eliminated, we hope to see a strong economic recovery.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Airbus will sell as many as 30 more of its
jetliners to U.S. Airways, the two firms said Thursday, in the
latest step by the European consortium toward equal footing with
the mighty U.S. jetmaker Boeing. The U.S. airline, which has
already ordered more than 100 planes from Airbus, is to buy up to
30 more widebody A330-300s, officials said in a joint statement.
``U.S. Airways will have the most modern fleet in the air within
just a few years time,'' U.S. Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf said in
a statement ahead of a news conference in Paris with Airbus
Managing Director Noel Forgeard. (FRANCE AIRBUS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Unable to curb its currency's
slide or its economy's tumble with tight-fisted policies, Malaysia
now intends to spend its way to recovery. Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim, announcing a 5 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.2 billion) stimulus
package to revive stalled projects, said Wednesday the government
had to intervene. The package marks a retreat from the tight
spending and credit squeeze monetary authorities had insisted were
needed to stabilize the ringgit and cap inflation. It comes on the
heels of a 7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.75 billion) government
spending package. ``The economy has to recover and if it takes the
government to provide the necessary stimulus, then we will have to
do it,'' Anwar said. (MALAYSIA ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A commission representing hundreds of U.S.
finance officials has cleared the way for sanctions against Swiss
banks suspected of holding the assets of Holocaust victims. Alan
Hevesi, chairman of the commission, said negotiations between the
banks and Holocaust survivors seeking their families' assets
``reached a total stone-like impasse.'' The group decided Wednesday
to lift its moratorium on sanctions against Swiss banks. California
will become the first state to impose sanctions. Treasurer Matt
Fong, who oversees dlrs 32 billion in state funds, said California
will not seek new contracts with U.S. subsidiaries of Swiss banks.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian political leaders
are trying to find common ground with Kosovo's separatist fighters,
well aware that their influence is diminishing while support for
the guerrillas grows. The Kosovo Albanians also are keeping links
open with international officials. Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova held talks Thursday with a Norwegian official in Pristina,
the capital of the secessionist province. Details were not
immediately available. Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian
political parties failed to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to
cooperation with the Kosovo Liberation Army. But they did agree to
meet again Sunday to try to meld the guerrilla struggle with their
nonviolent independence campaign. (YUGOSLAVIA KOSOVO)
	   GUILIN, China (AP) _ Standing before the spectacular limestone
peaks of a restored green paradise, U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged China Thursday to learn from U.S. mistakes and not harm the
environment for the sake of economic growth. He pledged U.S.
support to the cleansing of rivers, air and land in China, which
has five of the most polluted cities in the world. ``Let us,
Chinese and Americans, preserve what we have inherited from the
past and, in doing so, preserve the future we are working so hard
to build for our children,'' Clinton said. (CLINTON CHINA)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China called on the United States Thursday to
stop selling arms to Taiwan and said weapons sales increase the
chances Beijing will use force to take the island. The appeal by a
Foreign Ministry official came two days after U.S. President Bill
Clinton stated that Washington did not support independence for
Taiwan nor would it back the island's membership in the United
Nations. Clinton's statement before community leaders in Shanghai
gave Chinese leaders their biggest foreign policy victory of the
U.S. president's nine-day China tour. Clinton aides, however,
immediately signaled that the administration would live up to a
U.S. law requiring Washington to provide Taiwan with weapons for
defense. (CHINA TAIWAN)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan on Thursday denied
allegations by a disgruntled scientist seeking asylum in the United
States that it was considering a first nuclear strike against
India. In an interview earlier this week with The Associated Press,
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub called the allegations ``nonsense.'' He
said Pakistan had made ``elaborate plans'' to retaliate if
neighboring India attacked its nuclear facilities. But there was no
nuclear first strike strategy, he said. He reiterated those remarks
in reports published Thursday in several English-language
newspapers. His comments were in response to interviews given in
the United States by Iftikar Chaudhray Khan, who says he was a
nuclear scientist for Pakistan and now wants asylum in the United
States. (PAKISTAN US DEFECTOR)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Arsonists damaged nine Roman
Catholic churches across Northern Ireland in attacks lasting into
early Thursday, hours after the province's largest Protestant and
Catholic parties shook hands on a fragile new governing
partnership. No arrests have been made for the attacks, which
severely damaged three churches, said a spokesman for the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, speaking with customary anonymity. Protestant
churchmen, including leader of the Church of Ireland, Archbishop of
Armagh Robin Eames, and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church,
Dr. John Dickson, condemned the attacks and offered sympathy to
Roman Catholic worshipers. David Ervine, leader of the small
Protestant party, the Progressive Unionists, labeled the arsonists
``stupid, pathetic and sick.'' (NORTHERN IRELAND)

	   GUILIN, China (AP) _ Standing before the spectacular limestone
peaks of a restored green paradise, U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged China on Thursday to learn from U.S. mistakes and not harm
the environment for the sake of economic growth.
	   He pledged U.S. support to the cleansing of rivers, air and land
in China, which has five of the most polluted cities in the world.
	   ``Let us, Chinese and Americans, preserve what we have inherited
from the past and, in doing so, preserve the future we are working
so hard to build for our children,'' Clinton said.
	   After a boat ride on the picturesque Li River, Clinton flew to
Hong Kong on Air Force One, the first passenger plane to land at
the new Chek Lap Kok International Airport. Clinton was welcomed by
Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's Chinese-appointed chief executive.
The airport was dedicated earlier in the day by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, who was in Hong Kong for the first anniversary of the
former British colony's return to Chinese rule.
	   Clinton also scheduled a meeting with the city's de-facto
opposition leader, Martin Lee. That session will be closed to
media, including photographers _ a restriction critics consider a
bow to Beijing. But the White House insisted it was ``normal
practice'' to prohibit full coverage of meetings with opposition
leaders.

World Cup: Croatian tempers soar ahead of Germany clash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatia waged a war of words Thursday
against quarterfinal opponent Germany, assailing German media
reports portraying the Croatian team as easy prey.
	   ``We are irritated by what we are hearing from the German
side,'' coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``The German newspapers have
written unflattering things that have upset us.''
	   Croatia, in high spirits after reaching the World Cup
quarterfinals on its first try, is itching for revenge for a 2-1
loss against Germany that eliminated the young Balkan country from
the European Championship two years ago, which the Germans went on
to win.
	   Most members of the 1996 team are back in France for the World
Cup. They include striker Davor Suker, who scored the goal against
Germany and has notched three at the World Cup.
	   Blazevic has called Saturday's game at Lyon ``a great
showdown,'' but on Thursday he promised to keep it a ``chivalrous
combat.''
	   Firing up the atmosphere were suggestions in German media that
the Croats are past their prime and would not derail Germany's
quest for a fourth World Cup title.
	   ``Berti: These Croats don't scare us,'' read a headline
addressed to German coach Berti Vogts in the tabloid newspaper
Bild.
	   The papers were only reflecting what the German coach and
players are saying. German captain Juergen Klinsmann, for instance,
was brimming with confidence.
	   ``With all due respect to Croatia, however, it's really up to us
and I am very optimistic,'' Klinsmann said. ``We want to go to
Paris and it really depends only on us.''
	   Croatia finished second in its qualifying group behind Argentina
and beat lackluster Romania 1-0 on Tuesday to advance to the final
eight.
	   Blazevic, who insists that his team could win the trophy, said
he fears Germany's traditionally strong collective game and its
comeback strength.
	   ``Of course they never give up,'' he said. ``They can always
turn a game around, especially in the final minutes.''
	   Blazevic faces no major injuries in his team and will get back
sweeper Zvonimir Soldo after a one-game suspension. He said
Thursday he has worked out his lineup, but he did not immediately
reveal it.
	   Croatia's holdovers from 1996 include Derby County defender Igor
Stimac, who was sent off against Germany.
	   Like his teammates and coach, he still carries a fervent grudge
against that game's Swedish referee, whom the Croats accuse of
robbing them of victory.
	   But Stimac is trying to screen out the bad memories.
	   ``I'm concentrating on the next game,'' he said Thursday. ``I
don't want to think about the last game (against Germany) because
it wasn't too happy.''

Russian Far East again faces severe power cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A regional power company warned Thursday of more
widespread energy cuts in Russia's Far East because of strikes by
workers demanding overdue wages.
	   Electricity could even be cut to hospitals, day care centers and
bread factories, the Interfax news agency said, citing deputy
director Alexander Ius of the regional energy company, Dalenergo.
	   Employees at some power stations in the Primorye region have not
been paid for six months and are refusing to go to work. The strike
threatened to close the power plant providing energy to the
regional capital, Vladivostok.
	   Dalenergo cannot pay its workers because it owes the federal
government 27 million rubles (dlrs 4.5 million) and its bank
accounts were frozen by the tax police earlier in the week.
Consumers owe the company an estimated 4 billion rubles (dlrs 600
million).
	   Energy officials in Primorye often warn of imminent widespread
power outages. Cuts occurred frequently last year, but recent
warnings have not been implemented.

DNA tests ordered for immigrants to determine Jewish roots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Russian immigrants whose Jewish parentage is in
question have been asked to submit to DNA tests, the Interior
Ministry confirmed Thursday.
	   Community activists said the practice was humiliating. They said
dozens of immigrants have already been asked to take the tests and
that those who refuse to cooperate risk eventual deportation.
	   The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the tests are
administered only as a last resort to verify an immigrant's Jewish
background.
	   The minister of immigrant absorption, Yuli Edelstein, said he
had not heard of the practice and would look into the matter.
	   In the last decade, nearly 800,000 immigrants came to Israel
from the former Soviet Union. Under Israel's Law of Return, those
who can show that they have a Jewish grandparent are eligible for
citizenship as well as government benefits.
	   The tests would help the Interior Ministry determine claims by
immigrants by showing whether the immigrant and a Jewish parent or
grandparent listed on the birth certificates were indeed related.
	   With the economic boom of the 1990s, Israel has become an
attractive place to live, and government officials have expressed
concern about reports of widespread fraud of documents that allow
immigrants to settle in Israel illegally.
	   Immigrants, in turn, have complained of humiliating treatment by
Israeli authorities.

Supreme court frees two opposition journalists in libel case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The supreme court freed Thursday two
journalists of a leading opposition newspaper who had been
imprisoned for libel.
	   Magdi Hussein, editor-in-chief of Al Shaab, and reporter
Mohammed Helal were convicted for libel in February and sentenced
to two years in prison with hard labor for articles they wrote
accusing the sons of former Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfy of
using their father's position to amass wealth.
	   The court also fined Hussein 7,500 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 2,200).
	   An appeals court later upheld the convictions, but reduced the
sentences to one year.
	   The journalists appealed to the Court of Cassation, Egypt's
highest court, arguing they did not violate any law and that their
criticisms fell within the limits of free expression.
	   On Thursday, the court annulled the sentences and ordered the
release of Hussein and Helal.
	   Court officials said the judge also ordered the former interior
minister to pay the expenses of the trial.
	   The Al Shaab articles were part of a series of reports that
focused on the former interior minister, who was sacked in November
following the massacre of 58 tourists in the southern city of
Luxor. The stories accused him and his family of abusing his
position for financial gain.
	   Local human rights activists had criticized the initial verdict
as a ``disastrous'' blow to press freedom.
	   Hussein's son, Ahmed, said Thursday his father was expected to
be released from prison later in the day.
	   However, the court also ruled that Hussein should be retried in
another corruption case brought against him by el-Alfy's son Alla,
officials said.

Former President Bush unveils Berlin Wall monument
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Former U.S. President George Bush unveiled a
monument to the fall of communism on Thursday, a design featuring
five horses leaping over a grafitti-covered section of the Berlin
Wall.
	   Titled ``The Day the Wall Came Down,'' the 7-ton bronze
sculpture is a gift from a foundation led by Bush, who was
president when the Wall was torn down in 1989.
	   The dlrs 1.75 million monument stands outside Berlin's newly
opened Allied Museum, dedicated to the U.S., British and French
postwar occupation of West Berlin. It is a replica of a statue
outside the George Bush Presidential Library, at Texas A&AMP;M
University.
	   Sculptor Veryl Goodnight, of Sante Fe, New Mexico, says the
horses represent freedom. She says she conceived of the monument in
a dream after watching the destruction of the original wall on the
news in November 1989.

Government tells rice millers to lighten loads to find Thai
</HEADLINE>
workers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The government has told rice millers
who complain that Thais can't be found to replace expelled illegal
immigrant workers that lightening their load might help.
	   Labor Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri told the rice millers, who
began shutting down operations Thursday to protest new laws against
illegal workers, that the jobs are just too tough.
	   Presently, rice mill workers _ mostly from neighboring Myanmar,
one of the world's poorest countries _ have to heft 100-kilogram
(220-pound) sacks of rice all day.
	   Trairong amended a draft regulation Wednesday to enforce capping
loads at 55 kilograms (120 pounds), reasoning that Thais, less used
to grueling labor after a decade of rapid industrialization, might
then be found to do the jobs.
	   But Kriengsak Tapananond, a member of the Thai Rice Mills
Association, said the heavier sacks had been used for years. In the
past, Thailand ordered them from India, indicating 100 kilograms
was a normal load elsewhere.
	   ``When people from China immigrated to Thailand, they carried
sacks like this,'' Kriengsak said. ``It didn't kill them. They
became rich and prosperous.''
	   Descendants of Chinese laborers who emigrated to Thailand
earlier in this century number among the richest families.
	   Kriengsak said foreigners were paid less than Thais in the past
but their wages have matched the Thai minimum wage, currently 165
baht (dlrs 4) per day, since a labor shortage emerged in 1991.
	   The Thai Rice Mills Association is demanding exemption from laws
to expel illegal alien workers and free up jobs for Thais in the
middle of the country's worst recession in decades.
	   As it is, very few Thais have come forward to fill vacancies in
the mills, which normally employ 20,000 workers.
	   The association says it will shut down the mills until the
government rescinds the law or finds more Thai workers. Government
officials are scheduled to meet on the topic next week.
	   The original plan called for all foreign workers to leave their
jobs by May 1. The deadline was extended to July 10 after mill
owners complained.
	   Kriengsak said the 400 mills normally would produce 1 billion
baht (dlrs 24 million) worth of rice each day. Thailand is the
world's No. 1 rice exporter.

Solana says NATO ready for Kosovo, but diplomacy comes first

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO is ready to act in
Kosovo if the current push for a cease-fire and negotiations fails,
Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday.
	   ``We will not tolerate another war like the war that you have
suffered here,'' he said in Sarajevo during a brief Balkans visit.
	   ``I'm very, very concerned about the situation in Kosovo,''
Solana said before departing for Tirana for talks with Albanian
leaders. He was in Bosnia to open a seminar about democracy.
	   The alliance chief indicated that the focus for now is on
current efforts to broker a cease-fire involving both Serb forces
and the ethnic Albanians' secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``NATO continues its preparations in order to be prepared in
case the help of NATO to back up the international efforts is
necessary,'' he said.
	   Solana said the world appears to have learned from the mistakes
it made in reacting slowly to the war in Bosnia.
	   ``The way the international community is reacting to the crisis
in Kosovo has been very different,'' he said.
	   ``The international community reacted immediately in one voice''
when the Kosovo crisis arose. Also, NATO is involved in the crisis
from the very beginning, he noted.
	   ``At this point the diplomatic channel is open, the
international community is working,'' Solana said.
	   Russia, however, continues to block any U.N. Security Council
resolution that would result in any military action against its
Serb allies.
	   Western officials have said NATO has the right to go ahead with
military action despite that opposition if there is an
international consensus.
	   Asked what NATO will do if Russia continues blocking a
resolution, Solana said ``NATO always acts according to
international law.''
	   ``If the situation will require action, I'm sure that any
country that is part of the Security Council will recognize that
the situation requires action. If somebody doesn't see that, he
will have to take the responsibility upon his shoulders,'' he said.

Australian government urged to get tough on bribery abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Bribing public officials overseas
should be a criminal offense that can be prosecuted in Australia,
Parliament was told Thursday.
	   The joint standing committee on treaties wants laws on this
issue toughened to include reckless as well as deliberate actions
by Australian business people abroad.
	   ``Corruption is a global problem which must be addressed
multilaterally,'' committee chairman Bill Taylor told Parliament.
	   ``It takes many forms and its effects can be seen in some of the
unfortunate events which have occurred in Asian and Southeast Asian
economies in the last year or so,'' he said.
	   The committee is also urging the Australian government to widen
its anti-bribery net by persuading governments in the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations to join its campaign.
	   Sen. Helen Coonan said its target is grand bribery of public
officials in other countries.
	   She said the committee is not concerned about small matters like
paying U.S. dlrs 100 to grease wheels to get a telephone connected
or cargo moved off wharves.
	   Coonan also said that the committee does not want to place
Australian business at a disadvantage in other countries.
	   But she said Australia must have laws to punish those
responsible if Australian business people were found to be involved
in a scandal abroad on a scale comparable with the Lockheed bribery
affair in Japan.
	   The government is already preparing legislation that would make
the actions of Australians who bribe public officials abroad a
crime under Australian law.
	   The Australian government's approach is broadly in line with
that either already taken or being planned by most countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

World Cup: Charlton says FIFA's tackle mandate helped Owen score
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Michael Owen would not have scored his stunning
goal against Argentina if the mandate to expel defenders for
tackling from behind hadn't been in force, according to former
World Cup star Bobby Charlton.
	   ``Someone would definitely have taken him out,'' said Charlton,
one of the stars of England's 1966 triumph.
	   ``They would never have allowed him to get near the goal.''
	   The 18-year-old England star went on a 40-meter run, beating two
Argentine defenders for pace before shooting home in the game at
Saint-Etienne, where the South Americans won 4-3 on penalties after
a 2-2 tie.
	   The goal was hailed as one of the best of any World Cup but
Charlton, whose best was a 30-meter shot against Mexico in 1966,
said it was helped by FIFA's decision to make it an automatic red
card offense to foul players from behind.
	   ``It was a magnificent goal but he would not have scored that
goal if the mandate had not been there,'' Charlton said.
	   ``If they thought they could get away with it, one of those two
Argentina defenders (Jose Chamot and Roberto Ayala) would certainly
have brought him down. If they had, they would have had only 10 men
and they might have been out of the championship instead of
England.''
	   Charlton, a victim of tough-tackling defenders during his long
career with Manchester United and England, said the mandate to try
and cut out the tackle from behind had led to a big increase in
goal chances at this World Cup.
	   But it has also affected the performances of the referees.
	   ``I have seen some yellow and red cards given for some really
innocuous challenges, even with tackles from behind,'' he said.
	   ``If FIFA gives a directive just before a World Cup, then the
referees don't have to worry about falling foul of FIFA if they
give a red card. They're going to say, `Well, you told us to do
it.'
	   ``My worry is that people go to soccer games to see all 22
players in action. They don't want to see people sent off the field
for things that aren't really serious.''
	   Charlton said he hoped that Owen would not become a target for
ruthless defenders.
	   ``If he stays fit and free of injury, then the world's his
oyster,'' Charlton said. ``He's fast, he's got good control and he
does what people like to see _ attack defenders and go for goal.
	   ``He's a sensible young man and I think that his biggest problem
is facing up to the high-profile life he will inevitably get from
now on after his performance here. I hope that the people around
him, agents, PR people, will allow him to still be a footballer.''

Don't count on Asian markets for exports, economic forecaster
</HEADLINE>
warns &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian exporters should divert
their products to markets other than Asia to reduce the impact of
the regional economic crisis on the domestic economy, a forecasting
group said Thursday.
	   The alternative would be a lower exchange rate, higher inflation
and higher interest rates accompanied by a possible downgrading in
Australia's international credit rating, the South Australian
Center for Economic Studies warned.
	   Any general recovery in Asia was likely to take several years,
and exporters should look toward markets in Europe, the United
States and Latin America for increased trade, the center said in
its latest regular briefing paper.
	   ``With Japan now in recession, Hong Kong very wobbly and
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia likely to suffer sharply reduced
growth for two or three years, demand from these countries for
(Australian) products will remain weak for the foreseeable
future,'' the center said.
	   Despite the urgent need for a shift in export focus, analysts
felt that the impact of the Asian downturn on the value of the
Australian dollar has been larger than warranted, the center said.
	   Surveys suggested a value of about U.S. 65 cents was more
appropriate given current economic fundamentals in Australia. The
Australian dollar is currently worth about U.S. 62 cents, but
recently dipped below U.S. 60 cents.
	   The center said that following the dollar's fall below 60 cents,
it was now apparent the central Reserve Bank would need to lift
official interest rates to support the currency at rates above that
mark over the longer term, possibly by as much as 2 percentage
points.
	   ``The assessment is that the Reserve Bank will increase interest
rates, albeit reluctantly because an Australian dollar at 60 cents
or lower is undervalued when reference is made to the soundness of
the Australian financial system,'' the center said.
	   The recent depreciation was also likely to affect inflation,
possibly pushing it above the federal government's 1998-99 budget
forecast of 2.75 percent.
	   However, the center said any increase could be partially offset
by softer domestic demand prompted by increased prices for imported
goods.

Czech Republic's only mosque opens in south Moravia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The nation's first mosque opened
in the south Moravian town of Brno on Thursday to serve the needs
of the country's approximately 20,000 Muslims.
	   The news agency CTK said the mosque will also include a library
and a school where Koran and the Arabic language will be taught.
	   The head of the Muslim community in the Czech Republic, Mohamed
Ali Silhavy, said that despite the opening of the mosque _ which he
considers a ``breakthrough'' in relations of Czechs and Muslims _
prejudices still may survive.
	   ``Islam is a religion of tolerance and peace, and those who warn
of fundamentalism just do not understand,'' said Silhavy, 80.
	   Of the estimated 20,000 Muslims currently living in the Czech
Republic, some 500 are Czechs.

French journalist placed under formal investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A judge on Thursday placed a French journalist
under formal investigation for his reporting of the probe into the
February slaying of France's top prefect on the Mediterranean
island of Corsica.
	   Judicial officials, who asked not be named, said Gilles Millet,
who works for France's left-leaning weekly magazine L'Evenement du
jeudi, was released after being notified.
	   Being placed under formal invesitgation is one step short of
being charged.
	   In a very rare case, Millet was detained by police on Tuesday at
his Paris home and was placed in custody.
	   He is accused of violating the secrecy of the judicial
investigation into the slaying of Claude Erignac.
	   After detaining Millet, police seized documents relating to the
investigation.
	   Millet's lawyer, Francois Stefanaggi, on Wednesday called his
client's detention ``inappropriate and excessive,'' pointing out
that it was ``extraordinary'' for a reporter in France to be taken
into custody for work-related matters.
	   Erignac was shot in the head Feb. 6 while walking through a
crowded street in the city of Ajaccio.
	   A splinter group of Corsican nationalists has claimed
responsibility for the killing, but the assailants have not yet
been caught.

German bank talking with Credit Lyonnais about buying subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Commerzbank AG is talking
with France's Credit Lyonnais SA about possibly buying the French
bank's subsidiaries in Stockholm and Copenhagen, a Commerzbank
spokesman confirmed Thursday.
	   While the German bank doesn't currently have a presence in
Stockholm, it already has a liaison office in Copenhagen, he said.
The Credit Lyonnais subsidiaries are relatively small, with a staff
of between 20 and 25 employees each, the spokesman said.
	   A spokesman at Credit Lyonnais confirmed Thursday the
state-controlled bank is in talks with several potential partners,
but said no choice had been made.
	   Commerzbank said it expects an answer this month.
	   In May, the European Commission's competition authorities
approved the French government's latest rescue package for Credit
Lyonnais, in exchange for substantial European asset sales and a
promise to privatize Credit Lyonnais by October 1999.

Car explosion in Budapest kills 4, injures dozens

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A huge car bomb exploded in a crowded
downtown area of Hungary's capital on Thursday, killing four people
and injuring more than 20, a police official said.
	   The bomb was attached to a Mercedes-Benz that blew up shortly
before noon on busy Aranykez Street, in an area packed with
shoppers and pedestrians.
	   Three men and a woman were killed and another person was in
critical condition, said a police spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy.
	   The blast shattered shop windows as far as 100 meters (yards)
away, and blew in the windows of a nearby McDonald's restaurant
filled with lunch-time customers.
	   Most of the injured were eating at the burger place when the
huge plate glass windows crashed in.
	   Two cars caught fire, but firemen extinguished the flames before
the gas tanks exploded.
	   The bombing was the latest in a gang war that has included a
recent shooting on the same street in April that wounded a Finn
tourist.
	   Police are investigating some 140 bombings that have taken place
since 1991 but cannot stop a turf war among mostly Russian,
Ukrainian, Romanian, Turkish and Arab gangs. Earlier this year
homes of leading politicians were targeted.
	   No one has been apprehended.
	   Prime Minister Gyula Horn says 80 percent of crime in Hungary is
linked to foreigners.
	   Authorities set a five-million forint (dlrs 23,000) reward for
information leading to arrests in the case.

World Cup: Platini won't play benefit for injured policeman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Soccer great Michel Platini said Thursday he will
not play in a match of retired stars to benefit a French policeman
beaten into a coma by German thugs because he feels such a match is
premature.
	   The match with former French and German internationals July 11
in Paris _ on the eve of the World Cup final _ is to raise money
for David Nivel, who was attacked June 21 in Lens after the
Germany-Yugoslavia match.
	   Former German internationals who will play include Karl-Heinz
Rummenigge, Rudi Voeller Manfred Kaltz, Pierre Littbarski and Bernd
Foster. Franz Beckenbauer will be coaching, the organizers said.
	   French players expected to play include Eric Cantona, David
Ginola, Didier Six, Dominique Rocheteau, Joel Bats, Patrick
Battiston, Luis Fernandez and Jean Tigana.
	   Claude Simonet, president of the French soccer federation, told
reporters Thursday he ``was sure'' that Platini would want to play.
	   But Platini, the co-president of the France 98 organizing
committee, said he wouldn't participate because it was too early
for such a match, with Nivel's condition not known definitely.
	   The policeman has been comatose in a hospital in Lille since
being taken there by helicopter for treatment.
	   ``It would be better, firstly, to have this match in the Arras
region _ were Nivel is from_ and secondly I wasn't informed of this
initiative,'' Platini said at a press conference at the organizing
committee headquarters.
	   ``It would be better to take some time to think about what we
should do.''
	   Platini said it would be hard to get together the French and
German internationals so quickly to stage the match.
	   But Simonet and his German counterpart, Egidius Braun, said a
number of stars have committed to the match to show solidarity
between the two countries.
	   An emotional Braun spoke of his shock when he heard news of the
policeman being beaten with an iron bar by German thugs who
attacked him on a narrow street in the northern city just after the
2-2 draw between Germany and Yugoslavia.
	   ``When the news reached me of the horrible violence in Lens, I
was deeply shocked and I didn't know how to react,'' Braun said.
	   ``I wasn't thinking of football but of the destiny of the
policeman and his family who did his duty for all of us.''
	   Braun lashed out at the hooligans for the bad image they give of
Germany.
	   ``We have 8 million people in Germany and only 600 of those
animals,'' he said of the hooligans.
	   Braun said he wanted some of the money raised in Germany by
various public appeals to be put in a special fund in Nivel's name
against violence in and around soccer.
	   Simonet stressed that the teams will mix German and French
players, and they will wear soccer jerseys with the text, ``Yes to
football without violence.''

India expresses concern about Sino-U.S. nuclear alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India is wary of the United States and
China coming closer on nuclear issues, its defense minister said in
an interview in the July issue of Jane's Defense Weekly.
	   ``If Beijing decides not to target Washington ... India would be
China's prime enemy,'' Defense Minister George Fernandes was quoted
as saying, apparently referring to an accord between U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin not to aim missiles
at each other.
	   ``India has to be more concerned about the Sino-U.S. alliance
than it has been so far,'' Fernandes was quoted as telling Jane's.
	   During his visit to China, which was winding down Thursday,
Clinton pledged to work with Beijing to try to limit regional
tension following the series of tit-for-tat nuclear tests India and
Pakistan conducted in May.
	   India, the first to test, said it needed a nuclear defense
because its neighbor China had nuclear weapons and was believed to
be helping Pakistan acquire them.
	   Fernandes had earlier described China as India's main security
threat. His comments angered the Chinese leadership and soured
bilateral ties between the world's two most populous nations.
	   India and China fought a war in 1962 over a territorial dispute
that remains unresolved.

Real Madrid sells off clumps of Bernabeu pitch to fans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Cashing in on its record-seventh European
Champions Cup, famed Spanish soccer club Real Madrid has begun
selling off clumps of the playing field at its hallowed Santiago
Bernabeu stadium as part of a cost-cutting plan to recover the
ground.
	   As dozens of potential buyers queued up at the stadium Thursday,
news reports said the club earned 600,000 pesetas (dlrs 4,000)on
the first day of sale Wednesday.
	   The club hopes to sell off some 32,000 sods, each measuring
30x20 cm (12x8 inches), at 1,000 pesetas (dlrs 6) a piece to
members and double that to outsiders. It is also taking orders by
phone.
	   The purchase comes with a certificate that reads: ``The turf you
have obtained comes from the Santiago Bernabeu pitch on which games
were played that led to winning of our seventh European Cup.''
	   Real defeated Italy's Juventus 1-0 in May to take the
continent's most prized title.
	   The money is to go towards the cost of recovering the pitch
which the club decided needed to done this summer.
	   ``It would have been much easier to get in an excavator and get
it all off in one go,'' said ground caretaker Julio Casabella.
''But then, so many people dream of having a bit of the Bernabeu in
their garden.''

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The Armenian parliament agreed Thursday
to grant early release to about 950 prisoners, mostly women and
teen-agers, with good conduct records.
	   The measure is part of a package of judicial reforms announced
by Armenia's new president, Robert Kocharian.
	   Kocharian must approve the parliament's decision before the
prisoners can be released, and that was expected to happen within
one or two days. Kocharian was also expected to announce an amnesty
for some of the 18,000 to 20,000 prisoners in the former Soviet
republic.

Hezbollah attacks Israeli, SLA positions, wounds four

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas launched a series of
attacks against Israeli and allied militia outposts across southern
Lebanon Thursday, briefly overrunning one position. Israel
retaliated with air attacks and artillery.
	   Two Israeli soldiers, two allied South Lebanon Army militiamen
and a guerrilla of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah were wounded in the
offensive, Lebanese security officials said. A 65-year-old Lebanese
civilian died of a heart attack during the fighting, they added.
	   Israel confirmed that two of its troops and two SLA fighters
were wounded and taken to hospitals in Israel. An Israeli military
spokesman in Jerusalem said one of the wounded Israelis sustained
serious injuries.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said 18 Israeli and SLA
positions were attacked with rockets and machine-gun fire.
Thursday's attacks were the largest since a similar onslaught
targeted 25 Israeli and SLA positions on Feb. 4.
	   Israel's air force came to the aid of troops under fire,
Lebanese officials said. A helicopter gunship fired three missiles
at guerrillas near the SLA outpost of Haddatha, which was captured
for 12 minutes by Hezbollah as its defenders huddled in underground
bunkers to avoid the intense shelling that preceded the attack.
	   A jet bombed a nearby valley in the morning, the officials said.
	   Witnesses in the village of Haddatha, which is several hundred
meters (yards) from the fortified SLA position, said they saw one
seriously wounded Hezbollah fighter being evacuated.
	   Hezbollah named the operation at Haddatha after Hadi Nasrallah,
son of the guerrilla group's leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah. The
younger Nasrallah was killed in fighting in September and his body
was among those of 40 guerrillas exchanged last week for the
remains of an Israeli soldier.
	   Haddatha, 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of the Israeli
border, borders the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon.
	   Several mortar shells fired by the guerrillas landed inside
Israel, an Israeli military source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. One shell struck the Israeli Arab village of Arab
el-Aramshe, and six women in the village were treated for shock.
	   Arab el-Aramshe lies on the Israeli border with Lebanon, and it
is possible that the shells were aimed at Israeli or SLA positions
inside Lebanon, but overshot their target.
	   The occupied zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of
Lebanese territory _ was established by Israel in 1985 to protect
its northern border towns against guerrilla attacks. It is
patrolled by 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.

A new trust will preserve London's Old Vic theater
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Canadian owners of London's Old Vic theater _
once home to Laurence Olivier's National Theater company _ have
sold it to a charitable trust formed to ensure its future, one of
the trustees said Thursday.
	   Impresario Ed Mirvish and his son David, who purchased the
theater 16 years ago to preserve it from neglect, announced last
August that they were putting it on the market.
	   Trustee Stephen Daldry, former artistic director of the Royal
Court Theater, said the trust, a non-profit organization, was
formed to preserve the Old Vic ``as a home for serious theater in
London.'' It will renovate, preserve and run the 19th century
building, he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``I think there was a great concern...that the theater could
fall into the wrong hands or, indeed, wasn't going to be saved, if
you like, as a home for serious drama,'' Daldry said.
	   The trust has paid the initial down-payment of 1.5 million
pounds (dlrs 2.4 million) and is now working to raise the
additional funds necessary to complete the purchase and undertake
renovations, he said. The final amount needed was not given.
	   ``What's extraordinary is the amount of support we have had just
in the last few months and particularly internationally from actors
around the world,'' Daldry told the BBC. ``That's where at lot of
the financial support has come from.''
	   Built in 1818, the Old Vic was originally named the Royal Coburg
and was for generations the proving ground of British actors before
it fell on hard times. It was renamed the Old Vic in 1833 in honor
of the 14-year-old Princess Victoria, later Queen Victoria.
	   In the 1960s, the theater was the home of Britain's state-funded
National Theater, which later moved to its own building nearby.
	   Peter Hall, former artistic director of the National, raised the
Old Vic's profile last year when he returned there with a
season-long repertory of 13 shows.

Palestinian legislators to visit U.S. Congress in July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A delegation of Palestinian lawmakers will
visit U.S. Congress this month at the invitation of House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, a Palestinian official said Thursday.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a master at
lobbying Congress, and the Palestinians have long complained that
U.S. lawmakers are not hearing both sides in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
	   ``The trip is a very important step forward,'' Qureia said. ``We
will have the chance to explain the Palestinian position on several
issues directly to Congress.''
	   Qureia said he received an official invitation Thursday to head
a delegation to Congress between July 20-24.
	   Gingrich, a staunch supporter of Israel, first extended an
invitation to the Palestinian legislators during a four-day visit
to Israel and the Palestinian areas in May. Gingrich said he hoped
members of Congress would visit the Palestinian areas.

Muslim scholars from more than 70 countries discuss globalization

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Islamic scholars, religious leaders and
ministers from more than 70 countries urged Muslims Thursday to
welcome scientific progress as long as it agrees with Islamic law.
	   The annual conference, sponsored by Egypt's Ministry of
Religious Endowments, is held annually in Cairo. This year's
meetings will focus on ``Islam and the 21st Century.''
	   ``Any scientific progress is welcomed by Islamic law, as long as
this progress is to serve the rights, moral qualities and what God
permitted for human beings,'' Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, the sheik of
al-Azhar, said in a speech that opened the meeting.
	   Al-Azhar is the leading center of religious study among Sunni
Muslims, and Tantawi is a prominent figure among Muslim scholars.
	   Dozens of people attended the meeting, most of them affiliated
in some way to Muslim governments. Also attending were delegates
from Europe and the United States and some Christian leaders.
	   Delegates were not specific about issues in which progress might
contradict Islamic law, but in the past debates over cloning and
organ transplants have divided Muslim scholars. Another issue is
the Internet, a technology with almost universal support but one
that worries some by providing access to pornography.
	   Fears over globalization and the threat of Western influence to
non-Western countries were also worries for many at the meeting.
	   ``If globalization means melting and losing identity, cultures
and heritage, and superpowers' control of smaller or weaker
countries, Islam rejects this,'' said Ahmed M. ElHattab, assistant
secretary-general of the Islamic Society of North America.
	   ``But is Islam against the understanding of globalization and
against the understanding of brotherhood, coordination and
integration among the people of this planet? I believe that Islam
urges this,'' added ElHattab, who headed the American delegation.
	   Pope Shenouda III, the head of the Coptic Christian church, said
devout people should welcome development _ within limits.
	   ``The world is developing and we should develop with it,'' he
said. ``We do not develop values and principles, these are
constants. We develop in technology, telecommunication.''

NATO chief says world won't tolerate another Bosnia in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Solana and Rugova comments, Yugoslav officials
shutting down Pristina radio station, other; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The world will not allow the
conflict in Kosovo to turn into a drawn out bloody civil war
between ethnic groups, NATO's top official declared Thursday.
	   But the focus on resolving the conflict between ethnic Albanians
and Serbs in the Serbian province is not on Western military action
but on diplomatic efforts to obtain a cease-fire, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said in Sarajevo during a tour of
the Balkans.
	   NATO forces, which staged a display of air power in the region
last month, are continuing their preparations for possible further
action, Solana said before leaving for Tirana, Albania.
	   ``The situation we had in Bosnia should not be repeated,'' he
said. ``The international community will not allow that to
happen.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have been pressing for military
intervention to halt the months-long campaign by Serb security
forces to crush militant resistance in the secessionist province of
Serbia, populated predominantly by Albanians.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanians' political leader, said
after meeting a visiting delegation of U.S. congressional staffers
Thursday that the latest Serb actions are ``aimed at ethnically
cleansing Kosovo.''
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is grave because of constant attacks
by army and police forces and a continuation of ethnic cleansing of
Kosovo,'' he said. ``An international intervention is needed to
protect the people of Kosovo and create conditions for the start of
dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.''
	   Rugova also met with Norway's Kai Aide, an ambassador of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as part of
continuing efforts to persuade the West to act swiftly on Kosovo.
	   Officials in Serb-led Yugoslavia maintain the action is aimed at
wiping out ``terrorists'' and restoring order to the restive
province. They also accuse the Kosovo Liberation Army of attacks on
Serb civilians.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the KLA.
But they did agree to meet again Sunday to try to meld the
guerrilla struggle with their nonviolent independence campaign.
	   In an indication of how compelling the need to enlist the
guerrillas has become, Rugova also participated in the meeting.
Previously he has refused to cooperate with the armed insurgents,
preaching nonviolence as the only way to achieve independence.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule.
	   In the latest fighting, the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug
reported a clash Thursday in the flashpoint of Kijevo _ a Serb
village west of Pristina that KLA guerrillas surrounded last month.
Further details were not immediately available.
	   Tanjug also said the militants staged attacks overnight on
villages in the region of Klina, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   U.S. diplomats are making what State Department spokesman James
Rubin calls a ``full-court press'' to try to prevent the outbreak
of a more general war.
	   Backing off its demand for an immediate pullback of Serb forces
in Kosovo, the U.S. government said Wednesday there probably will
have to be a cease-fire before Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic withdraws the special units that have cracked down on
Albanian militants and civilians.
	   The shift, signaled by Rubin, was Washington's second major move
in the past week to try to revitalize its diplomatic approach to
the Kosovo conflict. The other step was opening talks with the KLA.
	   The director of a Pristina radio station said Thursday the
unlicensed station had been shut down by Yugoslavia's
Communications Ministry two days after it started broadcasting
reports by the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corp.

Ethnic militants kill 11 people in southern Karachi

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Rival factions of a militant ethnic
group terrorizing Pakistan's chief port city killed 11 people
Thursday, including two policemen and two paramilitary soldiers,
police said.
	   Police officials said all the deaths in Karachi were linked to
the ongoing dispute between rival factions of the militant Mohajir
Qami Movement, which claims to represent Indian Muslims who settled
in Pakistan after independence in 1947. Clashes between the
factions, which are mostly fighting over territory, have killed as
many as 200 people in the last month.
	   Two paramilitary Rangers were killed when gunmen opened fire on
their vehicle, while they were patrolling the city's eastern
Liaqatabad neighborhood, where rival factions of the MQM movement
nightly fire at each other from rooftops.
	   One Ranger died immediately and a second one died of gunshot
wounds later in the hospital, police said.
	   After the shootings, officers swiftly moved to cordon off the
area. In a house-to-house search about 100 teen-age boys and young
men were taken for questioning, residents said. They were later
released.
	   The bodies of two policemen were also found in an eastern
Karachi park. Police said the officers had been kidnapped while on
patrol and then shot to death.
	   Also in eastern Karachi, a local politician, Jamil Ahmed, who
belongs to the largest MQM faction, was gunned down outside his
office.
	   Five more victims, including an 18-year-old girl, were caught in
the crossfire. The 11th victim, whose body was riddled with
bullets, was found in an open sewer.
	   Sindh provincial Chief Minister Liaqat Jatoi has deployed 3,000
additional police in Karachi in recent days to help end the
fighting. The Rangers, who have been aiding police officers to stem
the violence, are under the command of the Pakistan military.
	   Mohajirs have protested government threats to give the Rangers
new powers of arrest and detention, and some officials in Karachi
fear Thursday's attack may have been in response to this threat.
	   ``We think it was someone who wanted to give the government
justification to give the Rangers more power,'' said Khawar Khalis
Yunus, a member of the largest MQM faction, led by Altaf Hussein.
	   The mohajir movement was established more than 15 years ago to
press the government for greater access to education and jobs.
Successive governments have refused to grant the movement's demand
for recognition of the mohajirs as a separate ethnic group in
Pakistan.
	   Most mohajirs or refugees settled in the cities of southern
Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital. Entire
neighborhoods of Karachi, which has 14 million residents, have
become ethnic and sectarian battlegrounds.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO is ready to act in
Kosovo if the current push for a cease-fire and negotiations fails,
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday.
	   ``We will not tolerate another war like the war that you have
suffered here,'' he said in Sarajevo during a brief Balkans visit.
After opening a seminar about democracy, Solana departed for Tirana
for talks with Albanian leaders.
	   The alliance chief indicated that the focus for now is on
current efforts to broker a cease-fire involving both Serb forces
and the ethnic Albanians' secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``NATO continues its preparations in order to be prepared in
case the help of NATO to back up the international efforts is
necessary,'' he said.
	   Solana said the world appears to have learned from the mistakes
it made in reacting slowly to the war in Bosnia.
	   ``The way the international community is reacting to the crisis
in Kosovo has been very different,'' he said. ``The international
community reacted immediately in one voice'' when the Kosovo crisis
arose. Also, NATO is involved in the crisis from the very
beginning, he noted.
	   Russia, however, continues to block any U.N. Security Council
resolution that would result in any military action against its
Serb allies.
	   Western officials have said NATO has the right to go ahead with
military action despite that opposition if there is an
international consensus.

	   GUILIN, China (AP) _ Standing before the spectacular limestone
peaks of a restored green paradise, U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged China on Thursday to learn from U.S. mistakes and not harm
the environment for the sake of economic growth.
	   He pledged U.S. support to the cleansing of rivers, air and land
in China, which has five of the most polluted cities in the world.
	   ``Let us, Chinese and Americans, preserve what we have inherited
from the past and, in doing so, preserve the future we are working
so hard to build for our children,'' Clinton said.
	   After a boat ride on the picturesque Li River, Clinton flew to
Hong Kong on Air Force One, the first passenger plane to land at
the new Chek Lap Kok International Airport. Clinton was welcomed by
Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's Chinese-appointed chief executive.
The airport was dedicated earlier in the day by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, who was in Hong Kong for the first anniversary of the
former British colony's return to Chinese rule.
	   Clinton also scheduled a meeting with the city's de-facto
opposition leader, Martin Lee. That session will be closed to
media, including photographers _ a restriction critics consider a
bow to Beijing. But the White House insisted it was ``normal
practice'' to prohibit full coverage of meetings with opposition
leaders.
	   As Clinton left China proper, police freed the last of seven
dissidents rounded up in connection with his visit. A human rights
group said police in eastern Hangzhou city released Zhu Yufu after
holding him for 48 hours.
	   In Guilin, where the government and citizens have replanted
trees, cleaned up the winding rivers and begun to wean themselves
from coal-burning fuels, the president marveled at the scenic
surroundings.
	   ``No place in China is more evocative of the beauty of your
country than Guilin,'' he told a group of more than 400 citizens
and environmental leaders gathered in the now pristine Seven Star
Park.
	   A hump-shaped gray and white limestone pinnacle, called Rosy
Clouds Over Camel, served as backdrop to his speech. In the
sweltering heat, Clinton cooled himself with a colorful Chinese
fan, referring to it as ``an energy efficient air conditioner.''
	   Clinton, praising Guilin's environmental leaders during a
roundtable discussion, said it's not too late for all of China to
reverse environmental trends that have put the country on track to
overtake the United States as the No. 1 emitter of greenhouse gases
within 20 years.
	   ``I believe that China has a unique opportunity _ because you're
developing rapidly, but later in time than other countries _ to
avoid some of the terrible mistakes we made,'' he said.
	   America, in the past generation, has worked hard to reverse
decades of environmental damage from the industrial revolution by
setting clean-air rules to clear up smog-shrouded cities and
clearing rivers so choked with pollution that one _ the Cuyahoga in
Ohio _ caught fire, Clinton said.
	   For two decades now, China has been undergoing its own
transformation from an agricultural society into an industrialized
economic power. As a result, Beijing and other large cities are so
smog-obscured they can no longer be seen from space by satellites,
the president said.
	   ``China's extraordinary growth has put the same kind of
pressures on your environment, and the costs of growth are rising
right along with your prosperity,'' Clinton said. ``You know better
than I that polluted air and water are threatening your remarkable
progress.''
	   The president praised steps taken by China to monitor air
quality, ban leaded gasoline in some big cities, reduce coal use
and otherwise restore and clean up the environment.
	   The United States and China launched a joint initiative on clean
energy last year. Clinton said the U.S. government would assist
Chinese air quality monitoring and make financing available for
clean-energy projects through the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A commission representing hundreds of U.S.
finance officials has cleared the way for sanctions against Swiss
banks suspected of holding the assets of Holocaust victims.
	   Alan Hevesi, chairman of the commission, said negotiations
between the banks and Holocaust survivors seeking their families'
assets ``reached a total stone-like impasse.'' The group decided
Wednesday to lift its moratorium on sanctions against Swiss banks.
	   California will become the first state to impose sanctions.
Treasurer Matt Fong, who oversees dlrs 32 billion in state funds,
said California will not seek new contracts with U.S. subsidiaries
of Swiss banks.
	   Hevesi, the comptroller of New York City, and New York State
Comptroller H. Carl McCall said they would outline Thursday morning
a series of sanctions that would begin taking effect in 45 to 60
days unless a settlement was reached, according to a report in The
New York Times.
	   Hevesi, Fong, McCall and officials from Pennsylvania and
Delaware said Wednesday that they would recommend to 800 other
state and local officials that comprise the commission to begin
applying sanctions to prod the Swiss government into joining new
negoatiations.
	   In New Jersey, the legislature is considering a bill that would
require the state to divest some dlrs 66 million in stock invested
with Union Bank of Switzerland until assets are returned to
Holocaust survivors.
	   Vermont, Rhode Island and Kentucky also are considering the
possibility of sanctions. Last year, Massachusetts ended its dlrs
120,000-a-year contract with Union Bank of Switzerland.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Small groups of demonstrators marched through
Hong Kong and burned a U.S. flag before President Bill Clinton's
arrival Thursday, protesting what they called a two-faced policy
toward labor conditions in mainland China.
	   About a dozen members of a group calling itself the April 5
Action Group burned a small American flag near the U.S. Consulate.
It called for U.S. companies to improve working conditions in their
factories in China.
	   ``We criticize Bill Clinton for talking about human rights and
doing nothing about it,'' said Leung Kwok-hung, leader of the
group.
	   Marching from Hong Kong's central business district, the group
carried flags saying: ``Stop U.S. businesses in China from creating
a workshop of sweat and blood.''
	   Earlier, another group of about 20 labor activists staged a
protest outside the consulate to deliver an open letter criticizing
working conditions of U.S. multinational companies in China.
	   ``Workers' rights are people's rights,'' they chanted.
	   The group carried a banner ``U.S. transnational corporations,
stop abusing Chinese workers.''
	   Han Dongfang, leader of the group, handed the letter to an
official from the U.S. Consulate and said that during his trip to
China, Clinton ``did not see the real working conditions'' or
workers in factories manufacturing U.S. goods.
	   ``Clinton mentioned a lot about human rights violations in
China, but I feel disappointed that he did not mention anything
about labor rights,'' said Han.
	   A report released in the United States in March said conditions
for thousands of workers in mainland factories, often owned by
middlemen who sell to major labels, were getting dramatically
worse.
	   Hong Kong activists who monitor the factories say they are not
convinced the United States can or will do anything about it.
	   Other activists urged Clinton to focus on Hong Kong during his
brief visit to the territory.
	   Many people have feared that China would backpedal on civil
liberties after regaining sovereignty last year.
	   Although fears have largely subsided, human rights groups argue
that mainland China's restrictive security laws may eventually be
applied in Hong Kong.
	   Human Rights Watch-Asia cited the expected introduction of
national security laws banning treason and sedition.
	   A law giving Beijing state organizations blanket legal
exemptions also raised fears of possible legal abuse, it said in a
statement.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A colorful Roman Catholic priest who
also owns a major private art collection has disappeared and the
art is missing from his home, authorities said Thursday.
	   Father Ricardas Mikutavicius was reported missing from his
apartment in Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city, on Wednesday
afternoon by his maid, officials said.
	   The art collection is valued at about dlrs 4 million. The
paintings had been carefully cut from their frames.
	   Kaunas police chief Srtanislovas Liutkevicius said the
disappearance was being investigated as a possible kidnapping as
well as other possibilities, which he declined to detail.
	   Mikutavicius is a controversial figure, criticized by the church
hierarchy for such acts as last winter's baptizing of three tiger
cubs at the Kaunas zoo.

Health of French hostages in Somalia deteriorates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ One of two Frenchmen kidnapped early
last month by gunmen in northeastern Somalia is seriously ill and
the other one is on a hunger strike, a witness said by radio
Thursday.
	   The witness is one of the elders who have been seeking the
release of the Frenchmen kidnapped June 5 off Alula, about 200
kilometers (124 miles) east of northeastern Somalia town of
Bossaso.
	   The elder, who said he saw the Frenchmen early this week, said
they looked pale and frightened. He asked that his name not be
published.
	   The Frenchmen were sailing in the Gulf of Aden and the gunmen
chased them with a speed boat.
	   The kidnappers are demanding dlrs 75,000 for the release of the
men and have moved them to a mountainous hideout difficult to reach
by road, the elder said.
	   He said negotiations with the kidnappers have been complicated
by local businessmen who have offered dlrs 80,000 for the
Frenchmen's boat.
	   Earlier, the elders had contemplated an armed rescue not only to
release the hostages, but as a deterrent to would-be kidnappers.
	   The idea was ruled out because the elders feared the hostages
might be killed, the elder said.
	   The region where the Frenchmen were kidnapped is relatively
peaceful, but piracy by freelance gunmen is rampant. Local strong
men have also had fishing boats seized on charges of illegal
fishing.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster of
the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and the country's
disintegration into fiefdoms protected by clan militia.
	   Since Siad Barre's ouster, only elders and Muslim clergymen who
have been successful in peacefully settling disputes.

Annan: All Nigerian political prisoners will be freed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with nine grafs to UPDATE with background on Abiola's
lost fortune, personal troubles, Nigerian officials meeting. Picks

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
announced Thursday that ``the stage is set'' for the release of all
of Nigeria's political prisoners, including Moshood Abiola, the
nation's leading opposition figure.
	   ``I'm leaving Nigeria with the stage set for the release of all
political detainees,'' Annan said. ``All political detainees will
be released and the government will make an announcement at the
appropriate time.''
	   Annan confirmed that he met with Abiola on Tuesday and said he
was in good health and alert.
	   Abiola, 60, was elected president of Nigeria in 1993 in an
election annulled by Nigeria's military regime. The junta, led by
Gen. Sani Abacha, jailed Abiola a year later when he declared
himself president.
	   Annan said Abiola had decided to relinquish his claim to the
presidency and cooperate with Nigeria's junta in preparing for a
peaceful transition to democracy.
	   ``I found him more realistic than some of us outside, Chief
Abiola realizes that a lot has changed,'' Annan said. Annan said
Abiola's first priority upon leaving prison is to rebuild his life
and then determine what political support he still has after more
than four years in prison.
	   Abiola's fortune, and his personal life, have suffered deeply
during his imprisonment. Two of his many wives have died since he
was imprisoned _ one in an assassination-style slaying _ and his
business empire has largely collapsed.
	   Just a few years ago Abiola's fortune was estimated in the
hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses stretching from
newspapers to shipping. Now, it is believed to to be just a tiny
fraction of what it was.
	   Nigeria's Council of State, meanwhile, which effectively
functions as the country's cabinet, was meeting Thursday afternoon
to discuss the releases. Later Thursday or early Friday the
Provision Ruling Council _ the core of Nigeria's junta leaders _
will also meet, apparently to rubber stamp the releases.

10 Catholic churches attacked as hatred rises over Orange march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 3-4 with Blair heading to Belfast, trims lower
speculation; tightens graf 7
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Arsonists attacked 10 Catholic
churches overnight, wrecking three, in a coordinated campaign
linked with rising sectarian passions over Northern Ireland's most
divisive march.
	   Police and politicians blamed the attacks on thugs determined to
punish British authorities for instructing the Orange Order,
Northern Ireland's major pro-British Protestant fraternal group,
not to march through the main Catholic section of Portadown this
weekend.
	   Fearful that the rising tensions could undermine April's peace
agreement, British Prime Minister Tony Blair flew from London to
Belfast to meet top political and religious leaders and to inspect
at least one of the targeted churches.
	   Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said the prime minister
would emphasize the message that Northern Ireland's future lay in
``dialogue and democracy, not violence and confrontation.''
	   Nine churches targeted after midnight Thursday were in isolated
and predominantly Protestant rural areas between Belfast and
Portadown 30 miles (50 kms) to the southwest. Another church in
overwhelmingly Protestant east Belfast suffered minor damage late
Wednesday.
	   Also Thursday, two Catholic homes had gasoline bombs thrown at
them on the predominantly Protestant east side of Londonderry,
Northern Ireland's second-largest city. Another Catholic-occupied
home on north Belfast's staunchly Protestant Shore Road had flower
pots thrown through its windows. None of the occupants was injured.
	   No group claimed responsibility for any of the attacks, but
police blamed an outlawed pro-British gang, the Loyalist Volunteer
Force. The LVF, based in Portadown, called a cease-fire in May
after coming under intense police pressure but opposes the entire
peace process.
	   ``It is appalling that people have returned to this type of
activity at a time when new political horizons are emerging,'' said
Adam Ingram, Britain's minister responsible for security and
victims in Northern Ireland.
	   The Protestant and Catholic politicians elected Wednesday to
head Northern Ireland's new compromise government, David Trimble
and Seamus Mallon, jointly condemned the violence.
	   ``At a time of hope for the future of Northern Ireland, society
can ill afford these acts of sectarian madness,'' said Trimble,
leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, which has formal links with
the Orange Order and supports its right to march where it wants.
	   ``The individuals behind these attacks have no respect for
themselves nor their God,'' said Seamus Mallon, the moderate
Catholic deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party.
The SDLP wants Orangemen to negotiate with Catholic militants, who
for the past three years have tried to block the Portadown march.
	   Even the Rev. Ian Paisley _ bitter opponent of the accord and
leader of his own virulently anti-Catholic church _ called the
arsonists ``criminal and disgraceful. They cannot make any claim to
be true Protestants, for Protestantism's genius is civil and
religious liberty for all,'' he said.
	   Orange leaders have called for their approximately 80,000
members not to commit acts of violence in response to the
government's determination to prevent about 2,000 Portadown
Orangemen from marching this Sunday from a rural Anglican church
past Catholic homes on Portadown's Garvaghy Road.
	   But Orangemen are plotting a campaign of civil disobedience _
launching surprise parades and blocking roadways across Northern
Ireland _ in hopes of stretching police reserves and forcing
authorities to reverse the decision. Such tactics inevitably lead
to violent confrontations with the 13,000-strong police force and
19,000 British troops based in Northern Ireland.
	   In 1996, police caved in to the Orangemen after four nights of
Protestant mayhem, clearing Catholic protesters off Garvaghy Road
and triggering three nights of Catholic riots.
	   Last year, police opted to club Catholic protesters off the
roadway, getting the Orange parade through easily but triggering
four nights of widespread Catholic rioting, during which several
Protestant churches were burned.

Pakistan dismisses allegations that it planned first-use

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission issuing
statement saying disgruntled scientist never worked there. ALSO
says it has reports alleged defector worked for private firm in
Karachi until last year, No pick up &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan on Thursday dismissed
allegations that it was planning to be the first to use nuclear
weapons against its uneasy neighbor India and said the disgruntled
scientist who made the accusations never worked for the government.
	   In a previous interview with The Associated Press, Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub called the allegations ``nonsense''. He said
Pakistan had made ``elaborate plans'' to retaliate if neighboring
India attacked its nuclear facilities. But there was no strategy of
first-use, he said.
	   He reiterated those remarks in reports published Thursday
following accusations by Iftikar Chaudhray Khan, who said he was a
nuclear scientist for Pakistan and now wants asylum in the United
States.
	   The Atomic Energy Commission, where Khan said he worked, issued
a statement on Thursday calling his story ``baseless, malicious,
fabricated and concocted.''
	   The commission also said it is believed that Khan, in fact,
worked for a private Karachi-based firm called Forte Pakistan (Pvt)
Limited until last year when he apparently quit.
	   ``No such scientist of any such name has ever worked in any of
the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's sensitive nuclear
installations,'' said the statement.
	   It also said that the atomic energy commission does not employ a
person named Dr. Altaf Hussain, the man Khan says was his boss.
	   Khan, however, said he fled Pakistan to protest plans apparently
made by Pakistan last April to launch a first strike against India
-- a country that Pakistan has three times gone to war with in the
past 51 years.
	   After both India and Pakistan conducted underground nuclear
tests in May, the prospect of a fourth war on the volatile South
Asian subcontinent raised fears that it could escalate into a
nuclear conflagration.
	   Ayub earlier said it is likely that another war would involve
the use of nuclear weapons, although he indicated Pakistan believed
India would be the first to fire one.
	   Meanwhile in New York, Khan told The Associated Press that he
was in on a high-level meeting of scientists last April, one month
before the tests, where Pakistan decided on a first-strike
strategy.
	   Government officials in Pakistan say meetings to decide combat
strategy would not be open to scientists.
	   Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, who led Pakistan's nuclear test team,
told the independent daily newspaper, The News, that the only
record of a Iftikar Chaudhary Khan working at the Pakistan Atomic
Energy Commission was 19 years ago and that man resigned.
	   He also said there was no position of assistant research officer
in the atomic energy commission, a post Khan reportedly claimed to
have held.

EU lifts ban on fish imports from four African countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission lifted a ban Thursday on imports of fresh fish from
Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique after receiving guarantees
the fish isn't infected with cholera.
	   But it urged these countries to monitor the health of workers
handling fish for human consumption. The EU executive body imposed
the ban last December following an outbreak of cholera in the four
countries.
	   In a separate decision Wednesday the Commission banned imports
of fish and other sea-food from around 50 countries and
territories, saying they provide inadequate information on hygiene
standards.
	   Kenya and Mozambique were among a group of countries exempted
from the ban but told to provide more information about hygiene
standards by Jan. 31, 1999.

Security personnel fire rubber bullets to stop Irianese protesters

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security personnel fired rubber
bullets Thursday to stop a rampage by thousands of pro-independence
protesters in the former Dutch colony of western New Guinea, police
said.
	   The bullets injured ``a number'' of protesters, and about 20
security personnel were hurt by rocks, said Lt. Col. Sugiono, the
police chief in Sorong, 2,620 kilometers (1,640 miles) northeast of
Jakarta.
	   The official Antara news agency said a university student was
severely injured.
	   The protest was one of two Thursday demanding independence for
the province of Irian Jaya, a Dutch colony taken over by Indonesia
in 1963.
	   In the provincial capital, Jayapura, authorities arrested 41
people following a stone-throwing protest. Warning shots also were
fired, but there were no reports of injuries.
	   In Sorong, the protesters numbered ``at least 2,000, including
students, civil servants as well as common people, even women and
children,'' Sugiono told The Associated Press.
	   Antara put the number of protesters at about 3,000. It said they
burned three cars and damaged a number of government buildings and
an office of the local Catholic diocese.
	   ``They became brutal when we told them that we have no
competence to make decisions on their demands'' for independence,
Sugiono said. ``The rubber bullets were fired as they threw rocks
at police and burned the local council building.''
	   Antara said the protest turned violent after demonstrators were
not allowed to hoist a ``West Papua'' flag in front of the council.
	   A small rebel group called the Free West Papua Movement has been
fighting a guerrilla war in Irian Jaya since 1963. Last week, it
was reported to have killed three settlers in an ambush outside
Jayapura.
	   The protest crippled public transportation, and almost all shops
and office in the town were closed.
	   In Jayapura, about 1,080 kilometers 675 miles) east of Sorong,
about 100 pro-independence activists were protesting for the second
day Thursday, said Lt. Col. Hary Risdianto, spokesman of the local
military.
	   Many shops were closed there too, and police and soldiers had
been mobilized since the morning to safeguard the city, Antara
said.
	   It said the warning shots were fired as the protesters clashed
with security personnel in front of the Yasmin Hotel.
	   At least four cars were damaged and one of the drivers was
severely injured in the protests, Antara said.
	   ``It seems that they are inspired by the East Timorese
struggle,'' Risdianto said. ``They demanded independence, and they
plan to occupy the local council building.''
	   Speaking to The Associated Press by telephone, Risdianto could
not confirm the warning shots, but said the situation was under
control.
	   Most of Irian Jaya's 1.5 million people are Melanesian and many
still follow traditional village lifestyles. Many are Christian in
predominantly Muslim Indonesia.
	   Tens of thousands of settlers, known as transmigrants, from
crowded parts of Indonesia have moved to the largely underdeveloped
province, triggering discontent.
	   Irian Jaya is one of three Indonesian provinces where native
people are struggling for independent states.
	   The other two are the former Portuguese colony of East Timor and
Aceh, a predominantly Muslim province on the northern tip of
Sumatra.

Military says Sri Lanka's civil war reaching decisive stage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Recent fighting in Sri Lanka's civil
war has killed at least 62 people _ 53 rebels and nine air force
personnel, a military spokesman said Thursday.
	   The ethnic war that began in 1983 has left more than 54,000
people dead on both sides and has drained the country's resources.
	   Spokesman Colonel Ranjith Witana said naval gunboats attacked a
convoy of guerrilla boats off the northeastern coast early
Wednesday, killing at least 48 rebels, said Col. Witana. Two
government sailors were wounded.
	   Witana said the nine airmen were killed by a guerrilla mine that
blew up their jeep Wednesday near the strategic town of Mankulam,
245 kilometers (150 miles) north of Colombo, the Sri Lankan
capital.
	   Five rebels were killed in several other clashes Wednesday.
	   At another briefing Thursday, the military said it was on the
verge of capturing a key highway that for the past year has been
the main focus of the war against Tamil rebels, the military said
Thursday.
	   Military spokesman Major General Sarath Munasinghe estimated the
rebels' fighting strength at under 7,000, all but a few hundred of
them defending the last major town on the highway to the Jaffna
Peninsula. For the last six weeks, they have held off Sri Lanka's
army, which has a total of 120,000 men, at Mankulam.
	   Capturing the north-south highway would open an overland supply
route to Jaffna city, whose residents are now supplied by air and
sea. About 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the 76-kilometer (47-miles)
highway remain to be captured.
	   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, seeking an independent
homeland for minority Tamils, administered the peninsula, where 1
million people live, for more than five years until the army
captured Jaffna city in December 1995.
	   After being driven out of Jaffna, the Tamil Tigers spread into
the northern jungle. ``Now, they have control over 100,000
people,'' Munasinghe said.
	   Munasinghe was unable to say when the highway operation will be
completed, but said, ``it is going to be soon.''
	   Government troops have been able to cut many of the Tigers'
smaller supply routes, Munasinghe said. The government's push is
being countered by the Tigers with mortar and artillery, much of it
captured from the army in earlier battles.
	   The guerrillas seized a shipment of 34,000 mortar shells that
were being sent by ship from Zimbabwe to the Sri Lankan military
some time last year.

World Cup: Vogts strikes gold with Bierhoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ When Berti Vogts went to a provincial
Italian town a couple of years ago to scout a second-division
striker, he was all but ridiculed. Now, the nation is grateful for
the stroke of genius from the German coach that brought Oliver
Bierhoff back from oblivion.
	   Vogts knew better, but German newspapers had a field day poking
fun at the coach.
	   ``Oliver played for me in Germany's Under-18 and Under-21 teams
and he was always scoring the most goals,'' Vogts said.
	   ``But I remember, when I went to watch him in Italy, I was
severely criticized.''
	   His critics could have been forgiven _ at the time.
	   Bierhoff was then playing for the small second-division team of
Ascoli. He had a difficult beginning, but by then had developed
into a prolific scorer.
	   Still, a second-division striker for Germany?
	   Bierhoff proved all doubters wrong.
	   He got his chance for Germany, and in the process moved to
Udinese in the Serie A, the top Italian division.
	   Before his Italian adventure, Bierhoff had gone through three
Bundesliga clubs in five years that were anything but spectacular.
When he left, hardly anyone noticed.
	   Since then, Bierhoff has gained fame by scoring Germany's most
important goals. He has 20 goals in 30 games.
	   He clinched the 1996 European Championship title for Germany by
scoring the sudden-death ``Golden Goal'' in extra time in the final
against the Czech Republic.
	   In August 1997, he came in as a substitute and hit three goals
within seven minutes to rally Germany to a 3-1 victory over
Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifying game.
	   At the World Cup here, Bierhoff scored the second goal that
salvaged a late 2-2 draw against Yugoslavia in group play.
	   And in the round of 16, he headed in the winner five minutes
before the final whistle as Germany rallied against to beat Mexico
2-1.
	   So far, he has three goals, all off headers.
	   ``I don't care how I score as long as we keep winning,''
Bierhoff said Thursday, as Germany prepared for Saturday's
quarterfinal against Croatia in Lyon.
	   ``They have very strong players who play for great clubs. They
are aggressive, but I hope that we can raise our game and beat
them,'' Bierhoff said of Croatia.
	   Against Croatia, Bierhoff will meet his future AC Milan teammate
Zvonimir Boban. Bierhoff, 30, has been signed by Milan to lift the
famed club after a dismal season.
	   Bierhoff admits that as a relatively obscure newcomer he had
some problems gaining acceptance from his German teammates in his
early days with the national team.
	   ``I tried to talk through my performances on the field, not
through talking to the media,'' he said. ``Now, I feel that the
team believes in me and that gives even more confidence.''
	   Vogts said Italy had been the turning point in Bierhoff's
career.
	   ``The life in Italy really helped him form as a person. He's
become one of the strongest players in the world,'' the coach said.

Belfast man charged with killing Irish policeman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A Belfast man appeared at Dublin's
special anti-terrorist court Thursday charged with murdering an
Irish policeman and stealing 62,100 pounds (dlrs 100,000) from the
Bank of Ireland 16 years ago.
	   Sean ``Bap'' Hughes was also charged with possessing two rifles,
a pistol, a submachine gun and ammunition with intent to endanger
life.
	   After a brief hearing, Hughes, 40, was remanded in custody until
Oct. 6. He did not speak in court.
	   Hughes is currently serving an eight-year sentence for an armed
robbery committed in May last year in Foxford, County Mayo. He was
convicted in December.
	   In the current case, he is charged with murdering policeman
Patrick Reynolds in Dublin in Feb. 20, 1982 , the same day the
prosecution alleges he was found to be in possession of the
weapons. The murder charge carries a mandatory sentence of 40
years' imprisonment without remission.
	   Hughes is charged with robbing a Bank of Ireland branch in
Askeaton, County Limerick, on Feb. 18, 1982.

Tauziat beats Zvereva for place in final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with first semifinal &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Nathalie Tauziat overcame a horrible
start to beat Natasha Zvereva in three sets Thursday, becoming the
first French player to reach the Wimbledon women's final in 73
years.
	   Tauziat barely kept the ball in the court as she dropped seven
of the first eight games, but she recovered in time to rally for a
1-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 victory.
	   Tauziat will face the winner of what many considered the true
final _ pitting defending champion Martina Hingis against Jana
Novotna in a replay of last year's championship match.
	   When Zvereva sailed a return long on match point, Tauziat let
out a shriek, threw her racket in the air, flopped onto her back
and covered her face with her hands. She then slapped the grass
with her hand.
	   It was by far the most dramatic moment of a match that was
largely devoid of compelling tennis.
	   In reaching her first Grand Slam final, the 30-year-old Tauziat
became the first French woman to make the Wimbledon final since
Suzanne Lenglen won her sixth Wimbledon title in 1925.
	   Francoise Durr, the last French woman to get to the semis in
1970, watched the match from the players' box and had tears in her
eyes as Tauziat celebrated her victory.
	   Tauziat is the lowest seeded player in the field at No. 16 and
the lowest seed ever to make the Wimbledon final.
	   For the first set and a half, it looked like Zvereva would
become the first unseeded women's finalist since Billie Jean King
in 1963.
	   The Belarussian, a doubles specialist who had upset Steffi Graf
and Monica Seles en route to the semis, only needed to keep the
ball in play as Tauziat sprayed errors all over the court.
	   But Tauziat finally settled down in the second set, playing
free-flowing tennis and punctuating her winners with shouts and
fist-pumps.
	   Zvereva collapsed in the second-set tiebreaker, committing a
series of glaring unforced errors that turned the match around for
good. Tauziat raced to 3-0 lead in the third set and never
relented.
	   On Friday, Centre Court will reverberate with ``Henmania'' as
Britain, still mourning over England's loss to Argentina in the
World Cup, pulls for Tim Henman to go where no homegrown male
player has ventured in 60 years.
	   ``It's safe to say it's my favorite court,'' Henman said. ``When
you've got 15,000 people cheering you on and willing you on, it
gives you a buzz.''
	   Henman will face defending champion Pete Sampras, who knows he
won't have many supporters.
	   ``Playing Tim here in England, it will be tough,'' he said.
	   But Sampras said he has faced similar situations, namely playing
Boris Becker in Germany, and knows how to cope.
	   ``Hopefully, you can put the crowd out of the match,'' he said.
``You've still got to play. It's still one on one. Tim is going to
have some emotional support behind him, but you have to play and I
feel like I'm playing well.''
	   Henman is playing more than just the No. 1 player in the world,
the man who has won Wimbledon four of the last five years and who
hasn't dropped a set so far this tournament.
	   Henman is also playing the burden of history. By beating Petr
Korda in Wednesday's quarters, he became the first British man to
make the semifinals since Roger Taylor in 1973.
	   Now he's aiming to become the first Brit to reach the final
since Henry Austin in 1938 and the first to win the title since
Fred Perry in 1936.
	   ``I wasn't born when Taylor got to the semis,'' the 23-year-old
Henman said. ``I don't want to stop at the semis now.''
	   The other men's semifinal will feature two of the game's biggest
servers _ Richard Krajicek and Goran Ivanisevic.
	   Despite a swollen knee, Krajicek is playing as well as when he
won the title in 1996. The big surprise is Ivanisevic, a former
two-time finalist who had won only one match in his last five Grand
Slam tournaments and had been written off by many people.
	   ``It's my 11th Wimbledon,'' he said. ``I'm having fun. I don't
know how it's going to finish, but maybe this year is the year for
me.''
	   Ivanisevic will be favored Friday because he has beaten Krajicek
eight consecutive times dating back to 1992.
	   Henman has enjoyed relatively restrained media coverage this
tournament because of the focus on the World Cup. But with England
out of the Cup following Tuesday's penalty shootout defeat to
Argentina, the hopes of a nation are now turned on Henman.
	   ``What I'm doing is far more important to me than the World
Cup,'' he said. ``They (England soccer players) are out there
representing their country, but when I'm on the court, I'm playing
solely for myself.''
	   Henman said he's never player better than in his win over Korda
and has no reason to believe he can't beat Sampras.
	   ``The way I'm playing, I definitely feel I've got a good
chance,'' he said.
	   Don't count on it, says Mark Philippoussis, who was swept away
by Sampras in straight sets in the quarterfinals and doesn't seen
anybody who can stop the defending champion.
	   ``I think he's too solid,'' Philippoussis said. ``He's dedicated
out there and he wants to prove a point. When somebody serves like
that, they want to say something. So I think he's ready. I don't
think anybody will beat him.''

Georgian troops to take over patrols of Abkhazian sea border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA DZHINDZHIKHASHVILI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian border guards will soon replace
Russian troops patrolling the sea borders of breakaway Abkhazia,
officials said Thursday.
	   Abkhazia opposes the move, which would strengthen the Georgian
government's control over the region, block arms deliveries to
separatists, and possibly hurt trade.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwestern Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Under an agreement with Georgia, Russian troops have been
patrolling the Abkhazian coast since 1994. During that time, Russia
trained Georgia's border guards so that they could eventually take
over.
	   Late last month Georgia and Russia signed an agreement for
Georgia to start patrolling its Black Sea coast _ including the
Abkhazian stretch _ on July 16, said the chief of the Georgian
border guards, Maj. Gen. Valery Chkheidze.
	   Georgia has been given 12 patrol boats for the job, including
one from the U.S. Coast Guard and others from Germany, Turkey and
Ukraine.
	   ``If Georgian border guards try to take control of the Abkhazian
sector of the Black Sea, it will lead to an intensification of the
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict,'' said the foreign minister of the
Abkhazian government, Sergei Shamba.
	   ``If Russian border guards leave, we should be able to control
the border ourselves.''
	   A significant share of Abkhazia's trade and humanitarian aide
deliveries are conducted by sea. The separatists reportedly also
receive weapons from a large Abkhazian community in Turkey by the
same route.
	   The Georgian government has promised to allow the trade and aide
deliveries to continue after its border guards take over, but is
certain to block arms supplies.
	   ``We are not trying to aggravate the situation,'' Chkheidze
said. ``There are internationally recognized borders of Georgia,
its state border, and that border we will protect.''
	   Violence has broken out sporadically in Abkhazia since the end
of the 1992-93 war, despite the presence of Russian peacekeepers.
Dozens of people were killed during fighting in May between
Abkhazian separatists and militia groups that support Georgia's
central government.

Contaminated nuclear waste container found at German power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WIESBADEN, Germany (AP) _ Special measurements at the Bibles
nuclear power station near Frankfurt have uncovered a contaminated
nuclear waste container, the RWE power company operators said
Thursday.
	   According to RWE, a small piece of radioactive material found
measured 30,000 becquerels. The safety limit set by the
International Atomic Energy Agency is four becquerels.
	   A becquerel is a unit for measuring radioactive decay, equal to
the number of atoms that disintegrate per second.
	   An RWE statement said the contaminated piece had been removed to
a special control point, and no one had been put in any danger.
	   But Hesse state Environment Minister Priska Hinz, to which RWE
reported the contaminated container, said that the find raised
questions about the reliability of waste containers and
contamination measuring procedures.
	   She said the find confirmed Hesse state was correct in stopping
nuclear waste transport and until safe means to do so are found, no
more would take place.
	   The particle had apparently been in a container sent to Biblis
from Cogema, RWE said. Cogema is the French state company that
operates La Hague, the world's largest nuclear waste processing
plant, near the Normandy port of Cherbourg.
	   Also Thursday, the environmental group Greenpeace called for the
immediate closure of an atomic waste storage site in Morsleben, in
eastern Germany.
	   Greenpeace nuclear expert Inge Lindemann said a geological study
showed that groundwater could seep into the site, a former salt
mine 500 meters (1,600 feet) deep.
	   Another environmental group, BUND, has asked an administrative
court in Magdeburg to order the site closed.
	   Last month, Germans were shocked when federal Environment
Minister Angelika Merkel reported that for years companies had been
shipping nuclear waste in containers that leaked radiation. She
ordered a ban on shipments until safer methods are found.
	   In the past, huge anti-nuclear demonstrations attempted to stop
the rail shipments, particularly to temporary storage sites back in
Germany, and frequently erupted into violent clashes with police.
	   The Social Democrats and Greens parties, who hope to form a
center-left coalition to replace Chancellor Helmut Kohl, have been
arguing in recent days over how quickly they would shut down
Germany's nuclear power industry if elected.
	   The Greens have been demanding an end to nuclear power within
eight years, while the Social Democratic chancellor candidate,
Gerhard Schroeder, has said 25 to 30 years would be more realistic.

Montgomerie on track for third Irish Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie started his bid for a
third consecutive Irish Open title with a six-under-par 65 at
Druids Glen on Thursday.
	   Montgomerie held a three-stroke lead after the morning but South
Africa's Ernie Els had just started his round in the early
afternoon.
	   The 35-year-old Scot opened with a bogey but fought back into
the lead with seven birdies, including four in the last five holes.
	   Spain's Sergio Garcia overshadowed the cast of top European
players early, carding 32 for his first nine holes.
	   But the 18-year-old British amateur titlist wilted as
Montgomerie loomed and he finished at 3-under for a share of second
place with Steve Richardson, Stephen Ames and Mark Davis.
	   Current European PGA tour leader Lee Westwood, seeking a third
successive win on tour, finished the first round with a one-under
round of 70.
	   Nick Faldo's search for a first tournament victory in 16 months
started badly and got progressively worse.
	   Faldo, who has sunk to his worst ever world ranking of 48th, had
a double bogey and six bogeys to finish 75.
	   Faldo, the last player to win three successive Irish Opens,
described his round as ``just lousy.''
	   He missed the fairway and then the green with his first two
shots and then missed a seven-foot putt and his round never fully
recovered.
	   Of the later starters, Sam Torrance, winner of the French Open
on Sunday, was two under after five while playing partner Ernie Els
was level. Seve Ballesteros was one over after seven.

Russian government targets biggest tax cheat, parliament resists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with agreement on Gazprom taxes, Duma
turning down tax reform measure. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government launched a new attack on tax
cheats Thursday by starting at the very top _ Gazprom, the
country's largest company, top tax debtor and perhaps its most
sacred cash cow.
	   Lawmakers immediately objected, denouncing the move as an effort
to destroy one of the country's remaining economic treasures, and
forced the government to back off.
	   ``Splitting up Gazprom is tantamount to splitting up Russia,''
sputtered Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, head of
parliament's largest faction.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko threatened to seize Gazprom's
assets and reassert control over its board unless the natural gas
monopoly starts paying the 2.45 billion rubles (about dlrs 400
million) it owes in taxes.
	   Gazprom gave in late in the day, agreeing to make regular
payments to pay down its debt, news agencies reported.
	   The government and its new tax czar are trying to dig Russia out
of its financial crisis, caused largely by the government's chronic
inability to collect taxes.
	   Tax debtors include the country's largest companies, as well as
most of its workers. Last year, only 5 million of Russia's 147
million citizens filed income tax declarations.
	   Lawmakers immediately made clear that they will not necessarily
go along with the Kremlin's plans, rejecting a reform bill that
would have streamlined tax brackets. Lawmakers complained there was
not enough graduation in some of the rates, which treated the poor
the same as the rich.
	   The government's poor tax collections have generated a cash
crisis that forces millions of state workers go without pay for
months on end.
	   Such problems have eroded investors' faith in Russia's financial
markets and stocks have plummeted, collapsing to half their
previous value.
	   The ruble has also suffered. The Central Bank has been
intervening heavily to prevent a devaluation, which would raise
consumer prices and could lead to social unrest.
	   A recent bond offering boosted reserves to dlrs 16 billion, up
from dlrs 14.7 billion the week before, the bank announced
Thursday. But that is still less than the estimated dlrs 21 billion
in ruble-denominated bonds the Central Bank must cover.
	   The government is seeking a new loan of at least dlrs 10 billion
from the International Monetary Fund to shore up the Central Bank's
reserves to prevent a run on the ruble.
	   The IMF is imposing stiff conditions, including better tax
collection and reform of Gazprom and other huge monopolies.
	   Gazprom controls production and distribution of Russia's vast
natural gas supplies, and is one of Western Europe's largest
suppliers. The IMF wants Gazprom to reform gas prices to include
transportation costs and loosen its monopoly by allowing
competitors access to its pipelines.
	   But Gazprom is one of Russia's economic sacred cows, revered as
a symbol of national strength. Parliament's sharp response prompted
President Boris Yeltsin to rush to the monopoly's defense.
	   ``A strong Gazprom means a strong state,'' Yeltsin said,
presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told the Interfax news
agency.
	   The state owns 40 percent of Gazprom, the biggest stake. The
rest of the shares are believed to be held by powerful political
and business figures, including former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin. Foreign investors hold a small stake.
	   But although the government is Gazprom's largest owner, it has
essentially ceded control of the company to its former chairman in
a complex and much-criticized trust agreement. Kiriyenko threatened
Thursday to rescind the deal, but decided later in the day to back
off.
	   Gazprom says it has had trouble paying because its customers _
many of them government-funded enterprises _ have not paid their
bills.

Children with leukemia write letters to Princess Diana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hundreds of children suffering from leukemia wrote
letters Thursday to the late Princess Diana wishing her what would
have been a happy 37th birthday _ a day late.
	   Children from hospitals, special homes and schools around the
country waited patiently in a South London park to draw pictures
and write poems, filling boxes with their tributes.
	   One message, adorned with hearts and stars, read: ``To Diana,
hope you had a nice birthday in heaven. I hope my sister was at
your party, love Molly.''
	   The princess, who died Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash, was
instrumental in setting up The Foundation for Children with
Leukemia in 1988 and later made it a beneficiary of the Princess of
Wales Trust.
	   More than 6,000 children attended the party, which featured 100
entertainers and rides.
	   The organizers hope many of the children's messages will be
displayed at Althorp, Diana's family home, which opened to visitors
Wednesday, her actual birthday.
	   Michelle Hunter, who accompanied some of the children to the
event, said, ``Diana was very special to them. As soon as they saw
her photograph they ran toward it and immediately wanted to join in
with writing a message.''

Historic night race at Daytona postponed by fires
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAYTONA BEACH, Florida (AP) _ The Pepsi 400, the first night
NASCAR race at Daytona International Speedway, was postponed
Thursday because of wildfires burning out of control in Florida.
	   The holiday race, scheduled for Saturday night, was billed as
the largest night sports event ever.
	   ``The wildfires plaguing Daytona Beach and surrounding
communities intensified Wednesday night to a level that makes
postponing this race the right thing to do,'' said John Graham,
speedway president.
	   The race was rescheduled for Oct. 17.
	   The postponement is the first in the 39-year history of the
Pepsi 400, the traditional midway point of the NASCAR Winston Cup
series.
	   While the fires have not directly affected the 480-acre
(195-hectare) speedway, access for fans was questionable.
	   Interstate 95, parts of U.S. 1 and other main roads to the track
have been closed by fires that have ravaged the area, burning
dozens of homes and businesses and forcing the evacuation of about
35,000 people in two counties.
	   ``Our manpower, facilities and resources will remain completely
devoted to our community until this crisis is over,'' Graham said.

Fighters trounce Buffaloes 10-5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nigel Wilson hit a two-run home run and drove in
another run with a grounder as the Pacific League's front-running
Nippon Ham Fighters trounced the Kintetsu Buffaloes 10-5 at Osaka
Dome Thursday.
	   Wilson, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, has 12 homers.
	   The victory increased the Fighters' lead over the second-place
Buffaloes to five games.
	   The Buffaloes' Tuffy Rhodes did not play Thursday because of a
one-game suspension by Pacific League chairman Kazuo Harano for
using ``violent'' language over an umpire's strike call.
	   Rhodes, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, was ejected in the
ninth inning of a game with the Fighters Wednesday.
	   No other games in the Pacific League were scheduled Thursday.
	   In the Central League, the Hiroshima Toyo Carp capitalized on
two errors for two runs in the three-run eighth inning and edged
the front-running Yokohama BayStars 6-5 at Yokohama.
	   The BayStars are still one game ahead of the second-place
Chunichi Dragons, who edged the Hanshin Tigers 2-1 at Koshien
Stadium.
	   Darrel May held the Dragons to two hits before he gave up his
second walk of the game to Takeshi Nakamura as a hard rain started.
The Dragons then drew four straight walks from May for two runs
after Nakamura moved to second on a bunt.
	   May, formerly with the Anaheim Angels, took the loss. He is 1-3.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, rookie Yoshinobu Takahashi hit a grand
slam home run in the five-run second inning, leading the Yomiuri
Giants to a 7-2 victory over the Yakult Swallows.
	   Takahashi has nine homers.

Hezbollah attacks Israeli, SLA positions. 1 killed, 4 wounded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with one Hezbollah killed, ADDS details on storming of
position, CHANGES overline; no pickup

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas attacked a series of
Israeli and allied militia positions in south Lebanon Thursday,
briefly overrunning one. Israel retaliated with air strikes and an
artillery bombardment.
	   One guerrilla was killed, two Israeli soldiers and two
militiamen of the South Lebanon Army were wounded, and a
65-year-old Lebanese civilian died of a heart attack during the
exchange, Lebanese and Israeli security officials said.
	   The attack, in which mortar shells landed in north Israel, was
the largest offensive that the Iranian-backed Hezbollah has
launched since Feb. 4 when it raided 25 Israeli and SLA positions.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said its forces attacked
18 Israeli and SLA positions with rockets, mortars and machine-gun
fire.
	   Israel's air force came to the aid of troops under fire,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   An Israeli helicopter gunship fired three missiles at guerrillas
near the SLA outpost of Haddatha, which Hezbollah captured for 12
minutes while the defenders huddled in underground bunkers after an
intense bombardment, the officials said.
	   Hezbollah said its guerrillas destroyed the position, but
Lebanese officials said they hoisted the Hezbollah flag and
retreated after throwing grenades into the bunkers.
	   The concrete-reinforced position, manned by up to 15 men,
suffered severe damage during the attack, the officials added.
Haddatha lies 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of the Israeli
border on the edge of the Israeli-occupied zone in southern
Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah named the operation at Haddatha after Hadi Nasrallah,
the son of the group's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah. The younger
Nasrallah was killed in fighting in September and his body was
among those of 40 guerrillas exchanged last week for the remains of
an Israeli soldier.
	   Hezbollah said one of its guerrillas, Hadi Msheimish, 22, was
killed.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman said two soldiers
and two SLA militiamen were wounded and taken to hospitals in
Israel. One of the Israelis sustained serious injuries.
	   Several of the guerrillas' mortar shells landed in Israel, an
Israeli military source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
One shell struck the Israeli Arab village of Arab el-Aramshe, and
six women in the village were treated for shock.
	   Arab el-Aramshe lies on the Israeli border with Lebanon, and it
is possible that the shells were aimed at Israeli or SLA positions
inside Lebanon, but overshot their target.
	   The occupied zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of
Lebanese territory _ was established by Israel in 1985 to protect
its northern border towns against guerrilla attacks. It is
patrolled by 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.

Milan trial: `Psychic' says Gucci's ex-wife nagged her to find
</HEADLINE>
killer &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The woman the Italian press has dubbed the
``black witch'' testified Thursday that fashion scion Maurizio
Gucci's ex-wife nagged her ``every day'' to find someone to kill
him.
	   Giuseppina Auriemma told the court here trying Patrizia Reggiani
Martinelli, the ex-wife, that she first asked her in late 1994 to
find a killer.
	   Gucci was shot to death in March 1995 as he entered his Milan
office.
	   As a packed courtroom listened, Auriemma, who is a co-defendant,
denied she was a psychic and described herself as Reggiani
Martinelli's only friend.
	   Auriemma said that the six months before the murder were a
nightmare during which Reggiani Martinelli asked her ``every day''
what was happening with the murder plot.
	   ``Every day that passed was a day lost for her,'' testified
Auriemma.
	   She testified, as have others in the trial, that Reggiani
Martinelli was extremely concerned that her ex-husband would
whittle away the dlrs 120 million he had received from his sale of
his 50 percent stake in the luxury leathergoods and clothing
company.
	   When Prosecutor Carlo Nocerino asked,``How did she ask you?''
Auriemma responded, ``She just asked me, She was serious. She said
she wanted to do it herself but she didn't have the courage. I
said, `Are you out of your mind?'''
	   Auriemma said she finally broke down under the ex-wife's
insistence and asked the only other person she knew in Milan, Ivano
Savioni, a hotel doorman.
	   Ivano Savioni, the alleged procurer of the hitman, was hunched
over a court bench while Orazio Cicala, who confessed to driving
the getaway car, watched while locked in the defendant's cage.
	   Neither Reggiani Martinielli nor the alleged triggerman,
Benedetto Ceraulo, were present in the courtroom.
	   Asked about money, Auriemma said, `She told me she would take
care of me separately as though I were part of the family,'' but
added she would pay a total of 500-600 million lire'' (dlrs
290,000-dlrs 350,000).
	   The defense contends that Auriemma ``exploited'' the friendship
with her and blackmailed her friend.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescuers have found 13 more bodies,
bringing the confirmed death toll to 25 in the sinking of a ferry
last week in central Indonesian waters, the official Antara news
agency reported Thursday.
	   Another 17 people remained missing, Antara said.
	   The ferry KMP Bahana Nusantara was carrying 94 people when it
went down last Thursday in the straits of Alas, between the islands
of Sumbawa and Lombok, a popular tourist destination. The region is
1,125 kilometers (700 miles) east of Jakarta, the capital.
	   Fifty-two people were rescued after the sinking, whose cause was
still under investigation.
	   Antara quoted Anton HL Enoch, chief of the local state-run ferry
company, as saying divers have located the wreckage in about 120
meters (395 feet) of water.

Turkish foreign minister to visit Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Foreign Minister Ismail Cem will pay a
four-day visit to Israel next week, in the latest sign of growing
ties between the two countries.
	   Cem is scheduled to fly to Israel on Monday to discuss bilateral
ties as well as the Middle East peace process, the Foreign Ministry
said Thursday.
	   Iran and Arab nations have criticized Turkey's growing
cooperation with Israel, especially in the military field, saying
it is a threat to peace and security in the region.
	   The two countries conducted a joint naval exercise in January
and Turkey has awarded Israel Aircraft Industries a dlrs 632.5
million contract to upgrade 54 Turkish air force F-4 Phantom jets.

Wife of kidnapped American returns to Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Making her fourth trip to Kashmir since
her husband was kidnapped three years ago, Jane Schelly on Thursday
again appealed for information to put an end to her uncertainty.
	   ``I need to know with certainty what has become of him _ if he
is alive, where, and if he has been killed , where is his body. I
would wish to bury him with peace and dignity,'' Schelly said in a
statement distributed to journalists in Srinagar, the summer
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state.
	   She arrived in Srinagar on Wednesday to make another attempt to
find her husband, coinciding with the kidnapping's third
anniversary on July 4.
	   Schelly and Donald Hutchings, of Spokane, Washington, were
trekking in Himalayan foothills when militants came to their camp,
demanded to see their passports, and separated them.
	   Hutchings, American John Childs of Simsbury, Connecticut; Dirk
Hasert of Erfurt, Germany; Keith Mangan of Middlesborough, England;
Paul Wells of London; and Norwegian Hans Christian Ostro were
kidnapped.
	   Childs escaped his captors within days, but Ostro was executed
and his beheaded body was found a month later.
	   Indian police have captured militants who have reported the
remaining hostages were killed in December 1995 or January 1996.
Searches for bodies turned up nothing.
	   A little known separatist group called Al Faran claimed
responsibility for the abductions and demanded the release of 21
guerrilla leaders in exchange for the hostages. The Indian
government refused, saying meeting the demand would encourage
kidnappings.
	   There has been no contact with Al Faran for nearly two years.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Three armed robbery suspects were
found shot
	   dead and five were captured after a manhunt by 100 farmers and
police in South Africa's North West province.
	   Police said the manhunt was mounted Wednesday after raiders,
believed from the Johannesburg area, surrounded a farmhouse near
the town of Makwassie, 230 kilometers (144 miles) from
Johannesburg.
	   Farmer Willie Kuhn, 69, and his wife Elizabeth, 65, were
allegedly assaulted by eight gunmen who demanded money and fired
assault rifles into the air.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Grimbeek said senior police officers
were on the farm on Thursday morning to investigate the deaths of
the suspects, whose bodies were found in the bush.
	   It was not clear whether they were killed in an exchange of fire
with searchers or by fellow gang members.
	   Farmers and police have set up self-protection units after a
spate of robberies and killings on mostly white-owned farms.
	   ------
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenyan parliament has banned
production, sale and consumption of liquor harmful to health, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Lawmaker John Michuki said the Kenya Medical Association
identified several brands of drink made by small brewers as being
potentially poisonous.
	   Nearly all the brands were introduced after the liberalization
of the beer industry in 1992 and are manufactured by small
companies.
	   Michuki said those who consume the drinks end up with poor
libido, loss of appetite, headaches, stomach aches and eventually
die.
	   ``These are poisonous drinks and not alcohol,'' the independent
Nation newspaper quoted Michuki as saying.
	   Legislators supported the motion, saying hundreds of people in
the central and eastern provinces, where the brands are mostly on
sale, have died after taking the drinks.
	   The drinks, which are packed in plastic containers, are in high
demand in slums and villages because their prices are much lower
than conventional beers.
	   Between 30 and 40 companies manufacture the banned brands. There
was no immediate comment from brewers.
	   ------
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The government said it will grant refugee
status to fugitives from Angola, Burundi and Rwanda fleeing their
own countries and the threat of fresh fighting in Angola.
	   Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa said more than 1,400
people crossed into northwestern Zambia in the past 10 days.
	   Some were nationals of Burundi and Rwanda fleeing a designated
refugee camp in neighboring Angola amid fears of renewed fighting
between Angolan government forces and UNITA rebels.
	   The United Nations on Wednesday imposed new sanctions on UNITA _
the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ after it failed to meet terms of a peace
accord signed with the government in 1994.
	   UNITA fought a civil war for nearly two decades after Angola's
1975 independence from Portugal.
	   Zambian authorities said about 200 Angolans entered southwestern
Zambia last month, saying they also feared new fighting near their
homes.
	   ------
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Most of Lesotho's revenue still comes
from receipts from the southern African customs union with South
Africa and neighboring countries, Finance Minister Leketekete Ketso
said Thursday.
	   Customs revenue totalling 1,033 million rand (dlrs 172 million)
accounted for 46 percent of the mountain kingdom's revenue, he told
the parliament in Maseru.
	   Ketso, presenting his annual budget speech, said salaries for
civil servants were the single most important item of expenditure,
totalling 44 percent of the budget.
	   ``This is unacceptably high by international standards,'' he
said.
	   The government had awarded a 10 percent inflation adjustment to
civil servants and a new pay and grading system had been
implemented.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Police have appealed for an end to
cruelty to donkeys who, said a spokesman, were being mercilessly
driven up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) a day under heavy burdens of
maize, cotton, cotton, millet and sunflowers.
	   The official Zimbabwe Information Service reported Thursday the
death of a donkey that was left tethered without water for 12
hours, in scorching sun, while its owner was selling his produce
and drinking the proceeds in a nearby beer hall.
	   Police at Sanyati, 240 kilometers (150 miles) west of Harare,
warned stock owners they risk a two year jail term under prevention
of cruelty to animals laws ``but they seemed not to take the
message seriously,'' ZIS said.
	   ------
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ A Swazi man died after being bitten by
a pig, police said.
	   A police spokesman said the man apparently died from excessive
bleeding from an artery after being bitten while feeding pigs in
the Matanga district. A veterinarian had been asked to investigate
other possible causes of his death.

German candidate criticized over plan for minimum income tax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's opposition Social Democrats were
defending a proposal for a minimum income tax Thursday after
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other government officials called it
absurd and economically dangerous.
	   Kohl's Social Democratic challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, told
Stern magazine the 20 percent tax would be levied on wealthy
individuals whose bookkeeping and deductions allow them to cut tax
payments to nothing.
	   But Kohl's government, trailing Schroeder in the polls less than
three months before federal elections, was quick to attack the
idea, calling it dangerous for Germany's economic viability.
	   ``As everyone understands, that really means a tax hike,'' Kohl
said of Schroeder's plan in an interview with RTL television. ``But
what we urgently need is a tax cut.''
	   Finance Minister Theo Waigel called it ``an absurd thought,'' a
sentiment echoed by the anti-tax Free Democrats.
	   The economics spokesman for the Social Democrats, Ernst
Schwanhold, told West German Radio that the proposal was not yet
fully developed.
	   He said he believed Schroeder's goal was correct, but added ``we
still have to explain practically for who and how this tax rate can
be applied.''

Truck caravans bring help to border villages hit by Indian shells
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Truck caravans crept along narrow
mountain roads Thursday to bring tents, food and medicine to
villagers caught in the crossfire between Indian and Pakistan
troops deployed along the disputed Kashmir border.
	   The government of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir announced the
distribution of supplies to scores of villagers left homeless by a
week of relentless artillery and shell attacks by Indian soldiers.
	   One thousand tents were among the supplies sent to the disputed
border.
	   The prime minister of Pakistan-run Kashmir, Sultan Mahmood
accused the Indians of preparing for an all-out assault on
Pakistan. The first step, he said, was to force villagers to
abandon the area along the border.
	   ``They mean business now . . . they are forcing the population
to leave,'' Mahmood said in an interview with The Associated Press.
``They want to go for a bigger attack.''
	   The Pakistan army says Indian shells and artillery have killed
an estimated 30 civilians in the last week.
	   Meanwhile, India says Pakistani soldiers are killing Indian
civilians.
	   But a Pakistan army spokesman, who cannot be identified under
usual briefing rules, said Pakistan has retaliated to the Indian
firing, but their guns are aimed at Indian troops.
	   ``We cannot say with certainty what casualties the enemy has
suffered,'' said the spokesman. ``We fire back on their positions
and while there is nothing to confirm, we believe they have
suffered huge losses in the shape of troops.''
	   Mahmood said the relentless shelling has destroyed homes and
livestock. People are panicked and have begun to look to his
government for help.
	   ``I am getting a lot of demands to give shelter, protection and
the basic necessities to the people on the line of control,'' he
said. ``This is what India is doing. They are doing it on a bigger
scale now so people will leave and create panic and destabilize
Azad Kashmir.''
	   The former princely state of Kashmir, tucked away in the shadow
of the Himalayan Mountains, was divided between Pakistan and India
after the British left the Asian subcontinent in 1947.
	   Both India and Pakistan lay claim to a united Kashmir and twice
they have fought a war to settle the issue. They fought a third war
in 1971 but then it was over Bangladesh or what was then known as
East Pakistan.
	   The simmering Kashmir dispute shot to international prominence
in May after India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests and
declared themselves nuclear powers.
	   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub has urged international
mediation warning that another war on the Asian subcontinent is
likely to result in the use of nuclear weapons.
	   While firing across the disputed border is a regular occurrence
in Kashmir, it has escalated in the last, according to government
officials and residents of the area.
	   The Neelum Valley region has been particularly hard hit in
recent days, say residents in the area. One village claimed 25
homes burned to the ground after being hit by Indian shells.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas launched a series of
attacks against Israeli and allied militia outposts across southern
Lebanon Thursday, briefly overrunning one position. Israel
retaliated with air attacks and artillery.
	   One guerrilla was killed, two Israeli soldiers, two allied South
Lebanon Army militiamen and a guerrilla of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah were wounded in the offensive, Lebanese security
officials said. A 65-year-old Lebanese civilian died of a heart
attack during the fighting, they added.
	   Israel confirmed that two of its troops and two SLA fighters
were wounded and taken to hospitals in Israel. An Israeli military
spokesman in Jerusalem said one of the wounded Israelis sustained
serious injuries.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said 18 Israeli and SLA
positions were attacked with rockets and machine-gun fire.
Thursday's attacks were the largest since a similar onslaught
targeted 25 Israeli and SLA positions on Feb. 4.
	   Israel's air force came to the aid of troops under fire,
Lebanese officials said. A helicopter gunship fired three missiles
at guerrillas near the SLA outpost of Haddatha, which was captured
for 12 minutes by Hezbollah as its defenders huddled in underground
bunkers to avoid the intense shelling that preceded the attack.
	   Hezbollah said its guerrillas destroyed the position, but
Lebanese officials said they hoisted the Hezbollah flag and
retreated after throwing grenades into the bunkers.

Fighting spreads across Guinea-Bissau; slow progress in talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Battles between government forces
and renegade troops escalated in inland areas Thursday while the
two sides studied each other's conditions for direct peace talks in
the capital.
	   Hundreds of people fled this northeastern town Wednesday night
after the rebels warned of an imminent battle against advancing
troops from neighboring Senegal who are supporting President Joao
Bernardo Vieira.
	   Three major roads leading to Bissau were unpassable Thursday as
rebels clashed with Senegalese reinforcements heading for the
capital, Portuguese radio TSF reported.
	   A Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman in Lisbon said
Senegalese forces were deploying large-calibre mortars as part of a
new offensive to help crush the 25-day-old revolt.
	   The rebels are willing to pursue a negotiated end to the
conflict, but the Bissau government is not inclined to enter into
talks, the spokesman told The Associated Press on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   ``The government believes it has the military might to resolve
the issue,'' he said.
	   The Portuguese ambassador in Bissau, who is attempting to
mediate the conflict, met Wednesday with a rebel delegation aboard
a Portuguese Navy frigate anchored off the coast. A government
delegation failed to turn up.
	   Ambassador Fernando Henriques da Silva later conveyed the rebel
conditions for direct talks to government officials, Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told reporters in Lisbon. A government
response was expected on Friday, he said.
	   Rebels dug into positions around Bissau's international airport
exchanged sporadic mortar fire with loyalist troops early Thursday,
according to the Portuguese Ambassador in Bissau.
	   The breakaway military faction has clung to its positions in
Bissau since former army chief of staff Brigadier Ansumane Mane
launched the coup attempt June 7. Mane says Vieira is corrupt and
has called on him to stand down.
	   The conflict erupted in Guinea-Bissau after Vieira accused Mane
of selling arms to Casamance separatists fighting the Senegalese
government. Mane said it was Vieira who was trafficking arms to the
region.
	   Information on the number of casualties was not immediately
available.
	   The spread of the fighting to the interior indicated the
conflict is developing into nearly all out civil war in this
impoverished former Portuguese colony in West Africa.
	   Henriques da Silva said he had received unconfirmed reports that
Senegalese soldiers were looting houses and committing human rights
abuses, including torture, in Bissau, according to the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   Portuguese humanitarian organizations alleged Thursday that
France was backing the Senegalese military effort in Guinea-Bissau
by deploying weaponry and support troops in southern Senegal, close
to the Guinea-Bissau border.
	   ``There's no doubt about France's involvement in the conflict,''
said Fatima Proenca, who represents four aid groups working in
Guinea-Bissau, after meeting with Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio.
	   Eyewitnesses reported French troop movements in the southern
Casamance region of Senegal just across Guinea-Bissau's northern
border, she said.
	   Senegal was preventing aid from crossing into Guinea-Bissau
where the fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people who
require urgent food and medical aid, she said.

Japan announces plan to resolve its banking crisis

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moving to answer criticism it hasn't done enough to
solve a banking crisis crippling the world's second-largest
economy, Japan announced a plan Thursday to gradually shut down
banks weakened by heavy loads of bad loans.
	   Modeled after the United States' bailout strategy for savings
and loan institutions in the 1980s, Japan's ``bridge bank'' scheme
is designed to keep credit flowing to healthy corporate borrowers
as the government takes over insolvent banks.
	   The plan is the latest attempt by the government to ease a
credit crunch and bad loan crisis that have been a major obstacle
to Japan's recovery from its worst recession since World War II.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga announced the widely expected
plan Thursday immediately after it was approved by a special
government task force set up last month.
	   ``It is of utmost importance that we restore confidence in our
banking system both inside and outside of Japan,'' Matsunaga said.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has come under mounting
criticism for failing to deal effectively with the 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 546 billion) in bad loans left in the wake of a late 1980s
speculative ``bubble'' in real estate and stock prices.
	   Under the plan, banks found to be insolvent will be managed by
the Financial Supervision Agency, a new government watchdog agency,
while a merger partner is sought. Bridge loans will be provided to
corporate customers dependent on financing from the troubled banks.
	   When no suitor can be found, the banks will be taken over by a
state-funded holding company and then sold off or liquidated. Bad
loans will be handed over to special institutions and good loans
are to be transferred to healthy private banks.
	   The process is to be completed within a maximum of five years
and funded with up to 13 trillion yen (dlrs 93 billion) in taxpayer
money allocated from Japan's Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures
bank deposits.
	   Also announced Thursday were steps to strengthen special
institutions that have been set up to absorb and sell off bad loans
held by banks.
	   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rallied ahead of the
announcement, but some analysts questioned whether the plan will be
effectively implemented, noting the criteria for closing troubled
banks remain vague.
	   ``I really think it's going to be a big disappointment,'' said
Betsy Daniels, a banking industry analyst in the Tokyo office of
Morgan Stanley.
	   ``They can serve up any sort of menu of opportunities to
restructure faster but it's not going to be meaningful until they
actually close down some institutions,'' she said.
	   But some welcomed the move to bring the government directly into
the banking industry.
	   ``Other measures cannot control the situation,'' said Yoshihiro
Sakamoto, an adviser at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi Ltd. and a former
trade official. ``We have to use the credibility of the
government.''
	   The plan was the result of a series of brainstorming sessions by
officials from Japan's powerful bureaucracy and Hashimoto's
governing party. The task force was assembled last month after
Japan promised the United States and other trading partners that it
would take aggressive action to deal with its banking crisis.
	   The yen recently dropped to eight-year lows against the dollar
amid growing pessimism over the outlook for the Japanese economy,
prompting criticism Japan could deepen the Asian crisis by
triggering a wave of currency devaluations in neighboring
countries.
	   Adding to the governing Liberal Democratic Party's sense of
urgency is a set of elections on July 12 for the upper house of
Japan's bicameral Parliament.

Tauziat beats Zvereva for place in final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Tauziat, Zvereva quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Nathalie Tauziat became the first
French woman to reach the Wimbledon final in 73 years, overcoming a
horrible start Thursday to beat Natasha Zvereva.
	   Tauziat barely kept the ball in the court as she dropped seven
of the first eight games, but she recovered in time to rally for a
1-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 victory.
	   Tauziat will face the winner of what many considered the true
final _ pitting defending champion Martina Hingis against Jana
Novotna in a replay of last year's championship match.
	   When Zvereva sailed a return long on match point, Tauziat let
out a shriek, threw her racket in the air, flopped onto her back
and covered her face with her hands. She then slapped the grass
with her hand.
	   It was by far the most dramatic moment of a match that was
largely devoid of compelling tennis.
	   ``I dont know what I'm going to do if I win the final,'' Tauziat
said. ``I was so happy to win and be in the final of a Grand Slam.
It's most important for me. ... I'm not on the moon already but
almost.''
	   In reaching her first Grand Slam final, the 30-year-old Tauziat
became the first French woman to make the Wimbledon final since
Suzanne Lenglen won her sixth Wimbledon title in 1925.
	   Francoise Durr, the last French woman to get to the semis in
1970, watched the match from the players' box and had tears in her
eyes as Tauziat celebrated her victory.
	   Tauziat is the lowest seeded player in the field at No. 16 and
the lowest seed ever to make the Wimbledon final. But she said she
won't be intimidated.
	   ``I have nothing to lose,'' she said. ``For me it's going to be
a nice present to be there, to be on Centre Court with any player.
I don't care. If I play my best tennis I think I can win.''
	   For the first set and a half, it looked like Zvereva would
become the first unseeded women's finalist since Billie Jean King
in 1963.
	   The Belarussian, a doubles specialist who had upset Steffi Graf
and Monica Seles en route to the semis, only needed to keep the
ball in play as Tauziat sprayed errors all over the court.
	   ``I was embarrassed,'' Tauziat said. ``I was not playing. You
are in the semifinals at Wimbledon and you want to give your best.
I didn't give my best. Suddenly I started to think I'm going to
miss this chance. I had to fight and I fought good.''
	   Tauziat finally settled down in the second set, playing
free-flowing tennis and punctuating her winners with shouts and
fist-pumps.
	   Zvereva's game collapsed in the second-set tiebreaker amid
glaring unforced errors that turned the match around for good.
Tauziat raced to 3-0 lead in the third set and never relented.
	   Zvereva said the strain of playing so many big matches had taken
its toll.
	   ``I'm so tired,'' she said. ``I need a mental institution break.
I've never been in this situation before. It's really draining.''
	   On Friday, 13th graf

British regulators probe pricing of Murdoch's newspapers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Competition officials said Thursday they are
investigating two of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, The Times and The
Sunday Times, after rivals complained about alleged predatory
pricing.
	   Prices often have been a contentious issue in Britain's highly
competitive newspaper industry. But three previous probes of The
Times _ in 1993, 1994 and 1996 _ found no evidence of wrongdoing.
	   The Office of Fair Trading said it had decided to open the
latest inquiry after receiving detailed complaints from three other
broadsheet newspapers, The Independent, The Daily Telegraph and The
Guardian.
	   The Times currently sells for 30 pence (50 cents) per copy on
weekdays, one-third cheaper than the 45 pence (75 cents) cover
price for The Guardian, The Independent and The Daily Telegraph.
	   The director-general of fair trading, John Bridgeman, has
ordered Murdoch's company, News International, to provide
``information on pricing strategies, profitability and the fixed
and variable costs of producing The Times and Sunday Times.''
	   Bridgeman said in a statement he has not reached any conclusion
about whether he thinks Britain's newspaper business has any
problems with predatory pricing.
	   ``It does mean that we are intent on a thorough assessment of an
issue which continues to cause debate and is of widespread
interest,'' Bridgeman said. After the three rival newspapers
complained about Murdoch's titles, Bridgeman asked them in March
for more information to substantiate their charges before he agreed
to open a new probe.
	   Predatory pricing occurs when a company seeks to run rivals out
of business by selling its product below cost.
	   Bridgeman gave News International six weeks to hand over the
information he wants, and the company promised to cooperate.
	   News International said the new investigation seemed similar to
the old cases in which it prevailed.
	   ``We will be responding to questions asked by the director
general of fair trading, as we have in the past,'' News
International said in a statement. ``On each of those occasions the
director general reached the conclusion that The Times' pricing
policy was a legimate commercial strategy. We are confident that
the same considerations apply now as previously.''

Annan: All Nigerian political prisoners will be freed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 15 grafs to UPDATE with numbers of prisoners still
held, diplomatic effects of prisoner release, quote. Picks up 10th
graf previous, `Abiola also met ...' &QL; 
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
announced Thursday that ``the stage is set'' for the release of all
of Nigeria's political prisoners, including Moshood Abiola, the
nation's leading opposition figure.
	   ``I'm leaving Nigeria with the stage set for the release of all
political detainees,'' Annan said. ``All political detainees will
be released and the government will make an announcement at the
appropriate time.''
	   Annan confirmed that he met with Abiola on Tuesday and said he
was in good health and alert.
	   Abiola, 60, was elected president of Nigeria in 1993 in an
election annulled by Nigeria's military regime. The junta, led by
Gen. Sani Abacha, jailed Abiola a year later when he declared
himself president.
	   Annan said Abiola had decided to relinquish his claim to the
presidency and cooperate with Nigeria's junta in preparing for a
peaceful transition to democracy.
	   ``I found him more realistic than some of us outside, Chief
Abiola realizes that a lot has changed,'' Annan said. Annan said
Abiola's first priority upon leaving prison is to rebuild his life
and then determine what political support he still has after more
than four years in prison.
	   Abiola's fortune, and his personal life, have suffered deeply
during his imprisonment. Two of his many wives have died since he
was imprisoned _ one in an assassination-style slaying _ and his
business empire has largely collapsed.
	   Just a few years ago Abiola's fortune was estimated in the
hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses stretching from
newspapers to shipping. Now, it is believed to to be just a tiny
fraction of what it was.
	   Nigeria's Council of State, meanwhile, which effectively
functions as the country's cabinet, was meeting Thursday afternoon
to discuss the releases. Later Thursday or early Friday the
Provision Ruling Council _ the core of Nigeria's junta leaders _
will also meet, apparently to rubber stamp the releases.
	   An estimated 250 and 280 political prisoners are believed to be
held across Nigeria. All are held in regular prisons except for
Abiola _ who is being held in relative comfort at a government
guest house in Abuja.
	   Annan, who is from Ghana, was the highest-profile diplomat to
visit Nigeria since Abacha provoked widespread outrage by executing
leading playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November 1995.
	   Abacha's death last month from a heart attack, and the
assumption of power by Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, provided the
opportunity for political change in Nigeria, Annan said.
	   Abubakar appears to be making a concerted effort to move away
from his predecessor's policies and has already freed about 40
political prisoners.
	   Abubakar's efforts _ particularly the prisoner releases _ could
certainly pay off in the international arena, which has largely
left Nigeria a pariah since Sar-Wiwa's execution.
	   ``We cannot but welcome such a development if it materializes,''
the French ambassador to the United Nations, Alain Dejammet, said
in New York on Thursday. Nigeria ``is a very big power, very
important, which can play a very active role. With such prospects,
it will be fully for the benefit of the U.N., and of Africa and of
Nigeria.''

Election commission investigates labor's political ads campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEVIN GALVIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Targeting an explosion of unregulated
advertisements by special-interest groups, the U.S. Federal
Election Commission is investigating a massive ad campaign in the
1996 presidential elections by the largest U.S. labor federation.
The commission aims to determine if the campaign was illegally
coordinated with leaders of President Bill Clinton's Democratic
Party.
	   Labor, legal and political sources said the commission, which
recently subpoenaed several Republicans over similar questions, has
been probing the AFL-CIO's campaign since late 1996. The various
probes are evidence of a new focus for the commission.
	   ``They have continued to go at it from every different
direction, and we've shipped them boxes and boxes of information,''
said David Mitchell, a partner in the media firm Greer, Margolis,
Mitchell, Burns and Associates Inc., which produced several of the
AFL-CIO television commercials in early 1996.
	   ``The FEC is being aggressive,'' Mitchell said. ``But I would
like to convince them that at the end of the day it will have been
for naught because there is nothing to find in this case.''
	   Third-party spending, if done in the form of generic ``issue
ads'' that don't advocate a particular candidate's election or
defeat, falls outside federal regulation and campaign spending
limits. The exemption is forfeited, however, if groups paying for
the ads coordinate efforts with political parties or candidates.
	   AFL-CIO counsel Larry Gold declined comment, as did Rick Hess,
spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. The FEC does not
comment on investigations while they are under way.
	   Labor increased the role of ``issues advocacy'' ads with the
AFL-CIO's dlrs 35 million political campaign in 1996, which
frequently criticized Republican incumbents about their stands on
the minimum wage, health care for the elderly and poor, education
and other issues.
	   Republicans protested that labor was unfairly boosting Democrats
under the guise of advocating positions on issues. They noted the
unions also sponsored candidate forums that included top Democrats
and pollsters and participated in coordinated campaigns that
generated turnout for Democrats.
	   Republicans also are under scrutiny for possible coordination.
Over the past month, the FEC subpoenaed Rep. John Boehner of Ohio,
chairman of the House Republican Conference, and a coalition of
business groups that ran a dlrs 4 million advertising campaign to
counter the labor ads.

Mandela arrives for Caribbean celebration

	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela arrived to a hero's welcome Thursday to celebrate the 25th
anniversary of the Caribbean Community trade bloc.
	   Mandela, 80 years old and clearly fatigued by the 18-hour flight
from South Africa, held his hand to his heart as a military brass
band played the South African national anthem.
	   He declined to review the white-uniformed honor guard, heading
instead to islanders crowded behind the airport fence.
	   ``Great man! Great man!'' one declared, as children squeezed
their fingers through the fence to reach Mandela's outstretched
hand.
	   On his first visit to the Caribbean as president, Mandela said
he was delighted to be among supporters of South Africa's struggle
against white-minority rule. He said he hoped to increase trade
between the Caribbean and South Africa, which last year topped dlrs
100 million.
	   Mandela's delegation included blacks and South Africans of East
Indian descent, the same ethnic groups involved in an increasingly
violent power struggle in Caricom member Guyana.
	   Guyana's problems have practically taken over the annual summit
of the 16-member trade bloc, a dlrs 30 billion market with more
than 6 million people.
	   Leaders were seeking a compromise between Guyanese President
Janet Jagan and the man she defeated in Dec. 15 elections, former
President Desmond Hoyte.
	   Hoyte's followers _ mostly Guyanese of African descent _ have
rioted in recent weeks, protesting an election they say was rigged
and alleged discrimination against blacks in the civil service.
	   Jagan's party is supported by Guyana's majority East Indian
population. A Caricom audit concluded she won fairly.

NATO chief says world won't tolerate another Bosnia in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first observer mission to patrol next week; more
reported flareups. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's top official declared
Thursday that the world won't allow a repeat of the Bosnian war in
Kosovo, where the top ethnic Albanian official pleaded again for
intervention.
	   But Secretary-General Javier Solana, speaking in Sarajevo during
a tour of the Balkans, said the focus for now is not on Western
military action but on diplomatic efforts to obtain a cease-fire.
	   In a concrete sign of such efforts, the U.S. Embassy announced
Thursday that a monitoring mission, made up of diplomats accredited
to the American, Russian, Austrian and Polish embassies in Belgrade
would begin its work in Kosovo next Monday.
	   Among the mission's tasks will be observing freedom of motion,
said a U.S. Embassy statement. Such freedom is hampered both by
Serb police blocking access to regions where anti-guerrilla
operations are in process, and Kosovo Albanian fighters extending
their grip in the central part of the Serbian province.
	   NATO forces, which staged a display of air power in the region
last month as a warning they may intervene, are continuing their
preparations for possible further action, Solana said before
leaving for Tirana, Albania.
	   ``The situation we had in Bosnia should not be repeated,'' he
said. ``The international community will not allow that to
happen.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have been pressing for military
intervention to halt the months-long campaign by Serb security
forces to crush militant resistance in the secessionist province of
Serbia, populated predominantly by Albanians.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanians' leader, said after meeting
a visiting delegation of U.S. congressional staffers Thursday that
the latest Serb actions are ``aimed at ethnically cleansing
Kosovo.''
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is grave because of constant attacks
by army and police forces and a continuation of ethnic cleansing of
Kosovo,'' he said. ``An international intervention is needed to
protect the people of Kosovo and create conditions for the start of
dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.''
	   Rugova also met with Norway's Kai Aide, an ambassador of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as part of
continuing efforts to persuade the West to act swiftly on Kosovo.
	   Officials in Serb-led Yugoslavia maintain the action is aimed at
wiping out ``terrorists'' and restoring order to the restive
province. They also accuse the Kosovo Liberation Army of attacks on
Serb civilians.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the KLA.
But they did agree to meet again Sunday to try to meld the
guerrilla struggle with their nonviolent independence campaign.
	   In an indication of how compelling the need to enlist the
guerrillas has become, Rugova also participated in the meeting.
Previously he has refused to cooperate with the armed insurgents,
preaching nonviolence as the only way to achieve independence.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule.
	   In the latest fighting, the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug
reported a clash Thursday in the flash-point of Kijevo _ a Serb
village west of Pristina that KLA guerrillas surrounded last month.
Further details were not immediately available.
	   Tanjug also said the militants staged attacks overnight on
villages in the region of Klina, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   In Pristina, the Kosovo Information Center, close to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said Albanian fighters
remained in control of Belacevac village, near the strategically
important coal mine west of Pristina.
	   The Serbs claimed to have retaken the mine on Tuesday, after two
days of intense fighting and reporters subsequently saw Serb armor
and troops in Belacevac. But the center said the KLA still held the
town itself, despite a Serb siege.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources also reported fighting in the Decani
region close to the Albanian border, with Serb forces shelling
eight villages. None of the reports could be confirmed.

NATO secretary-general to visit Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana will
arrive in Kiev next week to discuss the alliance's military and
technical cooperation with Ukraine, the Foreign Ministry said
Thursday.
	   The sides also are to discuss the appointment of a NATO liaison
officer to Ukraine, the first step towards opening a mission that
would facilitate military contacts with the former Soviet republic,
it said.
	   During his July 8-9 visit, Solana is scheduled to meet with
President Leonid Kuchma, Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk, Defense
Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk, Security Council secretary Volodymyr
Horbulin and other government officials.
	   He is also due to visit the Yuzhmash plant in the eastern
Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, which used to be one of the
world's largest producers of missiles.
	   Solana's visit is dedicated to the first anniversary of the
signing a cooperation charter between NATO and Ukraine.
	   Ukraine has repeatedly stressed it wants close relations with
NATO, and has hosted and participated in peacekeeping maneuvers
under the alliance's Partnership for Peace program.
	   Some Ukrainian officials have said the country may eventually
seek NATO membership.
	   However, Ukraine's stance toward NATO is largely influenced by
Russia, the country's giant northern neighbor, which has vehemently
protested against any of the former Soviet republics' joining NATO.

Kirsten and Kallis take South Africa to 152-1

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis hit
half centuries to grab the initiative from England on the opening
day of the third cricket test Thursday.
	   After the early loss of Gehardus Liebenberg, the second wicket
pair overcame a hesitant start to take South Africa to 152 for one
at tea.
	   Batting conditions improved after lunch as the sun appeared and
the South Africans scored 57 runs in the first hour after the
break.
	   Kirsten and Kallis had struggled on a damp pitch before lunch,
managing 59 runs in the first session.
	   But Kallis set the tone for the post lunch session, racing to
his half century off 101 balls, while Kirsten was happy to play
second fiddle.
	   Kallis, unbeaten on 71, outscored the veteran Kirsten, who was
60 not out in a minute under four hours.
	   Gough's first bowl for England in 12 months had the South
Africans in early trouble as he beat them with pace and movement
off the sparsely-grassed Old Trafford pitch.
	   Bowling with pace and swinging the ball both ways, Gough bowled
Liebenberg for 16 with the final delivery of his fifth over.
	   But England's joy was short lived as Kirsten and Kallis put
together 126 runs in 202 minutes. It raised a new South African
record for a second-wicket partnership at Old Trafford, improving
on the 93 between Dennis Dyer and Bruce Mitchell in 1947.
	   England's spin duo _ off spinner Robert Croft and left armer
Ashley Giles _ bowled just four overs each in tandem before lunch.
After the break England skipper Alec Stewart alternated between the
slow bowlers and the pace attack.
	   England's only chance to break up the South African partnership
was in Giles' first over after lunch when Kirsten cut the ball past
Nassaer Hussain's outstretched hand at slip.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ New York city and state announced sanctions
Thursday against Swiss banks suspected of holding the assets of
Holocaust victims.
	   If there is no settlement between the banks and representatives
of the claimants by Sept. 1, New York authorities will bar
short-term investments with Swiss banks and stop the banks and
investment firms from selling state and city debt, New York City
Comptroller Alan Hevesi said.
	   They also will not allow banks to provide letters of credit,
which are insurance policies on city debt.
	   The announcement comes a day after a commission, led by Hevesi
and representing hundreds of U.S. finance officials, cleared the
way for such sanctions.

NEW YORK: such sanctions.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   If the impasse continues, Hevesi said he and state Comptroller
H. Carl McCall would extend the actions to additional Swiss
financial services on Nov. 15 and to all Swiss companies on Jan. 1.
	   On Wednesday, California Treasurer Matt Fong, who oversees dlrs
32 billion in funds, said that beginning Thursday his state will
not seek new contracts with U.S. subsidiaries of Swiss banks.
	   Hevesi blamed the Swiss government for a breakdown in the
negotiations, which prompted the sanctions.
	   ``The line in the sand apparently has become a line in
concrete,'' he said, adding that the decision to endorse sanctions
came when a representative of the Swiss government told the
commission that Switzerland ``will never, ever'' participate in
negotiating a settlement.
	   New York has combined assets of almost dlrs 200 billion in state
and city pension funds _ the second and third largest in the
country, respectively _ invested in Swiss banks.
	   Other states also are taking action:
	   _In New Jersey, the legislature is debating a bill that would
require the state to divest some dlrs 66 million in stock invested
with Union Bank of Switzerland until assets are returned to
Holocaust survivors.
	   _Vermont, Rhode Island and Kentucky also are considering the
possibility of sanctions.
	   _Last year, Massachusetts ended its dlrs 120,000-a-year contract
with Union Bank.
	   Hevesi said he hopes U.S. officials will allow a measured
process of sanctions to give negotiators time to resolve the
issues. That didn't mollify Swiss banking officials.
	   ``The Swiss banks are outraged,'' said Ulrich Pfister, a
spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. ``Sanctions are
unjustified and counterproductive. We will study all measures we
can take against them.''

Government bans reporting of anti-Maoist operation in parts of
</HEADLINE>
Nepal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepali newspapers reporting on a
crackdown on Maoist rebels are facing an unannounced government ban
in the western region affected by the insurgency, a journalist
union leader said Thursday.
	   Kishor Nepal, president of the Nepali Journalist Federation,
said police are telling transport operators not to carry newspapers
that publish reports on the police operation and are seizing and
burning papers found on buses and trucks.
	   Most of the newspapers are printed in Katmandu, the Nepalese
capital.
	   According to the government, at least 54 Maoist rebels have been
killed in the last month, since police began flushing them from
jungle hide-outs. Opposition leaders say the figure could be much
higher.
	   Home Minister Govind Raj Joshi said he knew of no ban on news
about the crackdown, according to a delegation of journalists who
met him.
	   A Paris-based press rights group, Reporters Without Borders,
wrote to Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala on Tuesday
expressing concern over seizures of newspapers in Sindhulimadi, 320
kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Katmandu.
	   Maoist guerrillas oppose Nepal's constitutional monarchy and
demand that the Himalayan state be turned into a republic. More
than 200 people have been killed since the insurgency began two
years ago.

Extra lane to smooth motorists' access to Storebaelt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The opening of the Storebaelt link
was supposed to speed travel from Copenhagen to the European
Continent, but many motorists are complaining of long waits at the
toll booths.
	   The company that operates the 18-kilometer (11-mile)
bridge-tunnel announced Thursday it would add an extra lane to the
eastern approach, hoping to ease congestion.
	   Higher traffic than expected has forced motorists to wait as
long as 45 minutes to get through the booths _ just a few minutes
less than the ferry crossing that the link replaced.
	   The Storebaelt link consists of two bridges _ one of them, with
a length of 6,790 meters (4.2 miles), is Europe's longest _ and a
railroad tunnel.
	   It runs from Zealand, the island where Copenhagen sits, to
Funen, an island linked by another bridge to the mainland.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The world will not allow the
conflict in Kosovo to turn into a drawn out bloody civil war
between ethnic groups, NATO's top official declared Thursday.
	   But the focus on resolving the conflict between ethnic Albanians
and Serbs in the Serbian province is not on Western military action
but on diplomatic efforts to obtain a cease-fire, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said in Sarajevo during a tour of
the Balkans.
	   In a concrete sign of such efforts, the U.S. Embassy announced
Thursday that a monitoring mission, made up of diplomats accredited
to the American, Russian, Austrian and Polish embassies in Belgrade
would begin its work in Kosovo next Monday.
	   Among the mission's tasks will be observing freedom of motion,
said a U.S. Embassy statement. Such freedom is hampered both by
Serb police blocking access to regions where anti-guerrilla
operations are in process, and Kosovo Albanian fighters extending
their grip in the central part of the Serbian province.
	   NATO forces, which staged a display of air power in the region
last month, are continuing their preparations for possible further
action, Solana said before leaving for Tirana, Albania.
	   ``The situation we had in Bosnia should not be repeated,'' he
said. ``The international community will not allow that to
happen.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have been pressing for military
intervention to halt the months-long campaign by Serb security
forces to crush militant resistance in the secessionist province of
Serbia, populated predominantly by Albanians.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanians' political leader, said
after meeting a visiting delegation of U.S. congressional staffers
Thursday that the latest Serb actions are ``aimed at ethnically
cleansing Kosovo.''
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is grave because of constant attacks
by army and police forces and a continuation of ethnic cleansing of
Kosovo,'' he said. ``An international intervention is needed to
protect the people of Kosovo and create conditions for the start of
dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.''
	   Rugova also met with Norway's Kai Aide, an ambassador of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as part of
continuing efforts to persuade the West to act swiftly on Kosovo.
	   Officials in Serb-led Yugoslavia maintain the action is aimed at
wiping out ``terrorists'' and restoring order to the restive
province. They also accuse the Kosovo Liberation Army of attacks on
Serb civilians.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the KLA.
But they did agree to meet again Sunday to try to meld the
guerrilla struggle with their nonviolent independence campaign.
	   In an indication of how compelling the need to enlist the
guerrillas has become, Rugova also participated in the meeting.
Previously he has refused to cooperate with the armed insurgents,
preaching nonviolence as the only way to achieve independence.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule.
	   In the latest fighting, the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug
reported a clash Thursday in the flashpoint of Kijevo _ a Serb
village west of Pristina that KLA guerrillas surrounded last month.
Further details were not immediately available.
	   Tanjug also said the militants staged attacks overnight on
villages in the region of Klina, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   Backing off its demand for an immediate pullback of Serb forces
in Kosovo, the U.S. government said Wednesday there probably will
have to be a cease-fire before Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic withdraws the special units that have cracked down on
Albanian militants and civilians.
	   The shift was Washington's second major move in the past week to
try to revitalize its diplomatic approach to the Kosovo conflict.
The other step was opening talks with the KLA.

	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe. But victims' relatives
say bank officials stonewalled survivors and their heirs after
World War II, claiming they could not find accounts or demanding
nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to relatives of
those who died in concentration camps.
	   Three Swiss banks made a take-it-or-leave-it offer of dlrs 600
million last month. Jewish leaders rejected the offer, calling it
insultingly low.
	   Melvyn Weiss, lawyer for more than 31,000 plaintiffs in a
lawsuit against Swiss banks, said Jewish groups have proposed a
dlrs 1.5 billion settlement that would cover claims against all
Swiss banks as well as the Swiss government.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed
confidence Thursday that Asia will overcome its economic troubles
caused by weak currencies.
	   ``This present financial crisis, too, will pass if we work
together with discipline and vision to lift the fortunes of our
neighbors,'' the president declared after arriving in this
high-rise business haven.
	   He is the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hong Kong, and
the presidential jet Air Force One was the first passenger plane to
land at the city's new Chek Lap Kok International Airport. Chinese
President Jiang Zemin dedicated the airport earlier, and his was
the first plane to take off.
	   Clinton, whose nine-day tour of China ends Friday, declared his
trip an eye-opening experience that has convinced him the United
States and China are headed toward a successful diplomatic
partnership.
	   ``All this was encouraging and made me believe that we can build
together a future that is more stable, more prosperous and free,''
he said at a dinner hosted by Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief
executive.
	   In a separate meeting with Tung at Government House, Clinton
told him: ``We are poised now to do some important things
together.''
	   Tung, in turn, assured Clinton that Jiang had reaffirmed his
commitment to maintain autonomy for Hong Kong. The two presidents
were in Hong Kong one year after the British colony reverted to
Chinese rule after 156 years.
	   ``The central government leaders are determined to ensure the
implementation of the basic law,'' Tung said at the dinner,
referring to the rules under which Hong Kong is currently
administered. ``We are confident that China will be more open, more
prosperous and will play an increasingly important role in world
affairs.''
	   China has repeatedly vowed to maintain autonomy for the bustling
city, whose skyscrapers are monuments to Western-style capitalism.
	   Fears that Beijing would crack down on demonstrators and push
political opponents to the margin after the July 1, 1997, handover
have so far proved unfounded. Instead, the Asia financial crisis is
the former colony's most urgent worry.
	   In a show of support for leaders of Hong Kong's pro-democracy
movement, Clinton was scheduled to meet Friday with Martin Lee, the
de facto opposition leader who was among 20 legislators who won
recent elections. The president had no plans to meet 40 other
legislators who were not selected by direct vote of the people.
	   His meetings with pro-democracy leaders, including Lee, are
private and will be closed to photographers _ a restriction critics
consider a bow to Beijing's sensitivity over Clinton's visit. But
the White House insisted the president's ``normal practice'' is to
exclude the press from meetings with opposition leaders when he
travels abroad.
	   As Clinton left mainland China, police freed the last of seven
dissidents rounded up in connection with his visit. A human rights
group said police in eastern Hangzhou city released Zhu Yufu after
holding him for 48 hours.
	   Clinton's Hong Kong stop came after he took a picturesque boat
ride on the Li River that winds it way around scenic Guilin.
	   Earlier, standing before the spectacular limestone peaks of the
restored paradise, Clinton urged China to learn from the United
States' mistakes and not to harm the environment for the sake of
economic growth.
	   He pledged U.S. support to the cleansing of rivers, air and land
in China, which has five of the most polluted cities in the world.
	   ``Let us, Chinese and Americans, preserve what we have inherited
from the past and, in doing so, preserve the future we are working
so hard to build for our children,'' Clinton said today.
	   In Guilin, where the government and citizens have replanted
trees, cleaned up the winding rivers and begun to wean themselves
from coal-burning fuels, the president marveled at his scenic
surroundings.
	   ``I believe that China has a unique opportunity _ because you're
developing rapidly, but later in time than other countries _ to
avoid some of the terrible mistakes we made,'' he said.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A huge car bomb exploded in a crowded
downtown area of Hungary's capital on Thursday, killing four people
and injuring more 25, police said.
	   The bomb was attached to a car that blew up shortly before noon
on busy Aranykez Street, in an area packed with shoppers and
pedestrians.
	   Three men and a woman were killed and another person was in
critical condition, said a police spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy.
	   One of the men died in the ambulance. One of the injured was in
critical condition; 12 remained hospitalized with lighter injuries,
and the rest received outpatient treatment.
	   The apparent target of the bombing _ restaurateur Jozsef Tamas
Boross _ was among those killed, said National Chief Police
Superintendent Laszlo Forgacs. The bomb, apparently set off by
remote control, exploded as Boross drove by in his Mercedes.
	   No identities were immediately available for the other victims.
	   Forgacs said Boross had asked for police supervision _ but not
24-hour protection _ after receiving unspecified threats.

Today's new soccer word: ``Driblaveis.''

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On the eve of the World Cup quarterfinals, the
coach of defending champion Brazil tossed linguistics to the wind
and came up with a new word to describe the Danish defense:
	   ``Driblaveis.''
	   You won't find it in any Portuguese dictionary, and its English
equivalent is also a skewed yet easily understood bit of grammar:
``Dribblable.''
	   It's a word which must have perked up Ronaldo and the rest of
Brazil's wide array of talented players, who hope to slice through
the Danish backs like bishops moving past regimented pawns on a
chess board when the two teams met Friday at Nantes.
	   ``They play in line, and that makes it easier,'' Brazilian coach
Mario Zagallo said. ``The striker just has to move on the diagonal
and time his run to not get caught offsides.''
	   In other words, said Zagallo: ``They're dribblable.''
	   In Friday's other quarterfinal, France plays Italy at
Saint-Denis. Argentina-Netherlands and Croatia-Germany complete the
final eight matchups on Saturday.
	   Denmark didn't need Zagallo's word-wizardry to remind it of its
huge underdog status against the four-time champions. What must be
remembered, however, is that the Danes know how to pull an upset.
	   At the 1992 European Championship, as a last-minute substitute
replacing sanctions-hit Yugoslavia, Denmark startled the field by
winning the title for the first time, beating Germany in the final.
	   And, just a few days ago, Denmark trounced favored Nigeria 4-1
in the second round of France 98.
	   ``Nobody expects Denmark to do anything,'' said forward Brian
Laudrup. ``We like to be in that role. If we were to lose, people
would say we have done magnificently. If we win, it would even be a
bigger sensation.''
	   For Europeans, Brazil-Denmark is almost an afterthought compared
to the day's other game. Italy vs. France is a battle of
neighboring soccer giants, a three-time champion vs. the host
nation that conceived the World Cup, a tussle among friends who
know each other from clubs in Italy, a showdown between star
talents Christian Vieri of Italy and Zinedine Zidane of France.
	   ``The French playing in Italy have that fighting spirit. There
is no way we can lose to Italy,'' said midfielder Alain Boghossian,
one of seven players on the French roster who play for an Italian
club.
	   France will be boosted by Zidane's return after serving a
two-game suspension for stepping on a player in France's
first-round game against Saudi Arabia, but striker Thierry Henry is
doubtful with a sprained left ankle.
	   Henry is France's leading scorer in the tournament with three
goals, two behind leaders Vieri and Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Elsewhere, there were rumblings from two of the teams playing
Saturday. Brazil's confidence going into its match against Denmark
is nothing like the self-assuredness Germany feels as it prepares
to face Cup newcomer Croatia, and that bothers the Croats.
	   ``We are irritated by what we are hearing from the German
side,'' coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``The German newspapers have
written unflattering things that have upset us.''
	   Those papers are only reflecting what the German players are
saying.
	   ``With all due respect to Croatia, however, it's really up to us
and I am very optimistic,'' captain Juergen Klinsmann said. ``We
want to go to Paris (for the semifinals and finals) and it really
depends only on us.''
	   And Netherlands coach Guus Hiddink complained Thursday to FIFA
because his Dutch team wasn't initially allowed to train at
Marseille's Stade Velodrome the day before its match with
Argentina.
	   ``We suddenly get a letter saying we are not welcome in the
stadium, which I find very strange,'' Hiddink said.
	   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said the Dutch weren't given
practice time because they've already played a game at the stadium.
Late in the day, however, FIFA relented and Hiddink's players were
granted a 5 p.m. training time Friday.
	   The Dutch, perhaps in spite, then said they might not show up
because they'd rather train closer to their hotel.
	   The Netherlands-Argentina game is also naturally the talk of
Buenos Aires, where Argentine officials plan to deploy 1,800
security officers during Saturday's match. Argentina's Secretary of
Security said he will ask stores to stop sales of alcohol two hours
before the game's start.
	   Seventy-eight people were injured in disturbances after
Argentina beat England on Tuesday, when police had used tear gas
and a water cannon to disperse the throngs of fans. More than 100
people were arrested.

Government promises funding for Mir space station program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government promised Thursday to pay part of
its overdue bill to the Russian space program, allowing it to keep
the Mir space station in orbit until mid-1999 and then bring it
down safely.
	   But in another cash crunch, electricity was turned off at the
Baikonur cosmodrome, from which flights to Mir are launched, for
nonpayment of bills.
	   Space officials had warned that the government's failure to pay
its bills may force them to abandon Mir as early as next month and
send the 130-ton station crashing back to Earth. Large pieces could
hit populated areas or even nuclear power plants, they said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov met with the head of the
Russian Space Agency, Yuri Koptev, and other officials on Thursday
to discuss the problem, said Space Agency spokesman Sergei
Gorbunov.
	   Nemtsov's office later said the government would repay the dlrs
600 million it owes for Mir's operations last year, Gorbunov said.
The money would come from unspecified ``non-budgetary sources,'' he
said.
	   ``So lots of things remain unclear: just what sources
specifically it would come from, who would allocate the money,''
Gorbunov told The Associated Press.
	   The government has not paid any bills for the Mir mission this
year and there was no word on whether it would, he said.
	   But the dlrs 600 for 1997 would let the space program ``breathe
freely for a while,'' and allow it to bring Mir back to Earth ``in
a civilized fashion, without crashing,'' Gorbunov said.
	   To control Mir's descent to Earth, Russia plans to launch
several cargo ships to dock with the station and use their engines
to direct it into lower orbits. Most or all of Mir is expected to
burn up during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
	   A new crew was scheduled to blast off for Mir in mid-August, to
replace the current two-man team that is leaving on Aug. 25.
	   But the launch may be postponed for a few days because of the
blackout at the Baikonur cosmodrome, said Yuri Semyonov, head of
the state-run RKK Energiya company, which built Mir and operates
it.
	   ``For five days, we have been unable to work at the Baikonur,
because our electricity has been turned off for nonpayment,''
Semyonov was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   However, the launch cannot be postponed for longer than a few
days. The current crew must return to Earth by the end of August,
when the useful life of their escape capsule runs out, and a new
team cannot dock with the station if it is unmanned.

	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA announced Thursday that every doping test at
the World Cup, up to and including the eight second-round games,
had been negative.
	   Since the competition began June 10, two players from each team
have been tested after every match. FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said, after the second round tests had been analyzed, there had
been no positive tests.
	   ``Every doping control test in this World Cup so far has been
negative,'' he said. ``Were any result to be positive we would
announce it immediately.''
	   Cooper's announcement came two days after the last of the
second-round games in response to calls from journalists asking
whether a player had tested positive.

Fighting spreads across Guinea-Bissau; slow progress in talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Battles between government forces
and renegade troops escalated in inland areas Thursday while
faction leaders studied each other's conditions for direct peace
talks.
	   Hundreds of people the northeastern town of Mansoa Wednesday
night after the rebels warned of an imminent battle against
advancing troops from neighboring Senegal who are supporting
President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Meanwhile, three major roads leading to Bissau were unpassable
Thursday as rebels clashed with Senegalese reinforcements heading
for the capital, Portuguese radio TSF reported.
	   The spread of the fighting to the interior indicated the
conflict is developing into a full-blown civil war in this
impoverished former Portuguese colony in West Africa.
	   A Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman in Lisbon said
Senegalese forces were deploying large-calibre mortars as part of a
new offensive to help crush the 25-day-old revolt.
	   The rebels are willing to pursue a negotiated end to the
conflict, but the Bissau government is not inclined to enter into
talks, the spokesman told The Associated Press on customary
condition of anonymity. ``The government believes it has the
military might to resolve the issue,'' he said.
	   The Portuguese ambassador in Bissau, who is attempting to
mediate the conflict, met Wednesday with a rebel delegation aboard
a Portuguese Navy frigate anchored off the coast. A government
delegation failed to turn up.
	   Ambassador Fernando Henriques da Silva later conveyed the rebel
conditions for direct talks to government officials, Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told reporters in Lisbon. A government
response was expected on Friday.
	   Rebels entrenched around Bissau's international airport
exchanged sporadic mortar fire with loyalist troops early Thursday,
Henriques da Silva said.
	   The breakaway military faction has clung to its positions in
Bissau since former army chief of staff Brigadier Ansumane Mane
launched the coup attempt June 7. Mane says Vieira is corrupt and
has called on him to stand down.
	   The conflict erupted in Guinea-Bissau after Vieira accused Mane
of selling arms to Casamance separatists fighting the Senegalese
government. Mane said it was Vieira who was trafficking arms to the
region.
	   Information on the number of casualties was not immediately
available.
	   Henriques da Silva said he had received unconfirmed reports that
Senegalese soldiers were looting houses and committing human rights
abuses, including torture, in Bissau, according to the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   Portuguese humanitarian organizations alleged Thursday that
France was backing the Senegalese military effort in Guinea-Bissau
by deploying weaponry and support troops in southern Senegal, close
to the Guinea-Bissau border.
	   ``There's no doubt about France's involvement in the conflict,''
said Fatima Proenca, who represents four aid groups working in
Guinea-Bissau, after meeting with Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio.
	   Eyewitnesses reported French troop movements in the southern
Casamance region of Senegal just across Guinea-Bissau's northern
border, she said.
	   Senegal was preventing aid from crossing into Guinea-Bissau
where the fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people who
require urgent food and medical aid, she said.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering
group Asea Brown Boveri said Thursday it has received dlrs 160

German court allows parents to name son Speedy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ While warning he may get teased later
in life, a German court gave its permission Thursday for the
parents of a newborn boy to name him Ralf Speedy.
	   While the Karlsruhe state court acknowledged that Speedy is not
normally known as a first name in Germany, it said fantasy names
can sometimes be acceptable. And since Speedy is preceded by Ralf,
there would be no confusion about the sex of the child _ another
main concern.
	   At the same time, the court warned that Ralf Speedy might be
teased by his playmates when he gets older, even though Speedy,
known through the cartoon figure ``Speedy Gonzalez,'' carried no
negative connotations.
	   The court also noted a tendency in recent years to allow more
freedom in naming children in Germany, citing instances where baby
girls were allowed to be name Uragano-Mary and Prestige, and a boy
named Roi.
	   In Speedy's case, the parents sought a court ruling after the
birth registry office hesitated to accept the parents' name choice.

Israel blocks roads in Gaza Strip, Palestinians protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Israeli army stationed armed
personnel carriers to block Palestinian cars from using roads in
the Gaza Strip Thursday, after a Palestinian convoy blocked an
Israeli controlled coastal route up the strip.
	   A statement from the Israeli army said the incident began after
22 Palestinian vehicles illegally tried to use the coastal road
earlier Thursday.
	   Israel said it informed the convoy that only those carrying
Israeli issued VIP permits could use the road, but others refused
to turn back and blocked the path.
	   ``Now there is a situation of intentional disturbances in
different intersections in the strip caused by the Palestinian
police,'' the statement said.
	   But Palestinian officials blamed Israel.
	   ``This is all because Israel prevented Palestinians from using
the sea road,'' said a senior Palestinian officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``The situation is tense and Israel is responsible for this,''
he said.
	   Palestinian cars were backed up for several kilometers (miles)
at the Kfar Darom junction, controlled by Israel, which links the
Palestinian cities of Gaza and Khan Younis.
	   One Palestinian man attempted to drive through the roadblock but
was turned back by Israeli troops at the area.
	   Palestinian officials said Israel had blocked roads near the
Jewish settlements of Morag and Netzanim and have halted joint
patrols with their forces.
	   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority gained autonomy over most
of the strip after signing a 1993 peace agreement with Israel.
However Israeli troops still control areas in the strip around
several small Jewish settlements in addition to Gaza's borders.

Annan: All Nigerian political prisoners will be freed

between 250 and 2580 political prisoners still held. Picks up 11th

 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
announced Thursday that ``the stage is set'' for the release of all
of Nigeria's political prisoners, including Moshood Abiola, the
nation's leading opposition figure.
	   ``I'm leaving Nigeria with the stage set for the release of all
political detainees,'' Annan said. ``All political detainees will
be released and the government will make an announcement at the
appropriate time.''
	   Annan confirmed that he met with Abiola on Tuesday and said he
was in good health and alert.
	   Abiola, 60, was elected president of Nigeria in 1993 in an
election annulled by Nigeria's military regime. The junta, led by
Gen. Sani Abacha, jailed Abiola a year later when he declared
himself president.
	   Annan said Abiola had decided to relinquish his claim to the
presidency and cooperate with Nigeria's junta in preparing for a
peaceful transition to democracy.
	   ``I found him more realistic than some of us outside, Chief
Abiola realizes that a lot has changed,'' Annan said. Annan said
Abiola's first priority upon leaving prison is to rebuild his life
and then determine what political support he still has after more
than four years in prison.
	   Abiola's fortune, and his personal life, have suffered deeply
during his imprisonment. Two of his many wives have died since he
was imprisoned _ one in an assassination-style slaying _ and his
business empire has largely collapsed.
	   Just a few years ago Abiola's fortune was estimated in the
hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses stretching from
newspapers to shipping. Now, it is believed to to be just a tiny
fraction of what it was.
	   Annan's news thrilled Abiola's family.
	   ``We're very happy that my father is coming home at last after
four years of unjustified and inhumane treatment and
incarceration,'' his daughter Wura Abiola said in an interview in
London.
	   But she said it was too soon to predict his future plans, saying
he wants, ``time to reflect and to make the right decision for
Nigeria going forward.''
	   Some Nigerian dissidents, though, remained unimpressed.
	   ``Until all the remaining all the prisoners are released
unconditionally, it's only then that we can appraise the
seriousness of the regime,'' said Gani Fawehinmi, a fiery Lagos
lawyer and ardent critic of the junta.
	   Nigeria's Council of State, meanwhile, which effectively
functions as the country's cabinet, was meeting Thursday afternoon
to discuss the releases. Later Thursday or early Friday the
Provision Ruling Council _ the core of Nigeria's junta leaders _
will also meet, apparently to rubber stamp the releases.
	   An estimated 250 and 280 political prisoners are believed to be
held across Nigeria. All are held in regular prisons except for
Abiola _ who is being held in relative comfort at a government
guest house in Abuja.

Take it all, Lebanese civil servant tells boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A simmering feud in the Information
Ministry took a comic turn Thursday when Lebanon learnt that the
top civil servant was being unusually generous toward his minister.
	   Information Minister Bassem al-Sabei has been at loggerheads
with the ministry's director-general, Mohammed Obeid, for more than
a year.
	   What had contained their struggle was the spirit of
power-sharing that characterizes a government in which the prime
minister, parliamentary speaker, and president all lead separate
political factions.
	   Matters began to spin out of control on Monday when Obeid told a
press conference that the government had broken the law by
sidelining the committee of broadcasting regulations, which he
heads.
	   Al-Sabei, an ally of the prime minister, reacted swiftly. He
sent a letter to Obeid, an ally of the speaker, saying he would
lose half of his monthly salary for exceeding his authority.
	   Obeid's response was worthy of the British TV comedy, ``Yes,
Minister.''
	   In an interview with Thursday's edition of The Daily Star, he
said: ``To spare the minister the trouble of the many bureaucratic
formalities involved in halving my salary, I will donate my entire
salary of 1.4 million pounds (dlrs 930) to the minister.''

New Lloyd Webber musical opens to mixed reviews
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Whistle Down the Wind,'' Andrew Lloyd Webber's
first new musical in five years, has opened to mixed reviews some
18 months after the composer-producer pulled the plug on a
different version of the same show on its way to Broadway.
	   ``Is it a hit? Who cares. It's very, very good,'' Michael
Coveney in The Daily Mail wrote Thursday of the show, which marks
Lloyd Webber's first collaboration with Grammy-winning American
songwriter Jim Steinman (``Bat Out of Hell''), here functioning as
lyricist.
	   Benedict Nightingale in The Times of London praised the show's
central figure _ a convict on the run whom several children
mistakenly take to be Jesus Christ reborn in 1959 Louisiana _ as
``one of the more memorable of Lloyd Webber's damaged monsters,''
which include the Phantom in ``Phantom of the Opera'' and silent
movie diva Norma Desmond in ``Sunset Boulevard.''
	   Less impressed was The Guardian's Michael Billington, who called
the musical ``so much piffle down the wind.''
	   Nicholas de Jongh in The Evening Standard gave the show a black
``X'' _ the paper's lowest rating _ concluding, ```Whistle' just
echoes with anemic boisterousness.''
	   Lloyd Webber, 50, has a lot riding on this show. Not only has he
not had a smash hit this decade, but ``Whistle'' marks his return
to active producing of his shows following the departure last year
from his Really Useful Group of longtime business associate Patrick
McKenna.
	   Coveney is writing a biography of Lloyd Webber. Nightingale's
son, Christopher, is the show's musical director.

Health of French hostages in Somalia deteriorates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ One of two Frenchmen kidnapped early
last month in northeastern Somalia is seriously ill and the other
is on a hunger strike, a witness said by radio Thursday.
	   The witness is one of the elders who have been seeking the
release of the Frenchmen kidnapped June 5 off Alula, about 200
kilometers (124 miles) east of the northeastern Somali town of
Bossaso.
	   The elder, who asked that he not be identified, said the
Frenchmen were pale and frightened when he saw them early this
week.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the late dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991. The country has broken into
fiefdoms protected by clan militia and only elders and Muslim
clergymen have been successful in peacefully settling disputes.
	   The Frenchmen, who have not been identified, were captured as
they sailed in the Gulf of Aden. Their kidnappers are demanding
dlrs 75,000 for their release and have moved them to a remote
mountain hideout, the elder said.
	   Earlier, the elders were thinking of an armed rescue to release
the hostages and deter would-be kidnappers, but the plan was
abandoned for fear the Frenchmen might be killed, the elder said.
	   Piracy is common in the region where the Frenchmen were
kidnapped.

Novotna, Tauziat reach final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Novotna beating Hingis &QL; 
 &UR; STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Jana Novotna, best remembered for
sobbing on the Duchess of Kent's shoulder in 1993, beat defending
champion Martina Hingis in straight sets Thursday to reach the
Wimbledon final for the third time.
	   In a rematch of last year's championship match, Novotna came
from behind in both sets to win 6-4, 6-4 and send the top-seeded
Hingis to her second straight semifinal defeat in a Grand Slam.
	   The third-seeded Novotna, runnerup in 1993 and 1997, will be a
big favorite in Saturday's final against Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Tauziat recovered from a horrible start to beat Natasha Zvereva
1-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3, becoming the first French woman to reach the
Wimbledon final in 73 years.
	   The presence of Novotna, 29, and Tauziat, 30, in the final
represents a stunning victory for the old guard of women's tennis
over the new.
	   Hingis, 17, was the last of the teen-age stars in the draw. The
Williams sisters, 16-year-old Serena and 18-year-old Venus, lost
earlier and 17-year-old Anna Kournikova missed the tournament with
an injury.
	   Hingis, at 16 years, nine months, became the youngest women's
Wimbledon champion of the Open era last year. But this time, she
was outplayed in all phases by Novotna, her doubles partner.
	   It was Novotna's first win over Hingis after a run of four
defeats.

World Cup: Crackdown on child labor in Pakistan put under question
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fears are growing that an attempt to stamp out
underage labor in the production of soccer balls in Pakistan might
increase child poverty.
	   A group representing 62 leading sports equipment brands _
including Adidas, Mitre, Nike and Reebok _ said Thursday that their
suppliers in Sialkot, Pakistan, will aim to centralize all
production in factories by March 1999 to cut down on child labor.
	   But there are concerns that moving the manufacturing out of
homes and into factories will mean that such work will only be
available to people, normally men, who can travel into towns.
	   ``Programs like this are a catastrophe for the family if they
don't substitute for the loss of earnings. If local people had been
consulted, I am sure there would have been some different ideas,''
said Asha de Souza, Swiss national coordinator of the Global March
Against Child Labor, which was completed in Geneva in June.
	   Seventy percent of the world's soccer balls are made in the
Sialkot region. Currently about 25 percent of the balls are made in
factories, a figure that suppliers aim to increase to 50 percent in
September and 100 percent by March.
	   The World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI) said
the move is aimed at stamping out child labor _ defined as work by
people under the age of 14.
	   ``It's an efficient way of reducing child labor. But the result
is to reduce overall family income,'' de Souza said. ``Workers are
still paid a very small proportion of the profits for their work.
They should be paid a living wage.''
	   The WCSGI declined to say how much it pays workers in Sialkot.
	   But David Husselbee, Pakistan Country Director of the Save the
Children Fund (UK), said that workers there earn about 60 cents for
every ball stitched.
	   Workers normally sew three balls per day, said Faiz Shah,
director of Saga City, a Sialkot manufacturer of soccer balls.
	   ``We are concerned at overhasty action,'' Husselbee said. ``Most
workers need money for basic needs like shelter and food. So they
need another income-generating option.''
	   Sialkot employs about 24,000 full-time soccer ball workers. But
the industry is seasonal; between November and March employment
rises to 70,000.
	   ``It's during this period that children can become involved,''
Shah said.
	   Kari Tapiola, Deputy Director General of the International Labor
Organization, said that he supported the project in Sialkot, but
added that work needs to be done to improve the educational and
social conditions of the local population.
	   ``You can't simply take people out of the production process,''
Tapioli said. ``The population has to be provided with a viable
alternative. We have to avoid a situation where good intentions
have other less desirable results.''
	   ``Consumers are demanding an end to child labor immediately,''
de Souza said. ``Companies can't take a gradual approach because
they fear the bad publicity. They succumb to consumer pressure to
simplistically.''

Poland's former police chief buried week after murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's former national police chief was
buried in his home town Thursday, a week after he was found shot to
death outside his apartment.
	   Marek Papala, 39, Poland's police chief for 12 months ending in
January, was found June 25, shot in the head in his car, outside
the apartment house he lived in.
	   Hundreds of residents of the town of Pruchnik, Papala's
hometown, 300 kilometers (186 miles) southeast of Warsaw, and
government representatives gathered to give last honors to the
former police chief.
	   Investigators have not yet determined a motive for the murder.
Revenge by an organized criminal gang or by someone fired by Papala
are among two versions speculated on by the local press.

Sicilian volcano calmer after day of spewing lava
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) _ Mount Etna calmed down Thursday, a day
after a series of minor eruptions from the volcano, which has been
active on and off since January.
	   The Institute of Volcanology in Catania, eastern Sicily, said
the latest eruptions, although spectacular to see, especially in
the night sky, were part of normal activity for the volcano.
	   On June 14, the crater area was declared off-limits to tourists
after the volcano belched chunks of lava.
	   Since January, lava has been running down the southeast slope.
	   Etna's last major eruption came six years ago.

Airbus closing gap with Boeing: U.S. Airways to buy 30 more planes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. ADDS new quotes, TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos PAR102-4
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In another blow to Boeing, U.S. Airways said
Thursday it was ordering its first 30 wide-body jetliners from
Airbus. It was the latest coup for the European consortium vying to
depose the U.S. jet-maker as the world leader.
	   The order was the first by a U.S. airline for wide-body Airbus
jets and followed new orders from Air France and Spain's Iberia.
Airbus was also reportedly close to breaking Boeing's grip on sales
to British Airways.
	   An expanding U.S. Airways, which has already has placed orders
of more than 400 Airbus planes _ 125 of them firm _ is to buy up to
30 wide-body A330-300s.
	   ``U.S. Airways will have the most modern fleet in the air within
just a few years time,'' U.S. Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf told a
joint news conference with Airbus Managing Director Noel Forgeard.
	   Asked about not buying American, Wolf responded: ``This doesn't
brand me as an American turncoat. It brands me as a global
businessman.'' He noted he plans to buy U.S.-made Pratt and Whitney
engines.
	   The agreement, which came as Boeing struggles with production
snarls, includes firm orders for seven of the planes, seven more
subject to confirmation, and options on 16 others.
	   ``We plan to take all 30 aircraft,'' Wolf affirmed.
	   Wolf said they picked Airbus over Boeing because the A330s had
``slightly better cargo and passenger capability,'' as well as a
better ``economic package.''
	   The deal was valued at dlrs 3.7 billion based on the list price,
but Wolf said Airbus settled for a lower undisclosed figure.
	   Delivery of the first plane is scheduled for the first quarter
of next year, officials told the news conference. Another six are
scheduled for the year 2000.
	   The order came a day after Airbus said Air France signed for 40
planes, half of them firm orders.
	   Airbus was also negotiating a deal to sell at least 70 planes to
British Airways, an industry source has said. The airline is the
last major European carrier never to order an Airbus.
	   ``We are in tough negotiations,'' Forgeard said.
	   British Airways was expected to discuss the order during a board
meeting Friday.
	   The sale also comes on the heels of Airbus' largest-ever
European order: 76 single-aisle A320s and A321s to Spain's Iberia
to replace aging Boeing 727s and DC9s.
	   Until now, Boeing has held a 60-40 market share lead over
Airbus, but it's shrinking fast. Some analysts have put the figure
at 55-45, or closer.
	   ``The latest orders bring parity'' between Airbus and Boeing on
the world jetliner market, said Paul Beaver of the influential
Jane's Information Group that watches the aerospace and defense
industries.
	   With the sale to U.S. Airways, Airbus claimed they now have 52
percent of the commercial airline market so far this year. The only
time they have posted more than 50 percent over a whole year was in
1994.
	   Boeing was struggling with ``not being able to manufacture
aircraft to the right schedule, not enough personnel, too much
downsizing. That's all coming back to roost,'' Beaver said from
London.
	   Airbus was often beating Boeing in the sale of single-aisle
planes and lighter, computerized fly-by-wire technology. The
consortium is also reorganizing as a private company in order to
issue stock and raise capital for expansion.
	   The jetmaker's planned super jumbo A3XX is a dlrs 9 billion
gamble that airlines will need a 500-seat plane in coming years.
Boeing has bowed out of that race.
	   Airbus is a partnership of France's Aerospatiale, British
Aerospace PLC, Spain's Casa and Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace.

Iran burns dlrs 700 million worth of drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran destroyed 50 tons of drugs Thursday in
a ceremony attended by President Mohammad Khatami, senior officials
and foreign diplomats.
	   Troops lit the bonfire of heroin, opium and morphine, with a
street value of dlrs 700 million, at the foot of the Alborz
mountain, north of the capital Tehran.
	   Among those present was the head of the United Nations' drug
office, Pino Arlacchi, whose spokesman hailed the destruction as a
measure of Iran's commitment to the fight against illegal
narcotics.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran. The country lies along a
route used by smugglers from neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan
to transport opium, hashish and heroin to Gulf Arab states and
beyond.
	   Convicted drug smugglers face the death penalty. Thousands of
people have been hanged since the law was introduced in 1988.

Belarus president shines in new book, written by himself

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Alexander Lukashenko is in the newspapers
nearly every day and on state television every night. Yet the
president of Belarus still felt it necessary to write a book to get
his message across.
	   The book, with a first printing of 100,000, is a collection of
speeches, interviews and articles by and about Lukashenko. It's 39
chapters range from such topics as ``The Situation of Women'' to
``Why is NATO trying to punish Belarus?''
	   Most of the 120-page book is a tribute to Lukashenko, an
authoritarian leader criticized by the West for cracking down on
human rights, but who enjoys broad popular support among
Belarusians who share his nostalgia for Soviet-era stability.
	   Some of the sections are clearly written by Lukashenko, others
are unattributed. In one of the latter sections, a brief biography,
Lukashenko is extolled as everything from a ``wise prophet'' to ``a
man who sees things in the proper perspective.'' He is praised as a
judge and a peacemaker, and is even likened to a village teacher
and an experienced farmer.
	   The book's photographs are no less flattering. They show the
president talking with pensioners, sympathizing with hospital
patients and holding smiling young children bedecked in flowers.
	   Lukashenko uses the book, entitled ``Alexander Lukashenko:
President of the Belarusian Republic,'' to speak out against those
who criticize his crackdown on the media.
	   ``We haven't forcibly closed a single newspaper,'' he writes.
``Not a single journalist has been harassed. I will always defend
those people who belong to this esteemed occupation.''
	   And he takes aim at those who would introduce market reforms in
a country that has clung to its Soviet heritage.
	   ``Believe me that all this chaos under the guise of reform is
good for all sorts of swindlers because huge floods of mud are
created and in this cloudy water, one can do whatever one wants to
do.''
	   He includes the praise of many prominent figures, including
Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Alexy II and the speaker of the
lower house of the Russian parliament, Igor Stroyev.
	   He also appeals to Belarusians to continue to support him.
	   ``You understand that without you I have no others to rely on,''
he writes.
	   And then, as if to clear up any misconceptions about himself,
``I have no mafia clan, no party, and none of the money that is
mentioned in anonymous reports.''

WIMBLEDON: four defeats.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   After Hingis netted a backhand return on match point, Novotna
dropped to one knee, pumped her fist and patted the ground. She
stood, held up her arms and bowed and blew kisses as the Centre
Court crowd gave her a standing ovation.
	   Novotna has been a sentimental favorite here ever since the 1993
final, when she blew a 4-1 lead in the third set against Steffi
Graf and cried on the Duchess' shoulder.
	   While the first semifinal was devoid of drama and compelling
tennis, the Novotna-Hingis match featured sparkling points and
lived up its billing as the ``real final.''
	   Novotna lost the first nine points of the match and fell behind
3-0. Hingis had four break points to go up 4-0, but Novotna saved
them all. She won seven of eight games to win the first set and go
up 1-0 in the second.
	   Hingis became increasingly frustrated, tossing her racket into
the net and banging the top of the net with her racket. Novotna,
meanwhile, was shouting and pumping her fist after winners.
	   Hingis recovered and took a 3-2 lead, with three break points in
the sixth game. Again, Novotna saved them all. Hingis saved four
break points of her own in the next game, including two with aces,
and led 4-3.
	   But that was Hingis' last game as Novotna won three straight.
After breaking for 5-4 with a leaping backhand volley smash,
Novotna served out the match at love.
	   By far the most dramatic moment of the first semifinal was
Tauziat's reaction after winning the match.
	   When Zvereva sailed a return long on match point, she let out a
shriek, threw her racket in the air, flopped onto her back and
covered her face with her hands. She then slapped the grass with
her hand.

	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri decorated Jean-Jacques Fresard, a
Swiss, with the High National Order of Cedars in the Rank of
Officer at a special ceremony at the premier's office. The award is
one of Lebanon's highest honors.
	   ``You worked hard and in silence and we cooperated during those
past nine months for solving this problem which was of particular
difficulty for us,'' Hariri told Fresard.
	   Fresard was the main intermediary in the long negotiations that
led to Israel's return of the bodies of 40 Lebanese guerrillas and
the release of 60 prisoners held in its jails in exchange for the
remains of an Israeli soldier.
	   Last week, Fresard accompanied the remains of Israeli Sgt.
Itamar Ilya, who was killed in a botched commando raid in southern
Lebanon last September. He returned on the same French military
plane with the coffins of 40 Lebanese guerrillas.
	   Fresard then led a convoy of 60 prisoners who were released from
Israeli detention and handed over to Lebanese authorities in
southern Lebanon.
	   In Israel Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called
French President Jacques Chirac to thank him for his help in
securing the swap, Netanyahu's office said in a statement. Chirac
had discussed the deal with Lebanese officials during his visit to
Beirut in May and acted as guarantor of the exchange.

EU Commission proposes tougher law to fight tax evasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission on Thursday put forward a proposal aimed at
strengthening an EU-wide law to help fight tax evasion in the
15-nation bloc.
	   The proposal is aimed at catching people who evade tax claims
established in one EU country by moving, or by transferring their
assets to another EU country, the Commission said in a statement.
	   ``Greater cooperation between national tax administrations is
the only solution to this problem,'' said the EU's Taxation
Commissioner Mario Monti.
	   The proposal would update a 1976 law that requires each EU
country to collect taxes due to any other EU country on request.
	   But the existing law is ``little used and largely ineffective,''
the Commission said.
	   The Commission proposes to strengthen guarantees that each EU
country will treat tax claims by other EU countries in the same way
as it treats its own.
	   It also proposes to widen the scope of the law to cover direct
taxes, fines and a broader range of EU customs duties.
	   The 1976 law originally covered only EU agricultural levies and
customs duties. It was later amended to cover value added tax and
excise duties as well.
	   The Commission proposal ``will better safeguard national and
European Union financial interests while reassuring honest
taxpayers everywhere in Europe that non-payers won't get away with
it in future,'' Monti said.
	   The proposals must be approved by EU countries.

Novotna, Tauziat reach final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous; will be updates with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Jana Novotna, best remembered for
sobbing on the Duchess of Kent's shoulder in 1993, beat defending
champion Martina Hingis in straight sets Thursday to reach the
Wimbledon final.
	   In a rematch of last year's championship match, Novotna came
from behind in both sets to win 6-4, 6-4 and send the top-seeded
Hingis to her second straight semifinal defeat in a Grand Slam.
	   The third-seeded Novotna, runnerup in 1993 and 1997, will be a
big favorite in Saturday's final against Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Tauziat recovered from a horrible start to beat Natasha Zvereva
1-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3, becoming the first French woman to reach the
Wimbledon final in 73 years.
	   The presence of Novotna, 29, and Tauziat, 30, in the final
represents a stunning victory for the old guard of women's tennis
over the new.
	   Hingis, 17, was the last of the teen-age stars in the draw. The
Williams sisters, 16-year-old Serena and 18-year-old Venus, lost
earlier and 17-year-old Anna Kournikova missed the tournament with
an injury.
	   Hingis, at 16 years, nine months, became the youngest women's
Wimbledon champion of the Open era last year. But this time, she
was outplayed in all phases by Novotna, her doubles partner.
	   It was Novotna's first win over Hingis after a run of four
defeats.
	   After Hingis netted a backhand return on match point, Novotna
dropped to one knee, pumped her fist and patted the ground. She
stood, held up her arms and bowed and blew kisses as the Centre
Court crowd gave her a standing ovation.
	   Novotna has been a sentimental favorite here ever since the 1993
final, when she blew a 4-1 lead in the third set against Steffi
Graf and cried on the Duchess' shoulder.
	   While the first semifinal was devoid of drama and compelling
tennis, the Novotna-Hingis match featured sparkling points and
lived up its billing as the ``real final.''
	   Novotna lost the first nine points of the match and fell behind
3-0. Hingis had four break points to go up 4-0, but Novotna saved
them all. She won seven of eight games to win the first set and go
up 1-0 in the second.
	   Hingis became increasingly frustrated, tossing her racket into
the net and banging the top of the net with her racket. Novotna,
meanwhile, was shouting and pumping her fist after winners.
	   Hingis recovered and took a 3-2 lead, with three break points in
the sixth game. Again, Novotna saved them all. Hingis saved four
break points of her own in the next game, including two with aces,
and led 4-3.
	   But that was Hingis' last game as Novotna won three straight.
After breaking for 5-4 with a leaping backhand volley smash,
Novotna served out the match at love.
	   By far the most dramatic moment of the first semifinal was
Tauziat's reaction after winning the match.
	   When Zvereva sailed a return long on match point, she let out a
shriek, threw her racket in the air, flopped onto her back and
covered her face with her hands. She then slapped the grass with
her hand.
	   On Friday, Centre Court will reverberate with ``Henmania'' as
Britain, still mourning England's loss to Argentina in the World
Cup, pulls for Tim Henman to go where no homegrown male has
ventured in 60 years.
	   ``It's safe to say it's my favorite court,'' Henman said. ``When
you've got 15,000 people cheering you on and willing you on, it
gives you a buzz.''
	   Henman will face defending champion Pete Sampras, who knows he
won't have many supporters.
	   ``Playing Tim here in England, it will be tough,'' he said.
	   But Sampras has faced similar situations _ playing Boris Becker
in Germany.
	   ``Hopefully, you can put the crowd out of the match,'' he said.
``You've still got to play. It's still one on one. Tim is going to
have some emotional support behind him, but you have to play and I
feel like I'm playing well.''
	   Henman is playing more than just the No. 1 player, the man who
has won Wimbledon four of the last five years and who hasn't
dropped a set in his tournament.
	   Henman is also carrying the burden of history. By beating Petr
Korda in Wednesday's quarters, he became the first British man to
make the semifinals since Roger Taylor in 1973.
	   Now the 23-year-old is aiming to become the first Brit to reach
the final since Henry Austin in 1938 and the first to win the title
since Fred Perry in 1936.
	   ``I wasn't born when Taylor got to the semis,'' he said. ``I
don't want to stop at the semis now.''
	   The other men's semifinal will feature two of the game's biggest
servers _ Richard Krajicek and Goran Ivanisevic.
	   Despite a swollen knee, Krajicek is playing as well as when he
won the title in 1996. The big surprise is Ivanisevic, a former
two-time finalist who had won only one match in his last five Grand
Slam tournaments.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bobby Charlton, who won the World Cup with England
in 1966, doesn't think Brazil will win a fifth title at France 98.
	   ``I think almost any team can win it, but I try to look a little
deeper and I find the team with the most desire,'' said the former
Manchester United star, who played 106 times for England and scored
a national record 49 goals.
	   ``Brazil have expectation rather than desire. Argentina and
France have desire. I think that from those two will come the
winner.''
	   Charlton is at the tournament to promote one of the sponsors,
MasterCard, as well as England's candidature to play host to the
2006 World Cup.
	   ``Germany have had an easy route, it seems to be, and can only
get better,'' the former England sharpshooter said.
	   ``Italy, without a fully fit Alessandro Del Piero, cannot win
the World Cup. Christian Vieri has played well, but Del Piero isn't
playing well yet because I don't think he's back to full fitness.
He's such a vital player because he's a playmaker as well as a
scorer.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ French top-scorer Thierry Henry
remains doubtful for Friday's quarterfinal against Italy because of
a sprained left ankle.
	   Henry, who has scored three goals so far, was unable to train
Thursday morning and the rain made it unlikely he would test his
tender ankle later in the day. French coach Aime Jacquet will
announce his lineup to his players only hours before the
afternoon's kickoff at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis.
	   ``He didn't train so there is still a little uncertainty. Henry
has no pain though,'' said Jacquet.
	   Henry was the only injury worry Jacquet had to deal with
Thursday after midfielder Emmanuel Petit and goalkeeper Fabien
Barthez recovered from minor strains.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TAKMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Even with an presidential election
looming, Cambodian politicians prefer to break off their campaigns
to watch the World Cup.
	   Hen Sen, confident of an election victory, even hurried away
from a news conference to make sure he got home in time to see a
game.
	   ``Now it's time to watch the World Cup,'' he told reporters.
``At the least, I record it so I can watch the matches later.''
	   Speaking to reporters at his home outside Phnom Penh, Hun Sen
picked his favorite for soccer's ultimate prize.
	   ``It may be a little premature to say, but I have strong belief
in Brazil,'' he said. ``Brazil, France, Argentina and Italy may
advance to the semifinals, and Brazil might have the best chance.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Be careful what you say about the referee at all
times. Even things said after the game can land you a two match
ban.
	   After the Romania-Croatia World Cup game on June 30, Argentine
referee Javier Castrilli reported that Romanian forward Gheorge
Craioveanu had insulted him after the final whistle.
	   So, on Thursday, FIFA's disciplinary committee suspended
Craioveanu for two matches and fined him 5,000 Swiss francs (dlrs
3,300).
	   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said the committee normally takes
only a day to decide disciplinary matters after a match. But,
because Craioveanu's remarks were made after the match had ended,
they were not in the play report. A separate report had to be filed
before the committee could issue the fine and suspension.
	   Romania is out of this World Cup after its 1-0 loss to Croatia
in the second round, but the ban will carry over to the qualifying
rounds for the 2000 European Championship.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ When blue meets blue, someone will have to give.
	   The Italian ``Squadra Azzuri'' meet the ``Les Bleus'' of France
in the World Cup quarterfinals on Friday. Traditionally, both teams
play in similar outfits with blue shirts and white shorts.
	   So FIFA announced Wednesday that Les Bleus would become ``Les
Blancs'', playing in all white for the occasion. Italy will play in
blue shirts, shorts and socks.

Diplomatic observers to start patrolling war-torn province

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's top official said Thursday
that diplomats must have the lead in trying to stem Kosovo's
violence and foreign countries prepared to do just that, assembling
a monitoring team for the strife-torn province.
	   As Secretary-General Javier Solana made a case for diplomatic _
not military _ action to obtain a cease-fire, the U.S. Embassy in
Belgrade announced the formation of a monitoring mission, made up
of American, Russian, Austrian and Polish diplomats.
	   The mission would begin its work in Kosovo next Monday, said a
U.S. Embassy statement. Among its tasks will be observing freedom
of motion.
	   Such freedom is hampered both by Serb police blocking access to
regions where anti-guerrilla operations are in process, and Kosovo
Albanian fighters extending their grip in the central part of the
Serbian province.
	   In a separate diplomatic effort, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
planned to meet Friday in Belgrade with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, the main force behind the Serb crackdown on Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian independence fighters.
	   Solana, who spoke in Sarajevo before leaving for Tirana,
Albania, said NATO forces, which staged a display of air power in
the region last month, are continuing their preparations for
possible further action.
	   ``The situation we had in Bosnia should not be repeated,'' he
said. ``The international community will not allow that to
happen.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have been pressing for military
intervention to halt the months-long campaign by Serb security
forces to crush militant resistance in the secessionist province of
Serbia, populated predominantly by Albanians.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanians' leader, said after meeting
a visiting delegation of U.S. congressional staffers Thursday that
the latest Serb actions are ``aimed at ethnically cleansing
Kosovo.''
	   Officials in Serb-led Yugoslavia maintain the action is aimed at
wiping out ``terrorists'' and restoring order to the restive
province. They also accuse the Kosovo Liberation Army of attacks on
Serb civilians.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the KLA.
But they did agree to meet again Sunday to try to meld the
guerrilla struggle with their nonviolent independence campaign.
	   In an indication of how compelling the need to enlist the
guerrillas has become, Rugova also participated in the meeting.
Previously he has refused to cooperate with the armed insurgents,
preaching nonviolence as the only way to achieve independence.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule.
	   Backing off its demand for an immediate pullback of Serb forces
in Kosovo, the U.S. government now says there probably will have to
be a cease-fire before Milosevic withdraws the special units that
have cracked down on Albanian militants and civilians.
	   The shift was Washington's second major move in the past week to
try to revitalize its diplomatic approach to the Kosovo conflict.
The other step was opening talks with the KLA.
	   Among the Thursday's flash points, reported by Serb or ethnic
Albanian sources, were a clash Thursday in Kijevo _ a Serb village
west of Pristina that KLA guerrillas surrounded last month, and
attacks on Serb villages around Klina, some 50 kilometers (30
miles) west of Pristina.
	   In Pristina, the Kosovo Information Center, close to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said Albanian fighters
remained in control of Belacevac village, near the strategically
important coal mine west of Pristina.
	   The Serbs claimed to have retaken the mine on Tuesday, after two
days of intense fighting and reporters subsequently saw Serb armor
and troops in Belacevac. But the center said the KLA still held the
town itself, despite a Serb siege.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources also reported fighting in the Decani
region close to the Albanian border, with Serb forces shelling
eight villages. None of the reports could be confirmed.

Nerve-cell transplant may offer hope to stroke victims

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Nineteen years ago, Vickie Scott was fresh out
of nursing school, newly married and a recreational jogger. Then
she suffered a massive stroke and her world fell apart.
	   Left partly paralyzed, she had to relearn things most people
take for granted: talking, speaking, moving. Now she is hopeful
doctors might one day erase the last traces of her disability by
transplanting laboratory-grown human nerve cells into her brain.
	   Doctors at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center announced
Wednesday that they had done such an implant into the brain of a
62-year-old woman, hoping to restore movement to her right arm and
leg and help her regain her speech loss, all caused by a stroke.
	   The transplanted cells came from a tumor and were chemically
altered for more than a decade. Experts, however, said the work was
highly experimental and cautioned against concluding that it was a
breakthrough.
	   The procedure, which was performed June 23, launches a small
study _ just 12 patients _ of stroke treatment. Because there is no
known cure, doctors usually focus on prevention and therapy to
minimize damage.
	   ``Once the deficit is there and has been fixed, there is very
little that we have to offer,'' said Dr. Douglas Kondziolka, who
performed the implant on Alma Cerasini. ``This treatment at least
offers the hope that we will be able to help people with
deficits.''
	   Stroke is the United States' No. 3 killer, after heart disease
and cancer. Of the 700,000 Americans who suffer stroke every year,
many are left permanently disabled. Strokes are an economic
disaster, too: They cost dlrs 41 billion a year.
	   The lab-grown cells used in the operation originated with cells
from a 22-year-old man's testicular tumor that was removed in the
1970s.
	   Scientists discovered that the cells could be chemically induced
to mature into non-dividing nerve cells capable of assuming
different functions, depending on where they are placed in the
brain.
	   In rats who suffered induced strokes and had a similar operation
at the University of South Florida, stroke damage was reversed,
said Dr. Paul Sanberg, who conducted those experiments.
	   Layton BioScience Inc., a small Atherton, Calif.-based company,
patented the process that transforms the cancer cells and grew 2
million neuron cells that were sent to Pittsburgh.
	   Doctors injected the cells into three different spots in Ms.
Cerasini's brain. She is at home ``doing fine'' and will have
weekly checkups to measure her progress, Kondziolka said.
	   Some experts weren't as enthusiastic about the procedure.
	   ``People should not think we are on the threshold of repairing
brains after stroke. Because we aren't,'' said Dr. Joseph
Broderick, a neurologist at the University of Cincinnati and member
of the American Heart Association's stroke council.
	   ``It's pretty simplistic to think that you can put a few cells
in and a whole network would be restored,'' he said.
	   Mrs. Scott, a 42-year-old mother of two, isn't eligible for the
first part of the study because she has regained mobility. She's
interested in qualifying later and dreams of going back to work as
an anesthesiology nurse.
	   ``I've been praying for this,'' she said. ``I'm just not
concerned about the risk. I want to get back to where I was.''

Government's decision to grant visa to turncoat sparks commotion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The government's decision this
week to issue a visa to the country's most well-known turncoat in
the colonial war has angered veterans.
	   At the center of all the fanfare is Johannes Poncke Princen, 72,
a former conscript who deserted a Dutch army unit battling
insurgents in 1947 in what was then the Dutch East Indies colony,
now Indonesia.
	   He joined the rebels and was later decorated for his service to
the insurgency.
	   Princen, who still lives in Indonesia, applied for the visa to
visit his family in the Netherlands next week.
	   A veteran said the visa approval was ``beneath all decency.''
	   ``Princen remains a murderer of Dutch soldiers,'' L. Dijkema,
the chairman of the Dutch-Indonesian Veterans Society, was quoted
as saying by the Amsterdam daily Het Parool in Thursday's editions.
	   The request was granted by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van
Mierlo who said it is understandable that Princen's visit ``evokes
painful memories and emotions'' among war veterans.
	   But Van Mierlo added: ``Refusing a visa application ... is an
improper means of accommodating those feelings.''
	   After the war, Princen became a human rights activist in
Indonesia and was imprisoned several times for his views.
	   His visit to the Netherlands four years ago also riled veterans
and sparked protests.

U.N. sends diplomatic team to insurgency-wracked Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations will send a panel of
high-ranking international diplomats to Algeria to look into the
violence that has wracked the country for six years, U.N. officials
announced Thursday.
	   The Algerian government invited the team to come and has ensured
it ``free and complete access to all sources of information,'' U.N.
spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said Thursday.
	   The government in the North African nation has been battling a
Muslim insurgency since January 1992, when the regime canceled
parliamentary elections that an Islamic party was poised to win.
Since then, the conflict has killed an estimated 75,000 people.
	   Algerian authorities have been under pressure to allow an
independent inquiry into the violence. Demands for such an inquiry,
from a number of nations, including the United States, and human
rights groups, were spurred by suggestions that the army or
government-armed self-defense forces might have had at least a
passive role in some massacres.
	   The team will be led by former Portuguese President Mario Suares
and will include among others, former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral and the attorney-general of Kenya, Amos Wako.
	   They will go to Algeria as soon as arrangements can be made, and
will report back to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said Brandt.
	   Algeria has been shaken by unrest over the past week by protests
by thousands of people protesting a new Arabic-only law that is set
to go into effect this weekend, as well as the assassination of
popular singer Lounes Matoub last week.

World Cup: FIFA bends rules to let Dutch train in Marseille
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE-CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ FIFA bent its rules a little Thursday
to allow the Dutch World Cup squad to train in Marseille's Stade
Velodrome ahead of Saturday's quarterfinal confrontation with
Argentina.
	   Dutch coach Guus Hiddink told reporters early Thursday that he
had received ``a strange letter from FIFA'' saying that his team
could not train at the ground on Friday. Hiddink pointed out that
the Argentines had been given permission to use the pitch.
	   ``We suddenly get a letter saying we are not welcome in the
stadium, which I find very strange,'' Hiddink said.
	   But FIFA officials cleared up the mystery by explaining that
teams are entitled to train in a match stadium just once _ the
Netherlands practiced at the Stade Velodrome before its June 20
first round match against South Korea.
	   After Hiddink complained, soccer's governing body gave way and
said it would allow the Dutch to train in Marseille after all.
	   Upon hearing the news, a team spokesman said the Dutch might not
show up for the practice session anyway. He said Hiddink might
instead hold the workout at a field closer to the team hotel.

Former Alydar groom convicted of lying to grand jury

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ A former groom was convicted Thursday of lying to
a grand jury investigating the 1990 death of Alydar, one of the
most famous horses in triple Crown history, who was insured for
dlrs 36.5 million.
	   Alydar was the most heavily insured thoroughbred in history and
was collateral on a dlrs 20.5 million loan from the First City
Bancorporation.
	   Alton Stone was convicted of two counts of making a false
statement to a grand jury that was investigating whether Alydar's
death was engineered to collect the insurance money.
	   The charges involved questions about why he replaced the horse's
regular watchman at Calumet Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and how he
discovered Alydar's injury.
	   Stone appeared before the grand jury appearance during a 1997
investigation into loan activity involving now defunct First City
Bancorporation of Houston. First City, which failed in 1988 and
again in 1992, was Calumet's biggest creditor and received dlrs 20
million from Alydar's insurance payout.
	   Prosecutor Julia Hyman said she was pleased with the verdict.
	   Stone showed no emotion at the verdict and had no comment on the
advice of his attorney, who said he planned to appeal.
	   Stone faces up to five years in prison and a dlrs 250,000 fine
on each count. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 8.
	   Alydar initially broke a leg in a stall on Nov. 13, 1990. Two
days later, he stumbled following surgery, broke another bone and
had to be destroyed.
	   After the death of Alydar, who finished second to Affirmed in
each of the hotly contested 1978 Triple Crown races, Lloyd's of
London and other insurers paid off the claim.
	   Calumet, in turn, paid off its debt to the bank. Nevertheless
the farm, still staggering under more than dlrs 120 million of
debt, soon collapsed. It was sold the following year at auction for
dlrs 17 million.

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Alexander Lukashenko is in the newspapers
nearly every day and on state television every night. Yet the
president of Belarus still felt it necessary to write a book to get
his message across.
	   The book, with a first printing of 100,000, is a collection of
speeches, interviews and articles by and about Lukashenko. It's 39
chapters range from such topics as ``The Situation of Women'' to
``Why is NATO trying to punish Belarus?''
	   Most of the 120-page book is a tribute to Lukashenko, an
authoritarian leader criticized by the West for cracking down on
human rights, but who enjoys broad popular support among
Belarusians who share his nostalgia for Soviet-era stability.
	   Some of the sections are clearly written by Lukashenko, others
are unattributed. In one of the latter sections, a brief biography,
Lukashenko is extolled as everything from a ``wise prophet'' to ``a
man who sees things in the proper perspective.'' He is praised as a
judge and a peacemaker, and is even likened to a village teacher
and an experienced farmer.
	   The book's photographs are no less flattering. They show the
president talking with pensioners, sympathizing with hospital
patients and holding smiling young children bedecked in flowers.
	   Lukashenko uses the book, entitled ``Alexander Lukashenko:
President of the Belarusian Republic,'' to speak out against those
who criticize his crackdown on the media.
	   ``We haven't forcibly closed a single newspaper,'' he writes.
``Not a single journalist has been harassed. I will always defend
those people who belong to this esteemed occupation.''
	   And he takes aim at those who would introduce market reforms in
a country that has clung to its Soviet heritage.
	   ``Believe me that all this chaos under the guise of reform is
good for all sorts of swindlers because huge floods of mud are
created and in this cloudy water, one can do whatever one wants to
do.''
	   He includes the praise of many prominent figures, including
Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Alexy II and the speaker of the
upper house of the Russian parliament, Yegor Stroyev.
	   He also appeals to Belarusians to continue to support him.
	   ``You understand that without you I have no others to rely on,''
he writes.
	   And then, as if to clear up any misconceptions about himself,
``I have no mafia clan, no party, and none of the money that is
mentioned in anonymous reports.''

New York warns of sanctions against Swiss banks over Holocaust-era

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American officials increased the pressure on
Swiss banks on Thursday, with New York City and New York state
threatening to bar short-term investments with the banks, which are
suspected of holding the assets of Holocaust victims.
	   The move comes one day after a commission representing hundreds
of U.S. finance officials cleared the way for sanctions, saying
negotiations between the banks and Holocaust survivors seeking
their families' assets ``reached a total, stone-like impasse,''
said Alan Hevesi, commission chairman. There had been a moratorium
in place before on sanctions.
	   California, a commission member, announced Wednesday it will not
seek new contracts with U.S. subsidiaries of Swiss banks.
	   New York state, which with California has the largest pension
funds linked to Swiss banks, said Thursday that if there is no
settlement by Sept. 1, state and city officials will bar short-term
investments with the banks.
	   The banks and Swiss investment firms will also be forbidden from
selling state and city debt, said Hevesi, who is the New York City
comptroller. If the impasse continues, he said, the bans will be
extended to additional Swiss financial services in November and to
all Swiss companies in January.
	   Other commission members are also taking or considering action.
	   In New Jersey, the legislature is considering a bill that would
require the state to divest some dlrs 66 million in stock invested
with Union Bank of Switzerland until assets are returned to
Holocaust survivors. Vermont, Rhode Island and Kentucky also are
considering the possibility of sanctions.
	   Last year, Massachusetts ended its dlrs 120,000-a-year contract
with Union Bank.
	   Hevesi said he hopes U.S. officials will allow a measured
process of sanctions to give negotiators time to resolve the
issues. That didn't mollify Swiss banking officials.
	   ``The Swiss banks are outraged,'' said Ulrich Pfister, a
spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. ``Sanctions are
unjustified and counterproductive. We will study all measures we
can take against them.''
	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe. But victims' relatives
say bank officials stalled survivors and their heirs after World
War II, claiming they could not find accounts or demanding
nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to relatives of
those who died in concentration camps.
	   Three Swiss banks made a take-it-or-leave-it offer of dlrs 600
million last month. It was rejected by Jewish leaders as being far
less than the dormant wartime assets Holocaust victims say the
banks stole from their families.
	   Melvyn Weiss, lawyer for more than 31,000 plaintiffs in a
lawsuit against Swiss banks, said Jewish groups have proposed a
dlrs 1.5 billion settlement that would cover claims against all
Swiss banks as well as the Swiss government.
	   ``We tried to get the Swiss government involved and bring peace
between these people. And the Swiss government, instead of being
proactive in helping to put this behind us, has been a negative
influence,'' Weiss said.
	   He and other lawyers representing class-action plaintiffs said
their clients are now likely to turn to a lawsuit pending in
federal court in Brooklyn against the Swiss banks. Last year the
banks filed a motion asking a judge to dismiss the charges, but no
decision has been made.
	   Hevesi heads a group that represents about 800 financial
officers of state and municipal governments around the United
States. The moratorium on sanctions had been in effect since last
December. l

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A bus plunged off a mountain road in
northwestern Pakistan on Thursday killing 27 people and injuring
another 15 others, the state-run news agency reported.
	   The death toll was originally reported at 16. The other 11
people died of their injuries in hospital, The Associated Press of
Pakistan reported.
	   The bus apparently was overcrowded with passengers hanging on
the sides and sitting on the roof. The driver reportedly lost
control of the vehicle while trying to negotiate a sharp turn in
the road, said The Associated Press of Pakistan, quoting police
officials in the remote region.
	   The wounded were taken to the nearest hospital in Mansehra, some
200 kilometers (120 miles) northwest of the federal capital of
Islamabad.
	   The accident was under investigation, the police said.

<TEXT>
	   CNN on Thursday retracted its story that the U.S. military used
deadly nerve gas during a Vietnam War-era mission in Laos to kill
American defectors.
	   The news network said its internal investigation concluded that
its joint report with Time magazine, disputed by ``hundreds'' of
veterans and military officials, could not be supported.
	   ``CNN alone bears responsibility for both the television reports
and for the printed article in the June 15 issue of Time
magazine,'' Tom Johnson, chairman of the CNN News Group, said in a
statement read on CNN.
	   ``We apologize to our viewers and to our colleagues at Time for
this mistake. CNN owes a special apology to the personnel involved
in Operation Tailwind, both the soldiers on the ground and the U.S.
Air Force pilots and the U.S. Marine Corps helicopter pilots who
were involved in this action.''
	   CNN had hired attorney Floyd Abrams late last week to conduct an
independent investigation into the charges, and made its statement
today based on his report.
	   Johnson said reporters, producers and executives at CNN bear
responsibility for the mistake, but his statement did not say what
action would be taken against them.
	   The story proved a major embarrassment to CNN/USA President
Richard Kaplan. Launching a series of newsmagazines called
``NewsStand'' was his top programming initiative, and he used the
nerve gas story to attract attention to the series' premiere.
	   ``We acknowledge serious faults in the use of sources who
provided Newstand with the original reports and therefore retract
the Tailwind story,'' Johnson said in his statement.
	   Almost immediately after it was aired, military experts began
disputing the contention that the lethal nerve gas sarin was used
on a Laotian village in 1970, as part of a secret mission to kill
American defectors.
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered an investigation into
the charges, but said there was no evidence that the gas was ever
used.
	   CNN military analyst Perry Smith, a retired major general who
served in Vietnam, called the account ``sleazy journalism'' and
resigned in protest. He said he was not consulted on the story
before it was aired.
	   Retired Adm. Thomas Moorer, a former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, quoted in the report confirming the use of the
nerve gas, later said that he had heard rumors but saw no direct
evidence that the deadly chemical was used.
	   One soldier who was in Laos in 1970 and used in the report,
Robert Van Buskirk, later said that he had repressed all memory of
the events since 1974 before CNN began questioning him about it.
CNN made no mention of the recovered-memory episode.

Anglican priest tells court he had sex with two boys

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement saying priest is sacked. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Anglican priest told a court
Thursday he had oral sex with two street boys, adding he regretted
his actions, his lawyer said.
	   Michael Taylor, 35, said that he was under stress at the time
and the incident came after his parents died, his lawyer Jean
Talupca said after the hearing.
	   The vicar was caught by police and film cameras in an apartment
used by prostitutes in a seedy area of Bucharest last August
wearing only his underpants and sitting next to a naked boy on the
bed.
	   Although he initially pleaded guilty, he then said he was
innocent, claiming he had made a bargain for his release with
police.
	   Judge Tatiana Zorila will likely pronounce the sentence in a
week. Her decision will be published the next day.
	   He faces a jail sentence of two to seven years.
	   Talupca suggested one of the boys was a prostitute, citing three
cases in which the boy was accused of receiving money for sex.
	   Prosecutors accused Taylor, from Essex in eastern England, of
visiting Romania often and being involved in sex tourism, Talupca
said.
	   Taylor did not allow journalists in the courtroom.
	   Character witnesses from England were at the trial and one of
them handed Zorila a batch of support mail, attesting to Taylor's
allegedly good character.
	   Since the fall of communism in 1989 which revealed 100,000
unwanted children languishing in state orphanages, Romania has
attracted foreign pedophiles, who hang around rail stations and
pick up their prey.
	   In a statement, the Bishop of Chelmsford, the Rt. Rev. John
Perry, said that Taylor, who is currently suspended, would be
sacked from his job as a parish priest.
	   ``The church expects the highest standards of its clergy, and I
am greatly saddened that a priest in our diocese should admit to an
offense of this nature,'' said the bishop. `` Any act of abuse
against a child is a matter of great seriousness.''

Government agrees to guarantee loan for helicopter deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government will guarantee a dlrs
1.5 billion loan to purchase 96 attack helicopters to be produced
by U.S. Bell Helicopters Textron and a Romanian company, a senior
military official said Thursday.
	   The contract between Bell and IAR Brasov is expected to be
concluded ``soon,'' said Gen. Nicolae Irimia at a news conference.
No other details on the deal were available.
	   The contract has been widely criticized by the media and some
politicians who said it is too expensive.
	   ``We are not facing such a (military) threat to ask the
population for this sacrifice,'' said Petre Roman, head of the
parliament upper chamber, the Senate.
	   In 1997, Bell signed a pre-contract for a 70 percent stake in
IAR Brasov but said the Romanian army must buy 96 AH1RO Dracula
helicopters to be produced by IAR Brasov.
	   Gen. Nicolae Irimia said the government allowed the state
company Romtehnica, which handled the army transactions, to launch
bonds on the international markets in order to get the loan.
	   Irimia said the 96 helicopters will be purchased within nine
years. He said ``The Romanian army needs modern equipment.''

Ukrainian health authorities warn of radioactive mushrooms

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Health authorities have warned Ukrainians
not to buy mushrooms and berries from street vendors in Kiev
because they may have been grown in areas contaminated by the
Chernobyl nuclear explosion.
	   The start of summer has seen the arrival of blueberries and
chanterelle mushrooms at outdoor markets in the Ukrainian capital.
The forest delicacies are mostly picked by elderly people seeking
to supplement their diets and their often meager pensions.
	   But health authorities said in televised warnings this week that
the mushrooms and berries are often gathered in areas contaminated
by radioactive fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
	   ``The Kiev Veterinary Service has raised the health issue and
called on the media to help, trying to prevent unauthorized
sales,'' said Lidia Lysenko, who heads the laboratory testing food
sold at Kiev's central Bessarabsky Market.
	   So far this year the lab has found six cases of chanterelle
mushrooms with excess radioactivity and three cases of blueberries,
Lysenko said Thursday.
	   Health officials say dozens of similar cases have been
registered at three other markets in Kiev.
	   The radioactive mushrooms and berries, which contain excess
doses of Cesium-137 and Strontium-90, are being seized and
destroyed. High doses of Cesium-137 and Strontium-90 weaken human
muscles, liver and bones and might cause cancer.
	   ``We had three cases in which radioactivity emitted by
chanterelles and blueberries exceeded the norm by 10 to 15 times,''
Nadezhda Martynyuk, chief of the Lisovy market laboratory, told the
Kievskiye Vedomosti newspaper.
	   The 1986 explosion and fire at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power
plant contaminated vast areas of Ukraine and the government has
declared some areas unfit for living or farming.
	   But many people ignore the regulations out of ignorance or
greed, selling mushrooms, milk, meat and other contaminated
foodstuffs at markets. Some rarely visited, contaminated forests
are rich grounds for mushroom-hunting, a popular past-time in
Ukraine.

Fighting spreads across Guinea-Bissau; slow progress in talks

	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Battles between government forces
and renegade troops escalated in inland areas Thursday while
faction leaders studied each other's conditions for direct peace
talks.
	   Hundreds of people fled the northeastern town of Mansoa
Wednesday night after the rebels warned of an imminent battle
against advancing troops from neighboring Senegal who are
supporting President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Meanwhile, three major roads leading to Bissau were unpassable
Thursday as rebels clashed with Senegalese reinforcements heading
for the capital, Portuguese radio TSF reported.
	   The spread of the fighting to the interior indicated the
conflict is developing into a full-blown civil war in this
impoverished former Portuguese colony in West Africa.
	   A Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman in Lisbon said
Senegalese forces were deploying large-calibre mortars as part of a
new offensive to help crush the 25-day-old revolt.
	   The rebels are willing to pursue a negotiated end to the
conflict, but the Bissau government is not inclined to enter into
talks, the spokesman told The Associated Press on customary
condition of anonymity. ``The government believes it has the
military might to resolve the issue,'' he said.
	   The Portuguese ambassador in Bissau, who is attempting to
mediate the conflict, met Wednesday with a rebel delegation aboard
a Portuguese Navy frigate anchored off the coast. A government
delegation failed to turn up.
	   Ambassador Fernando Henriques da Silva later conveyed the rebel
conditions for direct talks to the government, Portuguese officials
said. A government response was expected on Friday.
	   The rebels will enter into direct talks only if the foreign
troops ``immediately and unconditionally'' withdraw from the
country, their spokesman Maj. Melciades Fernandes told the
Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   The government will agree to a cease-fire only if the rebels
first put down their weapons, according to Lusa.
	   Rebels entrenched around Bissau's international airport
exchanged sporadic mortar fire with loyalist troops early Thursday,
Henriques da Silva said.
	   The breakaway military faction has clung to its positions in
Bissau since former army chief of staff Brigadier Ansumane Mane
launched the coup attempt June 7. Mane says Vieira is corrupt and
has called on him to stand down.
	   The conflict erupted after Vieira accused Mane of selling arms
to Casamance separatists fighting the Senegalese government. Mane
said it was Vieira who was trafficking arms to the region.
	   Information on the number of casualties was not immediately
available.
	   Portuguese humanitarian organizations alleged Thursday that
France was backing the Senegalese military effort in Guinea-Bissau
by deploying weaponry and support troops in southern Senegal, close
to the Guinea-Bissau border.
	   ``There's no doubt about France's involvement in the conflict,''
claimed Fatima Proenca, who represents four aid groups working in
Guinea-Bissau, after meeting with Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio.
	   The French embassy in Lisbon denied the claim.
	   Senegal was preventing aid from crossing into Guinea-Bissau
where the fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people who
require urgent food and medical aid, Proenca said.

Pakistan dismisses allegations that it planned first-use

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with details from company director who said he

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani man claiming to be
nuclear scientist with confidential information about his country's
weapons program is actually a former low-level accountant at a
company that makes bathroom fixtures, a company official said
Thursday.
	   Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan is seeking asylum in New York saying he
fled Pakistan after learning his country was planning to be the
first to use nuclear weapons against its uneasy neighbor India.
Khan said he was a scientist with the Pakistan Atomic Energy
Commission working at a secret nuclear facility.
	   But Azad Gulzar Sheikh, a director of Forte Trading Company
(Pvt) Limited, said he employed Khan as an assistant accountant
until November 1997 when he resigned.
	   ``It was a shocking moment for me when I read newspaper reports
about the fake story,'' News Network International quoted Sheikh as
saying.
	   Khan joined the Forte Trading Company Limited in 1993, Sheikh
told The Associated Press of Pakistan, Pakistan Television and the
privately run Pakistan news agency, NNI.
	   Sheikh said Khan wasn't a scientist. On his employment
application form, Sheikh said that Khan listed his education as
business graduate. Khan earned 5,000 rupees, or the equivalent of
dlrs 120 a month, when he resigned from Forte.
	   Sheikh's company makes ceramic tiles and bathroom fixtures and
is based in the southern port city of Karachi. Sheikh said Khan's
father worked at a car-manufacturing firm in Chashma, the site of
one of Pakistan's nuclear facilities.
	   In New York, Khan told The Associated Press that he was in on a
high-level meeting of scientists last April, where Pakistan decided
on a first-strike strategy.
	   Khan said he fled Pakistan to protest plans apparently made by
Pakistan in April to launch a first strike against India -- a
country that Pakistan has three times gone to war with in the past
51 years.
	   In an interview earlier this week with The Associated Press,
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub called Khan's allegations ``nonsense.''
	   The Atomic Energy Commission, where Khan said he worked, also
issued a statement on Thursday calling his story ``baseless,
malicious, fabricated and concocted.''
	   ``No such scientist of any such name has ever worked in any of
the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's sensitive nuclear
installations,'' said the statement.
	   After both India and Pakistan conducted underground nuclear
tests in May, the prospect of a fourth war on the volatile South
Asian subcontinent raised fears that it could escalate into a
nuclear conflagration.
	   Government officials in Pakistan also said that meetings to
decide combat strategy would not be open to scientists.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some Iraqi children were suffering severe
malnutrition, the U.N.'s coordinator of operations in Iraq said
Thursday.
	   ``There is much more to be done in terms of meeting the
nutritional need of the Iraqi people, in particular of children
under five,'' Benon Sevan told a press conference at the U.N.
headquarters in Baghdad.
	   ``I visited a center in north Iraq for malnourished children. It
was an awful sight. Just as it was an awful sight for me when I
visited a children's hospital on my last visit.''
	   Sevan did not say how the United Nations plans to address the
problem of malnutrition, which U.N. reports highlighted last year.
	   But he said the world body intended to accelerate its efforts to
deliver food and medicine to the Iraqi people under the
oil-for-food program. He said it was unacceptable that contracts
for supplies signed during the early stages of the program, which
began in December 1996, had still not been fulfilled.
	   ``This is the reason why we have to double our efforts, in fact
triple them, and if necessary come up with new rules for meeting
the urgent need,'' said Sevan, a Cypriot and former U.N. assistant
secretary-general who was appointed U.N. coordinator in October.
	   Under the program, Iraq is allowed to bypass U.N. sanctions to
sell limited amounts of oil, with the proceeds being used to buy
food, medicine and humanitarian goods through contracts vetted by
the world body.
	   Iraq has blamed the delays in delivery on the United States and
Britain whom, it says, have stalled certain contracts to prolong
the crippling effect of the sanctions. Washington and London say
they are concerned about certain goods having a possible military
use.
	   Referring to the delays in the delivery of food, whose
distribution has to be monitored by U.N. observers, Sevan said:
``We are often criticized for carrying out activities in a certain
way which do not look logical. But please don't look for logic
because this is done within strict rules set up within the
framework of the sanctions system.''
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the wide-ranging sanctions
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The council says they will
not be lifted until Iraq has proved that it has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.

Croat hard-liner in Mostar critical of international mediator
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIRSAD BEHRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In a strong verbal attack,
Mostar's Croat deputy mayor on Thursday demanded that a senior
international mediator leave the divided and tense southern city.
	   ``Expecting your soonest departure, I salute you,'' said Ivan
Prskalo in an open letter to Martin Garrod. Accusing Garrod of
``working against the interests of Croatian people,'' Prskalo said
he will boycott any future meetings with him.
	   ``As you don't have even the minimum of credibility among
Croatian people, it would be the best for you ... to leave these
regions as persona non grata,'' Prskalo said in the letter,
obtained by The Associated Press.
	   The letter, reflecting outrage among Bosnian Croat hard-liners
in southern Bosnia, was triggered by the recent return of more than
60 Bosnian Serbs to their pre-war homes in Ortijes. The village is
a few kilometers (miles) southeast of Mostar, which remains tense
and divided between Croats and Muslims.
	   Garrod, a former British military officer, was co-organizing the
return as the southern Bosnian representative of Bosnia's top
international mediator, Carlos Westendorp.
	   Garrod claimed Bosnian Croat officials agreed to the return and
said the Dayton peace accord provides for free return of refugees.
	   But in the letter, Prskalo said Garrod was working without his
consent. Prskalo said while Garrod helps returns of Bosnian Serbs
and Muslims to the Croat-held areas, he has been preventing Croats
to return to the areas held by Serbs and Muslims.
	   The return to Ortijes ended without incident. Some Muslim
officials even came to welcome the Serbs with gifts, including a
television set and power-generator for the destroyed village, but
no Bosnian Croats were present.
	   ``With political mockeries ... you want to belittle and
humiliate us,'' Prskalo said in the letter.
	   For years, Bosnian Croat hard-liners, including Prskalo, have
opposed the return of non-Croat refugees to regions under their
control. They were also complaining against Garrod who won
sympathies of many common people and moderate officials by playing
tough against hard-liners on all three sides.
	   Officials in the Carlos Westendorp's office were aware of the
letter and said they will respond by Friday.
	   Talking briefly to reporters in Mostar, Garrod laughed off the
letter.
	   ``This is a complete glupost,'' Garrod said, using the local
word meaning ``stupidity.''

OAU team mediating border war meets Eritrean president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Ethiopia rejecting criticism by U.N. human rights
chief, last 5 grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki told a
team of African negotiators that he wants a peaceful end to his
country's border dispute with Ethiopia, the Eritrean News Agency
reported Thursday.
	   Isaias told envoys from the Organization of African Unity the
border must be demarcated to achieve a lasting solution, ENA said.
	   The agency said Isaias ``affirmed that Eritrea remains firmly
committed to a peaceful solution,'' and again called for an
immediate end to hostilities and direct talks with Ethiopia.
	   The OAU team, which arrived in Asmara Tuesday, also met an
Eritrean committee responsible for negotiations and formally
received the country's position on the conflict.
	   The team, scheduled to leave Eritrea Friday, is made up of
ambassadors to the OAU from Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti.
	   Fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia erupted May 6. Since then
several countries and international organizations have attempted
mediation.
	   The OAU has supported a plan originally drafted by the United
States and Rwanda which calls for Eritrea to unilaterally withdraw
from contested territory.
	   Eritrea has refused, insisting it is rightfully on land defined
by boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   Isaias has called for a cease-fire, demilitarization of disputed
territory monitored by independent observers, and demarcation of
the border.
	   Ethiopia, which has accepted the U.S.-Rwanda proposal, refuses
to engage in peace talks until Eritrea withdraws.
	   Also on Thursday, Ethiopia dismissed criticism by the U.N. human
rights chief Mary Robinson that the country was violating rights by
deporting Eritrean nationals.
	   Robinson issued a statement Wednesday urging Ethiopia to stop
the deportations saying they violated international principles of
human rights.
	   In a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry, the Ethiopian
government maintained that it had deported 1,047 Eritreans because
they had been spying or had raised money for the Eritrean war
chest.
	   ``The rationale for deporting Eritrean nationals was a security
consideration taken with full respect for the safety and dignity of
the individual and in full compliance with the principles of
international humanitarian laws,'' the statement said.
	   Ethiopia denies claims by Eritrea that Ethiopia badly treated
Eritrean nationals and forced them onto buses for deportation
without their belongings.

Ending discrimination required to tackle AIDS epidemic, experts

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ending discrimination against HIV-positive people
is the key to stemming the spread of the AIDS virus, speakers at
the World AIDS Congress said Thursday.
	   Many HIV-positive people face bias throughout the world,
including denial of the right to marry, refusal of medication and
other treatment and job discrimination, the delegates said.
	   But fear of being branded an outcast keeps many from mounting
legal challenges and also stops some from getting tested for HIV,
helping fuel the spread of the virus.
	   ``People won't come forward if they face being killed in the
streets,'' said Susan Paxton of APN-plus, an organization
documenting human rights abuses against people with HIV/AIDS in
Asia.
	   Her group is using HIV-positive people in eight Asian countries
to interview others stricken with the virus about their experience
with discrimination.
	   The problem is a global one.
	   In a study of 100 people who complained of HIV-linked
discrimination in Mexico's Jalisco state, only 21 went to court
with their complaints, said Armando Diaz Camarena of the AIDS
Prevention Council.
	   Mandeep Dhaliwal of the Lawyers' Collective, an Indian group,
insisted that programs to provide condoms and clean needles to
high-risk groups are important but ``have proven to be
insufficient.''
	   But delegates stressed that legal challenges can succeed.
	   Antonio Matamoros of Costa Rica's National University told the
conference of a successful legal challenge by AIDS patients to
require the national health system to pay for the expensive drug
combinations used to fight the virus.
	   The U.N. AIDS agency says more than 30 million people worldwide
are infected with HIV, yet only one in 10 knows it.

Russian government backs off Gazprom threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with prime minister pledging no breakup of
monopolies, Gazprom director agrees to restore state control. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government launched a fresh attack on tax
cheats Thursday by starting at the very top _ Gazprom, the
country's largest company, top tax debtor and perhaps its most
sacred cash cow.
	   Lawmakers immediately objected, denouncing the move as an effort
to destroy one of the country's remaining economic treasures, and
forced the government to back off.
	   ``Splitting up Gazprom is tantamount to splitting up Russia,''
sputtered Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, head of
parliament's largest faction.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko started the day by threatening
to seize Gazprom's assets and reassert control over its board
unless the natural gas monopoly starts paying the 4 billion rubles
(about dlrs 750 million) it owes in taxes each month.
	   Gazprom gave in late in the day, agreeing to make regular
payments, and its director pledged to return significant control of
the company to the state.
	   But along the way the Kremlin was forced to change its tune from
warning that all companies, big and small, must meet their debts to
pledging to protect the biggest of them all.
	   ``As long as I am in my post, there will be no breakup of
Gazprom or other natural monopolies,'' Kiriyenko said, dashing to
parliament at the end of the day to quell the confrontation.
	   Kiriyenko is in charge of digging Russia out of its financial
crisis, caused largely by the government's chronic inability to
collect taxes. Tax debtors include the country's largest companies,
as well as millions of workers.
	   Lawmakers made clear that they will not necessarily go along
with the Kremlin's plans, rejecting a reform bill Thursday that
would have streamlined tax brackets. Lawmakers complained there was
not enough graduation in some of the rates, which treated the poor
the same as the rich.
	   The government's poor tax collections have generated a cash
crisis that forces millions of state workers go without pay for
months on end.
	   Such problems have eroded investors' faith in Russia's financial
markets and stocks have plummeted, collapsing to half their
previous value.
	   The ruble has also suffered. The Central Bank has been
intervening heavily to prevent a devaluation, which would raise
consumer prices and could lead to social unrest.
	   A recent bond offering boosted reserves to dlrs 16 billion, up
from dlrs 14.7 billion the week before, the bank announced
Thursday.
	   The government is seeking a new loan of at least dlrs 10 billion
from the International Monetary Fund to shore up the Central Bank's
reserves to prevent a run on the ruble.
	   The IMF is imposing stiff conditions, including better tax
collection and reform of Gazprom and other huge monopolies.
	   Gazprom controls production and distribution of Russia's vast
natural gas supplies, and is one of Western Europe's largest
suppliers. The IMF wants Gazprom to reform gas prices to include
transportation costs and loosen its monopoly by allowing
competitors access to its pipelines.
	   But Gazprom is one of Russia's economic sacred cows, revered as
a symbol of national strength. Parliament's sharp response prompted
President Boris Yeltsin to rush to the monopoly's defense.
	   ``A strong Gazprom means a strong state,'' Yeltsin said,
according to presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
	   The state owns 40 percent of Gazprom, the biggest stake. The
rest of the shares are believed to be held by powerful political
and business figures, including former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin. Foreign investors hold a small percent.
	   But although the government is Gazprom's largest owner, it has
essentially ceded control of the company to its director in a
complex and much-criticized trust agreement.
	   Gazprom chief Rem Vyakhiryev said Thursday that the agreement is
``empty,'' and he would agree to return formal control of the
government's share to the Kremlin.
	   Gazprom says it has had trouble paying taxes because its
customers _ many of them government-funded enterprises _ have not
paid their bills.

Spoleto Festival hosts Chinese film director's play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SPOLETO, Italy (AP) _ A banned-in-China play by film director
Zhang Yuan about homosexual life in Beijing had topping on Friday's
program at Italy's summer festival here.
	   ``East Palace, West Palace,'' whose title refers to restrooms
that are meeting sites for gays, was forbidden in China, and
Beijing also barred the director from attending the festival,
organizers in Spoleto said.
	   Yuan also directed a movie by the same title which was presented
at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997. On that occasion, too, Yuan
was not allowed to leave China.
	   ``(In China) you can sometimes criticize political decisions or
corruption, but you can't talk about sex,'' said Yuan's wife, Ning
Dai, in Spoleto to present the work.
	   The Festival of the Two Worlds, founded by composer Giancarlo
Menotti, will run in the medieval Umbrian town through July 12.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Disease and malnutrition in remote
corners of northern Afghanistan devastated by last May's powerful
earthquake has claimed 100 lives in recent days, opposition
soldiers said Thursday.
	   Contacted by satellite telephone, Shamsulhaq Asfandyar said 30
of the dead were children, who became dehydrated from dysentery,
which is caused by contaminated drinking water.
	   The United Nations and the International Red Cross have been
sending in supplies via helicopters, which is the only way to reach
the remote regions worst hit by the May 30 earthquake. The quake is
believed to have killed as many as 5,000 people.
	   Thousands more were left homeless by the quake that triggered
landslides and flattened entire villages.
	   ``We need drinking water, food and medicine,'' he said. ``People
are dying every day.''
	   The weather has been particularly hot in recent days in Rustaq
and Shahr-e-Bezurk, near the quake's epicenter, adding to the
misery of the residents of the area, he said.
	   Further south in Takhar province, also in opposition-run
territory, 20 people died when swollen mountain streams inundated
six villages, he said. Roads in the area have been cut and 16
bridges have been destroyed.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance, a collection of groups representing
Afghanistan's minority ethnic groups, are fighting the Taliban
religious army on three different fronts, all in northern
Afghanistan.

Vaccine intended to prevent AIDS may instead cause the disease
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A weakened virus that many consider the best hope
for an AIDS vaccine suffered a serious setback Thursday when tests
in adult monkeys showed it may actually cause the disease it was
meant to prevent.
	   The approach _ what scientists call a live, attenuated vaccine _
initially protects monkeys from getting infected with the simian
version of HIV.
	   However, the new work shows that over time, the weakened virus
can mutate into a lethal form that causes the disease it was meant
to prevent.
	   ``To me, this fortifies that we are not ready to go into humans
with a live attenuated vaccine,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
	   Dr. Robert Gallo of the University of Maryland said that if the
live attenuated approach fails, it means AIDS vaccine development
is no farther ahead than it was in 1984, when little was known
about the epidemic's cause.
	   ``We have no guarantee that we will ever have a vaccine,'' he
said.
	   Creating an AIDS vaccine is a top priority of researchers but
also an extraordinarily difficult task because the AIDS virus
attacks parts of the immune system that are ordinarily called into
action by effective vaccines.
	   One idea is to give people a weakened version of HIV _ one that
would set up a harmless low-grade infection but keep immune
defenses on high alert against the real thing. People who carry
genetically crippled HIV that arose through random mutations do not
seem to get sick.
	   Because of the obvious hazards of testing even a weakened AIDS
virus on people, scientists at the New England Regional Primate
Center in Southboro, Massachusetts created a mirror version using
the closely related simian immune deficiency virus, SIV.
	   When first tested on macaque monkeys, they found that the
vaccine seemed to completely protect them from what should have
been lethal doses of the full-strength virus.
	   However, in 1995, Dr. Ruth Ruprecht of Dana Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston found that the weakened virus eventually
triggered the simian version of AIDS when given to baby monkeys.
	   At the 12th World AIDS Conference, Ruprecht reported her new
research shows that in time, the vaccine also causes AIDS in adult
monkeys.
	   ``What we saw in infants is a fast-forward version of what could
happen in adults with an attenuated vaccine,'' she said.
	   The version of the vaccine she tested was weakened by deleting
parts of three genes that were thought necessary for it to cause
illness.
	   Los Angeles AIDS specialist Charles Farthing, who wants to test
a live attenuated HIV vaccine in people, called Ruprecht's latest
discovery ``more concerning'' than her earlier work in infants.
Still, he said, monkey AIDS is an even more virulent disease than
human AIDS, and the human vaccine would be weakened even more than
the monkey version she tested.
	   ``Looking at SIV in monkeys gives you a misleading impression of
what would happen in human beings,'' he said. ``This is not safety
data for humans.''
	   Ruprecht vaccinated 15 adult monkeys over the past three to five
years. One has died of AIDS. Three others have high levels of virus
in their blood.
	   Among nine infant monkeys vaccinated, six have developed AIDS
and five of them are dead. The other three have pre-AIDS
abnormalities.
	   She said the weakened virus mutates so rapidly that strains
eventually emerge that are able to thrive.
	   ``There is a mini-Darwinian experiment going on in every single
vaccinated animal,'' she said. ``In the end, we have disease.''

Zimbabwean labor leaders defer strike after talks with Mugabe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's main labor federation said it
has suspended plans for a five-day national strike after talks
Thursday with President Robert Mugabe.
	   A 20-member delegation from the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions held a three-hour meeting with Mugabe and agreed to give him
time to consider their demands for cuts in taxes and prices of
staple goods.
	   Morgan Tsvangirai, the organization's secretary general,
described the atmosphere at the meeting as ``very positive.''
	   ``The work stoppage is deferred until we have a response,''
Tsvangirai
	   In May, the confederation, representing 80 percent of labor
groups, said it was calling a five-day strike to force the
government to lift a tax imposed last year to help pay pensions for
veterans of the bush war that led to independence in 1980.
	   Labor groups also demanded changes in wage and price policies
and action to be taken against high level corruption.
	   In a position paper delivered to Mugabe Thursday, the
confederation warned ``there is a wide social perception that in an
increasingly constrained environment government is not managing
resources adequately.''
	   It said the nation suffered huge financial losses though a lack
of transparency and accountability, ``with the taxpayer making up
for costs of unpunished corruption.''
	   A two-day national strike in March shut down the economy. In
January, troops were deployed to quell food riots triggered by
soaring food prices that claimed eight lives.
	   The main Harare university and technical schools were shut down
last month after student leaders called for Indonesian-style mass
protests to force a change of government.
	   Civil unrest is the biggest threat to Mugabe, who led the former
British colony of Rhodesia to independence as Zimbabwe.
	   Last week, Mugabe accused labor groups, employers and white
farmers of conspiring to overthrow his government.
	   Mugabe told party loyalists he faced ``a deliberate neo
colonialist strategy'' aimed at unseating him.

Novotna, Tauziat reach final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional lead; updates with Novotna, Hingis quotes &QL; 
 &UR; STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Jana Novotna is back in the Wimbledon
final _ and she has the Duchess of Kent to thank.
	   ``Let's just hope the Duchess of Kent was right,'' Novotna said
after beating defending champion Martina Hingis in Thursday's
semifinals. ``She said last year `third time lucky,' and here I
am.''
	   Novotna is best remembered for sobbing on the duchess' shoulder
after the 1993 final, when she blew a 4-1 lead in the third set
against Steffi Graf.
	   The two renewed their bond last year after Novotna lost to
Hingis in a three-set final. They exchanged warm greetings and the
duchess offered Novotna encouragement for a third shot at the
title.
	   Novotna played one of her best matches Thursday to beat Hingis
6-4, 6-4, coming from behind in both sets and showing no signs of
the nerves that have haunted her in the past.
	   The third-seeded Czech will be a big favorite in Saturday's
final against Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Tauziat recovered from a horrible start to beat Natasha Zvereva
1-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3, becoming the first French woman to reach the
Wimbledon final in 73 years.
	   The presence of Novotna, 29, and Tauziat, 30, in the final marks
a stunning victory for the old guard of women's tennis over the
new. Together, they represent the oldest women's finalists since
Betty Stove (32) and Virginia Wade (31) in 1963.
	   Hingis, 17, was the last of the teen-age stars in the draw. The
Williams sisters, 16-year-old Serena and 18-year-old Venus, lost
earlier and 17-year-old Anna Kournikova missed the tournament with
an injury.
	   ``I told you in the beginning of this tournament ... it will
come down to experience,'' Novotna said. ``Our tennis is based on
experience and that's what we showed in this championship.''
	   Hingis, at 16 years, nine months, became the youngest women's
Wimbledon champion of the Open era last year. But this time, she
was outplayed in all phases by Novotna, her doubles partner.
	   ``She's not the youngest player on the tour,'' Hingis said.
``But sometimes it seems like the older the better. You see Tauziat
in the other final and it's amazing. I hope it's going to be like
that with me also.''
	   It was Novotna's first win over Hingis after a run of four
defeats. It was also Hingis' second straight semifinal defeat in a
Grand Slam.
	   ``I guess I'm not the player I was last year,'' Hingis said.
``There's been difficulties, a lot of rain this week. Playing three
matches in a row day by day singles and doubles. I was not in the
best shape today.''
	   After Hingis netted a backhand return on match point, Novotna
dropped to one knee, pumped her fist and patted the ground. She
stood, held up her arms and bowed and blew kisses as the Centre
Court crowd gave her a standing ovation.
	   ``It was absolutely stunning,'' said Novotna, who has been a
sentimental favorite here since the 1993 final. ``It was really
emotional.''
	   Novotna put her arm around Hingis as the two players met at the
net.
	   ``I told Martina, `You beat me last year. I gave it back to you
now.' She said, `Yes you did.'''
	   While the first semifinal was devoid of drama and compelling
tennis, the Novotna-Hingis match featured sparkling points and
lived up its billing as the ``real final.''
	   Novotna lost the first nine points of the match and fell behind
3-0. Hingis had four break points to go up 4-0, but Novotna saved
them all. She won seven of eight games to win the first set and go
up 1-0 in the second.
	   Hingis became increasingly frustrated, tossing her racket into
the net and banging the top of the net with her racket. Novotna,
meanwhile, was shouting and pumping her fist after winners.
	   Hingis recovered and took a 3-2 lead, with three break points in
the sixth game. Again, Novotna saved them all. Hingis saved four
break points of her own in the next game, including two with aces,
and led 4-3.
	   But that was Hingis' last game as Novotna won three straight.
After breaking for 5-4 with a leaping backhand volley smash,
Novotna served out the match at love.
	   By far the most dramatic moment of the first semifinal was
Tauziat's reaction after winning the match.
	   When Zvereva sailed a return long on match point, she let out a
shriek, threw her racket in the air, flopped onto her back and
covered her face with her hands. She then slapped the grass with
her hand.
	   On Friday, Centre Court will reverberate with ``Henmania'' as
Britain, still mourning England's loss to Argentina in the World
Cup, pulls for Tim Henman to go where no homegrown male has
ventured in 60 years.
	   ``It's safe to say it's my favorite court,'' Henman said. ``When
you've got 15,000 people cheering you on and willing you on, it
gives you a buzz.''
	   Henman will face defending champion Pete Sampras, who knows he
won't have many supporters.
	   ``Playing Tim here in England, it will be tough,'' he said.
	   Henman is playing more than just the No. 1 player, the man who
has won Wimbledon four of the last five years and who hasn't
dropped a set in his tournament.
	   Henman is also carrying the burden of history. By beating Petr
Korda in Wednesday's quarters, he became the first British man to
make the semifinals since Roger Taylor in 1973.
	   Now the 23-year-old is aiming to become the first Brit to reach
the final since Henry Austin in 1938 and the first to win the title
since Fred Perry in 1936.
	   The other men's semifinal will feature two of the game's biggest
servers _ Richard Krajicek and Goran Ivanisevic.

Car explosion in Budapest kills 4, injures dozens

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A huge car bomb exploded in a crowded
downtown area of Hungary's capital on Thursday, killing four people
and injuring 25 more, police said.
	   The bomb was attached to a car that blew up shortly before noon
on busy Aranykez Street, in an area packed with shoppers and
pedestrians.
	   Three men and a woman were killed and another person was in
critical condition, said a police spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy.
	   One of the men died in the ambulance. One of the injured was in
critical condition; 12 remained hospitalized with less sersious
injuries. The others were treated and released.
	   The apparent target of the bombing _ restaurateur Jozsef Tamas
Boross _ was among those killed, said National Chief Police
Superintendent Laszlo Forgacs. The bomb, apparently set off by
remote control, exploded as Boross drove by in his Mercedes.
	   No names were immediately available for the other victims.
	   Forgacs said Boross had asked for police supervision _ but not
24-hour protection _ after receiving unspecified threats.

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   The Times, London, on Northern Ireland:
	   Politics in Northern Ireland is as much a matter of numbers as
words. Precision in language can make the difference between
provocation and peace. But in the days ahead, it is dates and
statistics which have to be faced with sensitivity. Ulster's
political calendar is mined with days which require careful
forethought if they are to be successfully negotiated. And the new
political landscape after Thursday's election is marked by delicate
balances of voting strength which have to be approached with care.
If the man most likely to lead Northern Ireland into a new era,
David Trimble, is to succeed, then those who have deployed charged
language before must deal carefully with details of timing and
tactics.
	   Last week's election was a dangerously close-run thing for Mr.
Trimble and his Ulster Unionist Party. Although he has emerged the
leader of the largest block, and the likely First Minister, there
are problems aplenty ahead. The biggest looming difficulty is the
Orange parade in Drumcree scheduled for this Sunday. ... The march
itself may seem a curious relic to other citizens of the United
Kingdom. But at a time of change in the life of the Province, those
with a deep emotional allegiance to the Union cling all the more
fiercely to these expressions of their identity. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Tribune de Geneve, Geneva, on U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to China:
	   The chapter of human rights has been provisionally closed by
Bill Clinton to make way for business.
	   As the president continues his Chinese visit, he will be able to
give free rein to his curiosity and make himself the spokesman for
the interest China awakes in the United States.
	   No more tormented sermons in favor of human rights, or `debates'
in which each word is weighed at length to reconcile both the
Communist authorities and the American Congress _ practically
impossible.
	   One has to recognize that Clinton has made a fairly good job of
this difficult exercise, to which he devoted himself for three
days. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   La Repubblica, Rome, on the crisis in Kosovo:
	   Efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis seem
to have all failed. ...
	   The truth is that no solution will ever be found unless one of
the two contenders accepts to give up part of its demands.
	   On one side Kosovo's ethnic Albanians should give up the dream
of an independent state. On the other side, the Serbs should
finally acknowledge that other people are now living in what was
once the cradle of their civilization. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on first anniversary of Hong Kong handover
to China:
	   Can capitalism survive under socialism? A year has passed since
that question was posed in the unprecedented test in the return of
Hong Kong, the former British colony, to China.
	   The invisible shadow of China can be sensed, but its two key
principles of `one nation, two systems' and Hong Kong ruled by Hong
Kong people are basically intact.
	   Tung Chee-hwa should listen to the calls for more democratic
freedoms and greater citizen participation in politics, as in the
Legislative Council election.
	   The `prosperity and stability' referred to in Hong Kong's Basic
Law have begun to erode. Discontent with the Hong Kong government
has grown over its failure to take effective measures to fend off
economic crisis.
	   Can Hong Kong retain prosperity while retaining its
idiosyncrasies? The answer to that part of the experiment has not
yet emerged.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on U.S. President
Bill Clinton in China:
	   Before getting too excited about the exposure President Bill
Clinton's visit to China is receiving inside China, it is worth
asking a few questions. What is likely to have the most impact on
ordinary Chinese _ Clinton condemning the Tiananmen Square massacre
on television or footage of him reviewing an honor guard of troops
loyal to the regime that ordered the massacre at the site where it
occurred?
	   Who gets most mileage from Clinton being seen addressing
students at Beijing University _ remnants of the student movement
which led the pro-democracy protests in 1989 or Communist Party
officials who argued the campuses were once infiltrated by
troublemakers but can now point to Clinton's address as proof that
genuine students no longer have much to complain about?
	   Who benefits from Clinton's pleas for religious tolerance _
Christians and Buddhists subject to harassment and imprisonment in
China, or China's leaders, who would like to sink a bill in the
U.S. Congress which would impose sanctions on any country engaging
in religious persecution? ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Buenos Aires Herald, Buenos Aires, Argentina, on economy and
Latin America:
	   The forecast among European market experts during May and June
is that the backlash of the Southeast Asian economic collapse will
take five to six months to reach Latin America. On the way the
expected false hopes will be many, such as the rally this week of
the Hong Kong market and the apparent bottoming out of the South

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some Iraqi children are still suffering
from severe malnutrition, the U.N.'s coordinator of operations in
Iraq said Thursday.
	   ``There is much more to be done in terms of meeting the
nutritional need of the Iraqi people, in particular of children
under five,'' Benon Sevan told a press conference at the U.N.
headquarters in Baghdad.
	   ``I visited a center in north Iraq for malnourished children. It
was an awful sight. Just as it was an awful sight for me when I
visited a children's hospital on my last visit.''
	   Sevan did not say how the United Nations plans to address the
problem of malnutrition, which U.N. reports highlighted last year.
	   But he said the world body intended to accelerate its efforts to
deliver food and medicine to the Iraqi people under the
oil-for-food program. He said it was unacceptable that contracts
for supplies signed during the early stages of the program, which
began in December 1996, had still not been fulfilled.
	   ``This is the reason why we have to double our efforts, in fact
triple them, and if necessary come up with new rules for meeting
the urgent need,'' said Sevan, a Cypriot and former U.N. assistant
secretary-general who was appointed U.N. coordinator in October.
	   Under the program, Iraq is allowed to bypass U.N. sanctions
imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 to sell limited
amounts of oil, with the proceeds being used to buy food, medicine
and humanitarian goods through contracts vetted by the world body.

Tauziat will be outsider again in final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Nathalie Tauziat will be the
uncelebrated outsider in the Wimbledon final Saturday against
two-time runner-up Jana Novotna.
	   It's a spot she's used to.
	   ``I don't care if I'm in the shadow,'' said the 30-year-old
Tauziat, the first Frenchwoman to reach a Wimbledon singles final
in 73 years after beating Natasha Zvereva 1-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 in
Thursday's semifinals.
	   ``For me, it's no problem. I'm somebody who lives my life and I
don't care if I am in the shadow. In France I was always in the
shadow because I wasn't in the system of the (French tennis)
federation.''
	   Seeded 16th, she's the lowest seeded woman ever to make the
final and one of the most obscure _ even to hardcore tennis fans.
Her lone victory this season over a top player came in Wednesday's
quarterfinal against second-seeded American Lindsay Davenport.
	   Born in the Bangui, Central African Republic _ she now lives in
Bayonne in southwestern France _ Tauziat (pronounced TOE-zee-ott)
is coached by outspoken Frenchman Regis de Camaret, a unpopular
figure with the French tennis establishment.
	   ``My coach is somebody who likes to speak _ he always says what
he thinks,'' Tauziat said. ``Sometimes it's not nice to listen to
what he thinks. I can tell you.''
	   Tauziat has won only four WTA Tour titles and has yet to crack
the top 10 in 15 seasons as a pro.
	   But two of those came on grass, which made her start against
Zvereva embarrassing. She lost seven of the first eight games,
scattering shots all over Centre Court.
	   ``The thing I was most embarrassed about is not playing,''
Tauziat said. ``Suddenly I started to think, `I'm going to miss
this chance. Nathalie, you have to fight,' and I fight good.''
	   When Zvereva struck a return long on match point, the somber
Tauziat screamed, tossed her racket skyward and flopped on her back
at Centre Court.
	   ``I don't know what I'm going to do if I win the final, but I
was so happy ... to win and be in the final of a Grand Slam,'' she
said.
	   ``For me, I'm not on the moon already, but almost.''
	   Tauziat came back by serving better and going to the net more
often against Zvereva's wide variety of soft cut shots.
	   ``The ball of Davenport comes at you very fast,'' she said.
``Natasha, she plays slowly, and I think Centre Court is also
slower.''
	   Tauziat, the first Frenchwoman in the final since Suzanne
Lenglen won her sixth Wimbledon title in 1925, is 4-4 in matches
against the 29-year-old Novotna, although they've never played on
grass.
	   Their combined age of 59 makes them the oldest women finalists
at Wimbledon since 1977.
	   ``I have nothing to lose,'' Tauziat said. ``For me it's going to
be a nice present to be there. To be on Centre Court with any
player _ I don't care.''

UNDATED: difficult times.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on China and the United States:
	   History reasserts itself with relations between China and the
United States restored to an even keel, an achievement for which
both presidents deserve full credit.
	   For a visit that was fiercely opposed by some, and dismissed out
of hand by others as a non-event that would not accomplish
anything, Mr. Bill Clinton's tour of China so far can claim
impressive gains. That would not have been possible if he and his
administration had not been courageous enough to defy domestic
critics and take a mature view of US responsibilities in Asia. Nor
would it have been possible if Mr. Jian Zemin had not felt secure
enough in his leadership to take Deng Xiaoping's philosophy so much
further along a logical but difficult road.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on the country's press law:
	   Criticism By international human rights groups of the
government's draft press and publications law should serve as a
strong message that the proactive element in `tarnishing' the image
of Jordan abroad is not journalists or the tabloids.
	   The government continues to window dress the draft, assuring the
public that this is a ``liberal and democratic'' law.
	   It continues to carry on as if it truly believes that if
Jordanians read no evil, see no evil and speak no evil then all our
problems _ recession, unemployment, corruption and the faltering
peace process _ will somehow dissolve.
	   It is particularly discouraging that a prime minister who had
the vision and courage to sigh a peace treaty with Israel seems to
be intolerant of criticism of the present situation. We think that
the prime minister and his team should engage the public in a real
debate and perhaps in the course of doing so, evoke some public
support for the government's position on several issues.''
	    &UR; ___
	   Star Tribune, Minneapolis, on sanctions and Iran:
	   Before he left for China, President Clinton vetoed a bill that
would have imposed new sanctions on any government or business that
provided missile technology to Iran. His was a wise action _ even
though the bill passed Congress by overwhelming margins, and even
though it contained needed implementing language to bring the
United States into compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention.
	   The Iran Missile Proliferation Act, as the vetoed bill was
called, was aimed specifically at Russia, the source of worrisome
technology capable of carrying nuclear arms or other weapons of
mass destruction. The United States very much wants to discourage
the Russian government and Russian businesses from aiding Iran in
its missile program.
	   Unlike Congress, however, the Clinton administration recognizes
that unilateral sanctions are not the best way to accomplish that
policy objective. Such sanctions almost never work as intended. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Daytona Beach News-Journal, Daytona Beach, Florida, on Iran-U.S.
relations:
	   Signs are mounting that Iran and the United States are steadily
moving toward rapprochement after 19 years of isolation and
antagonism. ...
	   It is in the interest of both countries to work toward
re-establishing relations. ...
	   The opening came in the surprise election last year of Iranian
President Mohammed Khatami, a moderate. ... His election reflected
a yearning by a new generation of Iranians for political and social
freedom common in the West. ...
	   Lessons might be drawn from reaction to Iran's soccer victory
over the U.S. team. Players and fans of both countries showed
respect for each other in a highly charged atmosphere. Celebrations
in Tehran were devoid of customary references to the Great Satan.
	   Name-calling doesn't bring nations together. Respect does, and
it is reflected in the moderate tone used in recent statements by
presidents of both countries.
	    &UR; ___
	   Florence Morning News, Florence, South Carolina, on the U.S.
team's World Cup performance:
	   How to explain the United States' 2-1 loss to Iran in soccer and
its embarrassingly early exit from the World Cup?
	   The United States became the fifth team to be eliminated from
the field of 32, joining such other athletic superpowers en route
home as Jamaica, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia.
	   To say that soccer is not a big-deal sport in America is to rely
on a tired, worn-out rationalization. We Americans must view the
loss in broader terms.
	   The Iranians were sportsmanlike and gracious in their victory,
which was also a triumph for the moderate, pro-West policies of new
President Mohammed Khatami. Iran also became the first Asian team
to win a World Cup game, a much needed morale boost for a region
beset by financial crises and nuclear testing.
	   Think of the loss not as a sports defeat but as a foreign policy
victory.

Ukrainian parliament's work paralyzed by failed speaker elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma lashed out Thursday
at lawmakers who tried _ and failed _ for the 19th time to elect a
parliamentary speaker, saying they need to focus instead on urgent
economic issues.
	   Kuchma said more than 100 bills were awaiting parliamentary
approval, including the 1998 budget that significantly reduces the
budget deficit, a key condition for a dlrs 2.5 billion
International Monetary Fund loan.
	   ``I do not intend to escalate the situation,'' Kuchma told a
meeting of business leaders. ``But the lack of legislative backing
for further economic development has reached a critical level.''
	   The Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has been trying to
elect a speaker since it convened in mid-May. But the 19th round of
elections Thursday failed to produce any results, and did not seem
to have brought the two rivaling camps any closer to a compromise.
	   ``No agreement has been reached. Everything will start all over
again,'' said Oleksandr Bandurka of the centrist Popular Democratic
Party, one of about 50 deputies who has been nominated as speaker
so far.
	   The 450-member Rada is sharply divided between an alliance of
Communists and Socialists and a coalition of four centrist
factions, dominated by the pro-government Popular Democratic Party.
	   The two warring camps have spent more than a month stubbornly
nominating and voting for their own candidates, who predictably
fail to gain the necessary number of votes, and just as stubbornly
ignoring each other's proposals to cooperate.
	   The legislators also are looking ahead to the 1999 presidential
election, saying the top parliamentary post could be used as a
launching pad in the campaign.
	   Ordinary Ukrainians long seem to have lost interest in what many
see as a political farce, but Kuchma threatened Thursday to take
unspecified ``tougher measures'' if the crisis continues.
	   Kuchma has already implemented some economic reforms through
presidential decree, bypassing the legislature.

World Cup: Platini won't play benefit for injured policeman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS German population, 16th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Soccer great Michel Platini said Thursday he will
not play in a match of retired stars to benefit a French policeman
beaten into a coma by German thugs because he feels such a match is
premature.
	   The match with former French and German internationals July 11
in Paris _ on the eve of the World Cup final _ is to raise money
for David Nivel, who was attacked June 21 in Lens after the
Germany-Yugoslavia match.
	   Former German internationals who will play include Karl-Heinz
Rummenigge, Rudi Voeller Manfred Kaltz, Pierre Littbarski and Bernd
Foster. Franz Beckenbauer will be coaching, the organizers said.
	   French players expected to play include Eric Cantona, David
Ginola, Didier Six, Dominique Rocheteau, Joel Bats, Patrick
Battiston, Luis Fernandez and Jean Tigana.
	   Claude Simonet, president of the French soccer federation, told
reporters Thursday he ``was sure'' that Platini would want to play.
	   But Platini, the co-president of the France 98 organizing
committee, said he wouldn't participate because it was too early
for such a match, with Nivel's condition not known definitely.
	   The policeman has been comatose in a hospital in Lille since
being taken there by helicopter for treatment.
	   ``It would be better, firstly, to have this match in the Arras
region _ were Nivel is from_ and secondly I wasn't informed of this
initiative,'' Platini said at a press conference at the organizing
committee headquarters.
	   ``It would be better to take some time to think about what we
should do.''
	   Platini said it would be hard to get together the French and
German internationals so quickly to stage the match.
	   But Simonet and his German counterpart, Egidius Braun, said a
number of stars have committed to the match to show solidarity
between the two countries.
	   An emotional Braun spoke of his shock when he heard news of the
policeman being beaten with an iron bar by German thugs who
attacked him on a narrow street in the northern city just after the
2-2 draw between Germany and Yugoslavia.
	   ``When the news reached me of the horrible violence in Lens, I
was deeply shocked and I didn't know how to react,'' Braun said.
	   ``I wasn't thinking of football but of the destiny of the
policeman and his family who did his duty for all of us.''
	   Braun lashed out at the hooligans for the bad image they give of
Germany.
	   ``We have 80 million people in Germany and only 600 of those
animals,'' he said of the hooligans.
	   Braun said he wanted some of the money raised in Germany by
various public appeals to be put in a special fund in Nivel's name
against violence in and around soccer.
	   Simonet stressed that the teams will mix German and French
players, and they will wear soccer jerseys with the text, ``Yes to
football without violence.''

Israel blocks roads in Gaza Strip, Palestinians protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead; UPDATES with fresh quotes; American, British
officials trying to help mediate end to stand-off &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinian and Israeli
troops backed by armed personnel carriers where engaged in a heated
stand-off Thursday with both sides warning of violence following a
dispute over the use of roads in the Gaza Strip.
	   At least three major intersections used by both Israelis and
Palestinians were blocked, causing a traffic back-up of hundreds of
vehicles across the strip.
	   The dispute began earlier Thursday when a minister in Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority demanded that Israel allow a convoy
of some 22 Palestinian vehicles to use a coastal route it controls.
	   An Israeli army statement said Israeli soldiers allowed
Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz Shaheen to use the road
because he holds a VIP permit but asked the others to turn back.
	   ``The supply minister refused to continue on his way unless all
the other vehicles were allowed to pass,'' the statement said. The
army said that shortly afterwards, Palestinian police began
orchestrating ``intentional disturbances'' by setting-up roadblocks
at major intersections in the strip.
	   But Shaheeh said Palestinians have been using the coastal road
for two months and blamed the Israeli for causing confusion.
	   ``Suddenly the Israeli soldiers blocked our way and prevented us
from using the road so I decided, along with the other drivers, to
stay here and we are going to stay as long as it takes to solve
this problem,'' said Shaheen, contacted on his cellular phone at
the site.
	   Shaheen said one American and one British official had arrived
at the area to try and mediate between Israeli and Palestinian
forces.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian troops blocked off sections
of road under their control throughout the strip and engaged in
heating shouting matches.
	   At Kfar Darom junction, near the Jewish settlement of the same
name, Israeli troops stationed three APCs in the middle of a road
linking two major Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds of vehicles were
brought to a standstill for some five hours. An army bulldozer
hauled in sand to set-up an extra military position near the
Israeli-controlled junction.
	   Israel said the Palestinians had blocked roads at three major
intersections near Jewish settlements and that its chief commander
in the area warned his Palestinian counterpart that ``the
provocation could lead to clashes and to the unnecessary harm of
human life on both sides,'' the Israeli army statement said. Israel
asked the Palestinians to ``send senior officers to the
intersections to clear the roadblocks and allow for an orderly
movement of cars in the area,'' the army statement said.
	   Palestinian officials however, charged that it was Israel that
blocked the roads and halted joint patrols with their forces.
	   But a Palestinian truck driver however, Issa Alwai, told
reporters that Palestinian police had ordered him and others to
move their large trucks into the middle of a road used by settlers
and the Israeli army, about 1 mile from where the APCs were
stationed at Kfar Darom.
	   Arafat's Palestinian Authority gained autonomy over most of the
strip after signing a 1993 peace agreement with Israel. However
Israeli troops still control areas in the strip around several
small Jewish settlements in addition to Gaza's borders.
	   Some roads leading out of the strip into Israel proper are
shared while others are not and incidents of violent are common in
areas where Israelis and Palestinian come into contact.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ David Beckham will never forget the kick which led
to his sending-off in England's World Cup loss to Argentina _ the
fans won't let him.
	   Beckham, escaping from the media scrutiny, retreated to New York
late Wednesday for some soul-searching and a reunion with fiance
Victoria Adams _ better known as Posh Spice of the Spice Girls.
	   Beckham, considered the ``glamor boy'' of English soccer, was
sent off early in the second half of Tuesday's match for petulantly
kicking an opposing player.
	   His dismissal left England one man short for 75 minutes, as his
teammates fought bravely to a 2-2 draw before losing the match on a
penalty shootout.
	   The Sun newspaper reported Thursday that Beckham could not
believe he had been sent off and could not face manager Glenn
Hoddle as he left the field.
	   ``I felt sick,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I stood in the
tunnel and watched the last few minutes and the terrible tension of
the penalty shoot-out. I kept thinking to myself that if I had
still been out there I would have been one of the penalty takers.''
	   While Beckham has former World Cup stars, his fiancee,
politicians and his parents defending him, the average soccer fan _
through hastily organized telephone polls _ still blames him for
England's exit.
	   The Sun even quoted his former teacher's report cards which
described Beckham as talented but ``silly''.
	   Victoria Adams appealed to fans not to persecute the 23-year-old
Manchester United star.
	   ``He doesn't deserve to be the most hated man in Britain,'' she
said in a statement. ``He, more than anyone, wanted England to go
all the way.''
	   Sir Bobby Charlton, a 1966 World Cup hero and director at
Manchester United, said Beckham can expect to be taunted when he
lines up for United next season.
	   ``...fans will be looking for any way to get back at him on the
football field next season,'' he told The Associated Press.
``Manchester United is not the most popular team already with rival
fans and this will just add to the unpopularity. This is going to
follow him around.''
	   ``He's not an evil person. He's a very nice young man and we'll
see how he's able to handle the situation,'' Charlton added.
	   Geoff Hurst, another 1966 World Cup hero, said in a television
interview on Thursday he did not think Beckham's actions cost
England the game and in years past would have gone unpunished.
	   ``In the context of the game, a few years ago that incident
would be regarded as next to nothing,'' he said.
	   However, Hurst said Beckham would have to learn how to control
his temper.
	   ``David seems to have a temperament which seems a little fiery
and needs to learn how to control that.''
	   ``He's a young lad, he's made a mistake and let's hope he learns
from that and becomes the great player we all feel he can be,''
Hunt added. ``We should get off his back and let him get on with
his career and his life.''

Helms spokesman attacks U.N. court during conference in Rome
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A U.S. political battle intruded at the U.N.
international court conference Thursday when a spokesman for Sen.
Jesse Helms here denounced the idea as a threat to American
sovereignty.
	   The Republican, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, could single-handedly block U.S. ratification of the
court. If the United States signs the treaty establishing the
court, it would go before his committee.
	   ``This is fundamentally an extremely dangerous idea,'' Marc
Thiessen, the Helms spokesman, told reporters. The conference was
``basically a power play'' by other countries to reduce U.S.
influence in the United Nations, he said.
	   Helms' main concern was the possibility that Americans, most
likely peacekeepers or troops on foreign soil, would be judged by a
non-American body. The concern is shared by the U.S. Defense
Department, which is at odds with the Justice Department over the
court.
	   ``The power to mete out justice ... is a fundamental principle
of sovereignty,'' Thiessen said.
	   Supporters argue that making Americans exempt would create a
double standard and undermine the court's authority. The United
States, which supports the idea of a court, has argued that the
U.N. Security Council -- on which it has veto power -- should
decide where a prosecutor can probe.
	   The aim of the conference, which ends July 17, is to establish a
permanent tribunal to handle war crimes, crimes against humanity
and genocide.
	   Helms' stance is nothing new. Even before the delegates from 159
nations gathered here last month for the five-week conference,
Helms said the court would be ``dead on arrival'' without U.S. veto
power over its actions.
	   But by making the statements in Rome, as the Clinton
administration's negotiators are in the middle of seeking to sway
other countries on scores of articles, the Helms spokesman put
pressure on the U.S. delegation.
	   Richard Dicker, a representative from the U.S.-based Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights, which supports a powerful, independent
court, called Helms' stance an ``extremist, isolationist view.''
	   He said Thiessen's comments ``undermine'' the U.S. position here
because it signals to other delegates that since a treaty would
have little chance of survival in the world's superpower, there was
no point in paying attention to its arguments.
	   The spokesman's presence was a delicate issue for the U.S.
delegation, which arranged the meeting with reporters.
	   An administration official stressed that the presence of
Thiessen and other Senate staff was not unusual, but that they did
not speak for the U.S. delegation. The official would only say the
United States was ``hopeful'' a treaty would be agreed on that the
Senate could approve.

World Cup: Vogts strikes gold with Bierhoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ When Berti Vogts went to a provincial
Italian town a couple of years ago to scout a second-division
striker, he was all but ridiculed. Now, the nation is grateful for
the stroke of genius from the German coach that brought Oliver
Bierhoff back from oblivion.
	   Vogts knew better, but German newspapers had a field day poking
fun at the coach.
	   ``Oliver played for me in Germany's Under-18 and Under-21 teams
and he was always scoring the most goals,'' Vogts said.
	   ``But I remember, when I went to watch him in Italy, I was
severely criticized.''
	   His critics could have been forgiven _ at the time.
	   Bierhoff was then playing for the small second-division team of
Ascoli. He had a difficult beginning, but by then had developed
into a prolific scorer.
	   Still, a second-division striker for Germany?
	   Bierhoff proved all doubters wrong.
	   He got his chance for Germany, and in the process moved to
Udinese in the Serie A, the top Italian division.
	   Before his Italian adventure, Bierhoff had gone through three
Bundesliga clubs in five years that were anything but spectacular.
When he left, hardly anyone noticed.
	   Since then, Bierhoff has gained fame by scoring Germany's most
important goals. He has 20 goals in 30 games.
	   He clinched the 1996 European Championship title for Germany by
scoring the sudden-death ``Golden Goal'' in extra time in the final
against the Czech Republic.
	   In August 1997, he came in as a substitute and hit three goals
within seven minutes to rally Germany to a 3-1 victory over
Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifying game.
	   At the World Cup here, Bierhoff scored the second goal that
salvaged a late 2-2 draw against Yugoslavia in group play.
	   And in the round of 16, he headed in the winner five minutes
before the final whistle as Germany rallied against to beat Mexico
2-1.
	   So far, he has three goals, all off headers.
	   ``I don't care how I score as long as we keep winning,''
Bierhoff said Thursday, as Germany prepared for Saturday's
quarterfinal against Croatia in Lyon.
	   ``They have very strong players who play for great clubs. They
are aggressive, but I hope that we can raise our game and beat
them,'' Bierhoff said of Croatia.
	   Against Croatia, Bierhoff will meet his future AC Milan teammate
Zvonimir Boban. Bierhoff, 30, has been signed by Milan to lift the
famed club after a dismal season.
	   Bierhoff admits that as a relatively obscure newcomer he had
some problems gaining acceptance from his German teammates in his
early days with the national team.
	   ``I tried to talk through my performances on the field, not
through talking to the media,'' he said. ``Now, I feel that the
team believes in me and that gives even more confidence.''
	   Vogts said Italy had been the turning point in Bierhoff's
career.
	   ``The life in Italy really helped him form as a person. He's
become one of the strongest players in the world,'' the coach said.

Jury retires in Christie libel hearing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The jury in the Linford Christie libel trial
retired Thursday to consider its verdict.
	   The former Olympic and world 100-meter champion is suing John
McVicar, a convicted armed robber turned writer, over a magazine
article suggesting that Christie used performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The article was published in the September 1995 issue of Spiked
magazine.
	   During the 13-day trial at the High Court, Christie called
witnesses, including former British Olympic officials and medical
experts, to support his repeated claim that he had never returned a
positive result in hundreds of drug tests.
	   In his summing up, Christie's lawyer Patrick Moloney said
McVicar, who was defending himself, had resorted to changing his
defense during the trial.
	   Moloney said McVicar had not proved Christie guilty of using
drugs, instead he relied on inferences about the former champion's
sudden increase in weight or improvement in world rankings.

Car explosion in Budapest kills 4, injures dozens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Boross was on street, not in car, when killed. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEX BANDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A huge car bomb exploded in a crowded
downtown area of Hungary's capital on Thursday, killing four people
and injuring more 25, police said.
	   The bomb was attached to a car that blew up shortly before noon
on busy Aranykez Street, in an area packed with shoppers and
pedestrians.
	   Three men and a woman were killed and another person was in
critical condition, said a police spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy.
	   One of the men died in the ambulance. One of the injured was in
critical condition; 12 remained hospitalized with lighter injuries,
and the rest received outpatient treatment.
	   The apparent target of the bombing _ restaurateur Jozsef Tamas
Boross _ was among those killed, said National Chief Police
Superintendent Laszlo Forgacs. The bomb, apparently set off by
remote control, exploded as Boross walked by.

Court rules prosecutors must prove intent to kill in AIDS case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A court dealt a blow Thursday to efforts to convict
three former Cabinet officials in the 1985 contamination of 1,300
people with AIDS-tainted blood, ruling in a separate case that
prosecutors must show intent to kill to prove poisoning.
	   Former Socialist Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, former Social
Affairs Minister Georgina Dufoix and former Deputy Health Minister
Edmond Herve are under investigation for ``complicity in
poisoning.''
	   Fabius and the two ministers have been accused of choosing not
to purchase technology that would have prevented the tragedy. All
three deny they knowingly approved the use of tainted blood.
	   The Cour de Cassation ruled Thursday that it was necessary to
prove ``intentional homicide'' to constitute the crime of poisoning
under French law.
	   The ruling came in a case involving a 35-year-old man accused of
poisoning by having unprotected sex even though he knew he was
HIV-positive.
	   But it will have deep implications for the tainted blood case,
which shook France's medical establishment in 1985.
	   On June 12, the chief prosecutor at a special court recommended
that an appeals court drop charges against the three officials.
	   The special court, composed of 12 members of parliament and
three French magistrates, is expected to decide July 17 whether to
accept the prosecutor's suggestion. The charges carry a maximum
30-year prison sentence.
	   About 1,300 hemophiliacs were infected with the AIDS virus in
the mid-80s when government medical authorities distributed blood
products they knew could be contaminated with HIV. More than 500 of
the victims have since died.
	   Four former health officials were convicted on charges related
to the case and jailed, including Dr. Michel Garetta, who headed
the National Center for Blood Transfusion in 1985 and is now being
investigated on other charges.
	   Fabius, Dufoix and Edmond were accused in part for choosing not
to buy U.S.-made AIDS tests as well as opposing the importing of
expensive blood products treated with heat to de-activate the AIDS
virus.
	   After the scandal broke in 1990, victims' families pressed for
prosecution of the ministers.
	   Fabius was prime minister from 1984-86 under then Socialist
President Francois Mitterrand.

Long drought by Englishmen at Wimbledon could soon be over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Stonehenge was still under
construction the last time an Englishman won Wimbledon.
	   Just kidding. It wasn't really that long ago. The year was
actually 1936, around the time of Henry VIII and the first Rolling
Stones album.
	   Britain has won a World War since it last won the men's title at
the All England Club, but two more victories by Tim Henman would
end the slump.
	   Henman, a 23-year-old Oxford lad with Wimbledon bloodlines,
faces four-time champion Pete Sampras in the semifinals Friday.
Goran Ivanisevic plays Richard Krajicek in the other match, but the
focus will be on the UK-USA showdown.
	   ``This event will obviously be watched all over England, and all
over the world,'' Sampras said. ``I'm looking forward to it. It'll
be a good fight.''
	   Sampras will actually be out-manned two to one, with the ghost
of Fred Perry on Henman's side.
	   Perry was the Sampras of an earlier era, winning nine Grand Slam
titles, including his third consecutive Wimbledon championship in
1936. It was the 32nd men's singles title at Wimbledon for the
British, and they haven't won one since.
	   The United Kingdom had a women's champion in Virginia Wade as
recently as 1977, but Henman is the first Englishman to reach the
semifinals since Roger Taylor in 1973.
	   A statue of Perry, who died in 1995, stands near the main
entrance at the All England Club. It's surrounded by roses,
begonias and an evergreen hedge, but there's plenty of room for a
Henman statue, should he win the title.
	   Henman's family has a rich history at Wimbledon. His great
grandmother, Ellen Stawell-Brown, was the first woman to serve
overhand in the tournament. His grandfather, Henry Billington,
reached the quarterfinals of men's doubles in 1939.
	   London bookmakers give the 12th-seeded Henman a 3-1 chance to
beat Sampras, with 8-1 odds that he'll win the title. His biggest
challenge will be to withstand the pressure of a nation's
expectations.
	   ``The nation doesn't come into it at all,'' he said. ``I have
great support, but in an individual sport, you have to play for
yourself. ... If I play the tennis that I've played and the tennis
that I'm capable of, I have a good chance.''
	   Ivanisevic, trying to become Croatia's first Wimbledon champion,
acknowledged national pride as a factor going into his match
against Krajicek. Ivanisevic said he can envision himself winning
the title and his country winning the World Cup a week later.
	   ``It would be great,'' he said. ``The whole country will be
drunk for the rest of the year, including me and the team. I'll put
my rackets in the closet and just come back next year.''
	   Britons would likely be more restrained in their celebration of
a Henman championship, but such a triumph would temper the anguish
of England's heartbreaking loss Tuesday to Argentina in the World
Cup.
	   Sampras, a fan favorite at Wimbledon with a 25-1 record on
Centre Court, knows the crowd will be against him this time.
	   ``The toughest crowd I've ever played in front of was probably
against Boris Becker in Germany in some of the Davis Cup matches,''
Sampras said. ``But come Friday, it's going to be tough. I'm
expecting it, so I feel like I'm ready.''
	   Sampras has yet to lose a set during the fortnight, but he
usually encounters at least one close call at Wimbledon. Last year
it came in the fourth round against Petr Korda, when Sampras
escaped 6-4 in the fifth set.
	   He and Henman are frequent practice partners, so both know what
to expect _ big serves, charges to the net, short points and long
sets. Neither player lost his serve in the quarterfinals, and the
match will likely hinge on a few key points, perhaps in
tiebreakers.
	   ``Tim is serving very, very big,'' Sampras said. ``He's got a
really good all-court game, and there aren't that many players
today who have that. He does everything very well. It'll be a
straightforward grass-court match, so there won't be any
surprises.''
	   Should Sampras lose, he would drop from first to third in the
rankings. Marcelo Rios would become No. 1 in the world.
	   And in England, Henman needs two more wins to become bigger than
Stonehenge.

Kallis' century take South Africa to 237 for one
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ A Jacques Kallis century and a record
second wicket stand with Gary Kirsten gave South Africa early
control of the third cricket test against England on Thursday.
	   Kallis' 117 not out and a fighting unbeaten 98 by vice-captain
Kirsten took South Africa to 237 for one at stumps on the first
day.
	   Their 212-run stand equals South Africa's record second wicket
partnership set by Kirsten and Daryll Cullinan against India at
Calcutta in 1996-97.
	   The pair fully vindicated skipper Hansie Cronje's decision to
bat first as they defied England on a slow, sparsely-grassed Old
Trafford pitch.
	   Kirsten and Kallis wrested the initiative from England after a
pumped up Darren Gough had drawn first blood for England in his
fifth over.
	   Bowling with pace and swinging the ball both ways, Gough bowled
Liebenberg for 16.
	   But for the next five hours and 22 minutes England went without
success.
	   Kallis' 234-ball innings set the tone for the afternoon after
the pair had struggled under overcast conditions before lunch.
	   Batting conditions improved after lunch as the sun appeared and
the South Africans scored 57 runs in the first hour after the
break.
	   While Kirsten batted patiently and will have to wait until
Friday for his century, Kallis took the attack to England.
	   He pulled and cut part-time off spinner Mark Ramprakash for
successive boundaries to bring up his century.
	   England's spin duo _ off spinner Robert Croft and left armer
Ashley Giles _ bowled just four overs each in tandem before lunch.
After the break England skipper Alec Stewart alternated between the
slow bowlers and the pace attack.
	   Croft and Giles never really threatened the South Africans with
turn or bounce in 41 overs between them.
	   England had two chances to break up the South African
partnership. In Giles' first over after lunch Kirsten, then on 24,
cut the ball past Nasser Hussain's outstretched hand at slip.
	   On 87, the opener hit a return catch to Giles but the bowler
could not hold the catch.
	   Stewart didn't take the second new ball until the 91st over but
the much needed breakthrough remained elusive as the pitch eased in
composure.

	   DAYTONA BEACH, Florida (AP) _ The Pepsi 400, the first night
race at Daytona International Speedway, was postponed Thursday
because of wildfires burning out of control in Florida.
	   The Saturday night race, on the Independence Day holiday, was
billed as the largest night sports event ever. All 143,000
grandstand seats were sold out, and other fans were already lining
up when the race was postponed.
	   ``The wildfires plaguing Daytona Beach and surrounding
communities intensified Wednesday night to a level that makes
postponing this race the right thing to do,'' said John Graham,
speedway president.
	   The race, one of the most anticipated NASCAR events in recent
years, was scheduled for Oct. 17. All tickets will be honored then.
	   The decision to postpone was announced an hour before the gates
were to open. Hundreds of fans in cars and campers had already
assembled at one gate during the night, hoping to stake out choice
infield spots.
	   Most of the drivers had already arrived for Thursday night's
qualifying.
	   Graham said the race was called off after a report from city and
county authorities saying roads were closed because of fires. A
ride that normally took less than one hour from the Orlando airport
to the speedway now took more than three hours.
	   Twenty people were heading for the airport, including Mike Joy,
who was to have called the race, host Ken Squier and analysts Ned
Jarrett and Buddy Baker.
	   Race fans Murray Wilson and Marlene Harvey flew in from Iowa on
Wednesday for the race.
	   ``It's disgusting, but it's understandable,'' Wilson said,
adding they wouldn't be able to return in October.
	   Mike Crowley, a firefighter from Sarasota who has been coming to
the races every year since 1979, plans to return for the
rescheduled race.
	   ``It's the best thing they could have done,'' Crowley said.
``There's no way they could have gotten the spectators here.''
	   The Pepsi 400 usually fills only two-thirds of the grandstands
at Daytona because of the 100-degree (38-degree Celsius)
temperatures in July. After deciding to install lights for the
first night race, all of the 143,000-plus seats had been sold out
by March.
	   The dlrs 5 million lighting project is believed to be the
largest ever for a sports arena. Completed last month in time for
testing, it required 1,835 lamps around the 2 1/2-mile
(4-kilometer) tri-oval to generate as much light as the high beams
of 87,000 passenger cars.
	   The Oct. 17 race will come three weeks before the season-ending
NAPA 500 race outside Atlanta. The only other break in the Winston
Cup series would have been in two weeks.

Diplomatic observers to start patrolling war-torn province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Solana comments. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's top official said Thursday
that diplomats must have the lead in trying to stem Kosovo's
violence and foreign countries prepared to do just that, assembling
a monitoring team for the strife-torn province.
	   As Secretary-General Javier Solana made a case for diplomatic _
not military _ action to obtain a cease-fire, the U.S. Embassy in
Belgrade announced the formation of a monitoring mission, made up
of American, Russian, Austrian and Polish diplomats.
	   The mission would begin its work in Kosovo next Monday, said a
U.S. Embassy statement. Among its tasks will be observing freedom
of motion.
	   Such freedom is hampered both by Serb police blocking access to
regions where anti-guerrilla operations are in process, and Kosovo
Albanian fighters extending their grip in the central part of the
Serbian province.
	   In a separate diplomatic effort, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
planned to meet Friday in Belgrade with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, the main force behind the Serb crackdown on Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian independence fighters.
	   Solana, who spoke in Sarajevo before leaving for Tirana,
Albania, said NATO forces, which staged a display of air power in
the region last month, are continuing their preparations for
possible further action.
	   ``The situation we had in Bosnia should not be repeated,'' he
said. ``The international community will not allow that to
happen.''
	   Later, in Tirana, he said NATO continued planning for a Kosovo
mission.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have been pressing for military
intervention to halt the months-long campaign by Serb security
forces to crush militant resistance in the secessionist province of
Serbia, populated predominantly by Albanians.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanians' leader, said after meeting
a visiting delegation of U.S. congressional staffers Thursday that
the latest Serb actions are ``aimed at ethnically cleansing
Kosovo.''
	   Officials in Serb-led Yugoslavia maintain the action is aimed at
wiping out ``terrorists'' and restoring order to the restive
province. They also accuse the Kosovo Liberation Army of attacks on
Serb civilians.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the KLA.
But they did agree to meet again Sunday to try to meld the
guerrilla struggle with their nonviolent independence campaign.
	   In an indication of how compelling the need to enlist the
guerrillas has become, Rugova also participated in the meeting.
Previously he has refused to cooperate with the armed insurgents,
preaching nonviolence as the only way to achieve independence.
	   In Tirana, an Albanian government official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Solana had asked the government to use
all its influence to bridge differences between the Kosovo Albanian
political leadership and militants, so that they can speak with one
voice.

Belarus marks national holiday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus began celebrations of its national
holiday Thursday, with the president laying a wreath at a war
memorial and delivering a speech praising the former Soviet
republic's achievements.
	   ``Today Belarus is an independent state in the center of Europe,
with political and economic ties to more than 120 countries,''
President Alexander Lukashenko told an audience at the national
opera house.
	   ``The foundation of these relations is democratic respect and
the sovereignty and independence of every country.''
	   Belarus became independent in 1991 as part of the breakup of the
Soviet Union.
	   Lukashenko, who is openly nostalgic for the Soviet Union, was
elected in 1994 and has since restored many Soviet-era practices.
In 1996 he converted Belarus' national holiday from June 27, the
anniversary of its declaration of independence, to July 3, the
anniversary of its liberation from the Nazi occupation.
	   The holiday will be marked with solemn military parades on
Friday.
	   Lukashenko has been criticized by the West for stifling
political opposition and restricting media coverage. He is
currently involved in a diplomatic dispute with the United States
and European countries over his government's attempts to evict
ambassadors from a diplomatic compound.
	   ``One cannot enter the third millennium, on whose threshold the
world now stands, carrying the weight of political falsehood, using
methods of political dictatorship,'' Lukashenko said, apparently
referring to his Western critics. ``We are prepared to discuss, but
we will bow to no one.''

Israel blocks roads in Gaza Strip, Palestinians protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinian and Israeli
troops were engaged in a heated stand-off Thursday with both sides
warning of violence following a dispute over the use of roads in
the Gaza Strip.
	   At least three major intersections used by both Israelis and
Palestinians were blocked, causing a traffic back-up of hundreds of
vehicles across the strip.
	   The dispute began earlier Thursday when a minister in Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority demanded that Israel allow a convoy
of some 22 Palestinian vehicles to use a coastal route it controls.
	   An Israeli army statement said Israeli soldiers allowed
Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz Shaheen to use the road
because he holds a VIP permit but asked the others to turn back.
	   ``The supply minister refused to continue on his way unless all
the other vehicles were allowed to pass,'' the statement said. The
army said that shortly afterwards, Palestinian police began
orchestrating ``intentional disturbances'' by setting-up roadblocks
at major intersections in the strip.
	   But Shaheeh said Palestinians have been using the coastal road
for two months and blamed Israel for causing confusion.
	   ``Suddenly the Israeli soldiers blocked our way and prevented us
from using the road so I decided, along with the other drivers, to
stay here and we are going to stay as long as it takes to solve
this problem,'' said Shaheen, contacted on his cellular phone at
the site.
	   Shaheen said one American and one British official had arrived
at the area to try and mediate between Israeli and Palestinian
forces.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian troops blocked off sections
of road under their control throughout the strip and engaged in
heating shouting matches.
	   Arafat's Palestinian Authority gained autonomy over most of the
strip after signing a 1993 peace agreement with Israel. However
Israeli troops still control areas in the strip around several
small Jewish settlements in addition to Gaza's borders.
	   Some roads leading out of the strip into Israel proper are
shared while others are not and violence is common in areas where
Israelis and Palestinian come into contact.

Three opposition figures sentenced in Azerbaijani plot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three members of opposition parties were sentenced
to prison Thursday after being convicted of involvement in a plot
to kill President Geidar Aliev, a news agency reported.
	   The Azerbaijani Supreme Court sentenced a leader of the
Democratic Party, Gurban Mamedov, to five years in prison and
another member of the party, Dzhamaleddin Akhmedov, to nine years
in prison, Interfax said.
	   A member of the National Independence Party, Takhmasib Novrusov,
was given a nine-year sentence.
	   Aliev, who was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party boss,
came to power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993 and has
been cracking down on the Popular Front and other opposition groups
ever since.
	   The three men sentenced Thursday were accused of involvement in
an alleged plot to kill Aliev a few months after the coup.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A huge car bomb exploded in a crowded
downtown area of Hungary's capital on Thursday, killing four people
and injuring 25 more, police said.
	   The bomb was attached to a car that blew up shortly before noon
on busy Aranykez Street, in an area packed with shoppers and
pedestrians.
	   Three men and a woman were killed and another person was in
critical condition, said a police spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy.
	   One of the men died in the ambulance. One of the injured was in
critical condition; 12 remained hospitalized with less sersious
injuries. The others were treated and released.
	   The apparent target of the bombing _ restaurateur Jozsef Tamas
Boross _ was among those killed, said National Chief Police
Superintendent Laszlo Forgacs. The bomb, apparently set off by
remote control, exploded as Boross walked by.

World Cup: Vieri vs. Zidane in quarterfinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new Maldini quote, third graf &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ In a battle of neighboring soccer
giants, the World Cup quarterfinals open Friday with Italy vs.
France and a showdown between top scorer Christian Vieri and star
playmaker Zinedine Zidane.
	   The teams are expected to balance out in tactics and stamina,
leaving it up to individual skills like those possessed by Italy's
Vieri and France's Zidane to break open rock-solid defenses.
	   ``It could be a free kick, a header or an imaginative move by
one of the stars both teams are fielding'' that decides the game,
Italian coach Cesare Maldini said Thursday.
	   The winner earns a place in next week's semifinals here at Stade
de France against the Germany-Croatia winner. The losers go home.
	   France is worried that an ankle injury to its top striker,
Thierry Henry, could blunt its attack. Henry has three goals so
far. A decision on his availability will be made just before game
time at 4:30 p.m. (1430 GMT).
	   Italy went through to the final four years ago in the United
States only to lose to Brazil. France last made the quarterfinals
in 1986.
	   In its Mexican run that lasted into the semifinals, France, led
by Michel Platini, coolly disposed of Italy 2-0 in the second
round. It was their last World Cup meeting.
	   Zidane is now France's new Platini. Fresh from a two-game
suspension, he's ready to challenge the Italians with his darting
runs and defense-splitting passes.
	   ``We must control Zidane,'' said Maldini. Most likely Dino
Baggio or Gianluca Pessotto will try to man-mark Zidane as close as
his shadow in the afternoon sun.
	   Vieri, who has scored five goals so far, will not get individual
attention. He will have the whole French defense to contend with.
In four matches French defenders, led by Marcel Desailly and
Laurent Blanc, have conceded one goal _ a penalty.
	   ``We've played against Ronaldo. We've played against many of the
greatest. They don't get special treatment,'' said Blanc.
	   Vieri remains confident. ``I am convinced we can get through,''
he said, adding ``I want to take advantage of this magic moment.''
	   But he also hinted that Italians may not be their usual
formidable self. ``It would be no shame losing against France.''
	   Sharing leadership of the offense with Vieri will be Alessandro
del Piero, the playmaker who is desperately trying to make his mark
on the World Cup.
	   Over the past decade, France has seen a lot of Gallic talent
flocking to the riches and fortunes of the Serie A. Over half of
the French players Friday will have played or are still playing in
Italy.
	   Zidane and captain Didier Deschamps play for Juventus Turin,
Desailly is just at end of a long stint with AC Milan and Youri
Djorkaeff will clash often with his Inter Milan teammate Giuseppe
Bergomi.
	   ``There is a very good mix now and everybody will know one
another on the pitch,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet.
	   France long had an inferiority complex about Italy but valuable
lessons have been learned.
	   ``The French playing in Italy have that fighting spirit. There
is no way we can lose to Italy,'' said midfielder Alain Boghossian,
who will move to Parma next season.
	   ``I have learned how to win,'' said Zidane. ``Italy has changed
me.''
	   And Zidane knows Italy's tactics will try to destabilize him.
After catching the red card for kicking a Saudi opponent, he will
be bent on avoiding further ill discipline.
	   It will be the 31st match between the two teams, with Italy
leading with 17 wins, seven draws and six losses.

World Cup: Italian coach expects tactical match with France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-France-Italy &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, Italy (AP) _ Italian coach Cesare Maldini said he
expected a close tactical match against France in Friday's World
Cup quarterfinal with a single strike determining victory.
	   ``It could be a free kick, a header or an imaginative move by
one of the stars both teams are fielding,'' Maldini said after
Thursday's final warmup at Italy's training camp.
	   The coach said he had decided nine of the starting 11, with
Alessandro Del Piero teaming in front with striker Christian Vieri
and the defense made with Alessandro Costacurta, Fabio Cannavaro,
Giuseppe Bergomi and his son, Paolo Maldini.
	   The possible alternatives were Demetrio Albertini for Gianluca
Pessotto and Angelo Di Livio for Francesco Moriero in midfield.
	   Midfielders Luigi Di Biagio and Dino Baggio were certain
starters with Gianluca Pagliuca defending the net.
	   ``My moves will depend on France's lineup and its tactical
disposition,'' said, who's team will play its usual waiting game.
	   The Italian coach said he and his players were aware of going to
play ``a strong team, which will be supported by at least 70,000
fans.''
	   ``They will start on the attack to score an early goal, pushed
forward by the roar of the crowd. They can't wait ... we can
wait,'' Maldini said.
	   Italy scored most of its winning goals so far turning a
defensive action into a quick counter-attack.
	   ``It's going to be a very tactical match between two powerful
teams. We know each other by heart after studying recent matches on
tape. And many of the players know each another as they play with
the same clubs in Italy. I don't expect any big surprise from the
French side, and I believe they don't expect any from us,'' the
coach said.
	   Maldini said he had a great respect of French midfielder
Zinedine Zidane, who is returning to France's helm following a
two-game suspension.
	   ``Zidane is a very important player for France. However, it's
made out to be Italy versus Zidane. It's not true. France fields
several players of class,'' Maldini said.
	   ``I'm confident. I must be confident, as well as my players. We
have a lot of respect for France, but no fears.''

Iran: U.S. oil companies welcome to invest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Iran wants to boost its oil production capacity by
1.4 million barrels per day with help from the West, and officials
said Thursday American oil companies would be welcome if they had
no concerns about U.S. sanctions.
	   The Iranians are in town this week seeking financial backing for
oil ventures worth some dlrs 8 billion _ and even though a number
of U.S. oil executives came to listen, that's about all they can do
for now.
	   ``They have the problem of sanctions, which is imposed on
them,'' said Seyed Medhi Hosseini, deputy Iranian oil minister.
	   The United States will not let its companies invest in Iran,
although the government backed off in May from threats to slap
sanctions on European Union-based oil companies that do business
with the Iranians.
	   Hosseini told a news conference that Iran is seeking dlrs 5
billion for projects to increase oil production onshore and dlrs 3
billion for projects to increase offshore production. Much of the
work involves what oil companies call ``enhanced recovery,''
meaning they will try to get more oil out of an existing field.
	   The Iranian official sought to play down any concerns that
internal political squabbles could undermine the Islamic nation's
efforts to reopen its doors to Western investment, and he was asked
about the oil companies' concerns that they might not be able to
find financing because it would be difficult to obtain appropriate
insurance for investing in Iran.
	   ``If you're looking for American banks to be included in this
project, they have a problem,'' Hosseini said. ``I don't see a
problem with other banks.''
	   He was vague about any insurance concerns but said there was
little risk that Iran will again turn its back on new Western
investment after kicking out multinational companies after the 1979
revolution.
	   ``This has been approved by the Parliament. If something is
approved by the Parliament, it is law, and I can't see any reason
to be hesitant about it.''
	   Iran will invite Western companies to Tehran in August to start
issuing bids for various oil projects.
	   Iran is the second-biggest producer in OPEC, pumping about 3.6
million barrels of crude a day. But it has recognized that it needs
Western help to boost capacity and halt the decline of some
oilfields.

Blair returns after 10 Catholic churches attacked in Northern
</HEADLINE>
Ireland
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Unwilling to stand by as
extremists try to send Northern Ireland's peace agreement up in
flames, British Prime Minister Tony Blair flew to Belfast on
Thursday after arsonists struck 10 Catholic churches.
	   ``This is the past behind me,'' Blair said outside the ruins of
one of three churches wrecked by the fires, the two-century-old St.
James' Church about 10 miles (15 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   ``Don't let us ever say that the people who perpetrate acts like
that are going to win,'' said Blair, whose intervention helped
secure April's peace accord among eight parties and the agreement's
strong ratification in a May referendum. ``The democrats are going
to win.''
	   Blair headed next ``to meet the future'' _ the Protestant leader
and Catholic deputy leader of Northern Ireland's new
cross-community Assembly, who were elected Wednesday.
	   The two politicians, David Trimble and Seamus Mallon, have no
powers yet. But, already, expectations are growing for them to help
broker a peaceful resolution to a looming confrontation in the
mostly Protestant town of Portadown this Sunday _ which police have
linked to the church fires.
	   For the past three summers, Catholic protesters have tried to
block Protestant Orangemen from marching from their rural Anglican
Drumcree church to the center of Portadown along Garvaghy Road,
where most of the town's Catholics live.
	   Police suspect that members of an outlawed pro-British gang, the
Loyalist Volunteer Force, attacked the churches because of a
government-appointed Parades Commission's order this week banning
Orangemen from Garvaghy Road. The same group killed a Catholic man
and threatened to kill others when police tried to block the
Orangemen in 1996.
	   ``I'm not here to negotiate over the situation at Drumcree.
That's not something I can do,'' Blair emphasized. ``What I can do
is ask people to listen to the voice of reason, to realize that the
Parades Commission has made its ruling.''
	   The Portadown showdown subjects the cross-community duo of
Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, and Mallon, deputy
leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, to an immediate,
fundamental test.
	   Trimble is hated on the Garvaghy Road for having championed the
Orangemen's cause in the past and wants the parade to be permitted
with protesters holding placards by the roadside. By contrast,
Mallon considers Orange marches offensive to Catholics, but thinks
the conflict could have been resolved if Portadown's Orange leaders
_ or Trimble _ would meet directly with the protesters.
	   Leaders of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's 80,000-member
Protestant brotherhood, have refused to meet the protesters, led by
a former Irish Republican Army prisoner.
	   The Orange Order published an open letter in Belfast's two main
newspapers Thursday defending its ``historic culture and noble
traditions'' and appealing for Catholics to respect their right to
march. The group stages more than 2,000 parades annually, most of
them in Protestant or neutral areas.
	   Also Thursday, the homes of three isolated Catholic families
living in predominantly Protestant areas were attacked.
	   On the east side of Londonderry, a mob of drunken youths taunted
90-year-old Bridget King and her son, then threw two gasoline bombs
onto the walls of her whitewashed home.
	   ``Fifty-eight years I've lived here, no bother at all,'' she
said softly. ``Good neighbors I have. I don't know why this was
done, because the family never got into any trouble.''
	   Nearby, Tommmy and Grace Grimes thanked their Protestant
neighbor for waking them up at 3 a.m.(0200 GMT) after someone
smashed their living room window with bricks, then tossed in two
gasoline bombs.
	   ``I'm the only Catholic on this road. I can see no other reason
for it,'' Tommy Grimes said. ``If it weren't for the neighbor
waking us up out of bed, we could have been burned to death.''

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, UPDATES with Kwasniewski vetoing consolidation
measure &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski on
Thursday vetoed a government-proposed plan to consolidate Poland's
provinces, saying it contradicts the will of local communities.
	   Kwasniewski won't offer his own plan on how to reorganize the
current 49 provinces but will ask the coalition and opposition to
agree on a new proposal, said Danuta Huebner of the presidential
office.
	   Kwasniewski met with major party leaders earlier Thursday for
last minute consultations before vetoing the plan to cut the number
of provinces to 15, which parliament approved on Wednesday.
	   The reform plan, which is to do away with the communist-era
administration and take effect Jan. 1, has broad support among
politicians, but the government and the leftist opposition disagree
over the number of provinces.
	   Kwasniewski's refusal to sign the bill into law means the
complicated process of drafting a new province map will start
again. But if local elections are to take place October 11, as
scheduled, parliament needs to end the legislative work by the
August break.
	   Parliament may take up the presidential veto already on Friday.
	   The original Cabinet plan provided for reducing the number of
provinces from 49 to 12 and for giving local governments more
power.
	   But following protests from cities that would lose their
provincial capital status and under pressure from the opposition,
the government agreed to increase the number to 15. Government
experts indicated that more provinces would produce municipalities
that are too small to be self-financing.
	   However, leaders of the leftist opposition as well as
Kwasniewski, their former party chief, argue that Poland should
return to its pre-1975 division into 17 provinces, which is less
controversial than fewer provinces.

Hagi quits national soccer team after 16 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Hagi to crowd

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Gheorghe Hagi, the best Romanian
soccer player of his generation, on Thursday announced his
resignation from the national team after 16 years and a lukewarm
performance in the World Cup.
	   ``Romania goes on with or without me. The important thing is to
win,'' said Hagi, wiping away tears, as he spoke to a crowd of
10,000, who roared his name at a soccer stadium.
	   Known for his superb technical skills and intelligence, Hagi,
33, peaked in the early 1990s. Called the Maradona of the
Carpathians, Hagi was a key figure in the World Cup 1990 and 1994
finals.
	   But his star dimmed in recent years and he was often plagued by
injury. Despite that, he is very popular in Istanbul where he plays
for Galatasaray.
	   He will continue playing for the club.
	   Debuting at 17, Hagi played 114 times for Romania and scored 33
goals. He was known as the ``brain in the team.'' He will still
keep his hand in Romanian soccer and has said that he wants to help
fight corruption in the national league.
	   After the 1989 fall of communism, he played for Real Madrid,
Brescia, Italy, Barcelona and Galatasaray.

Newspaper says German unemployment down to 10.7 percent in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ In an early report preceding official
release next week, a newspaper on Thursday said German unemployment
for June dropped to 10.7 percent or about 100,000 people from 10.9
percent in May.
	   The Hamburg-based Hamburger Abendblatt said that there were
40,000 fewer unemployed in western Germany and about 60,000 less in
the eastern German states last month.
	   The June figure of about 4.1 million jobless was also down by
about 120,000 people from June of last year, the newspaper said,
citing reliable sources.
	   The federal labor office is not expected to release its official
figures until early next week.

Montgomerie on track for third Irish Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: updates with end of first day's play

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie, bidding for a third
consecutive Irish Open title, shot a six-under-par 65 Thursday for
a three-stroke lead after the first round at Druids Glen.
	   The 35-year-old Scot opened with a bogey but fought back into
the lead with seven birdies, including four in the last five holes.
	   Spain's Sergio Garcia overshadowed the field of top European
players early, carding 32 for his first nine holes.
	   But the 18-year-old British amateur titlist wilted as
Montgomerie loomed and finished with three bogeys for 3-under 68.
	   Garcia has a share of second place with Steve Richardson, Mark
Davis, David Lynn and Trinidad's Stephen Ames. Australians Peter
Lonard and Greg Chalmers were one stroke further behind in third
place.
	   Current European PGA tour leader Lee Westwood, seeking a third
successive win on tour, finished with a one-under 70.
	   Nick Faldo's search for a first tournament victory in 16 months
started badly and got progressively worse.
	   Faldo, who has slipped to his worst ever world ranking of 48th,
had a double bogey and six bogeys to finish with a 75.
	   Faldo, the last player to win three successive Irish Opens,
described his round as ``just lousy.''
	   He missed the fairway and then the green with his first two
shots and then missed a seven-foot putt and his round never fully
recovered.
	   Sam Torrance, winner of the French Open on Sunday, finished with
an even 71, as did his playing partner Ernie Els.
	   Ian Woosnam finished with a 2-over 73, while Seve Ballesteros
shot a 78 after taking a nine on the 471-yard 13th hole.
	   The Spaniard lost his ball after driving into bush, went back to
the tee and struck more trouble with his second and then compounded
the problem by three-putting.

Romanian president lobbies for role in Caspian pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Romanian President Emil Constantinescu lobbied
Thursday for a Caspian Sea oil pipeline that would pass through his
country, a news agency reported.
	   Constantinescu said he favored a pipeline from Baku, the capital
of Azerbaijan, to the Black Sea ports of Supsa in Georgia and
Constanta, Romania.
	   He said that was the shortest and most economical of many routes
that have been proposed, Interfax reported.
	   Constantinescu is visiting Georgia where he toured the Black Sea
ports of Poti, Supsa and Batumi on Thursday.
	   Caspian reserves are believed to be among the richest in the
world.

Amnesty International accuses Libya of detaining 100 professionals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The human rights group Amnesty International
accused the Libyan authorities Thursday of detaining at least 100
professional people for about a month.
	   The detainees have been held on suspicion of supporting an
underground opposition party called the Libyan Islamic Group, which
is not known to advocate violence, the London-based Amnesty said in
a fax received in Cairo.
	   The persons held include university lecturers, doctors,
engineers and civil servants.
	   In its statement, Amnesty said it was demanding that the Tripoli
government reveal the whereabouts of the detainees, who were
arrested in early June.
	   ``This is yet another example of the culture of secrecy that
cloaks the treatment of those who dare to express dissent in
Libya,'' Amnesty said.
	   The reasons for the arrests were not known, Amnesty said, but
the detainees were suspected of advocating ``political change in a
country where the government is experiencing increasing underground
opposition.''
	   Security forces seized most of the detainees in their homes at
night in the northeast city of Benghazi and other places, the
statement said.
	   Amnesty called on the government to release immediately ``all
those imprisoned solely for their beliefs.''
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Libyan government,
which tends to either ignore or deny statements from human rights
groups.

Monitors blame trigger happy police for killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ An independent monitoring group
said South African police often use excessive force and said as
many as 900 people have died this year in custody or as a result of
police actions.
	   Police often cite danger to themselves as justification for
using their guns but in one province researchers found officers
were killed or injured in only six percent of the incidents in
which a suspect was killed, the Independent Complaints Directorate
said.
	   Neville Melville, head of the group, said a provisional tally
compiled during the first five months of this year showed police
involvement in 889 deaths across South Africa.
	   The group said that of 169 police-related deaths in South
Africa's commercial heartland of Gauteng, 110 were shot, 54 of them
because police said they posed an immediate threat.
	   Police officers may have exaggerated threats as a means of
justifying their own use of force, said the monitors.
	   ``It is possible that the police are responsible for an
escalation of violence due to the tactics they use,'' Melville
said.
	   Police were accused of widespread brutality during the apartheid
era before South Africa's first all race elections in 1994.
	   Melville said the police force still suffered from a lack of law
enforcement and management skills and experience low morale.

Tennessee women fly round the world to commemorate Russians'
</HEADLINE>
flight &QL; 
 &UR; By HANNAH WOLFSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Flight suits? Check. Maps? Check.
Enough fuel to make it across Siberia? Ummm ... .
	   Nikki Mitchell and Rhonda Miles, who depart Saturday from
Tennessee on an around-the-world flight in a single-engine Maule
M-5, couldn't answer the last question until three days before
takeoff.
	   ``We got our yes!'' Mitchell hollered as Miles walked in the
door of her Nashville office Wednesday. She waved a fax from the
Russian government promising to provide them fuel for their flight
across Siberia.
	   That's the most important part of the journey for Mitchell and
Miles, Nashville women who will be commemorating a non-stop trip
three Russian women pilots made from Moscow to the southeastern tip
of Siberia in 1938 in a plane called the ``Rodina,'' which means
``Motherland'' in Russian.
	   Valentina Grizodubova, Paulina Ossipenko and Marina Raskova
broke the long-distance world record for female aviators and
received the Soviet Union's highest honor, the Gold Star, for their
flight.
	   Raskova went on to found the Night Witches, a regiment of women
who flew combat planes in World War II.
	   ``These women were the role models for all women, whether you
flew or not,'' said Mitchell, whose research for a screenplay on
the Night Witches peaked her interest in the Rodina.
	   The Tennessee women say they won't be duplicating the Russian
women's accomplishment, only drawing attention to it.
	   ``These women flew 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) in bad weather
with no radio communication,'' Mitchell said. ``Now we're tracked
all the time. All we can do is to bring to light what they did.''
	   They already have.
	   Earlier this year, Vice President Al Gore invited the women to a
state dinner in Washington, D.C., with Viktor Chernomyrdin, then
the Russian premier.
	   Mitchell, 43, and Miles, 40, will fly from Lebanon, just east of
Nashville, to Moscow, where they will meet two Russian pilots,
Khalide Makogonova and Natalia Vinokurova. The four women then will
retrace the Rodina's flight.
	   Makogonova and Mitchell will be in one plane, while Miles will
pair with Vinokurova in the other. The four will fly side-by-side
across Siberia, making nine stops en route.
	   When they reach P. Ossipenko, Russia, a town named after one of
the Rodina fliers, the Russian pilots will turn back to Moscow.
Mitchell and Miles will fly home across Alaska, Canada and the
Midwest, a total of 15,000 miles.
	   ``My mother said, `Why can't you just commemorate someone who
flew over Oklahoma and Texas?''' Mitchell joked.
	   Mitchell has been flying for 20 years. She got her pilot's
license in Abilene, Texas, and now works for country star Waylon
Jennings. Two years ago, she bought the 1974 Maule M-5 out of a
barn and started fixing it up _ but needed somebody to teach her
how to fly it.
	   She hired Miles, a crop-duster's daughter who has been around
planes as long as she can remember. Miles is a pilot for Cracker
Barrel Old Country Store Inc. and also teaches country music stars
to fly.
	   Though the Siberian portion of their flight is the most
important to the woman, it's not the most dangerous. That will be
the 16 hours they will spend over the Atlantic Ocean flying from
Newfoundland to Greenland to Iceland to Scotland to Scandinavia.
	   The trip costs an estimated drls 250,000 and Miles said they
``have sold everything but our kidneys'' to pay for it. They hope
to create a documentary from the flight and might write a book.

Corruption has deep roots in Russia: prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Corruption has deep historic and social roots in
Russia, Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov said at a news conference
on Thursday.
	   ``The officialdom in Russia never was very law-abiding,''
Skuratov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``Now the situation is obviously not good,'' he said.
``Corruption has spread to all levels of the state mechanism,''
from the federal government to municipalities.
	   Skuratov said about 5,500 criminal investigations into
bribe-taking are opened annually and about 3,200 go to court. He
said that 48 corruption investigations against prosecutors were
opened in 1997 and 2,500 against police officers.
	   He said the answer was higher wages and better social
conditions.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas attacked a series of
Israeli and allied militia positions in south Lebanon Thursday,
briefly overrunning one. Israel retaliated with air strikes and an
artillery bombardment.
	   One guerrilla was killed, three Israeli soldiers and two
militiamen of the South Lebanon Army were wounded, and a
65-year-old Lebanese civilian died of a heart attack during the
exchange, Lebanese and Israeli security officials said.
	   The attack, in which mortar shells landed in north Israel, was
the largest offensive that the Iranian-backed Hezbollah has
launched since Feb. 4 when it raided 25 Israeli and SLA positions.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said its forces attacked
18 Israeli and SLA positions with rockets, mortars and machine-gun
fire.
	   Israel's air force came to the aid of troops under fire,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   An Israeli helicopter gunship fired three missiles at guerrillas
near the SLA outpost of Haddatha, which Hezbollah captured for 12
minutes while the defenders huddled in underground bunkers after an
intense bombardment, the officials said.
	   Hezbollah said its guerrillas destroyed the position, but
Lebanese officials said they hoisted the Hezbollah flag and
retreated after throwing grenades into the bunkers.
	   The concrete-reinforced position, manned by up to 15 men,
suffered severe damage during the attack, the officials added.
Haddatha lies 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of the Israeli
border on the edge of the Israeli-occupied zone in southern
Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah named the operation at Haddatha after Hadi Nasrallah,
the son of the group's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah. The younger
Nasrallah was killed in fighting in September and his body was
among those of 40 guerrillas exchanged last week for the remains of
an Israeli soldier.
	   Hezbollah said one of its guerrillas, Hadi Msheimish, 22, was
killed. It did not report any wounded.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman said three soldiers
and two SLA militiamen were wounded and taken to hospitals in
Israel. One of the Israelis sustained serious injuries.
	   Several of the guerrillas' mortar shells landed in Israel, an
Israeli military source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
One shell struck the Israeli Arab village of Arab el-Aramshe, and
six women in the village were treated for shock.
	   Arab el-Aramshe lies on the Israeli border with Lebanon, and it
is possible that the shells were aimed at Israeli or SLA positions
inside Lebanon, but overshot their target.
	   The occupied zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of
Lebanese territory _ was established by Israel in 1985 to protect
its northern border towns against guerrilla attacks. It is
patrolled by 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.

Clinton dialogue with Chinese provides window on mysterious China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WALTER R. MEARS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Chinese student tells U.S. President Bill
Clinton he's studying American history _ and what's more, he's seen
``Titanic.''
	   At the Internet Cafe in Shanghai, where Clinton called up the
White House home page, the wall hangings are National Basketball
Association team jerseys.
	   At scenic Guilin, the local brewer tells proudly of building a
system to purify water that his business returns to the river
because he felt guilty before it was done. He also puts in a plug
for Liquanbeer: ``I think it is one of the best beers in China.''
	   Those are among the scenes and stories that Clinton _ and by
television and newspapers, Americans back home _ saw during his
nine days in China, Xi'an to Beijing to Shanghai to Guilin. And
finally in Hong Kong Thursday night, a day after the first
anniversary of the Chinese takeover.
	   A China scholar at Columbia University in New York said the
purpose of the summit was to ``give American citizens a better
image of China,'' to replace that of the lone man confronting the
tank in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Andrew Nathan of the East Asian
Institute said that change will create a political basis for a
stronger relationship. ``In that way the summit seems to have
succeeded,'' he said.
	   Clinton not only passed before the Chinese who saw his tour, he
sat among them at roundtable discussions, answered student
questions in the university hall, spent 50 minutes on Shanghai
radio in a call-in program. There were sharp questions at times.
And there was, as Clinton said again and again, a dialogue.
	   Still, none of those questions diverged from Beijing policy.
Often they reflected the positions of the government. And the
questioners were the elite. Even when the setting was a dusty
village street, the people who sat with Clinton were hardly
peasants. There was a teacher, a fledgling businessman, a
government worker.
	   Professors, students, entrepreneurs building businesses in a
communist state, leaders of this Chinese society and of the
generation that will succeed them, were the people across the
tables and at the questioners' microphones.
	   Most of China's people were far from the cameras and the
questioning. The Internet won't reach people with no electricity in
their rural homes or villages, now or any time soon. Millions _
there was no counting _ saw Clinton on television, but millions and
millions more could not.
	   There were open microphones, open questions, and in that, the
back-and-forth with Clinton resembled the forums, and sometimes the
tone, of his campaigns back home _ with the notable absence of
dissenters from government policies. China remains, as Clinton's
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said, an authoritarian
society. No president's visit is going to change that.
	   The president said he came to see and to beam home images of a
changing China. ``I hope that my trip would help to show a full and
balanced picture of modern China to the United States,'' Clinton
said at Peking University.
	   It was one of three nationally televised appearances the White
House called a mark of new openness. He said in an interview with
Chinese television that he hoped the journey had helped him and his
countrymen understand why China is the way China is.
	   ``And I hope this trip to China has helped the Chinese people to
understand why Americans are the way we are,'' he said.
	   That left the question whether the president saw China the way
it really is. He visited tourist territory, the capital at Beijing,
the commercial center at Shanghai. He saw showcase China. That's
inevitable for a traveling president anywhere: Streets are cleared,
sirens sound, ceremonies are staged and set.
	   The China Clinton saw and Americans shared on his summit tour
was not a place of rickshaw servility or Red Guard regimentation.
	   There was neon to rival Las Vegas, air conditioning to ward off
the sweltering smog. But down the alleys, there were glimpses of
the crowded, crumbling neighborhoods, steps away from the bright
lights.
	   A U.S.-educated Shanghai professor talked of the incongruities
in the insular nation of 1.2 billion people with a new generation
looking westward.
	   ``Today there are not many people who have the chance to go
abroad,'' Zuo Xuejin said at a roundtable session with Clinton.
``But they know that there are many popular American stars, and
many of the kids in China love Kentucky Fried Chicken or
McDonald's.''

Four World Cup fans come down with Legionnaires' disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Four soccer fans attending the World Cup have come
down with Legionnaires' disease and one of them has died, the
French Health Ministry confirmed Thursday.
	   All four of the victims came from the British Isles, including
two Scottish and two English fans, the Health Ministry said.
	   It said the cases appeared so far to be unrelated. None of the
afflicted fans had traveled in the same group or stayed in the same
hotel at the same time.
	   The Health Ministry did not identify the names of the victims,
but said one case had been detected in France, while the others had
been discovered after the fans returned to Great Britain.
	   The victims all appeared to have passed at some point through
Paris, but then attended matches in different cities.
	   French and British health authorities, however, are
investigating the cases to see if there is a common link among
them.
	   The symptoms of Legionnaires' are similar to a severe case of
the flu

Top U.N. official says severe malnutrition among Iraqi children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some Iraqi children were suffering severe
malnutrition, the U.N.'s coordinator of operations in Iraq said
Thursday.
	   ``There is much more to be done in terms of meeting the
nutritional need of the Iraqi people, in particular of children
under five,'' Benon Sevan told a press conference at the U.N.
headquarters in Baghdad.
	   ``I visited a center in north Iraq for malnourished children. It
was an awful sight. Just as it was an awful sight for me when I
visited a children's hospital on my last visit.''
	   Sevan did not say how the United Nations plans to address the
problem of malnutrition, which U.N. reports highlighted last year.
	   But he said the world body intended to accelerate its efforts to
deliver food and medicine to the Iraqi people under the
oil-for-food program. He said it was unacceptable that contracts
for supplies signed during the early stages of the program, which
began in December 1996, had still not been fulfilled.
	   ``This is the reason why we have to double our efforts, in fact
triple them, and if necessary come up with new rules for meeting
the urgent need,'' said Sevan, a Cypriot and former U.N. assistant
secretary-general who was appointed U.N. coordinator in October.
	   Under the program, Iraq is allowed to bypass U.N. sanctions to
sell limited amounts of oil, with the proceeds being used to buy
food, medicine and humanitarian goods through contracts vetted by
the world body.
	   Iraq has blamed the delays in delivery on the United States and
Britain whom, it says, have stalled certain contracts to prolong
the crippling effect of the sanctions. Washington and London say
they are concerned about certain goods having a possible military
use.
	   Referring to the delays in the delivery of food, whose
distribution has to be monitored by U.N. observers, Sevan said:
``We are often criticized for carrying out activities in a certain
way which do not look logical. But please don't look for logic
because this is done within strict rules set up within the
framework of the sanctions system.''
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the wide-ranging sanctions
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The council says they will
not be lifted until Iraq has proved that it has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.

Clinton dialogue with Chinese provides window on mysterious China

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Chinese student tells U.S. President Bill
Clinton he's studying American history _ and what's more, he's seen
``Titanic.''
	   At the Internet Cafe in Shanghai, where Clinton called up the
White House home page, the wall hangings are National Basketball
Association team jerseys.
	   At scenic Guilin, the local brewer tells proudly of building a
system to purify water that his business returns to the river
because he felt guilty before it was done. He also puts in a plug
for Liquanbeer: ``I think it is one of the best beers in China.''
	   Those are among the scenes and stories that Clinton _ and by
television and newspapers, Americans back home _ saw during his
nine days in China, Xi'an to Beijing to Shanghai to Guilin. And
finally in Hong Kong Thursday night, a day after the first
anniversary of the Chinese takeover.
	   A China scholar at Columbia University in New York said the
purpose of the summit was to ``give American citizens a better
image of China,'' to replace that of the lone man confronting the
tank in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Andrew Nathan of the East Asian
Institute said that change will create a political basis for a
stronger relationship. ``In that way the summit seems to have
succeeded,'' he said.
	   Clinton not only passed before the Chinese who saw his tour, he
sat among them at roundtable discussions, answered student
questions in the university hall, spent 50 minutes on Shanghai
radio in a call-in program. There were sharp questions at times.
And there was, as Clinton said again and again, a dialogue.
	   Still, none of those questions diverged from Beijing policy.
Often they reflected the positions of the government. And the
questioners were the elite. Even when the setting was a dusty
village street, the people who sat with Clinton were hardly
peasants. There was a teacher, a fledgling businessman, a
government worker.
	   Professors, students, entrepreneurs building businesses in a
communist state, leaders of this Chinese society and of the
generation that will succeed them, were the people across the
tables and at the questioners' microphones.
	   Most of China's people were far from the cameras and the
questioning. The Internet won't reach people with no electricity in
their rural homes or villages, now or any time soon. Millions _
there was no counting _ saw Clinton on television, but millions and
millions more could not.
	   There were open microphones, open questions, and in that, the
back-and-forth with Clinton resembled the forums, and sometimes the
tone, of his campaigns back home _ with the notable absence of
dissenters from government policies. China remains, as Clinton's
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said, an authoritarian
society. No president's visit is going to change that.
	   The president said he came to see and to beam home images of a
changing China. ``I hope that my trip would help to show a full and
balanced picture of modern China to the United States,'' Clinton
said at Peking University.
	   It was one of three nationally televised appearances the White
House called a mark of new openness. He said in an interview with
Chinese television that he hoped the journey had helped him and his
countrymen understand why China is the way China is.
	   ``And I hope this trip to China has helped the Chinese people to
understand why Americans are the way we are,'' he said.
	   That left the question whether the president saw China the way
it really is. He visited tourist territory, the capital at Beijing,
the commercial center at Shanghai. He saw showcase China. That's
inevitable for a traveling president anywhere: Streets are cleared,
sirens sound, ceremonies are staged and set.
	   The China Clinton saw and Americans shared on his summit tour
was not a place of rickshaw servility or Red Guard regimentation.
	   There was neon to rival Las Vegas, air conditioning to ward off
the sweltering smog. But down the alleys, there were glimpses of
the crowded, crumbling neighborhoods, steps away from the bright
lights.
	   A U.S.-educated Shanghai professor talked of the incongruities
in the insular nation of 1.2 billion people with a new generation
looking westward.
	   ``Today there are not many people who have the chance to go
abroad,'' Zuo Xuejin said at a roundtable session with Clinton.
``But they know that there are many popular American stars, and
many of the kids in China love Kentucky Fried Chicken or
McDonald's.''

Diplomatic observers to start patrolling war-torn province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Macedonian troops put on heightened alert. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's top official said Thursday
that diplomats must have the lead in trying to stem Kosovo's
violence and foreign countries prepared to do just that, assembling
a monitoring team for the strife-torn province.
	   As Secretary-General Javier Solana made a case for diplomatic _
not military _ action to obtain a cease-fire, the U.S. Embassy in
Belgrade announced the formation of a monitoring mission, made up
of American, Russian, Austrian and Polish diplomats.
	   The mission would begin its work in Kosovo next Monday, said a
U.S. Embassy statement. Among its tasks will be observing freedom
of motion.
	   Such freedom is hampered both by Serb police blocking access to
regions where anti-guerrilla operations are in process, and Kosovo
Albanian fighters extending their grip in the central part of the
Serbian province.
	   In a separate diplomatic effort, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
planned to meet Friday in Belgrade with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, the main force behind the Serb crackdown on Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian independence fighters.
	   Solana, who spoke in Sarajevo before leaving for Tirana,
Albania, said NATO forces, which staged a display of air power in
the region last month, are continuing their preparations for
possible further action.
	   ``The situation we had in Bosnia should not be repeated,'' he
said. ``The international community will not allow that to
happen.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have been pressing for military
intervention to halt the months-long campaign by Serb security
forces to crush militant resistance in the secessionist province of
Serbia, populated predominantly by Albanians.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanians' leader, said after meeting
a visiting delegation of U.S. congressional staffers Thursday that
the latest Serb actions are ``aimed at ethnically cleansing
Kosovo.''
	   Officials in Serb-led Yugoslavia maintain the action is aimed at
wiping out ``terrorists'' and restoring order to the restive
province. They also accuse the Kosovo Liberation Army of attacks on
Serb civilians.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the KLA.
But they did agree to meet again Sunday to try to meld the
guerrilla struggle with their nonviolent independence campaign.
	   In an indication of how compelling the need to enlist the
guerrillas has become, Rugova also participated in the meeting.
Previously he has refused to cooperate with the armed insurgents,
preaching nonviolence as the only way to achieve independence.
	   In Tirana, an Albanian government official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Solana had asked the government to use
all its influence to bridge differences between the Kosovo Albanian
political leadership and militants, so that they can speak with one
voice.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule.
	   Backing off its demand for an immediate pullback of Serb forces
in Kosovo, the U.S. government now says there probably will have to
be a cease-fire before Milosevic withdraws the special units that
have cracked down on Albanian militants and civilians.
	   The shift was Washington's second major move in the past week to
try to revitalize its diplomatic approach to the Kosovo conflict.
The other step was opening talks with the KLA.
	   Among the Thursday's flash points, reported by Serb or ethnic
Albanian sources, were a clash Thursday in Kijevo _ a Serb village
west of Pristina that KLA guerrillas surrounded last month, and
attacks on Serb villages around Klina, some 50 kilometers (30
miles) west of Pristina.
	   In Pristina, the Kosovo Information Center, close to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said Albanian fighters
remained in control of Belacevac village, near the strategically
important coal mine west of Pristina.
	   The Serbs claimed to have retaken the mine on Tuesday, after two
days of intense fighting and reporters subsequently saw Serb armor
and troops in Belacevac. But the center said the KLA still held the
town itself, despite a Serb siege.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources also reported fighting in the Decani
region close to the Albanian border, with Serb forces shelling
eight villages. None of the reports could be confirmed.
	   In Belgrade, the Beta news agency reported that Macedonia, which
neighbors Kosovo and has its own restive Albanian minority, had put
border troops on high alert to prevent incursions by KLA members.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas attacked a series of
Israeli and allied militia positions in south Lebanon on Thursday,
briefly overrunning one. Israel retaliated with air strikes and an
artillery bombardment.
	   One guerrilla was killed, three Israeli soldiers and two
militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army were wounded,
and a 65-year-old Lebanese civilian died of a heart attack during
the exchange, Lebanese and Israeli security officials said.
	   The attack, in which mortar shells landed in north Israel, was
the largest offensive launched by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
since Feb. 4, when it raided 25 Israeli and SLA positions.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said its forces attacked
18 Israeli and SLA positions with rockets, mortars and machine-gun
fire.
	   An Israeli helicopter gunship came to the aid of troops, firing
three missiles at guerrillas near the SLA outpost of Haddatha,
Lebanese security officials said. They said Hezbollah captured the
outpost for 12 minutes while the defenders huddled in underground
bunkers after an intense bombardment.
	   The concrete-reinforced position, manned by up to 15 men,
suffered severe damage during the attack, the officials added.
Haddatha lies 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of the Israeli
border on the edge of the Israeli-occupied zone in southern
Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah said one of its guerrillas was killed. It did not
report any wounded.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman said three soldiers
and two SLA militiamen were wounded and hospitalized in Israel. One
of the Israelis sustained serious injuries.
	   Several of the guerrillas' mortar shells landed in Israel, an
Israeli military source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
One shell struck the Israeli Arab village of Arab el-Aramshe, and
six women in the village were treated for shock.
	   It was not clear whether the village had been targeted or if the
shells had overshot Israeli or SLA positions inside Lebanon.
	   The occupied zone _ about 10 percent of Lebanese territory _ was
established by Israel in 1985 to protect its northern border towns
against guerrilla attacks. It is patrolled by 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.

Security service investigating diplomats' imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Federal Security Service said Thursday it
had begun a large-scale investigation into the importing of alcohol
and cigarettes by diplomats.
	   The agency said last month that foreign diplomats were bringing
in ``commercial amounts'' of alcohol and tobacco and using their
status to avoid paying taxes.
	   Agency director Nikolai Kovalyov said that in recent weeks,
security service and customs officials have detained 20 tons of
bootleg tobacco, worth dlrs 360,000, that was addressed to the
embassies of the Central African Republic and Nicaragua.
	   During the past year, such shipments totaled 344 tons of alcohol
and 51 tons of tobacco from African countries, 230 tons of alcohol
from Asian countries, 90 tons of alcohol and 10 tons of tobacco
from Latin America, and 108 tons of alcohol from former Soviet
republics.
	   In addition, Kovalyov said Thursday that the security service
recently stopped a diplomat who was trying to smuggle 44 objects of
historic and cultural value out of Russia, Interfax reported. He
did not say which country the diplomat was from.

Situation in Kosovo explosive, U.S. and French diplomats say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and U.S.
peace mediator Richard Holbrooke both consider the situation in
Kosovo to be ``explosive,'' the French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
said Thursday.
	   Vedrine and Holbrooke met Thursday afternoon to discuss ways to
resolve the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. Both diplomats agreed
that neither the status quo nor independence for Kosovo province
were satisfactory, said spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
	   Speaking Wednesday in Oslo, Norway, Holbrooke said international
observers could begin making symbolic patrols of the tense Kosovo
province of Yugoslavia as early as this week.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels and Serb security forces have been
fighting in Kosovo in a conflict Holbrooke claims could threaten
peace throughout the Balkans.
	   Holbrooke has been conducting shuttle diplomacy between
Yugoslavs and ethnic Albanians but so far has failed to find a way
to end the fighting in Kosovo.

Four World Cup fans come down with Legionnaires' disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Four soccer fans attending the World Cup have come
down with Legionnaires' disease and one of them has died, the
French Health Ministry confirmed Thursday.
	   All four of the victims came from the British Isles, including
two Scottish and two English fans, the Health Ministry said.
	   It said the cases appeared so far to be unrelated. None of the
afflicted fans had traveled in the same group or stayed in the same
hotel at the same time.
	   The Health Ministry did not identify the names of the victims,
but said one case had been detected in France, while the others had
been discovered after the fans returned to Great Britain.
	   The victims all appeared to have passed at some point through
Paris, but then attended matches in different cities.
	   French and British health authorities, however, are
investigating the cases to see if there is a common link.
	   The flu-like bacterial illness was first documented in July 1976
at an American Legion convention at a Philadelphia hotel. In all,
34 people died and 221 became sick.

Henman better than last Englishman 25 years ago in semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Tim Henman is the first British player
to reach the Wimbledon's men semifinals in 25 years. Roger Taylor,
the last player to do it, says it's wrong to compare him with
Henman.
	   ``I never really had a very good backhand,'' Taylor told the
Daily Mail. ``Tim has a far better technique than I had, even when
I was at my best.''
	   That's not the only difference, Taylor said.
	   ``In my early days I often used to take a tent when I played
abroad, because I couldn't afford big hotels,'' he said. ``Tim has
grown up in a completely different world. He comes from a well-off,
middle-class family. Prize money is immense, and he can stay in the
best hotels and afford his own private coach.''
	   Taylor, 56, lost in the Wimbledon semifinals in 1967, 1970 and
1973.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CASH IN ON TIM: &LR;  Scalpers are reportedly cashing in on Henman's
appearance in the semifinals _ the first boost Wimbledon has had
this year playing largely in the shadow of the World Cup in France.
	   England is a country short on recent sporting success, so Henman
is a god send. His run to the semifinals against Pete Sampras has
helped soothe the hurt of Tuesday's loss to Argentina in the World
Cup.
	   The headline's Thursday said it all.
	   The Sun: ``Henman is our new lion''
	   The Express: ``Tim Cheers up the Nation''
	   The Daily Mail: ``You're next pistol Pete''
	   ___
	   SOME CONSOLATION: &LR;  Despite Natasha Zvereva's loss to Nathalie
Tauziat in Thursday's semifinals, Zvereva leaves Wimbledon with
wins over Steffi Graf and Monica Seles _ only the second player to
beat the two former No. 1s in the same event.
	   The other was American Zina Garrison in 1990 at Wimbledon.
	   It was also Zvereva's first Grand Slam semifinal in 10 years.
	   ``I'm so tired,'' said the 27-year-old Belarussian, known as one
of the free spirits in women's tennis. ``I need a
mental-institution break. I've never been in the situation before.
Now I know what I've done. It's really draining.''
	   ``For top people like Martina (Hingis), Jana (Novotna), Lindsay
(Davenport), Monica (Seles) and Steffi (Graf) _ it's incredible to
do it over and over and over again _ every second week or every
third week.''
	   ___
	   MILESTONES: &LR;  Zvereva was attempting to become the first unseeded
woman to make the final since Billie Jean King in 1963. King lost
to Australian Margaret Court Smith. For the record, an unseeded
woman has never won Wimbledon.
	   By beating Zvereva and reaching the final, France's Nathalie
Tauziat also made Wimbledon history.
	   She's the lowest seed to ever reach the women's final. The
previous low was Olga Morozova, seeded eighth in 1974 _ and Jana
Novotna, eighth in 1993.
	   Wimbledon increased its seeds from eight to 12 in 1977 and went
to the present 16 in 1978.
	   ___
	   TIE GOES TO GORAN: &LR;  In five matches at Wimbledon, Goran
Ivanisevic has won seven of eight tiebreakers.
	   That trend could help Ivanisevic in Friday's semifinal against
Richard Krajicek. Both players have dominating serves and are
difficult to break, making tiebreakers likely.
	   ``I know that I can play good on tiebreaks,'' Ivanisevic said of
his recent success. ``I proved that these two weeks.''
	   Krajicek is 3-0 at Wimbledon in tiebreakers, but his career
record is only 133-121, compared with 221-155 for Ivanisevic.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   KRAJICEK'S KNEE: &LR;  Richard Krajicek is surprised by how well his
sore right knee has held up en route to the semifinals.
	   Krajicek has won even though he has felt sharp pain at times in
the knee, which required surgery in December.
	   ``I don't think I'm a Marine or a Navy Seal, but I think I can
cope with pain OK,'' he said.
	   Krajicek said he has fluid and stiffness in the knee, but he
moved well in a quarterfinal victory over Davide Sanguinetti.
	   ``I'm a little bit tentative to really go for crazy shots,'' he
said. ``But I felt good and moved good. I thought I would be more
afraid to move, but that was not the case.''

Britain, the Commonwealth, welcomes planned release of political
</HEADLINE>
prisoners in Nigeria
 &UR; With BC-Nigeria

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain welcomed U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan's announcement Thursday that political prisoners in Nigeria,
including Moshood Abiola, the west African state's leading
opposition figure, will soon be freed.
	   ``I hope that these prisoner releases will happen as soon as
possible,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said. ``This is one of the
key demands which we, together with our E.U. and Commonwealth
partners, have made in the search to restore democracy and human
rights in Nigeria,'' said Cook, who is planning to meet Secretary
General Annan in London on Saturday.
	   Emeka Anyaoku, Secretary General of the Commonwealth, the
54-nation club of Britain and its former colonies, said that the
prisoner release would open the way to the return of civilian
government in the oil-rich state.
	   ``I am convinced now that the military government will put in
place a credible transition to civil rule,'' Anyaoku said in a news
conference in the Nigerian city of Lagos.
	   On Thursday, Annan said that all political detainees would be
released by the country's military junta.
	   ``I'm leaving Nigeria with the stage set for the release of all
political detainees,'' Annan said in the Nigeria's capital, Abuja.
	   Nigeria's Council of State, which effectively functions as the
country's cabinet, met Thursday afternoon to discuss the releases.
Later Thursday or early Friday the Provision Ruling Council _ the
core of Nigeria's junta leaders _ will also meet, apparently to
rubber stamp the releases.
	   Abiola, 60, was elected president of Nigeria in 1993 in an
election annulled by Nigeria's military regime. The junta, led by
Gen. Sani Abacha, jailed Abiola a year later when he declared
himself president. After Abacha's death on June 8, junta officials
said that political prisoners would likely be released ``in time.''
	   Speaking in London, Abiola's daughter Wura said that Annan had
done a ``incredible job negotiating'' with Nigeria's military junta
over the release of the country's approximately 250 political
prisoners.
	   ``We're just very happy that my father is coming home at least
after four years of unjustified and inhumane treatment and
incarceration by the military,'' she said. Ms. Abiola said it was
too soon to predict her father's plans, saying he needed ``time to
reflect and to make the right decision for Nigeria going forward.''
	   France also welcomed the prospects of the release.
	   ``We cannot but welcome such a development if it materializes,''
said Alain Dejammet, the country's ambassador to the United
Nations.

U.N. sends diplomatic team to Algeria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of agreement, team leaving July 22, Armed
Islamic Group blamed for attacks. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Algeria's government, which has long
resisted any outside investigation into the violence that has
wracked the country for six years, has agreed to international
demands to let an independent team investigate the killings, U.N.
officials said Thursday.
	   The government, after a number of consultations with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, invited a U.N. team to come and has
ensured it ``free and complete access to all sources of
information,'' U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said Thursday.
	   The team, currently made up of diplomats from Portugal, France,
Kenya, India, Jordan and the United States, was to leave for
Algeria on July 22, he said.
	   The government in the North African nation has been battling a
Muslim insurgency since January 1992, when the regime canceled
parliamentary elections that an Islamic party was poised to win.
Since then, the conflict has killed an estimated 75,000 people.
	   The Armed Islamic Group, the most powerful opposition group
which wants to install strict Muslim rule in the country, has been
blamed for many of the attacks.
	   Algeria has rejected any international investigation of the
violence, insisting the killings are an internal affair. The
Algerian government maintains that terrorism is the major problem
and that it needs no inquiry.
	   Demands for such an inquiry, from a number of nations, including
the United States, and human rights groups, were spurred by
suggestions that the army or government-armed self-defense forces
might have had at least a passive role in some massacres.
	   Brandt credited the mounting international pressure and Annan's
persuasion with bringing about a change of heart from the Algerian
leadership.
	   ``I think Algeria has recognized the need to work with and
assist the international community on this,'' he said.
	   The team will be headed by former Portuguese President Mario
Soares. Other team members include: former Indian Prime Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral, former Jordanian Minister Abdel Karim Kabariti,
the attorney-general of Kenya, Amos Wako, the former American U.N.
ambassador Donald McHenry, and Simone Veil, France's former
secretary of state.
	   The team is seeking ``a clear vision and a precise perception,''
of the situation and will report back to Annan, Brandt said.
	   The North African country has been shaken by unrest over the
past week by protests by thousands of people protesting a new
Arabic-only law that is set to go into effect this weekend, as well
as the assassination of popular singer Lounes Matoub last week.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Four soccer fans attending the World Cup have come
down with Legionnaires' disease and one of them has died, the
French Health Ministry confirmed Thursday.
	   All four of the victims came from the British Isles, including
two Scottish and two English fans, the Health Ministry said.
	   It said the cases appeared so far to be unrelated. None of the
afflicted fans had traveled in the same group or stayed in the same
hotel at the same time.
	   The Health Ministry did not identify the names of the victims,
but said one case had been detected in France, while the others had
been discovered after the fans returned to Great Britain.
	   The victims all appeared to have passed at some point through
Paris, but then attended matches in different cities.
	   French and British health authorities, however, are
investigating the cases to see if there is a common link among
them.
	   The flu-like bacterial illness was first documented in July 1976
at an American Legion convention at a Philadelphia hotel. In all,
34 people died and 221 became sick.

Sicily sizzles; heat fans fires in Italy's south
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ South-central Italy sizzled under a heat wave
Thursday which brought temperatures as high as 45 C (113 F) to
Sicily, fed forest fires and was blamed for four deaths.
	   Temperatures were in the 40s (100s) across the Mediterranean
island, with Syracuse in the east reporting the highest recording.
	   Central and southern Italy baked in the heat, which weather
forecasts said would last at least through Saturday. On the
peninsula, some of the highest temperatures were recorded in
Puglia, the ``heel'' of Italy, with 44 C (112 F) in Bari.
	   Fires in pine forests in the Gargano area, the mountainous
``heel spur,'' on the southeastern coast licked at campgrounds and
vacation resorts but caused no injuries, Italian news reports said.
A stubborn blaze was reported on Lipari, a tiny island north of
Sicily, and hot air blowing up from northern Africa fanned fires in
the rugged area of Basilicata, a region forming the ``instep'' of
Italy.
	   The extreme heat was blamed for the death of an elderly resident
in Calabria and a 66-year-old tourist from northern Italy near the
sea close to Salerno, south of Naples. Two deaths were blamed on
the heat in Puglia.

More arrests likely in Russian tax scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Another 15 people could be arrested in the scandal
involving officials of the Russian statistics service accused of
helping big companies evade taxes, the prosecutor general said
Thursday.
	   The head of the State Statistics Committee, his deputy and up to
20 alleged accomplices were arrested last month. Police seized dlrs
1.5 million, dlrs 1 million of it from the home of the committee
chief, Yuri Yurkov.
	   Investigators accused them of manipulating economic data to hide
the real output of companies and reduce their tax liability, and
with selling classified information about rival companies'
performance.
	   The arrests could have far-reaching implications if it turns out
that data government officials rely on to make policy and collect
taxes was falsified.
	   Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov said another 15 people could be
arrested, the Interfax news agency reported.

Airbus closing gap with Boeing: U.S. Airways to buy 30 more planes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Boeing in 6th graf, Boeing
spokesman on British Airways deal in 16th graf &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos PAR102-4
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In another blow to Boeing, U.S. Airways said
Thursday it was ordering its first 30 wide-body jetliners from
Airbus. It was the latest coup for the European consortium vying to
depose the U.S. jet-maker as the world leader.
	   The order was the first by a U.S. airline for wide-body Airbus
jets and followed new orders from Air France and Spain's Iberia.
Airbus was also reportedly close to breaking Boeing's grip on sales
to British Airways.
	   An expanding U.S. Airways, which has already has placed orders
of more than 400 Airbus planes _ 125 of them firm _ is to buy up to
30 wide-body A330-300s.
	   ``U.S. Airways will have the most modern fleet in the air within
just a few years time,'' U.S. Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf told a
joint news conference with Airbus Managing Director Noel Forgeard.
	   Asked about not buying American, Wolf responded: ``This doesn't
brand me as an American turncoat. It brands me as a global
businessman.'' He noted he plans to buy U.S.-made Pratt and Whitney
engines.
	   In Seattle, Boeing spokeswoman Liz Verdier said, ``Hey, we're
disappointed, that's for sure. We'd much prefer it was us. We
thought we had a better product.''
	   The agreement, which came as Boeing struggles with production
snarls, includes firm orders for seven of the planes, seven more
subject to confirmation, and options on 16 others.
	   ``We plan to take all 30 aircraft,'' Wolf affirmed.
	   Wolf said they picked Airbus over Boeing because the A330s had
``slightly better cargo and passenger capability,'' as well as a
better ``economic package.''
	   The deal was valued at dlrs 3.7 billion based on the list price,
but Wolf said Airbus settled for a lower undisclosed figure.
	   Delivery of the first plane is scheduled for the first quarter
of next year, officials told the news conference. Another six are
scheduled for the year 2000.
	   The order came a day after Airbus said Air France signed for 40
planes, half of them firm orders.
	   Airbus was also negotiating a deal to sell at least 70 planes to
British Airways, an industry source has said. The airline is the
last major European carrier never to order an Airbus.
	   ``We are in tough negotiations,'' Forgeard said.
	   British Airways was expected to discuss the order during a board
meeting Friday.
	   Fernando Vivanco, a Boeing spokesman, said negotiations were
still underway. ``It ain't over,'' he said.

Telecom Italia Says Still In Talks With AT&AMP;T
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Telecom Italia Spa said Thursday that it was
pursuing talks with AT&AMP;T Corp., and the latter's partner, telecoms
consortium Unisource NV.
	   A Telecom spokesman quoted the company's annual report to U.S.
investors, a copy of which has been sent to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, as saying the talks focused on the 1997
agreement in principle to forge a strategic alliance.
	   ``No agreements have yet been reached,'' the Telecom report
said. ``The group is continuing negotiations with AT&AMP;T and
Unisource,'' it added after a hoped-for alliance between Telecom
Italia and AT&AMP;T, collapsed.
	   Telecom chairman Gian Maria Rossignolo broke off the strategic
alliance with AT&AMP;T soon after he was named chairman in January.

Grain, soybean futures lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: contains livestock prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Weather forecasts leading into the long Fourth of
July weekend sent grain and soybeans futures prices lower Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
	   Wheat futures lost more than a nickel a bushel and hit contract
lows for most deliveries.
	   With only scattered showers forecast for prime wheat-growing
areas, farmers are expected to make good progress harvesting the
grain this weekend.
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told reporters in Washington
that he had heard anecdotal comments that Kansas farmers are seeing
some ``very, very large yields'' from their wheat fields.
	   Forecasts of favorable growing weather for corn and soybeans in
the coming week also undercut those markets.
	   Wheat for delivery in July was 5 1-4 cents lower at dlrs 2.68
1-4 a bushel; July corn was 2 1-2 cents lower at dlrs 2.37 a
bushel; July oats were 1 cent lower at dlrs 1.19 1-2 a bushel; and
July soybeans were 1-4 cent lower at dlrs 6.39 1-4 a bushel.

Security Council concerned about intimidation of Serbs in Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council said Thursday it was
gravely concerned about the number of Serbs who have fled Croatia
because of intimidation and evictions and called on Belgrade
integrate Serbs into society.
	   In a joint presidential statement, the 15-member council noted
that ``the overall situation in the Danube region is relatively
stable,'' and said it was satisfied with the performance of
Croatian police, who are monitored by U.N. police.
	   But it expressed concern that ethnically-related incidents,
evictions and housing intimidation cases hadn't stopped and had in
fact increased recently despite the large presence of Croatian
police in the region.
	   Large numbers of Serbs continue to emigrate because of security
incidents, ethnically-related intimidation, a ``dire'' economic
situation, bureaucratic obstacles, discriminatory legislation and
the stalled refugee program, the council said.
	   ``A continuation of this trend could have a seriously negative
effect on the restoration of a multi-ethnic society in the Republic
of Croatia,'' the council said.
	   It said it welcomed a June 20 decision by Belgrade to adopt a
nationwide program to return displaced people and called for full
implementation of the program as well as previous accords on
eastern Slavonia, the easternmost region of Croatia.
	   The council has repeatedly expressed concern about Croatia's
commitment to granting full rights and protections to ethnic Serbs
in the eastern Slavonia region, which was seized by Serb rebels
during the ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The region
returned to Croatian control Jan. 15 after two years under U.N.
administration.
	   In 1996, 65,000 Serb refugees were living in the region. Now
only 16,000 remain. Most Serb refugees lived in abandoned Croat
houses during six years of Serb rule in Eastern Slavonia.
	   About 100,000 Croat refugees are expected to return, and Serbs
who left apparently feared they would be evicted, despite
government promises to the contrary.

Diplomatic observers to start patrolling war-torn province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Macedonian troops put on heightened alert, ADDS
new Solana quotes, Holbrooke expected in Belgrade on Friday. No
pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As NATO's top official pleaded for a
diplomatic solution to the Kosovo conflict, foreign countries on
Thursday assembled a monitoring team for the strife-torn province
in southern Yugoslavia.
	   The mission, announced by the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, would
include American, Russian, Austrian and Polish diplomats.
	   The embassy said it would begin its work in Kosovo next Monday.
Among its tasks will be observing freedom of motion.
	   Such freedom is hampered both by Serb police blocking access to
regions where anti-guerrilla operations are in process, and Kosovo
Albanian fighters extending their grip in the central part of the
area.
	   In a separate diplomatic effort, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
planned to meet Friday in Belgrade with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, the main force behind the Serb crackdown on Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian independence fighters.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, who spoke in Sarajevo
before leaving for Tirana, Albania, said NATO forces, which staged
a display of air power in the region last month, are continuing
their preparations for possible further action.
	   ``The situation we had in Bosnia should not be repeated,'' he
said. ``The international community will not allow that to
happen.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have been pressing for military
intervention to halt the months-long campaign by Serb security
forces to crush militant resistance in Kosovo. The province,
located in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, is populated
predominantly by Albanians.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanians' leader, said after meeting
a visiting delegation of U.S. congressional staffers Thursday that
the latest Serb actions are ``aimed at ethnically cleansing
Kosovo.''
	   Yugoslav officials say the action is aimed at wiping out
``terrorists'' and restoring order. They also accuse the Kosovo
Liberation Army of attacks on Serb civilians.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the KLA.
But they agreed to meet again Sunday to try to meld the guerrilla
struggle with their nonviolent independence campaign.
	   Reflecting the growing power of the guerrillas, Rugova also
participated in the meeting. Previously he has refused to cooperate
with the armed insurgents, preaching nonviolence as the only way to
achieve independence.
	   In Tirana, an Albanian government official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Solana had asked the government to use
all its influence to bridge differences between the Kosovo Albanian
political leadership and militants, so that they can speak with one
voice.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule.
	   Backing off its demand for an immediate pullback of Serb forces
in Kosovo, the U.S. government now says there probably will have to
be a cease-fire before Milosevic withdraws his troops.
	   The shift was Washington's second major move in the past week to
try to revitalize its diplomatic approach to the Kosovo conflict.
The other step was opening talks with the KLA.
	   Among the Thursday's flash points, reported by Serb or ethnic
Albanian sources, were a clash in Kijevo _ a Serb village west of
Pristina that KLA guerrillas surrounded last month, and attacks on
Serb villages around Klina, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of
Pristina.
	   In Belgrade, the Beta news agency reported that Macedonia, which
neighbors Kosovo and has its own restive Albanian minority, had put
border troops on high alert to prevent incursions by KLA members.

Italian and Iranian energy companies reach preliminary pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian and Iranian energy companies have reached a
preliminary agreement to build a power plant in the Iranian port
city of Bandar Abbas, an Italian official said Thursday.
	   The deal, signed a day earlier, involves Ansaldo Energia, the
energy branch of Italy's state-owned Finmeccanica-Ansaldo group,
and Iran Power and Development Co., an Ansaldo spokesperson said,
adding the deal would be worth about dlrs 400 million.
	   The agreement was part of broader commercial talks between Iran
and an Italian delegation led by Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who
arrived in Iran Tuesday and left late Wednesday.

UN concerned about intimidation of Serbs in Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council said Thursday it was
gravely concerned about the number of Serbs who have fled Croatia
because of intimidation and evictions and urged Belgrade to
integrate Serbs into society.
	   Large numbers of Serbs continue to emigrate because of security
incidents, ethnically-related intimidation, a ``dire'' economic
situation, bureaucratic obstacles, discriminatory legislation and
the stalled refugee program, the council said.
	   In a joint presidential statement, the 15-member council noted
that ``the overall situation in the Danube region is relatively
stable,'' and said it was satisfied with the performance of
Croatian police, who are monitored by U.N. police.
	   But it expressed concern that ethnically-related incidents,
evictions and housing intimidation cases hadn't stopped and had in
fact increased recently despite the large presence of Croatian
police in the region.
	   ``A continuation of this trend could have a seriously negative
effect on the restoration of a multi-ethnic society in the Republic
of Croatia,'' the council said.
	   It said it welcomed a June 20 decision by Belgrade to adopt a
program to return displaced people and urged full implementation of
the nationwide program as well as previous accords on eastern
Slavonia, the easternmost region of Croatia.
	   The council has repeatedly expressed concern about Croatia's
commitment to granting full rights and protections to ethnic Serbs
in the eastern Slavonia region, which was seized by Serb rebels
during the ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The region
returned to Croatian control Jan. 15 after two years under U.N.
administration.
	   In 1996, 65,000 Serb refugees were living in the region. Now
only 16,000 remain. Most Serb refugees lived in abandoned Croat
houses during six years of Serb rule in Eastern Slavonia.
	   About 100,000 Croat refugees are expected to return, and Serbs
who left apparently feared they would be evicted, despite
government promises to the contrary.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani man claiming to be a
nuclear scientist with confidential information about his country's
weapons program is actually a former low-level accountant at a
company that makes bathroom fixtures, a company official said
Thursday.
	   Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan, 29, is seeking asylum in New York
saying he fled Pakistan after learning his country was planning to
be the first to use nuclear weapons against its uneasy neighbor
India. Khan said he was a scientist with the Pakistan Atomic Energy
Commission working at a secret nuclear facility.
	   But Azad Gulzar Sheikh, a director of Forte Trading Company
(Pvt) Limited, was quoted by Pakistani news media as saying that
until recently Khan worked for him. Sheikh's company makes ceramic
tiles and bathroom fixtures and is based in the southern port city
of Karachi.
	   Sheikh said Khan resigned in November 1997, after more than four
years at the company, where he was employed as an assistant
accountant. He was earning the equivalent of $120 a month at the
time.
	   ``It was a shocking moment for me when I read newspaper reports
about the fake story,'' the privately run Pakistan news agency,
News Network International, quoted Sheikh as saying. Sheikh also
was interviewed by The Associated Press of Pakistan and Pakistan
Television.
	   Sheikh said Khan's father worked for an automaker in Chashma,
the site of one of Pakistan's nuclear facilities. But apparently
that was the only nuclear connection.
	   Khan is no scientist, Sheikh said, citing Khan's application for
employment, on which business was listed as his educational
background.
	   In New York, Khan told The Associated Press that he was in on a
high-level meeting of scientists in April during which Pakistan
decided on a first-strike strategy.
	   In May, both countries conducted their first on-the-record
nuclear tests, raising the prospect of a nuclear arms race in
volatile South Asia. Pakistan and India have fought three wars
since the subcontinent gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Pakistan denies Khan's allegations, saying it does not allow
scientists to attend meetings about combat strategy.
	   The Atomic Energy Commission, where Khan said he worked, issued
a statement on Thursday calling his story ``baseless, malicious,
fabricated and concocted.''
	   ``No such scientist of any such name has ever worked in any of
the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's sensitive nuclear
installations,'' the statement said.
	   In addition, the U.S. State Department has no information to
support Khan's claim that Pakistan was planning a pre-emptive
strike on Indian nuclear facilities, spokesman James Rubin said.
	   ``We do note significant discrepancies in his story as reported
in the press,'' Rubin said. He did not elaborate.

Novotna soars past Hingis, meets Tauziat in final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVE WILSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Tennis Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Three times near the end of a riveting
Wimbledon semifinal Thursday, Jana Novotna soared to spear lobs
with backhand smashes _ the toughest shot in tennis _ and each time
she made Martina Hingis cringe.
	   The last of those acrobatic, age-defying leaps set up triple
match point, and after a nervous balk of a toss into the shivery
breeze, Novotna closed out a 6-4, 6-4 victory with a serve that the
young defending champion dumped feebly into the net.
	   Novotna dropped to one knee, patted the turf to feel it for real
in her own fingers, then ran over to kiss Hingis on both cheeks.
	   ``You beat me last year, and I gave it to you back now,''
Novotna said.
	   ``Yes, you did,'' Hingis replied with a smile to her doubles
partner and fellow Czech native.
	   Moments later, when Hingis was asked how it felt to lose her
title, she winced and replied sarcastically, ``Great.''
	   But she quickly changed her expression and flashed a pained
grin.
	   ``Put on a smiley face, you know,'' she said.
	   If ever a Wimbledon crowd embraced a player, coaxing her game by
game with the warmest cheers and applause, it was Novotna.
	   ``It was absolutely stunning,'' Novotna said of the fans calling
her name.
	   They had witnessed her unhappy history on Centre Court and
wanted to share in her triumph. Many of the same fans sat in the
same seats for the 1993 finals when Novotna capitulated a huge lead
against Steffi Graf and sobbed on the Duchess of Kent's shoulder.
	   They saw Novotna waste a lead again in the final last year
against Hingis, and once more be comforted by the duchess, who
whispered an encouraging wish: third time lucky.
	   ``Let's just hope what the Duchess of Kent said last year is
right,'' said Novotna, who has a chance to fulfill that wish
Saturday when she goes for the title against Nathalie Tauziat, a
1-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 winner over Natasha Zvereva.
	   Tauziat, the lowest seeded finalist in history at No. 16, is
seeking to become the first Frenchwoman to win Wimbledon since
Suzanne Lenglen in 1925.
	   ``I'm not on the moon already, but almost,'' said Tauziat, who
talked herself past an embarrassing first set, settled down to beat
Zvereva with a solid all-court, and now is emerging from the
shadows for the first time in an undistinguished 15-year career.
	   ``I'm don't care if I'm in the shadow,'' Tauziat said. ``In
France I was always in the shadow because I wasn't in the system of
the federation. I made the choice to practice with a coach who the
federation doesn't like, and after my choice, that say play for
yourself. So I don't care if I'm in the highlight or the shadow.''
	   At a time when women's tennis has so many young stars like
Hingis, a 17-year-old with four Grand Slam titles already, and
Venus and Serena Williams, the pairing of Novotna and Tauziat in
the final is another sign that the old guard is not finished.
	   A month ago, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario captured the French Open
against Monica Seles. Now the match between the 30-year-old Tauziat
and the 29-year-old Novotna will be the oldest in a Wimbledon final
since 1977, when Virginia Wade, 31, beat Betty Stove, 32.
	   ``I said to myself, `I may be old, but I'm still all over the
court,''' Novotna said. ``Martina came there with some incredible
lobs, topspin lobs over my backhand, and the way I handled that was
just wonderful.
	   ``Really, it doesn't matter how old you are, or what it says on
the paper. The most important is how you feel. I know that I have
ben working really hard and playing some consistent tennis. I mean,
you don't see this happening too often, getting back-to-back
finals.''
	   Novotna fashioned this victory over Hingis with exquisite
grasscourt play, chipping and charging at every opportunity, mixing
up baseline rallies with serve-and-volley tactics. She overcame an
0-3 start in the first set to break Hingis three times, punishing
the teen's weak second serve, and broke her again to start the
second set.
	   ``After last year, I would never think that she's going to come
back again and have this great Grand Slam here at Wimbledon,'' said
Hingis, who won in three sets a year ago. ``But she's a great
player on grass.
	   ``She puts a lot of pressure on you because she closes up at the
net very well, and you have to go for your shots. I hit some great
shots which against other players would have been the point. She
always got it somehow with the slice, and you have to come back
again and again and again. Today I just wasn't patient enough.''
	   Unlike her losses in the Wimbledon finals to Graf and Hingis,
Novotna never tightened up this time when she grabbed a lead.
Rather, she played with a confidence and fluidity that looked
effortless.
	   She was at her athletic best in lunges for drop shots or leaps
for lobs, strokes that Hingis has used so effectively against
everyone else at Wimbledon. In the last few games, Novotna put on a
show that utterly frustrated Hingis.
	   At 3-3, Hingis was struggling to hold after three break points.
On the fourth deuce, Hingis lofted a lob she thought was good, but
Novotna flung herself upward and back and caught the ball with a
backhand smash that Hingis couldn't handle. Hingis flung her racket
into the net in disgust. She managed to hold with the help of a
service winner, and two games later, serving at 30-40, Hingis tried
another lob.
	   Once more Novotna spun and leaped, twisting in the air like a
contortionist, and she drilled another backhand smash for a winner
that gave her the crucial break and a 5-4 lead. Hingis doubled
over, then went slowly to the sideline as if she knew the match
would soon be finished.
	   And so it was. Novotna got to 40-love with one last backhand
smash off a lob, and sent it crosscourt. Hingis tried to scoop it
up, but could only flick it into the net.
	   Novotna didn't waste the opportunity, though one nervous moment
remained. She tossed up the ball for her final serve, but caught it
instead of hitting it. Maybe it was the breeze, maybe her
excitement as she stood on the brink of victory. But she smiled,
and the crowd chuckled with her, and the tension was broken.
Novotna tossed the ball up again and delivered a serve that Hingis
couldn't return.

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ A brief look at what happened Thursday
on the 10th day of the Wimbledon tennis championships:
	   Weather _ Heavily overcast and chilly. High temperature was 16
Celsius (60 Fahrenheit).
	   Attendance _ 29,236. Last year on the 10th day it was 31,724.
	   Results: Women's semifinal winners: No. 3 Jana Novotna, No. 16
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Upsets _ No. 1 Martina Hingis by No. 3 Jana Novotna.
	   Stat of the Day _ Hingis won only 38 percent of her second
serves.
	   Quote of the Day _ ``I guess I'm not the player I was last year.
I always said it was going to be much more difficult this year to
accomplish the same things. Sometimes it seems like the older, the
better. You see Tauziat on the other side in the finals and it's
amazing. I hope it's going to be like that with me also, the older,
the smarter, the cleverer, the better.''

Japan announces plan to resolve its banking crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from U.S.Treasury Secretary, paras 6-7.
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moving to answer criticism it hasn't done enough to
solve a banking crisis crippling the world's second-largest
economy, Japan announced a plan Thursday to gradually shut down
banks weakened by heavy loads of bad loans.
	   Modeled after the United States' bailout strategy for savings
and loan institutions in the 1980s, Japan's ``bridge bank'' scheme
is designed to keep credit flowing to healthy corporate borrowers
as the government takes over insolvent banks.
	   The plan is the latest attempt by the government to ease a
credit crunch and bad loan crisis that have been a major obstacle
to Japan's recovery from its worst recession since World War II.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga announced the widely expected
plan Thursday immediately after it was approved by a special
government task force set up last month.
	   ``It is of utmost importance that we restore confidence in our
banking system both inside and outside of Japan,'' Matsunaga said.
	   In Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin welcomed the
measures, calling them ``potentially significant steps toward
addressing its (Japan's) banking problems.''
	   Japan must ``move quickly to translate this approach into
concrete actions,'' he added.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has come under mounting
criticism for failing to deal effectively with the 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 546 billion) in bad loans left in the wake of a late 1980s
speculative ``bubble'' in real estate and stock prices.
	   Under the plan, banks found to be insolvent will be managed by
the Financial Supervision Agency, a new government watchdog agency,
while a merger partner is sought. Bridge loans will be provided to
corporate customers dependent on financing from the troubled banks.
	   When no suitor can be found, the banks will be taken over by a
state-funded holding company and then sold off or liquidated. Bad
loans will be handed over to special institutions and good loans
are to be transferred to healthy private banks.
	   The process is to be completed within a maximum of five years
and funded with up to 13 trillion yen (dlrs 93 billion) in taxpayer
money allocated from Japan's Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures
bank deposits.
	   Also announced Thursday were steps to strengthen special
institutions that have been set up to absorb and sell off bad loans
held by banks.
	   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rallied ahead of the
announcement, but some analysts questioned whether the plan will be
effectively implemented, noting the criteria for closing troubled
banks remain vague.
	   ``I really think it's going to be a big disappointment,'' said

	   ``They can serve up any sort of menu of opportunities to

the banking industry.
	   ``Other measures cannot control the situation,'' said Yoshihiro
Sakamoto, an adviser at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi Ltd. and a former
trade official. ``We have to use the credibility of the
government.''
	   The plan was the result of a series of brainstorming sessions by
officials from Japan's powerful bureaucracy and Hashimoto's
governing party. The task force was assembled last month after
Japan promised the United States and other trading partners that it
would take aggressive action to deal with its banking crisis.
	   The yen recently dropped to eight-year lows against the dollar
amid growing pessimism over the outlook for the Japanese economy,
prompting criticism Japan could deepen the Asian crisis by
triggering a wave of currency devaluations in neighboring
countries.
	   Adding to the governing Liberal Democratic Party's sense of
urgency is a set of elections on July 12 for the upper house of
Japan's bicameral Parliament.

Britain, the Commonwealth, welcome planned release of political
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS TO FIX CODING
prisoners in Nigeria
 &UR; With BC-Nigeria

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain welcomed U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan's announcement Thursday that political prisoners in Nigeria,
including Moshood Abiola, the west African state's leading
opposition figure, will soon be freed.
	   ``I hope that these prisoner releases will happen as soon as
possible,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said. ``This is one of the
key demands which we, together with our E.U. and Commonwealth
partners, have made in the search to restore democracy and human
rights in Nigeria,'' said Cook, who is planning to meet Secretary
General Annan in London on Saturday.
	   Emeka Anyaoku, Secretary General of the Commonwealth, the
54-nation club of Britain and its former colonies, said that the
prisoner release would open the way to the return of civilian
government in the oil-rich state.
	   ``I am convinced now that the military government will put in
place a credible transition to civil rule,'' Anyaoku said in a news
conference in the Nigerian city of Lagos.
	   On Thursday, Annan said that all political detainees would be
released by the country's military junta.
	   ``I'm leaving Nigeria with the stage set for the release of all
political detainees,'' Annan said in the Nigeria's capital, Abuja.
	   Nigeria's Council of State, which effectively functions as the
country's cabinet, met Thursday afternoon to discuss the releases.
Later Thursday or early Friday the Provision Ruling Council _ the
core of Nigeria's junta leaders _ will also meet, apparently to
rubber stamp the releases.
	   Abiola, 60, was elected president of Nigeria in 1993 in an
election annulled by Nigeria's military regime. The junta, led by
Gen. Sani Abacha, jailed Abiola a year later when he declared
himself president. After Abacha's death on June 8, junta officials
said that political prisoners would likely be released ``in time.''
	   Speaking in London, Abiola's daughter Wura said that Annan had
done a ``incredible job negotiating'' with Nigeria's military junta
over the release of the country's approximately 250 political
prisoners.
	   ``We're just very happy that my father is coming home at least
after four years of unjustified and inhumane treatment and
incarceration by the military,'' she said. Ms. Abiola said it was
too soon to predict her father's plans, saying he needed ``time to
reflect and to make the right decision for Nigeria going forward.''
	   France also welcomed the prospects of the release.
	   ``We cannot but welcome such a development if it materializes,''
said Alain Dejammet, the country's ambassador to the United
Nations.

Iranian Foreign Minister says U.S. tone is positive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's Foreign Minister praised the United
States approach toward his country Thursday as ``positive.''
	   Interviewed on television, Kamal Kharrazi said: ``We evaluate
the new tone of the United States, and its aim of ending enmity, as
positive.''
	   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami discussed relations with the
United States in his talks with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
on Wednesday, Kharrazi said.
	   Prodi, who ended two-day visit to Tehran late Wednesday, told
reporters that he had discussed his trip to Iran with U.S.
President Bill Clinton on the telephone.
	   Kharrazi said Prodi had told the government that the United
States wants to change its policy toward Iran.
	   The minister reinforced Wednesday's remarks by Khatami, who said
that while the United States had changed its tone, Tehran was
looking for deeds rather than words.
	   ``Goodwill cannot be assessed through tone and cannot be
considered as a criteria (for better relations) by itself,''
Kharrazi said.
	   ``The current situation cannot not be changed by words. It needs
a national will and American officials should demonstrate it
through actions.''
	   ``The United States should create a new atmosphere and prove
that they are going to respect Iran's independence and pursue
policies based on mutual respect.''
	   ``Otherwise, as our president said, the wall of mistrust cannot
be broken between Iran and the United States,'' the minister added.
	   In an interview with a U.S. television channel in January,
Khatami called for a break in the ``wall of mistrust'' between the
two nations.
	   Clinton said June 18 that Iran was ``changing in a positive
way'' that could lead to a return to normal relations.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the previous day
that while the gap between the United States and Iran remained
wide, ``it is time to test the possibilities for bridging this
gap.''

U.S. tries to blunt Arab drive to upgrade Palestinian status at
</HEADLINE>
U.N. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Arguing the shaky Middle East peace process
could be harmed, the U.S. administration is urging Arab and other
nations at the United Nations to stop trying to upgrade the
Palestinian mission to that of a virtual state.
	   Without a veto in the General Assembly, where the Palestinian
cause traditionally has support, the United States may be unable to
carry the day with its argument that this is not the time to come
down either on the side of the Palestinians or Israel on an
explosive issue like statehood.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization, headed by Yasser Arafat,
was ranked in 1974 as an ``observer'' at the United Nations. In
1988 the mission's designation was changed from PLO to
``Palestine,'' implying statehood, which gave Palestinian diplomats
considerable access and respect.
	   The Arabs now want to have the Palestinians essentially dealt
with as a state _ though without a vote.
	   In negotiations with Israel, Arafat hopes to gain a state on the
West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem. If bargaining does not
achieve his goal, the Palestinian leader has said he would declare
statehood unilaterally.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on the other hand,
insists there will be no Palestinian state and all of Jerusalem
will remain under Israel's sovereign control.
	   The Clinton administration has avoided a definitive statement on
a Palestinian state since the Oslo accords between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority in 1993 and 1995 provided that Jerusalem's
future be determined through negotiations. Before then, Secretaries
of State James A. Baker III and Warren Christopher and other senior
American officials had openly opposed establishment of a
Palestinian state.
	   ``The United States is strongly opposed to enhanced status for
the PLO at the United Nations, both because of its potentially
negative effects on the peace process and because of the bad
precedent it would set for the U.N. system itself,'' James P.
Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said Thursday.
	   ``We have repeatedly urged other U.N. members to oppose this
move, and we have urged both Israel and the Palestinians in general
to avoid unilateral actions that would prejudge the outcome of
negotiations. We view this effort as just such a unilateral
action,'' he said.
	   The General Assembly is due to take up the issue next week.

Japan announces plan to resolve its banking crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from U.S.Treasury Secretary, paras 6-7. and
treasury official, para 8.
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moving to answer criticism it hasn't done enough to
solve a banking crisis crippling the world's second-largest
economy, Japan announced a plan Thursday to gradually shut down
banks weakened by heavy loads of bad loans.
	   Modeled after the United States' bailout strategy for savings
and loan institutions in the 1980s, Japan's ``bridge bank'' scheme
is designed to keep credit flowing to healthy corporate borrowers
as the government takes over insolvent banks.
	   The plan is the latest attempt by the government to ease a
credit crunch and bad loan crisis that have been a major obstacle
to Japan's recovery from its worst recession since World War II.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga announced the widely expected
plan Thursday immediately after it was approved by a special
government task force set up last month.
	   ``It is of utmost importance that we restore confidence in our
banking system both inside and outside of Japan,'' Matsunaga said.
	   In Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin welcomed the
measures, calling them ``potentially significant steps toward
addressing its (Japan's) banking problems.''
	   Japan must ``move quickly to translate this approach into
concrete actions,'' he added.
	   Also in Washington, a senior U.S. Treasury official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that market confidence could only be
regained ``through timetables and concrete actions.''
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has come under mounting
criticism for failing to deal effectively with the 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 546 billion) in bad loans left in the wake of a late 1980s
speculative ``bubble'' in real estate and stock prices.
	   Under the plan, banks found to be insolvent will be managed by
the Financial Supervision Agency, a new government watchdog agency,
while a merger partner is sought. Bridge loans will be provided to
corporate customers dependent on financing from the troubled banks.
	   When no suitor can be found, the banks will be taken over by a
state-funded holding company and then sold off or liquidated. Bad
loans will be handed over to special institutions and good loans
are to be transferred to healthy private banks.
	   The process is to be completed within a maximum of five years
and funded with up to 13 trillion yen (dlrs 93 billion) in taxpayer
money allocated from Japan's Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures
bank deposits.
	   Also announced Thursday were steps to strengthen special
institutions that have been set up to absorb and sell off bad loans
held by banks.
	   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rallied ahead of the
announcement, but some analysts questioned whether the plan will be
effectively implemented, noting the criteria for closing troubled
banks remain vague.
	   ``I really think it's going to be a big disappointment,'' said
Betsy Daniels, a banking industry analyst in the Tokyo office of
Morgan Stanley.
	   ``They can serve up any sort of menu of opportunities to
restructure faster but it's not going to be meaningful until they
actually close down some institutions,'' she said.
	   But some welcomed the move to bring the government directly into
the banking industry.
	   ``Other measures cannot control the situation,'' said Yoshihiro
Sakamoto, an adviser at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi Ltd. and a former
trade official. ``We have to use the credibility of the
government.''
	   Adding to the governing Liberal Democratic Party's sense of
urgency is a set of elections on July 12 for the upper house of
Japan's bicameral Parliament.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A weakened virus that many consider the best hope
for an AIDS vaccine suffered a serious setback Thursday when tests
in adult monkeys showed it may actually cause the disease it was
meant to prevent.
	   The approach _ what scientists call a live, attenuated vaccine _
initially protects monkeys from getting infected with the simian
version of HIV.
	   However, the new work shows that over time, the weakened virus
can mutate into a lethal form that causes the disease it was meant
to prevent.
	   ``To me, this fortifies that we are not ready to go into humans
with a live attenuated vaccine,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
	   San Francisco-based Vaxgen Inc. recently gained Food and Drug
Administration approval to begin testing on humans of a possible
AIDS vaccine that doesn't contain a live strain of the virus.
	   But Dr. Robert Gallo of the University of Maryland said that if
the live attenuated approach fails, it means AIDS vaccine
development is no farther ahead than it was in 1984, when little
was known about the epidemic's cause.

	   SIENA, Italy (AP) _ Cheers and hoots went up Thursday at the
bareback, medieval-era Palio horserace, but not just for the
entrants -- the Italian and French premiers also had their share.
	   On the eve of the French-Italian soccers World Cup matchup in
France, Italy's Romano Prodi and France's Lionel Jospin turned out
here for one of Italy's oldest and most colorful events, held in
Siena's main, shell-shaped square.
	   The two premiers were showered with applause, but also had some
catcalls, including calls for fewer taxes and more work for young
people, the Italian news service ANSA reported from this Tuscan
town.
	   One cry went up: ``We will win 3-1,'' referring to Friday's
match in the quarterfinals. No side was mentioned, but in the
partisan crowd, presumably Italy was the predicted winner.
	   Winning horse represented the Goose neighborhood.
	   Residents in Siena's 17 neighborhoods, sporting colorful names
such as caterpillar, prepare all year for two races run during the
summer. Medieval-style parades and banquets accompany the event.

Study says cave dwellers had flair for making shoes

 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ There were no spiked heels, wing tips or cross
trainers. But footwear crafted by American cave dwellers thousands
of years ago was fashionable, tough and well-made.
	   ``My guess is that these shoes were very stylish for the time,''
said Michael J. O'Brien, an anthropologist who analyzed 35
specimens of sandals, moccasins and slip-ons unearthed in a cave in
the Midwestern state Missouri that was a popular campsite some
9,000 years ago.
	   The shoes also were very durable, he said. Of 35 samples
recovered, 20 were complete or almost complete. This enabled
O'Brien and co-researchers from Louisiana State University to
analyze and date the footwear for the first time, he said. A report
on the study will be published Friday in the journal Science.
	   The oldest specimen was a sandal made from a woven, fibrous
material that dated from about 9,400 years ago. The most recent,
about 1,000 years old, was a classic deerskin moccasin, probably
made for a child.
	   Even though the shoes spanned thousands of years, said O'Brien,
basic craftsmanship was about the same.
	   ``They did not invent something flimsy that then got better over
time,'' he said. ``The earliest shoe is every bit as well-made and
as complex as those from later on.''
	   There were a variety of styles and differences in crafting
details, suggesting concessions to style or fashion, O'Brien said.
	   ``There were no spike heels,'' he said, ``but there were
sling-backs (an open sandal with a cupping heel and a loop that
grasps the heel bone).'' Sling-backs are a common summer fashion
shoe even now.
	   Only the 1,000-year-old moccasins were made of leather, and the
researcher said it is likely the cave dwellers did not use leather
for shoes much earlier than that. The other shoes were made from
fibrous plants woven into a tough fabric used for the top, bottom
and sides of the footwear.
	   Footwear got hard use among prehistoric Americans. The people,
who have not been named, had to walk most places, as they had no
horses. They had to hunt or gather their food and haul water back
to the cave, all jobs that took much walking.
	   ``Many of the shoes wore down exactly the way that our shoes do
_ the ball of the foot and the heel,'' said O'Brien. ``In some
instances there were repairs where they wove fiber back into them.
Other shoes were just tossed, but they wore the heck out of these
things.''
	   The cave, in a bluff not far from the Missouri River, was a
spectacular home by the standards of the time. O'Brien said people
lived there for hundreds of generations and left layer after layer
of debris: bone and stone tools, animal bones, char from campfires
and even some human remains. Late in the occupancy, there were
shards of pottery.
	   The shoes and other artifacts were unearthed 40 years ago from
cave deposits. Only recently have researchers been able to
precisely date each of the footwear specimens.

French and Italian premiers turn out for Siena race

 &UR; EDS: ADDS premier's predictions for Friday's soccer match &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SIENA, Italy (AP) _ Cheers and hoots went up Thursday at the
bareback, medieval-era Palio horserace, but not just for the
entrants -- the Italian and French premiers also had their share.
	   On the eve of the French-Italian soccers World Cup matchup in
France, Italy's Romano Prodi and France's Lionel Jospin turned out
here for one of Italy's oldest and most colorful events, held in
Siena's main, shell-shaped square.
	   The two premiers were showered with applause, but also had some
catcalls, including calls for fewer taxes and more work for young
people, the Italian news service ANSA reported from this Tuscan
town.
	   One cry went up: ``We will win 3-1,'' referring to Friday's
match in the quarterfinals. No side was mentioned, but in the
partisan crowd, presumably Italy was the predicted winner.
	   After the race, the premiers, who also dined together, took a
stroll.
	   Their pick for Friday's soccer game?
	   ``I believe France will win 1-0, but I'll avoid saying it
here,'' Jospin was quoted as saying by the AGI news agency. ``I,
too, believe it will be 1-0 ... for Italy,'' Prodi followed up
quickly.
	   As for the horserace, the winning horse represented the Goose
neighborhood.
	   Residents in Siena's 17 neighborhoods, sporting colorful names
such as caterpillar, prepare all year for two races run during the
summer. Medieval-style parades and banquets accompany the event.

United Nations says missile that hit water plant was U.S. made
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BAG-101/102

<TEXT>
	   UMM QASR, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations confirmed Thursday that
the missile which smashed into the grounds of an Iraqi water
treatment plant was a U.S. weapon.
	   ``It was identified as a U.S.-manufactured HARM missile and an
investigation team found the manufacturer's name and serial
number,'' said Abdullah al-Zubair, the public relations officer of
the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission.
	   The United States has said that one of its F-16 fighter-bombers
fired a HARM missile at an Iraqi anti-aicraft battery Tuesday after
Iraqi radar had locked on to British warplanes patrolling a no-fly
zone in southern Iraq.
	   On Wednesday U.N. officials said a missile struck the
demilitarized zone along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border, but declined to
identify it as American.
	   Al-Zubair said there was no structural damage to the water
treatment plant.
	   ``There was a slight cosmestic damage to a storage building and
two broken windows in an adjacent building,'' he said.
	   Al-Zubair added that the missile had violated the demilitarized
zone, which was set up by the United Nations after the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   In Baghdad Thursday, the official Iraqi News Agency said the
government had asked the U.N. Security Council to put an end to
``such aggressive violations of its sovereignty, national security
and territorial integrity by the government of the United States.''
	   The agency said Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
had made the request in a letter to the council.
	   Iraq has denied that its radar tagged British warplanes.

Washington Monument goes into second phase of facelift
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Washington Monument goes into the second
phase of its facelift next week as workers prepare scaffolding to
restore its 112-year-old outer stones.
	   The monument is expected to remain open during the repairs,
which should be completed in 2000, said Jim Maddy, president of the
National Park Foundation, the fund-raising arm of the U.S. National
Park Service.
	   Scaffolding designed by architect Michael Graves will cover the
monument and will be erected in November, after which the work on
the stones can begin. The monument will remain visible throughout
the restoration through a design that combines blue outlining
fabric and semitransparent netting.
	   At night, the monument will gleam with hundreds of lights
attached to the scaffolding.
	   The design will allow crews to get to the monument to clean and
restore the 36,000 white marble-faced stones that comprise the
obelisk, which is 555 feet, 5[ inches high.
	   Private companies are paying most of the dlrs 9.4 million
restoration cost.
	   The monument was reopened in May after being closed for four
months for interior work that included repairing the aging elevator
and ventilating system. The final phase of repairs, to begin late
next year, will refurbish observation areas at the top, install new
exhibits and clean and polish 193 commemorative stones that line
the interior.
	   This is the first extensive repair project since the 1930s for
the monument, which was completed in 1884.

Government says opposition planned a series of bombings this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Dissidents planned to set off nine bombs
on the eve of a government celebration this week, Sudan's Interior
Minister said Thursday.
	   One bomb exploded, causing a fire at an oil depot in Khartoum
but inflicting no casualties, Abdul-Rahim Mohammed Hussein told a
news conference.
	   Experts managed to defuse the other eight bombs, which had been
planted in areas crowded with people, power stations and under a
bridge, he said.
	   ``We are sure there was a political plan behind this,'' Hussein
said.
	   The bombs were meant to go off on Tuesday during celebrations
marking the ninth anniversary of the 1989 military coup that
overthrew the elected government and brought President Omar
el-Bashir to power.
	   Hussein said several people had been arrested in connection with
the bombs.

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's most famous comic actor and
playwright, Theodore Beaubrun, has died after a long illness. He
was 79.
	   Beaubrun, who was known by his stage name Languichatte Debordus,
suffered from Parkinson's disease. He died Tuesday at his residence
in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Delmas.
	   In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Beaubrun was
especially remembered in Haiti for his television series
``Languichatte in the 20th Century,'' in which he gently mocked
social-climbing pretentiousness.
	   He also was a standup comedian and, on many tours, delighted
Creole and French-speaking Haitian communities in the United States
and Canada.
	   His son, Theodore Beaubrun Jr., is the leader of Haiti's most
famous roots music group, Boukman Eksperyans.
	   Haiti was planning a state funeral on Tuesday to honor
Beaubrun's contribution to Haitian culture.
	   Beaubrun is survived by his wife, Ginette, and nine children.

	   ``We evaluate the new tone of the United States, and its aim of
ending enmity, as positive,'' Kamal Kharrazi said in a television
interview.
	   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami discussed relations with the
United States in his talks with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
on Wednesday, Kharrazi said.
	   Prodi, who ended two-day visit to Tehran late Wednesday, said he
had discussed his trip to Iran with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
the telephone.
	   Kharrazi said Prodi had told the government that the United
States wants to change its policy toward Iran.
	   Clinton recently indicated that the United States is ready for a
new era of relations with Iran. Kharrazi praised the American
words, but said Tehran is now looking for new American actions.
	   ``The United States should create a new atmosphere and prove
that they are going to respect Iran's independence and pursue
policies based on mutual respect.''
	   ``Otherwise, as our president said, the wall of mistrust cannot
be broken between Iran and the United States,'' the minister added.
	   In an interview with a U.S. television channel in January,
Khatami called for a break in the ``wall of mistrust'' between the
two nations.
	   Clinton said June 18 that Iran was ``changing in a positive
way'' that could lead to a return to normal relations.

Drill cores find evidence of past Antarctic ice melting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Cores from holes drilled through thousands of
feet of ice in the Antarctic produced fossils that prove a massive
ice sheet in the polar region may have melted as recently as
400,000 years ago.
	   The finding, reported in the journal Science, suggests that a
huge deposit known as the West Antarctic ice sheet, goes through
natural cycles of melt and re-freeze over thousands of years.
	   Some scientists have warned that if the ice sheet melts it could
raise the level of all the world's oceans by about 16 feet, enough
to swamp seaside cities including Miami, Florida; New Orleans,
Louisiana; and Bangkok, Thailand.
	   Researchers from Uppsala University in Sweden and the California
Institute of Technology report in Science that an analysis of core
drillings from beneath the ice showed that ocean once lapped where
the ice now is. The cores brought up fossils of a type of algae
called diatoms, which live only in open sea.
	   The finding, said the researchers, shows that the southern
oceans were warmer during periods, such as now, between major ice
ages.
	   Reed P. Scherer, a researcher at Uppsala and the first author of
the study, argues in Science that the ice field area was free of
ice some time in the last 600,000 years and it could have been as
recently as 400,000.
	   A news report in Science notes that some scientists have
detected instabilities in the ice field and have predicted that it
could disintegrate as early as 500 to 700 years from now, with a
rapid sea-level rise starting after 2100.

Israel blocks roads in Gaza Strip, Palestinians protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with troops taking up positions, both sides bringing
in reinforcements; American, Egyptian efforts to mediate, defense
minister calling situation delicate; CORRECTS spelling to armored

<TEXT>
	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinian and Israeli
troops backed by armored personnel carriers where engaged in a
heated stand-off Thursday with both sides warning of violence
following a dispute over the use of roads in the Gaza Strip.
	   Troops from both sides took up positions on opposite sides of
main roads and brought in reinforcements after sunset.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai contacted American
peace envoy Dennis Ross and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas to urged Palestinians to open the roads, his
aide said. ``The situation is extremely delicate,'' said
Mordechai's spokesman Avi Beniahu.
	   At least three major intersections used by both Israelis and
Palestinians were blocked for more than eight hours, causing a
traffic back-up of hundreds of vehicles across the strip. Drivers
finally gave up, abandoned their vehicles and headed home on foot.
	   The dispute began earlier Thursday when Palestinian Authority
Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a
convoy of some 22 Palestinian cars to use a coastal route it
controls.
	   An Israeli army statement said Israeli soldiers allowed Shaheen
to use the road because he holds a VIP permit but asked the others
to turn back.
	   ``The supplies minister refused to continue on his way unless
all the other vehicles were allowed to pass,'' the statement said.
The army said that shortly afterwards, Palestinian police began
orchestrating ``intentional disturbances'' by setting-up roadblocks
at major intersections in the strip.
	   But Shaheen said Palestinians have been using the coastal road
for two months and blamed Israel for causing confusion.
	   ``Suddenly the Israeli soldiers blocked our way and prevented us
from using the road so I decided, along with the other drivers, to
stay here and we are going to stay as long as it takes to solve
this problem,'' said Shaheen, contacted on his cellular phone at
the site.
	   American and British diplomats had arrived at the area to try
and mediate between Israeli and Palestinian forces. Israel radio
later reported that Ross, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and
Egypt's ambassador to Israel were also trying to work out a way out
of tensions.
	   Earlier, Israeli and Palestinian troops blocked off sections of
road under their control throughout the strip and engaged in
heating shouting matches, with at least one incident of soldiers
pointing weapons at one another.
	   At Kfar Darom junction, near the Jewish settlement of the same
name, Israeli troops stationed three APCs in the middle of a road
linking two major Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds of vehicles were
brought to a standstill for some five hours. An army bulldozer
hauled in sand to set-up an extra military position near the
Israeli-controlled junction.
	   Israel's chief military commander in the area warned his
Palestinian counterpart that ``the provocation could lead to
clashes and to the unnecessary harm of human life on both sides,''
the Israeli army statement said. Israel asked the Palestinians to
``send senior officers to the intersections to clear the roadblocks
and allow for an orderly movement of cars in the area,'' the army
statement said.
	   Joint patrols between the two sides were suspended.
	   Arafat's Palestinian Authority gained autonomy over most of the
strip after signing a 1993 peace agreement with Israel. However
Israeli troops still control areas in the strip around several
small Jewish settlements in addition to Gaza's borders.
	   Some roads leading out of the strip into Israel proper are
shared while others are not and incidents of violent are common in
areas where Israelis and Palestinian come into contact.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish police arrested 39 Colombian
citizens suspected of participating in an international
organization laundering millions of dollars from drug trafficking,
authorities said on Thursday.
	   Police spokesman Antonio Jimenez said the arrests were made June
23 in several houses and offices after an eight-month investigation
of a money laundering operation of six billion pesetas (dlrs 39
million) from cocaine.
	   Over two years, the suspects, posing as employees at three
public utility companies, converted huge amounts of Spanish pesetas
into dollars in downtown Madrid banks without raising suspicion,
Jimenez said. The suspects had no previous records.
	   Also as part of the operation, police seized 83 million pesetas
(dlrs 543,483), eight cars, a motorbike, 160 grams of cocaine,
jewelry, computer software and machines to count money and detect
false bank notes.

Chrysler to invest dlrs 1.5 billion in Mexico over five years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALTILLO, Mexico (AP) _ Chrysler Corp. announced Thursday it
will invest dlrs 1.5 billion over the next five years to upgrade
equipment and train workers at its eight Mexico manufacturing
plants.
	   The investment plan does not include any new Mexican
manufacturing facilities at this time although productivity will be
increased, Miles Bryant, director of Chrysler's Mexico unit, and
Roberto Gutierrez, the manufacturing director, told a news
conference.
	   ``We will continue to invest in those facilities to improve the
productivity and the quality,'' Bryant said.
	   The conference followed the inauguration of the company's dlrs
170 million light truck stamping plant, adjacent to a
three-year-old truck assembly near the northern city of Saltillo.
	   Chrysler also has a four-cylinder engine plant in the Saltillo
area, along with facilities in Mexico City and in Toluca.
	   Mexican President Ernest Zedillo attended the Chrysler
inauguration and other official opening ceremonies nearby including
Hamilton Beach-Proctor Silex de Mexico SA, Grupo Industrial
Saltillo SA, and Trinity Industries de Mexico SA.
	   Byrant said that Chrysler sales in June were up 121 percent over
the same month in 1997 and that overall domestic car and truck
sales are expected to reach 105,000 from 67,000 last year.
	   The company expects to produce about 400,000 cars and light
trucks in Mexico in 1988, he said.

Villagers welcome Clinton, whoever he is
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Window on China &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YUCUN, China (AP) _ The villagers in tiny Yucun, which U.S.
President Bill Clinton visited by boat from Guilin, were agog over
the presidential appearance _ even if some had no idea who the
visitor was.
	   Eighty-eight-year-old Qu Zhenxin sat quietly, awaiting the
president's arrival at her family's home, scrubbed clean for the
occasion.
	   ``I know he's coming, but I've never heard of him before,'' she
told reporters. ``I am very glad he's coming and want to welcome
him to the village.''
	   In a village where many homes had cable TV but not telephones,
many people said they knew of Clinton through television.
	   Even in Yucun, a village of 500 accessible only by boat or a
two-mile walk over a dirt path, villagers were thinking of
Clinton's visit in global _ and economic _ terms.
	   ``We are very happy he's coming,'' said Zhao Jiashuai. ``I am
hoping it will increase friendly relations. I also hope it will
bring economic development to the village.''
	    &UR; ___
	   The 500-year-old village was chosen for a Clinton visit in part
to showcase its biogas plant, which processes human waste and
converts the gas emissions to power for cooking and boiling water.
	   Clinton surveyed the stove where waste was being processed in a
big pot and asked how it worked. A man stepped to the stove,
proudly turned the knob on and off, smiled at Clinton and shook his
hand.
	   Chelsea Clinton was particularly interested in the process and
later told her father the locals had come up with the idea
themselves.
	   ``There are lots of rural places all over the world that should
be doing this with biogas,'' Clinton said. ``This is one of the
things that almost any village could be doing. It's very
important.''
	    &UR; ___
	   Almost as exciting for the villagers as the presidential
appearance was the digital camera of one of the visiting
photographers.
	   Children hammed it up and parents clapped their hands with
delight at the photographic images that could be viewed immediately
on the camera.
	   Chelsea got into the spirit by pulling out her own camera to
take photos as the first family visited the homes of several
townspeople.
	    &UR; ___
	   The president said his visit to the village was an important
addition to his understanding of China.
	   ``You learn a lot about the country from places like this,'' he
said. ``There is a larger percentage of Chinese people from places
like this than in the big cities, which is hard to imagine when you
think of how many people live in places like Beijing and
Shanghai.''
	   He got a particular kick out of his visit to the village store,
where he examined the local version of a cash register.
	   ``Look at this,'' he called out. ``An abacus for the store, for
counting.''
	   He pushed the beads around and pronounced that it ``still works
pretty well.''
	   ``I love it. I love it,'' he said later of his village tour.
``It was fascinating. I mean the idea that it's been here for over
500 years, remarkable old buildings, nice people. I got to visit
the little country store. I told them my grandfather had such a
store.''

study says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Volcanoes on a moon of Jupiter called Io may
be the hottest place in the solar system outside the sun itself,
researchers say.
	   Using instruments orbiting Jupiter on the Galileo spacecraft,
researchers calculated the temperature of lava spewing from
volcanoes on Io. They found that 12 vents had temperatures of 2,200
degrees F (just over 1,200 C) and that one vent was as hot as 3,100
degrees (more than 1,700 C).
	   The temperature of lava erupting to the surface on Earth is
generally around 2,000 F, or almost 1,100 C, according to standard
references.
	   ``The very hot lavas erupting on Io are hotter than anything
that has erupted on Earth for billions of years,'' said Alfred
McEwen, lead author of a study appearing Friday in the journal
Science. ``They are the highest surface temperatures in the solar
system other than the sun itself.''
	   Io is so far from the sun, about 1.2 billion miles, that most of
its surface is well below freezing. Only in or near the volcano
vents is the moon's surface warm.

the 1995 Dayton peace agreement, which ended the 3 1/2-year Bosnian
war and divided the country a Serb repulblic and Muslim-Croat
federation while seeking to preserve links between them.
	   The previous meetings were in London in December 1996 and Bonn,
Germany last December.
	   Carlos Westendorp, the top international mediator in Bosnia, and
NATO secretary-general Javier Solana will also attend the December
conference to review how well Bosnian leaders are fulfilling the
Dayton peace accord.

Government says opposition planned a series of bombings this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Dissidents planned to set off nine bombs
on the eve of a government celebration this week, Sudan's Interior
Minister said Thursday.
	   One bomb exploded, causing a fire at an oil depot in Khartoum
but inflicting no casualties, Abdul-Rahim Mohammed Hussein told a
news conference.
	   Experts managed to defuse the other eight bombs, which had been
planted in areas crowded with people, power stations and under a
bridge, he said.
	   ``We are sure there was a political plan behind this,'' Hussein
said.
	   The bombs were meant to go off on Tuesday during celebrations
marking the ninth anniversary of the 1989 military coup that
overthrew the elected government and brought President Omar
el-Bashir to power.
	   Hussein said several people had been arrested in connection with
the bombs.

Sorenstam slips but doesn't sink at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's play; will be UPDATED with later
finishers &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Just as in 1997, Annika Sorenstam
bungled her way to a triple-bogey in the first round of the U.S.
Women's Open. Unlike last year, the two-time champion's game didn't
collapse.
	   Sorenstam overcame a calamitous 7 on the par-4, 409-yard
(372-meter) fifth hole Thursday to finish at par-71 at the
Blackwolf Run Golf Course.
	   ``I think I played really good golf _ on 17 holes,'' said
Sorenstam, the 1995 and '96 Open winner. ``There was just one hole
I had trouble on.''
	   Sorenstam recovered on the strength of five birdies, including
one on the final _ and toughest _ hole, a par-4, as did playing
partner Laura Davies, who grabbed the early first-round lead at
3-under-par 68.
	   More than half the 150 golfers still were out on a course
softened by overnight drizzle. One of them, Helen Alfredsson of
Sweden, had a hole-in-one on the par-3 eighth hole.
	   Davies had said she didn't anticipate making the cut, but that's
all changed for the Englishwoman.
	   ``Now I hope to be playing all four rounds,'' said Davies, who
nonetheless felt rotten about her game. ``I'm so low on confidence,
that's the trouble,'' she said. ``Out there today, I was
panicking.''
	   One player who might be on her way back to England early is
defending champion Alison Nicholas, whose 78 threatened to knock
her from weekend qualification, just as poor play did in Sorenstam
last year.
	   Sorenstam went into last year's Open trying to become the first
player to win the women's most prestigious title three straight
times. But a 77 in the first round ended her hopes and a 73 the
next day put her three strokes shy of the 36-hole cut.
	   This week, Sorenstam returned to the Open playing perhaps the
best golf of her life, with victories in her last two starts and 10
top-10 finishes in 11 tournaments, including seven times in the top
four.
	   But when she triple-bogeyed the fifth hole, teeing off into the
water on the right, then chipping over the green, Sorenstam
couldn't help but think about that triple-bogey at Pumpkin Ridge
last year.
	   ``For a few seconds, I did,'' Sorenstam said. ``But I told
myself, `This is only Thursday, put this behind you and go on.
There are a lot of good holes to come up.'
	   ``I won't give up,'' Sorenstam added. ``I'm going to keep
grinding. That's the lesson I learned last year.''
	   Leslie Spalding, Se Ri Pak and Pat Hurst fired 69s on the Pete
Dye-designed layout renowned for its fast greens that once prompted
Ernie Els to suggest the women practice their putts in a bathtub.
	   The course was indeed demanding but not backbreaking.
	   ``The course is perfect,'' Spalding said. ``I guess we got a
little rain last night, so it is a little softer out there.''
	   U.S. Open courses are longer than those the women usually play,
and that favors big, accurate hitters such as Davies and Sorenstam.
At 6,412 yards (5,834-meters) Blackwolf Run is the second-longest
ever played at a Women's Open.
	   ``I like a course where long hitters are given a chance,''
Davies said. ``All year we play such short golf courses that I
could hit my 5-iron off a tee and still be in play. This is nice
where you hear girls struggling and they're whining about hitting
woods in. I think it's fabulous.''
	   After 36 holes, the 60 lowest scorers and any tying for 60th
place, or anyone within 10 strokes of the lead, will make the cut.
The winner will receive dlrs 267,500 from the purse of dlrs 1.5
million.

Israel blocks roads in Gaza Strip, Palestinians protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with troops taking up positions, both sides bringing
in reinforcements; American, Egyptian efforts to mediate, defense
minister calling situation delicate. &QL;

	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinian and Israeli
troops backed by armored personnel carriers were engaged in a
heated standoff Thursday, with both sides warning of violence
following a dispute over the use of roads in the Gaza Strip.
	   Troops from both sides took up positions on opposite sides of
main roads and brought in reinforcements after sunset. Israeli,
American, British and Egyptian officials were trying to defuse the
situation.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai contacted American
peace envoy Dennis Ross and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, to urge Palestinians to open the roads, his
aide said.
	   ``The situation is extremely delicate,'' said Mordechai's
spokesman Avi Beniahu.
	   At least three major intersections used by both Israelis and
Palestinians were blocked, causing a traffic back-up of hundreds of
vehicles across the strip.
	   The dispute began when a minister in Arafat's Palestinian
Authority demanded that Israel allow a convoy of about 22
Palestinian cars to use a coastal route it controls.
	   An Israeli army statement said Israeli soldiers allowed
Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz Shaheen to use the road
because he holds a VIP permit but asked the others to turn back.
	   However, Shaheen ``refused to continue on his way unless all the
other vehicles were allowed to pass,'' the statement said. Soon
afterward, Palestinian police began setting up roadblocks at major
intersections, blocking all traffic, it said.
	   Shaheen blamed the Israelis for the confusion, saying
Palestinian drivers had been using the coastal road for two months.
	   ``Suddenly the Israeli soldiers blocked our way and prevented us
from using the road, so I decided, along with the other drivers, to
stay here and we are going to stay as long as it takes to solve
this problem,'' Shaheen said by cellular phone from the site.
	   American and British diplomats had arrived at the area to try to
mediate between the two sides. Israel radio later reported that
Ross, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Egypt's ambassador
to Israel were also trying to work out a way out of tensions.
	   Earlier, Israeli and Palestinian troops blocked off sections of
road under their control throughout the strip and engaged in
heating shouted matches.
	   Arafat's Palestinian Authority gained autonomy over most of the
strip after signing a 1993 peace agreement with Israel. However
Israeli troops still control areas in the strip around several
small Jewish settlements in addition to Gaza's borders.
	   Some roads leading out of the strip into Israel proper are
shared while others are not and incidents of violence are common in
areas where Israelis and Palestinian come into contact.
	   At a junction near the Kfar Darom settlement, Israeli troops
stationed three armored personnel carriers in the middle of a road
linking two major Gaza Strip cities, bringing hundreds of vehicles
to a standstill for about five hours. An army bulldozer hauled in
sand to set up an extra military position near the
Israeli-controlled junction.
	   Israel said the Palestinians had blocked roads at three major
intersections near Jewish settlements. The chief Israeli commander
in the area warned his Palestinian counterpart ``the provocation
could lead to clashes and to the unnecessary harm of human life on
both sides,'' the Israeli army statement said.
	   Palestinian officials halted joint patrols with the Israelis.

World Cup: Danes are hungry for more success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Satisfied for clinching an unprecedented
quarterfinal berth? Not the Danes. They may be underdogs against
Brazil, but still are hungry for more.
	   ``They tell me that 'you don't know us really yet' and that's
very positive,'' said Swedish coach Bo Johansson on the eve of the
game. ``I don't think they're satisfied. They want more all the
time. They're very competitive. Their willpower to win one more
match is tremendous. But you never know if it's enough to beat
Brazil. We didn't know if it was enough to beat Nigeria ...it's
exciting.''
	   Scandinavian teams have been successful against Brazil in past
World Cups, other tournaments and friendlies. Denmark and Norway
are unbeaten against Brazil. Sweden, Scandinavia's all-time leader,
had mixed results, including a loss as host of the 1958 Cup.
	   The Norwegians edged Brazil _ already assured of winning Group A
_ in a match (2-1) they needed to win to make the second round, a
year after winning a friendly 4-2 against Ronaldo and company in
Oslo.
	   Denmark blanked Brazil 4-0 last time they met in Danish soccer's
Centennial tournament nine years ago in Copenhagen and is also
unbeaten (in two games) against the South Americans. And Sweden,
Johansson's native country, drew Brazil 1-1 in group play four
years ago in the United States before losing 1-0 in the semifinals
to the eventual world champions on a late game-winner by Romario.
	   Is there a coincidence that the Scandinavians do so well against
Brazil?
	   ``I haven't thought about that,'' said Michael Laudrup,
Denmark's best player ever who's quitting the game at age 34 after
this World Cup. ``Any team that can beat Brazil twice in a year ...
it's something fantastic. I just ask if we could beat them once.''
	   Laudrup, the creative hub against Nigeria in the round of eight
when he set up two goals with brilliant passes, will never forget
his first match against Brazil. He scored two goals and just missed
a hat trick in the late stages.
	   ``To be honest, not many players can say they beat Brazil 4-0,''
said Laudrup, who refused to play for the Danes in 1992 when they
won their only major trophy, the European Championship final in
Sweden.
	   ``Tomorrow's game is one of the most important in Danish
football history and I'm sure it will be a great game. The only
thing we want to do is to try to play our best, play like the other
day (against Nigeria). If we can do that, you can't ask for more.
Then we can see if it's enough.'' Like its Scandinavian neighbors
Sweden and Denmark, teamwork is one of the most important weapons
for Denmark.
	   ``It's one of the best qualities of this team,'' Laudrup said.
''In the bad and good moments we're always together. We have a very
good relationship even if we've been together for many weeks in
France.
	   ``On the field, maybe the best thing is that you never know what
you get. It's like a gift for a little child.' So what is needed to
beat Brazil again? ``We need to play very good,'' Laudrup said.
	   ``We need to be lucky. And we need that Brazil is not having the
best day. Then it's possible. Otherwise, it looks it a little bit
difficult.''
	   One advantage for Denmark certainly is goalkeeping. Taffarel,
the Brazilian goalie, is not bad. But Peter Schmeichel is arguably
the world's best. He proved it in the 1992 European Championships
and is ready to prove it again. Asked about Ronaldo, the great Dane
said: ``I'm ready for anybody.''
	   Brian Laudrup, Michael's kid brother who's heading to Cup
Winner's Cup champion Chelsea next season, said Schmeichel's
presence between the sticks gives the team extra confidence.
	   ``He's the world's best keeper, no doubts about that,'' Brian
Laudrup said. `` His charisma is tremendous, and even Ronaldo will
be intimidated if he goes through against him.
	   ``Peter frightens attacking players and they know they will have
to produce something extra-special to beat him. That's how
important he is to us.''
	   Johansson agrees.
	   ``Peter is the number one in the world,'' the coach said. ``I
knew that before we came here and I've not changed my mind. He is a
great personality. If you're going to win a match like this, you
have to have a great goalkeeper and that's what we have.''

Three tenors praise England soccer team's heroic performance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's contingent of soccer hooligans may not
have won many fans during the World Cup, but their soccer team's
gritty performance against Argentina won the approval of opera
superstars Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras.
	   The Three Tenors have written to each member of the England team
- and manager Glen Hoddle - to congratulate them on an ``heroic''
performance.
	   England lost a penalty shoot-out with Argentina after a fiercely
contested 2-2 draw Tuesday which saw England play most of the match
with only 10 men against Argentina's 11 after midfield star David
Beckham was sent off.
	   Writing to ``Dear Glen and the England team,'' the three said:
``Having seen the heroics performed by all of you on Tuesday night,
we would like to send you our commiserations, but also our
congratulations on such a classic performance.
	   The three also sent each member of the team a copy of their
latest single, ``You'll Never Walk Alone,'' written by Liverpool
rock band Gerry and the Pacemakers in 1963 and which is often sung
at soccer matches in England.
	   The three stage a spectacular concert in Paris on July 10 ahead
of the World Cup final.

McCombs is successful bidder on Vikings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Red McCombs, former owner of the National
Basketball Association's San Antonio Spurs, has been chosen as the
Minnesota Vikings' new owner and will keep the National Football
League franchise in Minnesota.
	   Vikings co-owner James Jundt said the purchase price is at least
dlrs 200 million, the same figure that author Tom Clancy had agreed
to pay for the team. Clancy pulled out two months ago after he was
unable to raise the money.
	   Team attorney John Mooty said he expects the NFL, which will
insist on keeping the team where it is, to approve it quickly.
	   Another confirmed bidder was Minnesota Timberwolves owner Glen
Taylor. But Mooty declined to identify the other bidders. Team
president Roger Headrick, who challenged Clancy's bid, had been
expected to make a bid, but decided at the last minute not to join
the bidders.
	   When bids first were taken in February, Clancy's dlrs 200
million offer was chosen over offers from Headrick (dlrs 186
million) and McCombs (dlrs 178.5 million). But Clancy didn't have
enough money to make good on his offer, and it fell apart.
	   McCombs, co-founder of the umbrella company that owns the Twin
Cities' Fox TV affiliate, has no co-investors.

GM says slow-moving car lines could be axed earlier than planned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks recessed until Friday.
 &UR; By BRIAN S. AKRE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Auto Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ General Motors Corp. is signalling that some of
its slower-selling cars may be eliminated from the automaker's U.S.
and Canadian model lineup sooner than expected because of two
costly strikes.
	   But talk of dropping more models and possibly closing some aging
plants can only add to GM's tensions with the United Auto Workers,
whose strikes at two Flint parts plants have all but halted GM's
North American production.
	   Negotiations at the plants concluded with no settlement Thursday
and were to resume Friday. Vice President Norm McComb of UAW Local
659 said talks at one of the plants, the Flint Metal Center, had
accomplished nothing.
	   Most analysts agree that GM needs to trim its model roster
further to bring its per-vehicle profitability more in line with
that of Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and foreign automakers.
	   ``It's not a radical strategy,'' analyst Scott Merlis of Merlis
Automotive International Inc. said Thursday. GM already has reduced
its lineup from 109 models four years ago to 80 Thursday.
	   At a news conference Wednesday, marketing chief Ronald L.
Zarrella said GM faced a sharp drop in market share if the strike
continued through July, and that GM was looking at the strikes'
financial effects ``on every aspect of the business.'' He
acknowledged that ``there's still some overlap'' in GM's lineup _
cars that compete with each other.
	   ``We may well take this situation as an opportunity to move up
some future plans in terms of eliminating overlap in our
portfolio,'' Zarrella said. ``We have more cars than we need and
not enough trucks. One of the outcomes of this may be getting out
of those cars faster.''
	   While Zarrella's comments were aimed at UAW leaders as much as
Wall Street, analysts said GM appears serious about killing off
slow-selling lines.
	   ``I don't think this is bluster,'' analyst Joseph Phillippi of
Lehman Brothers said. ``There's been plenty of talk inside the
organization about how many entrants they need to serve all those
market segments.
	   ``When you stack them up against Ford or against Honda or
against Toyota and look at the number of offerings they have
relative to their overall volume, it's clear they don't need all
those models.''
	   Two models most likely to go first are the Pontiac Firebird and
Chevrolet Camaro made at the St. Therese plant in Quebec. The two
so-called ``pony cars'' date back to 1967, when GM was forced to
respond to the staggering popularity of Ford's Mustang.
	   Nearly 172,000 GM workers have been idled because of the
strikes. Before GM's two-week summer vacation shutdown began
Monday, 26 of the company's 29 major, wholly-owned assembly plants
in North America had been idled by the strikes. The only plant
still operating during the shutdown is GM's Ramos Arizpe small-car
plant in Mexico.

Security Council extends Libya sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided Thursday to
extend sanctions against Libya, saying it hadn't complied with U.N.
demands to turn over two suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The decision, made after a periodic review, was another setback
to Libya, which has been pushing to have the six-year-old sanctions
lifted based on Col. Moammar Gadhafi's offer to send the suspects
to a third country or an international tribunal for trial.
	   U.S. and British governments insist they be tried in the United
States or Scotland, as required under a 1992 council resolution
which imposed an arms and aviation embargo to force Gadhafi to hand
over the suspects.
	   ``The problem here is not six years of sanctions, but six years
of Libyan obstruction in efforts to bring to justice those
responsible for 270 deaths of people from 27 different countries,''
said Nancy Soderberg, a deputy U.S. representative.
	   China and Russia, who are also permanent council members, have
called for more flexibility in considering Libya's proposals.
	   But council president, Sergey Lavrov of Russia, told reporters
the council ``could not agree that necessary conditions exist to
change the sanctions regime.''

Jury receives Don King case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The jury in the insurance fraud trial of boxing
promoter Don King received the case Thursday after four days of
closing arguments.
	   A half hour later, the jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
sent several notes requesting evidence.
	   In one note, it asked whether the U.S. government was
``interested'' in King before the cancellation of a 1991 bout that
led to the current case.
	   King stood at the side of the courtroom nodding his head to
indicate that he believed the government had pursued him before
1991.
	   In his closing arguments, King's lawyer, Peter Fleming Jr.,
suggested to the jury that he believed the government had
overstepped its authority in its pursuit of King.
	   The trial, which began in mid-April, has centered on whether
King cheated Lloyd's of London out of dlrs 350,000 by faking a
contract for the canceled bout between Cesar Chavez and Harold
Brazier.
	   If convicted of nine counts of wire fraud, King could face up to
45 years in prison.
	   His company, Don King Productions Inc., is also charged in the
case.

Alfredsson aces eighth hole at Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Helen Alfredsson of Sweden on Thursday
became the 13th golfer to score a hole-in-one in the 53-year
history of the U.S. Women's Open.
	   Alfredsson aced the 152-yard (138-meter), par-3 eighth hole at
Blackwolf Run Golf Course. It was her second career ace. Her first
came in 1996 during the third round of the Chrysler-Plymouth
Tournament of Champions.
	   The last hole-in-one in an Open was by Susie Redman, who aced
the 15th hole at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Course in Oregon last year.
	   Nancy Porter is the only golfer to accomplish the feat twice.
She hit a hole-in-one at Winged Foot in Mamaroneck, New York in
1972 and duplicated the feat four years later at Rolling Green in
Springfield, Pennsylvania.

Casey is not so mighty in Hartford
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EVAN BERLAND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CROMWELL, Connecticut (AP) _ His golf cart was fine. Casey
Martin's golf game was another matter.
	   Martin, who won the right this year to drive a cart while on the
PGA Tour, took advantage of a sponsor exemption for the first time
to move up from the Nike Tour and play the Canon Greater Hartford
Open.
	   He shot a 1-over-par 71 Thursday and said he was too focused to
acknowledge any milestones.
	   ``It never crossed my mind, honestly,'' he said.
	   What did occupy his thoughts was the 6,820-yard (6,206-meter)
TPC at River Highlands, which is his first stop since the U.S. Open
two weeks ago.
	   ``This is no piece of cake, this is an extremely hard course,''
he said. ``If I end up making it out here I've got to really
elevate my game to be able to compete.''
	   Martin started his round on the back nine, getting a birdie on
the par-5, 523-yard (475-meter) No. 13 with a 10-foot putt.
	   Two holes later, the long-ball hitter pulled a driver from his
bag in an attempt to reach the par-4, 296-yard (269-meter) No. 15.
But he drove into the woods, chopped his way onto the fairway and
bogeyed the hole.
	   Martin's only other birdie came on the par-5 sixth, which has 15
bunkers and is touted as the tour's sandiest hole.
	   Martin, who has a birth defect that weakens his right leg, is
ranked 17th on the Nike Tour money list, with a victory in his
first event. He earned an additional dlrs 34,043 when he tied for
23rd at the U.S Open two weeks ago.
	   A magistrate ruled in February that Martin can use his cart for
PGA Tour events. The case drew national attention, and on Thursday
about 50 fans followed him around the course.
	   Martin said he appreciated the support, even as he tried to
block out the commotion and concentrate on the round. But he has a
special place in his heart for the several people in wheelchairs
who watched him play.
	   ``These people kind of get shunned and I try to make a point to
at least say, `Hi,''' he said. ``It seems like every time I play
there's at least a couple. That's great, I love it.''

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Jose Hernandez hit a tie-breaking, two-run single
in the sixth inning, and the Chicago Cubs beat the Arizona
Diamondbacks 3-2 Thursday to win consecutive games for the first
time in three weeks.
	   Since a 10-game winning streak from May 29-June 8, the Cubs have
gone just 7-15. Sammy Sosa, who hit a record 20 homers in June to
raise his season total to 33, went 0-for-3.
	   Steve Trachsel (7-5), who had lost his four previous decisions,
matched his career high with nine strikeouts, allowing one run and
seven hits in 7 2-3 innings. Rod Beck pitched the ninth for his
20th save in 24 chances, allowing Devon White's 13th homer.
 &UR; Mariners 10, Rockies 3
	   In Seattle, Ken Griffey Jr. homered for the fourth consecutive
game, hitting his AL-leading 35th and tripling as the Mariners beat
up Darryl Kile and the Colorado Rockies.
	   Russ Davis also homered as Seattle hammered Kile (5-11) with 10
runs in the first two innings.
	   Griffey hit a two-run triple in the six-run first, then led off
the second with an opposite-field shot to left. Griffey, who led
the AL with 56 homers last season, is two behind the Cardinals'
Mark McGwire, the major league leader.
	   The homer gave Griffey six consecutive extra-base hits, one shy
of the major league record; he had a homer and three doubles in his
last four at-bats Wednesday night.
 &UR; Orioles 5, Marlins 3
	   In Baltimore, Rafael Palmeiro homered for the fourth consecutive
game and the Orioles stopped their eight-game losing streak by
finally defeating the Florida Marlins.
	   Rookie Sidney Ponson allowed two runs and seven hits in six
innings to help Baltimore to its first victory since June 22.
Ponson (2-6), who gave up 15 runs in his previous two starts,
struck out four and walked none.
	   The eight-game skid was one short of the Orioles' longest of the
season. Baltimore lost nine straight May 14-22.
	   It was the first time in two years Baltimore beat the Marlins.
Florida swept three at home last season and won the first two games
of this three-game interleague series.
 &UR; Braves 6, Devil Rays 0
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Greg Maddux pitched his second
straight shutout to beat Rolando Arrojo in a matchup of All-Star
pitchers, leading the Atlanta Braves over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
6-0 Thursday.
	   Maddux (12-2), the winningest pitcher in the majors, has won 10
consecutive decisions, the longest current streak in the majors. He
pitched a five-hitter for his sixth complete game and fourth
shutout of the season.
	   The four-time Cy Young Award winner, who has pitched 18
consecutive scoreless innings, struck out eight and walked one in
the 27th shutout of his career.
	   Keith Lockhart homered twice, a solo shot in the sixth off
Arrojo (10-5) and a three-run drive of Jim Mecir in the ninth.
Chipper Jones also hit a solo homer as the Braves swept the
three-game series and finished interleague play 9-7.

Tense showdown between Israeli and Palestinian troops; Gaza sealed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs; UPDATES with Israel sealing the Gaza Strip &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In the tensest showdown in nearly
two years, Israeli and Palestinian troops on Thursday scuffled and
later pointed guns at one another from hastily dug fortifications
outside Jewish settlements in the southern Gaza Strip.
	   A seemingly routine argument over the use of a road led to the
confrontation which quickly escalated. Scores of Palestinian trucks
blocked access roads to the settlements and in response, Israel
brought in armored personnel carriers and sealed off the entire
Gaza Strip.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai appealed to the U.S.
Mideast peace envoy, Dennis Ross, and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, for help in defusing the situation.
	   ``The situation is extremely delicate,'' said Mordechai's
spokesman Avi Beniahu.
	   There has been sporadic friction between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police in recent months. However, Thursday's standoff
was the tensest since September 1996 gun battles between Israeli
and Palestinian troops in which scores of people were killed.
	   About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is controlled by the
Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops are deployed in and near
Jewish settlements and control several access roads. Israeli and
Palestinian troops conduct joint patrols on major thoroughfares.
	   Thursday's incident began in the afternoon when Palestinian
Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a
convoy of 22 Palestinian cars to use a coastal route it controls.
	   Israeli soldiers allowed Shaheen to use the road because as a
Cabinet minister he has special privileges, but asked the other
motorists to turn back. Shaheen insisted that all cars be allowed
to pass.
	   Dozens of Palestinian police arrived at the scene and quickly
engaged in shouting matches with Israeli troops. The two sides
angrily pushed each other and pointed their weapons at one another.
	   The Israeli army accused Palestinian police of orchestrating
``intentional disturbances'' by setting up roadblocks at major
intersections in the strip.
	   At Kfar Darom junction, near the Jewish settlement of the same
name, Israeli troops stationed three APCs in the middle of a road
linking two major Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds of vehicles were
brought to a standstill for hours.
	   As the standoff dragged on, army bulldozers hauled in sand to
set-up extra military positions along the road, and Palestinian
police crouched in the fields just a few dozen meters away.
	   At one point, American and British diplomats arrived in the area
to try and mediate, but to no avail. Israel radio said Ross,
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Egypt's ambassador to
Israel were also trying to work out a way out of tensions.
	   The showdown came at a time when Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
remained deadlocked over the scope of an Israeli troop withdrawal
in the West Bank. The United States proposed in January that Israel
withdraw from 13 percent of the land, a plan accepted by the
Palestinians. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has said he could not hand over the land unless the Palestinians
made a greater effort to crack down on Islamic militants.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A homemade bomb made with
instructions from the Internet exploded in southern Brazil, killing
a 13-year-old boy and injuring his friend, police said Thursday.
	   The two boys, Tiago Ravenello, 13, and Gabriel de Oliveira, 14,
constructed the bomb Wednesday using gun powder from 24 fireworks,
which they stuffed into a piece of PVC tubing, police chief Fulvio
Wolf said by telephone from Porto Uniao 750 miles (1,200 kms)
southwest of Rio de Janeiro.
	   The bomb exploded after the boys stuck an iron skewer, which
they had heated over a fire, into the tubing, said Wolf.
	   The bomb ripped through Ravenello's stomach killing him and
struck Oliveira in the right eye.
	   Friends of the two boys said they learned how to build the bomb
from instructions posted on the Internet.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Eighteen people were arrested for
allegedly selling fake Viagra anti-impotency pills after nearly 100
men fell sick from taking the phony medicine, police said Thursday.
	   The street vendors and store owners were arrested during sweeps
of downtown Caracas this past week. Authorities said they had
received nearly 300 complaints from men who said they had bought
pills painted blue and marketed as Viagra.
	   Police also raided pharmacies and health stores that allegedly
were selling real Viagra pills smuggled into the country. Selling
Viagra is currently illegal in Venezuela, although health officials
are expected to approve its sale.
	   Vendors also are selling fake Viagra in the form of injections,
sprays and suppositories, authorities said. They believe thousands
of the fake pills are still being sold in stores and on the street.
	   Police plan to expand the investigation to other parts of
Caracas.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ An unidentified body, found without a head
and hands, was exhumed Thursday to determine if it may be linked to
the killing of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi Conedera.
	   Gerardi, the head of the church's human rights office in
Guatemala, was bludgeoned to death April 26, two days after
presenting a report blaming the army for most of the atrocities in
Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
	   The unidentified body was found April 30 outside Guatemala City,
the capital. Otto Ardon Medina, the prosecutor in the Gerardi case,
requested the exhumation to compare DNA samples with evidence found
in the garage of the parish home where the bishop was killed. The
DNA will be sent to the United States for testing.
	   The only suspect under arrest in the Gerardi case, Juan Carlos
Vielman, has not been formally charged. He claims he is innocent.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Former guerrillas seeking to form a new
political party charged Thursday that the government has failed to
comply with the December 1996 peace accords that ended 36 years of
civil war.
	   The former rebel group, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary
Union, urged the country's poor to continue pressing the government
to live up to promises of legal and land reforms contained in the
peace pact.
	   The government ``is not acting in accordance with the spirit or
the content of the agreements, and the standard of living for the
majority of the population continues to decline,'' the group said.
	   Jorge Soto, a leader of the group, predicted at a Thursday press
conference that the problem would be aired in Brussels in October
during a meeting of the countries that sponsor the peace accords.
	   ``The Brussels meeting will fail because the government has
failed to comply in the areas of constitutional and land reform,
the tax structure and law enforcement,'' Soto said.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) - The Dominican
government declared a hiring freeze Thursday, the first step of an
austerity program to reduce a dlrs 4 billion public debt.
	   In a televised speech Wednesday night, President Leonel
Fernandez said the government needs to settle its accounts with
dozens of vendors who claim outstanding bills are driving them to
bankruptcy.
	   Private electric companies, who together are owed about dlrs 60
million by the government, are the biggest creditors. In April,
police and troops briefly occupied a power plant owned by AES
Dominican Power to keep the company from shutting off electricity
because of dlrs 10 million in unpaid bills.
	   The austerity plan will also use gasoline taxes to pay external
debts and create a commission to investigate budget overruns.
	   Fernandez's administration has seen strong economic growth since
his election in 1996 - 8.3 percent last year and 7 percent expected
in 1998. But he has struggled to pay off the country's massive
foreign debt and has met resistance to plans to privatize
government enterprises.

Puerto Rico considers `serious' Spanish bid for telephone company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico is considering a
``serious'' Spanish bid for its state-owned telephone company,
despite having signed a dlrs 1.9 billion deal to sell to GTE Corp.,
an official said Thursday.
	   Telefonica Internacional S.A.'s dlrs 2.1 billion bid for Puerto
Rico Telephone will be considered by a government privatization
committee on Friday or Monday, said Maria Nevares, spokeswoman for
the Government Development Bank.
	   ``It's a serious bid and the GDB has the responsibility of
evaluating it,'' said Nevares.
	   GTE Corp., which signed a deal with Gov. Pedro Rossello to buy
the company, would receive a dlrs 25 million penalty fee if the
government pulls out.
	   Telefonica's bid came two months after Rossello announced the
GTE deal in April, and Rossello originally said it had come ``too
late'' to be considered.
	   Rossello seemed to reverse himself this week, noting that a
clause in the GTE contract allowed Puerto Rico to opt for a
``better'' offer. Still, he declared, ``the GTE deal is not going
backwards.''
	   The GTE sale has been approved by Puerto Rico's legislature and
is awaiting Federal Communications Commission approval, a process
that could take months. It also spawned a telephone workers' strike
that began June 18.
	   ``GTE plans to proceed'' with its acquisition despite the
Telefonica offer, said GTE spokeswoman Liz Brannan. ``We're going
forward as if it is a done deal.''
	   According to published reports, Telefonica Internacional offered
dlrs 2.1 billion for between 50 and 60 percent of Puerto Rico
Telephone. A GTE-led consortium of private investors would acquire
50 percent plus one share of Puerto Rico Telephone stock and
control of management for dlrs 1.9 billion.
	   Puerto Rico's two telephone unions have staged a
sometimes-violent walkout to protest the sale, which they say could
cut more than 2,000 jobs from the company's 8,000-strong workforce.
The government accuses workers of sabotaging hundreds of phone
lines.
	   More than 60 other unions, including the public electrical and
water workers unions, plan to stage a two-day general strike on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   In a letter to Rossello Thursday, the U.S.-based Communications
Workers of America offered to mediate between strikers and the
Rossello administration, which has launched an ambitious
privatization campaign.
	   In New York, about 200 union members and their supporters
gathered noisily outside a Manhattan branch of Banco Popular on
Thursday to protest the bank's participation in the GTE consortium.

U.S. congressmen warn Haitians of loss of aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ U.S. congressmen warned Haitian
legislators Thursday their poverty-stricken nation will lose the
financial support of the United States if they don't quickly
install a new government.
	   Haiti hasn't had a prime minister since June 1997, when Rosny
Smarth resigned to protest fraud in legislative elections.
	   The U.S. delegation, led by Michigan Democrat John Conyers,
warned that Congress ``is inclined to cut all assistance to Haiti
if, in one or two months, there isn't a (new) government,'' said
Haitian Rep. Joseph Jasmin.
	   ``We told them that perhaps their conception of democracy is not
necessarily the same as ours,'' Jasmin said.
	   Because of political infighting, Haiti has been without a fully
functional government since Smarth resigned.
	   The de facto government is being run on the 1997 fiscal budget,
since it has not submitted a 1998 budget to Congress. Plagued by
absenteeism, the Senate has not convened since April 15.
	   President Rene Preval has designated a new premier three times.
Haiti's Congress rejected each nomination, accusing Preval of
complicity in the tainted April 1997 legislative elections.
	   With no new government or elections in sight, international
lenders are withholding millions of foreign aid dollars for Haiti,
the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
	   U.S. congressional Republicans, meanwhile, have objected to a
request by President Bill Clinton to double U.S. aid to Haiti from
dlrs 70 million to dlrs 140 million this year.
	   The Clinton administration has failed to resolve the crisis,
despite several visits by National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   In 1994, Clinton sent 20,000 troops to Haiti to oust a military
regime that deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a bloody
1991 coup and subsequently killed 4,000 civilians. Aristide
returned from his U.S. exile after the invasion and was succeeded
by Preval in 1995 elections.
	   Conyers and Representatives William Delahunt, Democrat of
Massachusetts, and John Christensen, a Nebraska Republican, met
with Preval and Aristide during their visit, which ended Thursday.

Five Peruvian soldiers injured by land mines near Ecuador border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A Peruvian military patrol stepped on land
mines along a disputed stretch of the northern border with Ecuador,
injuring five soldiers, the Defense Ministry said Thursday.
	   The soldiers were on a routine patrol Wednesday in the
mountainous Cordillera del Condor region, where the two countries
fought a brief undeclared war in early 1995, when they stepped on
the mines, a ministry statement said. One soldier lost a leg in an
explosion.
	   Peru charged that the mines were planted by Ecuadorean troops in
Peruvian territory and will file a protest with an international
peace mission monitoring the disputed region.
	   The two countries have fought three wars this century over 48
miles (78 kms) of unmarked border, but are currently trying to
negotiate a peaceful solution.

Jury receives Don King case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with jury off until Monday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The jury in the insurance fraud trial of boxing
promoter Don King received the case Thursday after four days of
closing arguments.
	   A half hour later, the jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
sent several notes requesting evidence. An hour later, the panel
adjourned for the weekend.
	   In one note, it asked whether the U.S. government was
``interested'' in King before the cancellation of a 1991 bout that
led to the current case.
	   King stood at the side of the courtroom nodding his head to
indicate that he believed the government had pursued him before
1991.
	   In his closing arguments, King's lawyer, Peter Fleming Jr.,
suggested to the jury that he believed the government had
overstepped its authority in its pursuit of King.
	   The trial, which began in mid-April, has centered on whether
King cheated Lloyd's of London out of dlrs 350,000 by faking a
contract for the canceled bout between Cesar Chavez and Harold
Brazier.
	   If convicted of nine counts of wire fraud, King could face up to
45 years in prison.
	   His company, Don King Productions Inc., is also charged in the
case.

Mini-tour unknowns grabs one-stroke lead in GHO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA TOMMELLEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CROMWELL, Connecticut (AP) _ Pete Morgan, who had to qualify to
make the field, birdied his last hole Thursday for a 6-under-par 64
and a one-stroke lead in the first round of the Greater Hartford
Open.
	   Morgan, 35, has played mostly mini-tours the past 10 years,
opened his round with three straight birdies. The Harwich, Mass.
native who lives in the Tampa, Fla., area shot a 69 Monday to earn
a spot in the field.
	   Hartford is only his fourth PGA Tour event since turning pro in
1989.
	   Casey Martin, playing his first tour event after suing for the
right to use a cart in competition, had a 1-over 71.
	   Morgan, who started on the back nine, came to the par-4 No. 9
sharing the lead with Kenny Perry and Scott Hoch. Morgan's 15-foot
birdie putt gave him a 64 and a one-shot lead.
	   ``I knew where I stood. I don't have very many opportunities
like this,'' Morgan said. ``I was trying to get to six (under) and
trying not to make a bogey at the same time.''
	   In fact, he made no bogeys in a round highlighted by a 30-foot
(9-meter) chip for birdie on No. 11.
	   While Morgan played in relative obscurity, Martin drew one of
the largest galleries of the day. Martin, who plays on the Nike
Tour, got a spot in the field this week through a sponsor's
exemption.
	   Martin, who also started on the back, was 1-under through five
holes but got into trouble when he tried to drive the 296-yard
(269-meter) 15th hole. He took a bogey to fall back to even-par and
had three more bogeys the rest of the way against two birdies.
	   ``I know I can play a lot better,'' Martin said. ``I just hope
it shows up here tomorrow or in the next couple of days.''
	   Perry, coming off a three-week layoff, started his round with a
birdie on No. 10, the tightest driving hole on the 6,820-yard
(6,206-meter) course. He made the turn with a 4-under 31 and
birdied Nos. 1-2 to reach 6-under.

Brazil's World Cup worry over Ronaldo's knee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian soccer fans are focusing
on one thing before Friday's World Cup quarter final clash with
Denmark _ Ronaldo's left knee.
	   Brazilian newspapers on Thursday reflected the fans' concern
about Ronaldo's damaged knee tendon which has been hampering him in
training.
	   The Rio de Janeiro daily O Dia carried the headline ``A Star
Under Pressure.'' The sports daily Lance! was more succinct running
the headline word `Panic' over a picture of the soccer star.
	   Ronaldo told Thursday editions of several Brazilian newspapers
that he would play through the pain barrier.
	   But soccer fans remain worried.
	   ``It's a very serious situation. This has happened at the worst
time possible,'' said restaurant worker Alessandre Pereira da
Costa, 23.
	   ``Ronaldo is a great player and we cannot afford to lose him. I
just hope that he is treated so he can play all right.''
	   Even though Ronaldo has only shown glimpses of skill so far
during the World Cup, soccer fans know Brazil's success could hinge
on him.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks finished Thursday slightly lower, pulled
down by a slump in technology stocks and some profit-taking by
investors looking to cash in on the market's recent climb.
According to preliminary calculations, the Dow fell 23.41 to
9,025.26. Broad-market indicators were also down Thursday,
especially the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index. Stocks
slipped back Thursday amid some profit-taking, with many investors
looking to end the week with gains in their portfolios. Financial
markets will be closed Friday for a U.S. holiday. Also weighing
down the market was a government report showing a surprising rise
in unemployment last month. While investors like signs of an
economic slowdown, many also worried that this may be the first
step in a long deceleration of the economy. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moving to answer criticism it hasn't done enough to
solve a banking crisis crippling the world's second-largest
economy, Japan announced a plan Thursday to gradually shut down
banks weakened by heavy loads of bad loans. Japan's ``bridge bank''
scheme is designed to keep credit flowing to healthy corporate
borrowers as the government takes over insolvent banks. The plan is
the latest attempt by the government to ease a credit crunch and
bad loan crisis that have been a major obstacle to Japan's recovery
from its worst recession since World War II. Finance Minister
Hikaru Matsunaga announced the widely expected plan Thursday
immediately after it was approved by a special government task
force set up last month. In Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin welcomed the measures, calling them ``potentially significant
steps toward addressing its (Japan's) banking problems.''
(JAPAN-BANKS)
	   PARIS (AP) _ U.S. Airways said Thursday it was ordering its
first 30 wide-body jetliners from Airbus. It was the latest coup
for the European consortium vying to depose the U.S. jet-maker
Boeing as the world leader. The order was the first by a U.S.
airline for wide-body Airbus jets and followed new orders from Air
France and Spain's Iberia. Airbus was also reportedly close to
breaking Boeing's grip on sales to British Airways. An expanding
U.S. Airways, which has already has placed orders of more than 400
Airbus planes _ 125 of them firm _ is to buy up to 30 wide-body
A330-300s. The agreement, which came as Boeing struggles with
production snarls, includes firm orders for seven of the planes,
seven more subject to confirmation, and options on 16 others. U.S.
Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf said they picked Airbus over Boeing
because the A330s had ``slightly better cargo and passenger
capability,'' as well as a better ``economic package.'' The deal
was valued at dlrs 3.7 billion based on the list price, but Wolf
said Airbus settled for a lower undisclosed figure. (FRANCE-AIRBUS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government launched a fresh attack on tax
cheats Thursday by starting at the very top _ Gazprom, the
country's largest company, top tax debtor and perhaps its most
sacred cash cow. Lawmakers immediately objected, denouncing the
move as an effort to destroy one of the country's remaining
economic treasures, and forced the government to back off.
``Splitting up Gazprom is tantamount to splitting up Russia,''
sputtered Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, head of
parliament's largest faction. Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
started the day by threatening to seize Gazprom's assets and
reassert control over its board unless the natural gas monopoly
starts paying the 4 billion rubles (about dlrs 750 million) it owes
in taxes each month. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Asian economic turmoil and the General Motors
strike slowed U.S. job growth in June, pushing the unemployment
rate up to 4.5 percent from a 28-year low during the two previous
months. It was a sign the economy is beginning to slow. Yet even
with the increase from 4.3 percent, the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate remained well below the 5 percent rate of a year
ago, the Labor Department said Thursday. Employers added a moderate
205,000 jobs to their payrolls in June, compared with 309,000 in
May. Most of the gains came in services. Manufacturers cut 29,000
jobs, the fourth decline in five months and the worst since March
1996. That reflected drops in industries either facing stiff
competition from Asian imports or loss of export sales to Asia,
including apparel, textiles, paper products and electronic
components. (US-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Iran wants to boost its oil production capacity by
1.4 million barrels per day with help from the West, and officials
said Thursday that American oil companies would be welcome if they
had no concerns about U.S. sanctions. The Iranians are in London
this week seeking financial backing for oil ventures worth some
dlrs 8 billion _ and even though a number of U.S. oil executives
came to listen, that's about all they can do for now. The United
States will not let its companies invest in Iran, although the
government backed off in May from threats to slap sanctions on
European Union-based oil companies that do business with the
Iranians. (BRITAIN-IRAN)

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In the tensest showdown in nearly
two years, Israeli and Palestinian troops on Thursday scuffled and
later pointed guns at one another from hastily dug fortifications
outside Jewish settlements in the southern Gaza Strip. A seemingly
routine argument over the use of a road led to the confrontation.
Scores of Palestinian trucks blocked access roads to the
settlements. In response, Israel brought in armored personnel
carriers and sealed off the entire Gaza Strip. ``The situation is
extremely delicate,'' said a spokesman for Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai. The minister appealed to U.S. and Palestinian officials
for help in defusing the situation. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Arsonists set fire to 10 Catholic
churches, gutting three and compelling British Prime Minister Tony
Blair to dash to Belfast on Thursday to bolster Northern Ireland's
peace agreement. Standing outside the smoldering ruins of the
200-year-old St. James' Church west of Belfast, Blair emphasized he
wouldn't let the agreement go up in flames, too. Blair accused the
arsonists of being part of the province's bloody past. Blair headed
next ``to meet the future'': the Protestant leader and Catholic
deputy leader of Northern Ireland's new cross-community Assembly,
who were elected Wednesday. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ One year after China took command of Hong Kong,
U.S. President Bill Clinton underscored America's support for
strengthening democracy and autonomy with his visit to the former
British colony. He also said the territory's battered economy would
rebound. On the final day of his nine-day journey, Clinton was to
address community and business leaders Friday on the theme of
``building stability in Asia for the 21st century.'' The White
House billed it as the second most important address of his trip,
after his Beijing University speech on human rights and the steps
China should take in the 21st century. (CLINTON-CHINA)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani man claiming to be a
nuclear scientist with confidential information about his country's
weapons program is actually a former low-level accountant at a
company that makes bathroom fixtures, a company official said
Thursday. Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan, 29, is seeking asylum in New
York saying he fled Pakistan after learning his country was
planning to be the first to use nuclear weapons against its uneasy
neighbor India. Khan said he was a scientist with the Pakistan
Atomic Energy Commission working at a secret nuclear facility. But
Azad Gulzar Sheikh, a director of Forte Trading Company (Pvt)
Limited, was quoted by Pakistani news media as saying that until
recently Khan worked for him. Pakistani officials have said Khan's
claims were a hoax. (PAKISTAN-US-DEFECTOR)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's top leader insisted Thursday
that diplomats _ not generals _ should win a cease-fire for Kosovo,
warning that the mistakes of earlier Balkan conflicts must be
avoided in the strife-torn province. Secretary-General Javier
Solana's support for peacemaking efforts came just hours after the
U.S. Embassy in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade announced that a
new diplomatic monitoring mission will start Monday. The mission
will include American, Russian, Austrian and Polish diplomats. The
diplomats will observe freedom of movement, which has been hampered
both by Serb police blocking access to regions where anti-guerrilla
operations are taking place, and Kosovo Albanian fighters extending
their grip in the central part of the province. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Supermodel Christie Brinkley gave birth to a
baby girl early Thursday, publicist Fran Curtis said.
	   Sailor Lee Brinkley Cook was born at an undisclosed location in
New York, weighing 7 pounds, 12 ounces (3.51 kilograms). The proud
papa is architect Peter Cook.
	   Brinkley, 43, has a 3-year-old son, Jack, with ex-husband
Richard Taubman, and a daughter, Alexa Ray, 12, from her marriage
to piano man Billy Joel.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LINCOLN, Nebraska (AP) _ Miss America 1997 Tara Dawn Holland
says gossip that her wedding to U.S. Rep. Jon Christensen of
Nebraska is off is merely a rumor.
	   ``No cold feet, no questions,'' said Holland, who said plans for
the Nov. 21 wedding are still on track. ``If they know us, they
know that's not even a question.''
	   The wedding, which will be in her hometown of Mobile, Alabama,
will be a small and private one for family and close friends.
	   Exactly what they'll be doing afterward isn't clear, however,
since Christensen lost his bid for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination in May. He had given up his seat in the U.S. House of
Representatives to run for that office.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ For a Finnish man who ran out of beer
and decided to steal some more, breaking into a store was the easy
part. Getting out again was the hard part.
	   According to a story in Thursday's Iltalehti newspaper, police
were alerted by an alarm, came on the scene and ordered the man to
come out with his hands up.
	   ``I can't, I'm stuck,'' replied the would-be thief, whose
posterior was stuck in the window while his arms and legs dangled
outside.
	   The 41-year-old man had broken a store window and tried climbing
through it backwards. But the hole was too small and he couldn't
move without hurting himself, police told the newspaper.
	   He suffered slight injuries from the broken glass, the newspaper
said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tony Orlando has been tying on a yellow
ribbon for a quarter century.
	   Orlando's classic homecoming song was released 25 years ago
Saturday. Since then, it has become synonymous with hope and the
return of everyone from hostages to prisoners of war.
	   ``It is almost inconceivable to me what `Tie a Yellow Ribbon'
has become. This song has become an American anthem of freedom,''
Orlando said Thursday.
	   He didn't even want to record it at first.
	   ``When the songwriters brought it to me, I immediately thought
Bobby Vinton should record it because he had all the hit songs with
colors like `Roses are Red,' `Blue Velvet' and `Blue on Blue.' I
figured Bobby needed a yellow song in his repertoire,'' he said.
	   But Vinton turned it down and Orlando recorded it.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hundreds of children suffering from leukemia wrote
letters Thursday to the late Princess Diana wishing her what would
have been a happy 37th birthday _ a day late.
	   Children from hospitals, special homes and schools around the
country waited patiently in a South London park to draw pictures
and write poems, filling boxes with their tributes.
	   One message, adorned with hearts and stars, read: ``To Diana,
hope you had a nice birthday in heaven. I hope my sister was at
your party, love Molly.''
	   The princess, who died Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash, was
instrumental in setting up The Foundation for Children with
Leukemia in 1988 and later made it a beneficiary of the Princess of
Wales Trust.
	   More than 6,000 children attended the party, which featured 100
entertainers and rides.

 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Leaders reach accord to end racial strife in Guyana &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ At the urging of Caribbean heads of
state, Guyana's feuding president and opposition leader signed an
agreement Thursday designed to end weeks of political and racial
violence.
	   Aides to Guyanese opposition leader Desmond Hoyte said the pact,
brokered by Caribbean Community leaders at a summit here, called
for constitutional reforms to give the opposition more say in
government.
	   Hoyte and President Janet Jagan also agreed to create a
commission to address race discrimination, a volatile issue in
racially divided Guyana, the aides said.
	   St. Lucia Prime Minister Kenneth Anthony said that the Caribbean
Community had ``demonstrated not only to ourselves but to the rest
of the world that our problems must be solved in our community.''
	   The deal followed weeks of violent protests in Guyana.
 &UR; HAITI: U.S. congressmen warn of loss of aid
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ U.S. congressmen warned Haitian
legislators Thursday their poverty-stricken nation will lose the
financial support of the United States if they don't quickly
install a new government.
	   Haiti hasn't had a prime minister since June 1997, when Rosny
Smarth resigned to protest fraud in legislative elections.
	   The U.S. delegation, led by Michigan Democrat John Conyers,
warned that Congress ``is inclined to cut all assistance to Haiti
if, in one or two months, there isn't a (new) government,'' said
Haitian Rep. Joseph Jasmin.
	   ``We told them that perhaps their conception of democracy is not
necessarily the same as ours,'' Jasmin said.
	   Because of political infighting, Haiti has been without a fully
functional government since Smarth resigned.
	   The de facto government is being run on the 1997 fiscal budget,
since it has not submitted a 1998 budget to Congress.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Mandela arrives for Caribbean celebration
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela arrived to a hero's welcome Thursday to celebrate the 25th
anniversary of the Caribbean Community trade bloc.
	   Mandela, 79 years old and clearly fatigued by the 18-hour flight
from South Africa, held his hand to his heart as a military brass
band played ``God Bless Africa.''
	   He declined to review the white-uniformed honor guard, heading
instead to islanders crowded behind the airport fence.
	   ``Great man! Great man!'' one declared, as children squeezed
their fingers through the fence to reach Mandela's outstretched
hand.
	   On his first visit to the Caribbean as president, Mandela said
he was delighted to be among supporters of South Africa's struggle
against white-minority rule. He said he hoped to increase trade
between the Caribbean and South Africa, which last year topped dlrs
100 million.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Two Cuban swimmers say they plan to defect
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Two Cuban swimmers who disappeared
from a Puerto Rican training camp appeared on television Thursday
night, saying they planned to defect to the United States.
	   Nubis Rosales and Daimara Munoz, members of Cuba's national
women's swimming team, were interviewed by WLII-Channel 11 with
Sergio Ramos, a lawyer known for helping Cubans apply for asylum.
	   The swimmers had disappeared Tuesday night from camp in Vega
Baja, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of San Juan.
	   ``It was difficult to do. I left my mother, my sister,'' Rosales
said. ``I didn't talk about my decision with my family or anyone. I
did it because I wanted to be here, free.''
	   Munoz, who is divorced, said she left a 2-year-old daughter in
Cuba.
	   By late Thursday, the women hadn't contacted the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said INS Deputy District
Director Myrna Oriette Pere.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Clinton fails to keep promise to Caribbean, says leader
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The United States has failed to act
on promises President Clinton made to help Caribbean states more
than a year ago, the leader of Barbados said Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Owen Arthur said a summit of Caribbean leaders
here that ``very slow or no progress'' has been made on promises of
financial help made when Clinton met with Caribbean leaders in
Barbados in May 1997.
	   One promise was for a gift of dlrs 3 million to help diversify
the economies of eastern Caribbean countries hurt by a U.S.
challenge to their preferential banana trade with Europe at the
World Trade Organization last year.
	   Arthur also said that the United States had not made good on a
pledge to help the seven island members of the Organization of
Eastern Caribbean States join the Inter-American Development Bank,
the principal institution for hemispheric development.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Protesters in New York decry phone company sale
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ About 200 union members and their supporters
gathered noisily outside a Manhattan branch of Banco Popular on
Thursday to protest the bank's planned purchase of the Puerto Rico
Telephone Co.
	   The protesters were angry that Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello
signed a law last month completing the dlrs 1.9 billion sale of the
telephone company, pending Federal Communications Commission
approval, to a group led by communications giant GTE Corp. and
including Banco Popular, a Puerto Rican bank.
	   ``Hey, Banco Popular, Puerto Rico's not for sale,'' chanted the
mob.
	   Rankled telephone company employees in Puerto Rico, who say
their governor is selling national patrimony to the United States,
have been on strike for two weeks.
	   They say the sale would leave 2,700 people jobless and raise
telephone rates.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Government considers `serious' Spanish bid for
company
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico is considering a
``serious'' Spanish bid for its state-owned telephone company,
despite having signed a dlrs 1.9 billion deal to sell to GTE Corp.,
an official said Thursday.
	   Telefonica Internacional S.A.'s dlrs 2.1 billion bid for Puerto
Rico Telephone will be considered by a government privatization
committee on Friday or Monday, said Maria Nevares, spokeswoman for
the Government Development Bank.
	   ``It's a serious bid and the GDB has the responsibility of
evaluating it,'' said Nevares.
	   GTE Corp., which inked a deal with Gov. Pedro Rossello to buy
the company, would receive a dlrs 25 million penalty fee if the
government pulls out.
	   Telefonica's bid came two months after Rossello announced the
GTE deal in April, and Rossello originally said it had come ``too
late'' to be considered.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Government declares hiring freeze
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) - The Dominican
government declared a hiring freeze Thursday, the first step of an
austerity program to reduce a dlrs 4 billion public debt.
	   In a televised speech Wednesday night, President Leonel
Fernandez said the government needs to settle its accounts with
dozens of vendors who claim outstanding bills are driving them to
bankruptcy.
	   Private electric companies, who together are owed about dlrs 60
million by the government, are the biggest creditors. In April,
police and troops briefly occupied a power plant owned by AES
Dominican Power to keep the company from shutting off electricity
because of dlrs 10 million in unpaid bills.
	   The austerity plan will also use gasoline taxes to pay external
debts and create a commission to investigate budget overruns.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Cuba, Jamaica conclude shipping agreement
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Cuba and Jamaica have signed an
agreement to ease shipping between the two Caribbean countries,
Jamaica's foreign affairs minister said.
	   Foreign Minister Seymour Mullings said Wednesday the agreement
sets out procedures for payment of ports fees, tax appeals and
transfer of funds between the countries. It also creates a Maritime
Joint Commission to work out disagreements.
	   ``This agreement will prove beneficial to Jamaican exporters as
it seeks to ensure their unimpeded access to Cuban ports and the
constancy and predictability of the user charges levied against
Jamaican ships,'' Mullings said.
	   Negotiations on the deal began in November and ended in April,
he said.
 &UR; HAITI: Comic actor Theodore Beaubrun dies
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's most famous comic actor and
playwright, Theodore Beaubrun, known by his stage name Languichatte
Debordus, has died after a long illness. He was 80.
	   Beaubrun, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, died at his
residence in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Delmas on Tuesday.
	   In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Beaubrun was
especially known in Haiti for his televised series ``Languichatte
in the 20th Century,'' in which he gently mocked social-climbing
pretentiousness.
	   He also was a stand-up comedian and, on many tours, delighted
Creole and French-speaking Haitian communities in the United States
and Canada.
	   His son, Theodore Beaubrun Jr., is the leader of Haiti's most
famous ``roots'' music group, Boukman Eksperyans.
	   The Ministry of Culture announced Thursday it planned a state
funeral to honor Beaubrun's contribution to Haitian culture.

Old guard upstages new in women's tennis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; first men's semifinal starts at 1200 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ So much for all that talk about
teen-agers taking over women's tennis. The old ladies are doing
just fine, thank you.
	   Martina Hingis, Venus and Serena Williams, Anna Kournikova and
Mirjana Lucic will be watching on television _ if they bother to
watch at all _ when the Wimbledon women's final is played Saturday.
	   The two finalists are among the oldest players on the tour _
30-year-old Nathalie Tauziat and 29-year-old Jana Novotna.
Together, they represent the oldest Wimbledon finalists since Betty
Stove (32) and Virginia Wade (31) in 1977.
	   ``Sometimes it seems like the older the better,'' said Hingis,
outplayed by Novotna in straight sets in Thursday's semifinals.
``If you see Tauziat on the other side in the finals, it's amazing.
I hope it's going to be like that with me also, the others, the
smarter, the cleverer, the better.''
	   It's the second Grand Slam tournament in a row where the
youngsters have been upstaged by the grownups. At the French Open
last month, the finalists were relative oldtimers Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario (27) and Monica Seles (24).
	   Hingis, 17, was the only teenager to get as far as the Wimbledon
semifinals. Kournikova, 17, missed the tournament with a thumb
injury; Lucic, 16, lost in the second round; Serena Williams, 16,
went out in the third, and Venus Williams, 18, departed in the
quarters.
	   ``It doesn't really matter how old you are,'' Novotna said.
``The most important is how you feel. I have been working really
hard.''
	   The women gave way to the men's semifinals Friday, with
defending champion Pete Sampras facing Britain's Tim Henman, and
1996 champ Richard Krajicek playing two-time finalist Goran
Ivanisevic.
	   Sampras, who hasn't dropped a set all tournament, is seeking his
fifth title in six years, while Henman can become the first British
player to reach the men's final since 1938.
	   Age seemed irrelevant Thursday as Novotna sprinted, jumped and
covered the court with ease in her 6-4, 6-4 victory over the
defending champion, avenging a three-set defeat to a 16-year-old
Hingis in last year's final.
	   ``Even though I'm one year older than last year, I felt so much
better,'' Novotna said. ``I felt so much younger, really. I said to
myself, `I may be old, but I'm still all over the court.''
	   Novotna said it was natural for so much attention to be focused
on the young players but the veterans still have a key advantage.
	   ``I said this tournament will come down to experience,'' she
said. ``Nathalie and me are playing very similar tennis. Our tennis
is based on experience, and that's what we have shown in this
championship.''
	   Notovna also has another edge: royal support.
	   Five years ago, the world watched as Novotna sobbed on the
shoulder of the Duchess of Kent after blowing a 4-1 lead in the
third set of the final against Steffi Graf.
	   Novotna resumed her bond with the duchess last year after losing
in the final to Hingis. The two exchanged warm greetings and the
duchess gave Novotna some special words of encouragement.
	   ``Let's just hope what the Duchess of Kent said last year is
right,'' Novotna said. ``She said, `third time lucky.' So here I
am.''
	   Novotna will be heavily favored against Tauziat, who beat
unseeded Natasha Zvereva in three sets in the semis.
	   Tauziat is not only the first French women's finalist since
Suzanne Lenglen in 1925, but also the lowest seed (No. 16) to get
this far.
	   In 42 previous Grand Slam tournaments, Tauziat had never reached
the semifinals.
	   ``She's definitely a very, very dangerous opponent,'' Novotna
said. ``Even though on the list it would seem that, yes, maybe I
should be the favorite, I see this as a very, very tough match.
Believe me, it's not going to be easy to beat Nathalie Tauziat.''
	   The two have split their eight previous matches. Tauziat won the
last meeting on indoor carpet in Chicago last year.
	   Tauziat, who celebrated Thursday's victory by flopping onto her
back at the baseline, seemed content just to be in the final.
	   ``I have nothing to lose,'' she said. ``For me, it's going to be
a nice present to be there, to be on this Centre Court with any
players, I don't care. If I play my best tennis, I think I can
win.''

Women's tour gaining ground on Hingis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Martina Hingis' position at the top
looks more precarious lately, with opponents coming at her from all
directions.
	   Younger, older, on grass, on clay _ every foe is eager to beat
the player who has been the game's best over the past 18 months.
	   Jana Novotna did the job Thursday, ending Hingis' reign as
Wimbledon champion with a 6-4, 6-4 victory in the semifinals.
	   ``The last four times I always beat her,'' Hingis said, ``so I
guess I'm not the player I was last year.''
	   Or perhaps the rest of women's tennis is simply improving.
	   Last year, at age 16, Hingis won three Grand Slam titles and was
runnerup at the French Open. This year she repeated at the
Australian Open, but at the French she lost to Monica Seles to the
semifinals, and now she'll watch Saturday's final from the
sideline.
	   Hingis has already lost six times this year, once more than in
all of 1997. She has been beaten twice by Venus Williams and once
by Anna Kournikova and Lindsay Davenport.
	   ``I always said it's going to be much more difficult this year
to accomplish the same things I did last year,'' Hingis said. ``The
younger players have gotten better, and the older players are back
again. They are still at the same level.''
	   The 29-year-old Novotna, who lost to Hingis in last year's
Wimbledon final, made some tactical adjustments and played this
time with poise from start to finish. Hingis, renowned for probing
until she finds an opponent's weakness, seemed overwhelmed by
Novotna's aggressive serve-and-volley game.
	   ``I didn't know what to do,'' Hingis confessed. ``I tried to
come in. I tried to stay back. She would just always have the
better answer.''
	   Hingis has never been an overpowering player, and her serve may
be the area where she can improve most. Novotna broke serve four
consecutive times, and Hingis failed to hold at 4-4 in each set.
	   ``There are a lot of things I can work on now,'' Hingis said.
	   But she took the defeat to her doubles partner well. They
kissed, then walked off the court with their arms around each
other.
	   ``You beat me last year. I gave it back to you,'' Notovna said.
	   ``Yes, you did,'' Hingis agreed.
	   Hingis took some consolation in being the last of the teen
queens to be eliminated. The Williams sisters, 16-year-old Serena
and 18-year-old Venus, lost earlier and the 17-year-old Kournikova
missed the tournament with a thumb injury.
	   The youngsters attracted enormous media attention during the
fortnight, but the finalists _ Novotna and 30-year-old Nathalie
Tauziat _ are among the oldest players on the tour.
	   ``From the younger players, I was still one of the best ones,''
Hingis said.
	   She is not easily discouraged, which is one of her strengths.
	   ``Put on a smiley face, you know?'' she said.
	   Hingis still has a big grin, and she still has the No. 1 ranking
_ at least for now.

Zvereva leaves Wimbledon singles with some consolation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Despite losing in the singles
semifinals to Nathalie Tauziat, Natasha Zvereva left her mark at
Wimbledon.
	   Zvereva leaves the All England Club as only the second player to
beat both Steffi Graf and Monica Seles in the same event. The other
was American Zina Garrison in 1990 at Wimbledon.
	   It was also Zvereva's first Grand Slam semifinal in 10 years.
	   ``I'm so tired,'' said the 27-year-old Belarussian, known as one
of the free spirits in women's tennis. ``I need a
mental-institution break. I've never been in the situation before.
Now I know what I've done. It's really draining.''
	   ``For top people like Martina (Hingis), Jana (Novotna), Lindsay
(Davenport), Monica (Seles) and Steffi (Graf) _ it's incredible to
do it over and over and over again _ every second week or every
third week.''
	   Zvereva failed to become only the second unseeded woman to make
the final since Billie Jean King in 1963. King lost to Australian
Margaret Court Smith. For the record, an unseeded woman has never
won Wimbledon.
	   By beating Zvereva and reaching the final, France's Nathalie
Tauziat also made Wimbledon history.
	   She's the lowest seed to ever reach the women's final. The
previous low was Olga Morozova, seeded eighth in 1974 _ and Jana
Novotna, eighth in 1993.
	   Wimbledon increased its seeds from eight to 12 in 1977 and went
to the present 16 in 1978.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TRES BIEN: &LR;  French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin _ torn away from
France's preparation for its World Cup quarterfinal Friday against
Italy _ offered a congratulatory message to Wimbledon finalist
Nathalie Tuaziat.
	   ``In reaching the finale of the prestigious Wimbledon
tournament, 73 years after Suzanne Lenglen, you have achieved a
very great performance,'' Jospin's message said. He said her
achievement ``rewarded intense, long-drawn out work'' which put her
in a ``good position to win.''
	   ``All of my encouragement accompanies you for this final which
all French people hope will be victorious,'' Jospin added.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   THE CASH: &LR;  Just a reminder. The men's singles winners gets
415,000 pounds (dlrs 688,900) and 373,500 (dlrs 620,000) goes to
the women's singles champion. Runner-up isn't bad. The losing man
gets 207,500 pounds (dlrs 345,000) and the losing woman 186,750
(dlrs 310,000).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BURR: &LR;  It's early July, but you'd never know it at Wimbledon
where temperatues hovered around 16C (60sF) during Thursday's
women's semifinals. At least it was rain-free, the third straight
dry day after five of the first seven were wet.
	   At Centre Court, many fans watching Thursday quarterfinals were
bundled up in parkas with others wearing caps and scarves to keep
the chill off.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  Richard Krajicek talking about his sore right
knee and his tolerance for pain: ``I don't think I'm a Marine or a
Navy Seal, but I think I can cope with pain OK,'' he said.

Passarella happy, but not too happy with team performance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICENTE LEONARDO PANETTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Argentina has reached the World Cup
quarterfinals unbeaten and looking impressive.
	   Yet coach Daniel Passarella appears not fully satisfied and may
try some changes in the team to face the Netherlands on Saturday.
	   Passarella has not discussed the variations he may try. Some
appeared suggested at Thursday's training session, which was held
behind closed doors although reporters were able to see from atop a
small hill next to the stadium.
	   Passarella appeared to be working mainly with the defense and
the attack, rather than its well-organized midfield.
	   Not even striker Gabriel Batistuta, who has scored five goals,
appears to fully satisfy the coach. Passarella replaced him with
Hernan Crespo in the second half of the second round match against
England, which Argentina won 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 tie.
	   Against England, Passarella also took off striker Claudio Lopez
and sent in Marcelo Gallardo, a midfielder. The changes did not
bring the expected improvement, though.
	   While Batistuta is still expected to remain a starter against
the Dutch, the training sessions directed by Passarella suggest
Abel Balbo, the striker of the Roma side of Italy, will start
instead of Lopez.
	   The defense, which breezed through the first round without
allowing a single goal, appeared slow and often out of position
against England and took two goals, including a brilliant one from
Michael Owen.
	   During Thursday's practice Passarella had Roberto Sensini,
recovered from a pulled muscle, regaining his post from Nelson
Vivas, who played the last two matches.
	   And Mauricio Pineda, who scored the winning goal against Croatia
in the first round, appeared taking the place of Javier Zanetti,
the midfielder of Inter of Milan whom Passarella is known to
consider too eager to attack and to unenthusiastic to defend.
	   It could prove difficult for Passarella to bench Zanetti,
however, after he scored against England.
	   On Thursday, Lopez and Zanetti played briefly for the team
likely to start and then switched to the substitutes.

Charlton hits out at diving players
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fans are getting value for money at the World Cup.
	   According to former soccer great Bobby Charlton, they're also
getting a version of the world diving championships.
	   ``They all fall the same way. The head goes back, they look up
in pain and then they roll over three times. It's always three
times.
	   ``It's a work of art,'' Charlton said. ``The moment they get
touched by a defender, down they go. I'm sure they practice it.''
	   The former Manchester United star says that players are hitting
the ground far more often these days in a bid to get penalties or
get opponents cautioned or expelled.
	   ``I have never seen so many people dive,'' he said. ``And the
referees are falling for it, too.
	   ``What I would like to see is some kind of punishment for these
people. Although the referees don't see it, it's shown up clearly
on TV and I'd like to see someone take action, like some sort of
disrepute charge that would lead to a suspension.''
	   After the first two-day break of a championship that's now three
weeks old, the action returned Friday with the start of the
quarterfinals.
	   Defending titlist and four-time champion Brazil faced 33-1
outsider Denmark at Nantes while European powerhouses France and
Italy met at the Stade de France just outside Paris.
	   The other two quarterfinals are Saturday when Argentina faces
the Netherlands at Marseille and three-time titlist Germany meets
debutant Croatia at Lyon.
	   Bookmakers Ladbrokes were offering the odds on a Denmark-Croatia
final at 80-1. The Danes are in only their second World Cup and
this is the furthest they have been.
	   Croatia, which has made the last eight at its first attempt, is
riled at reports that the Germans feel assured they will gain the
semifinal.
	   ``We are irritated by what we are hearing from the German
side,'' coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``The German newspapers have
written unflattering things that have upset us.''
	   Those papers are only reflecting what the German players are
saying.
	   ``With all due respect to Croatia, however, it's really up to us
and I am very optimistic,'' captain Juergen Klinsmann said. ``We
want to go to Paris (for the semifinals and finals) and it really
depends only on us.''
	   Argentina, having struggled to overcome England in a penalty
shootout after a 2-2 tie at Saint-Etienne, practiced behind closed
doors in the buildup to Saturday's game against the Dutch.
	   But the media was able to watch from atop a small hill next to
the stadium.
	   They saw defender Roberto Sensini, recovered from a pulled
muscle that put him out of the England game, regaining his post
from Nelson Vivas, who played the last two matches.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Don't like the referee's call? Take it to court.
	   That's what the Cameroonian cultural association is doing. The
association is suing FIFA over a disallowed goal during a World Cup
match against Chile on June 23.
	   The association claims that the ``inexcusable mistake'' by
Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner disallowing Francois Omam Biyick's
goal unjustly kept the Indomitable Lions from advancing in the
tournament. The game ended 1-1; a victory would have put Cameroon
into the second round.
	   ``We don't look at this in the terms of the sport, but in terms
of civil responsibility,'' said Michel Taupier, the lawyer for the
Cameroon association. ``We consider the referee is a FIFA official,
the FIFA being the civil party responsible for the damaged
suffered.''
	   The association is suing for 300,000 francs (dlrs 50,000) for
financial losses and 100,000 francs (dlrs 17,000) for emotional
distress.
	   Taupier admitted it was an ``audacious move.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Despite David Beckham's red-card retaliatory kick
against Argentina, England continues to top the World Cup fair-play
standings at France 98.
	   England holds first place ahead of Norway, another team that was
eliminated in the second round.
	   Brazil, which won the award in 1994, and host France are tied
for third.
	   The award is based on several criteria compiled into a points
system. Red and yellow cards, positive play, respect toward
opponents, respect toward the referee, behavior of team officials
and behavior of the country's fans are all taken into account.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's not been a good World Cup for Adidas. All five
players featured in the sporting goods manufacturer's
pre-tournament advertising campaign have flopped:
	   _David Beckham went home in disgrace after kicking an opponent
in England's second-round loss to Argentina.
	   _Zinedine Zidane was suspended for two matches after stepping on
an opponent in France's first-round match against Saudi Arabia.
	   _Patrick Kluivert was suspended for two games for elbowing
Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' opening
match.
	   _Paul Gascoigne was cut from the England team before the World
Cup began.
	   _Alessandro Del Piero, injured before the tournament began, has
not performed up to expectations with Italy.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Dutch defender Michael Reiziger may
miss the Netherlands' World Cup quarterfinal against Argentina on
Saturday because his foot injury has not responded to treatment,
coach Guus Hiddink said.
	   ``Reiziger is doubtful,'' Hiddink said Thursday. ``He still has
bruising on his foot. We will look at it again this afternoon in
training.''
	   Reiziger, who plays for Louis van Gaal's Barcelona, did not
train with the Dutch squad Wednesday after his right foot was badly
bruised in the Netherlands' second-round match against Yugoslavia
on Monday in Toulouse.
	   If he does not play, Reiziger will likely be replaced by Inter
Milan's versatile midfielder Aron Winter, who has already played
right back for the Dutch in this tournament.
	   Winter is considered a more offensive defender than Reiziger and
will face a testing match against Argentine forwards Gabriel
Batistuta and Ariel Ortega.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines has offered passengers on
international flights the chance to watch World Cup soccer games.
	   Full-length matches from the 1998 World Cup finals will be
available on most SIA flights longer than three hours, the company
said Thursday.
	   The two semifinal games, the playoff for third place and the
World Cup final match will be shown on flights from July 8 to July
14. Highlights from the tournament also will be shown.
	   ``We have received many requests from passengers for screenings
of the World Cup, and we are pleased to be able to cater to their
wishes,'' said Yap Kim Wah, SIA's marketing director.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian soccer fans are focusing
on one thing before Friday's World Cup quarter final clash with
Denmark _ Ronaldo's left knee.
	   Brazilian newspapers on Thursday reflected the fans' concern
about Ronaldo's damaged knee tendon which has been hampering him in
training.
	   The Rio de Janeiro daily O Dia carried the headline ``A Star
Under Pressure.'' The sports daily Lance! was more succinct running
the headline word `Panic' over a picture of the soccer star.
	   Ronaldo told Thursday editions of several Brazilian newspapers
that he would play through the pain barrier.

World Cup: Dutch stars desert domestic league for foreign
</HEADLINE>
challenge &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Yet again, the lure of bigger pay
packets _ and bigger audiences admiring the players' skills _ is
draining the Netherlands of the cream of its soccer talent.
	   With at least two transfers likely to be finalized before next
season, only four of the 22-man Dutch World Cup squad are expected
to play in the Netherlands come September.
	   The phenomenon is nothing new. The list of past Dutch exports is
long and illustrious. Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit
and Frank Rijkaard are just a few players who made their names and
fortunes in foreign leagues.
	   ``For top players, salaries in the Netherlands are about the
same as in bigger countries, but the tax system is different,''
Paul Onkenhout, a soccer writer with respected Dutch daily De
Volkskrant said Thursday.
	   ``In Italy and England, players keep twice as much money after
tax.''
	   Of the current crop of Orangemen, just Edwin van der Sar, Frank
de Boer, Wim Jonk and Andre Ooijer look certain to be playing in
the Dutch Honor Division next season.
	   Jonk is nearing the end of his career, Ooijer is just beginning
his and nobody expects Van der Sar or De Boer to stick around too
long.
	   Earlier this year, the De Boer twins suggested the introducing
tax breaks for top soccer players as a way of keeping them in the
Netherlands. The government rejected the idea.
	   Now Ronald is almost certain to quit Ajax and England's Arsenal
reportedly is the most likely club to sign him.
	   Also likely to leave is Feyenoord Rotterdam's Giovanni van
Bronckhorst who is expected to sign for Glasgow Rangers _ coached
by Dutchman Dick Advocaat.
	   Frank de Boer wants out too but Ajax Amsterdam refuses to sell
him yet.
	   ``I could go to three or four clubs immediately but I have
signed at Ajax and they won't let me go,'' De Boer said.
	   But it is not just cash that sucks players out of the Dutch
league.
	   ``They get bored,'' Onkenhout said.
	   ``It is no challenge playing against RKC Waalwijk, or
Volendam,'' two teams often to be found in the basement of the
Dutch Honor Division, he added.
	   ``The players want to perform on the biggest stage. Also you do
not improve as a footballer playing for years in the Netherlands.''
	   De Boer and his Ajax teammates past and present almost always
play in the Champions Cup. But the players crave week-in-week-out
challenging opposition and that is not available in the
Netherlands.
	   As a result, they seek stronger opposition on foreign fields.
	   National trainer Guus Hiddink, who himself played in the United
States and coached Spanish club Valencia, says the change of
scenery improves the players.
	   He said his current squad has significantly improved since two
years ago because so many players now turn out for foreign clubs.
	   ``Now they have experienced different clubs, different
cultures,'' Hiddink said. ``That pays back into the national
team.''

Clinton tries to boost democracy in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Will be led with developments. &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A year after Hong Kong reverted to the control
of China, U.S. President Bill Clinton underscored America's support
for strengthening democracy and autonomy in this former British
colony. He also predicted that the territory's battered economy
will rebound.
	   On Friday, the final day of his nine-day journey, Clinton
addresses community and business leaders on the theme of ``building
stability in Asia for the 21st century.'' The White House billed
the speech as the second most important of his trip, after his
Peking University address on human rights and the steps China
should take in the 21st century.
	   The president and his family arrived in Hong Kong late Thursday
on Air Force One in a flurry of excitement. The president's
aircraft was the first passenger plane to land at the city's new
dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok International Airport. Hours earlier,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin dedicated the airport and flew out in
the first plane to take off.
	   As the United States nudged the former colony toward a more
democratic system, Clinton pointedly called Hong Kong ``a world
symbol of trade, enterprise, freedom and global interdependence.''
	   In a show of support of support for leaders of Hong Kong's
pro-democracy movement, Clinton also meets Friday with opposition
leader Martin Lee and others among the 20 legislators who won
recent elections. The president had no plans to meet with 40 other
legislators who were not selected by a direct vote of the people.
	   Clinton met over dinner Thursday with Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's
chief executive, who was installed by the Beijing regime. In a
dinner toast, Clinton looked back over his nine-day trip to China
and said he was ``profoundly appreciative'' to Jiang for helping
make his visit ``a remarkably successful attempt to continue to
build our partnership for the future.''
	   And in a message sure to resound in Hong Kong, Clinton said he
was encouraged by signs ``that we can build together a future that
is more stable, more prosperous and free.''
	   Tung, in turn, assured Clinton that Jiang had reaffirmed his
commitment to maintain autonomy for Hong Kong, one year after the
former British colony returned to Chinese rule after 156 years.
	   Fears that Beijing would crack down on demonstrators and push
political opponents to the margin after the July 1, 1997,
transition to Chinese rule have so far proved unfounded.
	   Instead, Asia's sagging economy has eclipsed political concerns.
	   Tourism is down 20 percent, while unemployment is at a 15-year
high. Sharing the woes felt across Asia, Hong Kong's housing values
and stock market have fallen badly.
	   Clinton said that ``this present financial crisis too will pass,
if we work together with discipline and vision to lift the fortunes
of our neighbors.''
	   Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit Hong Kong, although
he and his wife, Hillary, visited before they moved to the White
House.
	   White House press secretary Mike McCurry said Clinton would use
the occasion of the trip to urge Hong Kong's leaders to increase
the rights of voting and universal sufferage used for electing
members of the legislative council and the position of chief
executive itself.

Wildlife and chemical weapons incinerator coexist on Pacific isle
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHNSTON ATOLL (AP) _ This four-island coral atoll 825 miles
(1,330 kilometers) southwest of Honolulu is a pristine and
beautiful place. Azure skies, gentle trade winds and crystal blue
water teeming with life.
	   But to visit, you need to carry a gas mask and syringes and
antidote.
	   ``Just in case,'' a U.S. Army guide explains.
	   A chemical weapons incinerator operates on this national
wildlife refuge. Where marine life and rare tropical birds thrive,
the army destroys millions of pounds (kilograms) of deadly nerve
gas, mustard gas and blister agents dating back to World War II.
	   Can these disparate missions of destruction and survival safely
coexist? The Army and the 1,250 people, 80 percent civilian, who
live here believe so.
	   ``I don't find it ironic. It's probably the strongest proof that
we have that we are not doing anything ecologically damaging on a
long-term basis,'' says Gary McCloskey, manager of the Army's
Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System.
	   ``That's the reason why we have the seabird and aquatic studies
group monitor the project for its duration and to verify that we
really are not affecting the wildlife,'' he says. ``Fear comes from
not fully understanding the safeguards that are built into the
process.''
	   In the eight-plus years since the system was built, researchers
and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service scientists say they have no
evidence of harm to the marine and bird populations on the four
islands _ Johnston, Sand, East and North _ from the incineration
process.
	   ``For eight years now we have been conducting our upwind and
downwind studies, and have found no differences in the reproductive
success of the red-tailed tropicbird,'' the most common bird on the
atoll, says Lindsey Hayes, a manager with Fish and Wildlife.
	   The tropic birds are especially telling since they nest both
upwind and downwind of the plant and are very faithful to their
nesting sites, returning year after year. This allows Hayes and
other scientists to study the same birds and their offspring.
	   ``The populations of all of these birds are growing out here,''
he says. ``I feel real comfortable saying the plant is having no
impact, other than 1,250 people crammed on that island.''
	   Some fish around Sand Island have been detected with levels of
PCBs, but Dr. Philip Lobel, associate professor of biology at
Boston University, believes that's from transformers dumped in the
water by the Coast Guard during World War II.
	   ``One of the most sensitive indicators of environmental
pollution ... is the health of the fish. The first indication of
poor health is bad reproduction,'' Lobel says. ``We have not been
able to define any effects. This is a beautiful, pristine island.
When you get out into these crystal-clear waters, there is
incredible coral growth.''
	   That lack of demonstrated harm to the environment will be touted
by the Army as it tries to assure eight U.S. cities that similar
weapons incinerators planned for their communities will be safe.
	   Those communities are Umatilla, Oregon; Tooele, Utah; Pueblo,
Colorado; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Newport, Indiana; Anniston,
Alabama; Lexington, Kentucky and Aberdeen, Maryland.
	   ``Obviously you can see why anyone would be concerned, but it
seems to be working well out here,'' Hayes says.
	   Safety is seen at every level. There's a 24-hour air monitoring
system constantly checking chemical levels, and a control room
where workers can shut down operations. Air circulation systems at
the incinerator are designed, officials say, to minimize any
effects of a leak or explosion.
	   Video cameras and guards are all around, and double fencing
surrounds the plant. No one is allowed to enter the weapons area
alone, or to be out of sight of a co-worker.
	   ``In a strange sense, it's almost the safest industry in the
world to be involved in because of the level of safety precautions
that are built in,'' McCloskey says.
	   Only one person has ever been exposed, he says. That was a
soldier ``stupidly'' carrying a bag of wet munitions over his
shoulder, instead of in front of him, according to McCloskey.
Mustard agent dripped down his rubber suit and through two unlaced
eyelets on his boot, giving the man two coin-size burns on his
calf.
	   The one fatality at JACADS, McCloskey says, occurred on
Thanksgiving Day 1997 when a man moving a 1,000-pound
(450-kilogram) piece of metal didn't recognize it was tipping and
it fell on him. ``It had nothing to do with chemical agent, it had
nothing to do with explosives.''
	   He adds, joking: ``The most dangerous place on this island is
the softball field.''
	   One man who has conquered his initial fears of Johnston is Army
Sgt. Charles Putman, now on his third tour of duty at the
incinerator.
	   The chemical ammunitions specialist leads teams of rubber-suited
soldiers who move chemical weapons from 54 concrete, igloo-like
storage bunkers and transport them to the incinerator. They also
check the bunkers for leaky missiles or munitions.

	   ``The first time I walked in here (in 1992), I was almost
overwhelmed by my fear,'' Putman says. ``But as time proceeds you
see training, you do training, your confidence grows.''
	   Putman enjoys the work, even if means time away from his wife
and baby son in Alabama, since no military dependents are allowed
to live on the island.
	   ``This is one place I feel I'm doing good,'' Putman says.
``Getting rid of weapons of mass destruction that can harm
people.''
	   JACADS was built in 1990 and began operating in 1993. When work
is completed in fall 2000, the 280,000 chemical weapons stored on
the island will have been destroyed. That's 6.6 percent of the U.S.
chemical weapons arsenal.
	   So far, 3 million pounds (1.4 million kilograms) of sarin nerve
gas, mustard gas and blister agent have been incinerated. One
million pounds (453,600 kilograms) remain.
	   By 2002, the weapons incinerator and all related facilities are
scheduled to be taken down. No future military uses are planned for
the island, and Hayes and other researchers hope it will remain a
wildlife refuge.
	   That would end a military tradition here dating from World War
II, when Johnston was a submarine base and Sand Island was a Coast
Guard station.
	   In the 1950s and '60s, the atoll was the site of atmospheric
nuclear tests.
	   Three testing accidents in 1962 left parts of the islands
covered with plutonium oxide, and a different team is working on
clearing that from the soil, says Air Force Col. Robert Sutton, the
man in command of the atoll.
	   He expects that work to be completed around the same time as the
weapons are all incinerated. Meanwhile, people are discouraged from
eating fish taken from an area where fallout occurred.
	   ``We probably will never be able to tell you it's 100 percent
cleaned up, but it will be cleaned to EPA approval,'' Sutton says.
``I don't believe there is any hazard there.''

Japan's latest export _ garbage _ flowing overseas
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan has a new export for the world _ garbage.
	   Pinched by rising disposal costs, a shortage of landfill sites
and a public that just doesn't want to deal with the problem,
garbage handlers are increasingly using legal loopholes to pawn
Japan's trash off on the rest of Asia.
	   The government says it hasn't received any complaints from the
recipients, but environmentalists are slamming the trade as
exploitative and irresponsible.
	   ``The garbage is being sent to places where labor is cheap and
environmental restrictions are low, despite the risks,'' said
Noriyuki Hiwada, a volunteer with an environmental group monitoring
Japan's waste exports to the Philippines.
	   Under current Japanese waste control laws, shipping any material
overseas as waste is prohibited. The export of hazardous materials
is also generally banned in line with international conventions.
	   So businessmen are just calling it something else, and selling
it.
	   ``What's garbage to the Japanese can still be used in other
countries,'' said Kosuke Ueda, spokesman for the 14,500-member
National Foundation of Industrial Waste Management Associations.
	   Ueda said waste disposal has become a less profitable enterprise
because disposal costs are rising while competition is holding down
removal fees. That has encouraged both export and a surge in
illegal dumping at home.
	   Such dumping has already created many ``smoky mountains'' at the
foot of scenic Mount Fuji, forcing outraged officials and residents
of 13 nearby towns to begin dump-prevention patrols.
	   The number of reported illegal dumping cases swelled from 274 in
1992 to 679 in 1994, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry.
Only about one-third led to arrests in 1994. The ministry has no
more recent data.
	   For waste producers and handlers, however, sending the waste
overseas is an even safer option.
	   In most cases, exporting garbage is legal as long as the
material is for sale, said Tatsuro Akashi, a Health and Welfare
Ministry official in charge of solid waste.
	   ``There is no objective definition to distinguish waste from
goods, except for the question of whether anyone wants to pay for
it,'' Akashi said.
	   And there does, indeed, appear to be a market for Japan's trash.
	   According to Finance Ministry statistics, Japan exported 91,137
tons of scrap plastic and 21,430 tons of aluminum waste last year,
mostly to Hong Kong, China and Taiwan.
	   Some 9.4 million old tires were also exported, mainly to North
Korea, Hong Kong and the United States.
	   These items can be recycled _ the tires can be shredded and used
in cement, for example. But doing so in Japan is often either
prohibitively expensive or involves potential health hazards. Where
labor costs are lower and fewer restrictions exist, the profit
margins are higher.
	   Either way, the bottom line remains _ for Japanese exporters,
selling is the easy way out.
	   Japan's government maintains there is little it can do because
waste handling is largely a private industry.
	   But critics point out the government encourages Japan's
shipbuilders to scrap old single-hull tankers in the Philippines,
Vietnam and China. The ships, which contain hazardous materials
like asbestos and oil, are torn to pieces using cheap local labor
and sold for scrap metal.
	   The Transport Ministry, which finances the project, says it
makes sure tankers are scrapped and not simply resold whole. But it
has done little to examine the environmental or labor aspects.
	   ``There is little space to scrap huge tankers inside Japan,
where labor has become too expensive,'' said Shinichiro Otsubo, a
ministry official in charge of shipbuilding.
	   ``If we don't promote scrapping, aging ships will be operated
forever, and that's more dangerous,'' he said.
	   Environmentalists beg to differ.
	   They say Japan's widespread waste dumping and export reflects a
serious lack of corporate ethics and environmental concerns on the
part of manufacturers as well as waste handlers.
	   ``Industrial waste export is a result of failure in Japan's
waste processing system,'' said Nobuo Kojima, a lawyer who has
worked with grass-roots groups that oppose the industrial waste
exports.
	   ``The more a particular waste becomes a problem at home, the
more likely it is exported as a way to avoid taking required
measures for environmental protection,'' he said.

	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Alison Smale has covered Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union for The Associated Press for 16 years,
witnessing some of the most momentous chapters in communism's
collapse: the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev, the fall of the Berlin
Wall, the Yugoslav wars. In this report, written shortly before
leaving Europe, she reflects on her experiences.
	   ___
 &UR; By ALISON SMALE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   PODBISCE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A village graveyard, lined with
trees. The soaring beauty of Montenegro's mountains. Wind and
light. A drunk in his ill-fitting Sunday suit babbling his fear of
talking to foreigners. Communist stars on the gravestones.
	   It could be a scene from the movies east Europeans make so well,
tales laced with the poetry of their lands, their rich, lurching
conversations, the humor of people accustomed to the distinctly
un-Western rawness of life.
	   But today, I'm not here to savor these human treasures, unknown
to so many friends and acquaintances in the West, who stare blankly
as I struggle to explain that the Wild East is far more than chaos
and blood, and why it's so hard to say goodbye.
	   Instead, after 16 years, I find myself leaving a Europe that
came together for a few joyful weeks in late 1989, only to divide
again.
	   In this new Europe, there are 15 Western countries locked in a
borderless union of democracies, weaving their economies _ if not
their policies _ into a single, strong unit.
	   And then there is the East, the junkyard of Europe's ideologies,
unable to free itself from its all-consuming history, or the dead
hand of the Soviets' brand of communism.
	   Post-communism has reared a few model pupils _ the East Germans
swallowed, if not digested, by western Germany; the Czechs, Poles
and Hungarians who join NATO next spring.
	   But there is also the gaggle of post-communist failures, the
worst of them in the bloodied Balkans and Caucasus, where life
after Marxism is immeasurably worse than before.
	   Each of the isms that have marched through Eastern Europe this
century _ Czarism, monarchism, Nazism, Communism, nationalism, and
now a Wild East form of capitalism _ have left their psychological
wreckage.
	   To the Westerner plumbing the East's emerging markets, or trying
to make sense of the war in the former Yugoslavia, these ruins of
the spirit may seem irrelevant.
	   To me, they go to the heart of the matter: the Easterners'
surprise that when the chance came to throw off the communism under
which all had chafed for so long, it wasn't simple. The communist
system, it turned out, functioned as it did because each and every
one of them collaborated, actively or passively, in making it work.
	   In the joy of November 1989, it didn't seem possible that it
would take decades to weave together what the Cold War sundered.
	   On the night the Berlin Wall fell, I crossed Checkpoint Charlie
with the first East German to pass through. It was the only time in
my life that I really did pinch myself to make sure it was really
happening.
	   Just three days later, however, the mood was already
depressingly different. The Easterners had come over in hordes and
were greeted with free bananas, buns and beers. The politicians
were making lofty speeches; on the streets, the Easterners' joy had
already become more a grab for goods, the West's happiness a
contest to see who could give away _ or sell _ the most.
	   In East Berlin, I walked past the kind of apartment blocks you
can find all across the enormous stretch of Earth between Berlin
and Vladivostok. These decrepit hulks with their unkempt yards,
second-class fittings and broken elevators symbolized to me the
dehumanizing system that evolved from the Marxist ideology of
egalitarianism.
	   Millions toiled to build them, millions schemed and bribed to
live in them, and now it seemed all for naught; with the West's
tempting wares on offer, who would want to live in these shoddy
surroundings?
	   But they still stand, a reminder that the past is hard to shake
off. For Easterners, donning the West's clothes, translating its
commercials or consuming its products are inescapable, but
inadequate, acts of disguise.
	   Some ``Easterners'' _ actually, these who prefer to be called
Central Europeans _ are succeeding quite well in this mental
juggling of two worlds. Next spring, the Czechs, Hungarians and
Poles will become members of NATO. They, plus Estonia and Slovenia,
are negotiating entry into the European Union.
	   If that means scraping into exclusive clubs that will remain
barred to their post-communist comrades for decades, it will make a
mockery of that ``common European home'' envisaged by Mikhail
Gorbachev, the Soviet leader whose reforms doomed communism. The
new East European homes are either the garish villas of the new
rich, or the roofless ruins of Bosnia.
	   Why come to the graveyard of an obscure Montenegrin village to
ruminate on all this? Because it is here, beneath a simple slab of
gray stone, that Milovan Djilas lies buried.
	   When he died in 1995 at age 83, Djilas was still the only man in
Eastern Europe who had killed to build Communism, risen to the
almost unlimited power of Politburo membership, only to renounce it
and become the first anti-Stalinist dissident.

PODBISCE: anti-Stalinist dissident.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   In this part of the world, he was one of the few to junk his own
history.
	   The West lionized him, millions read his books about and against
Stalinism. But in his own country, he remained a political outcast
until death. Some Yugoslavs might have admired his brain and
courage _ in prison, he translated Milton's ``Paradise Lost'' on
toilet paper smuggled in by his wife _ but could not forgive his
bloody Communist past. Most others simply did not know, or care,
who he was.
	   Until more people can cast off history, the East's 20th century
dream of ``joining Europe'' will remain a mirage.
	   ``At the beginning of the 20th century, we were keeping up with
developments in Europe _ behind of course, but keeping up,'' says
Milan Protic, a Belgrade historian. Now, after ``50 or 70 years of
negative hibernation'' under Communism, ``it's going to take the
east Europeans maybe 100 years to develop institutions of
democracy. And who knows how much further the West will be in that
time?''
	   Even in Prague, where the Czechs had the strongest tradition of
pre-World War II democracy of any Soviet bloc land, Vaclav Havel,
the dissident playwright-turned-president, sees his Czech Republic
as a corrupt land lacking in moral fiber, a quasi-capitalist
artifice that has so far missed its chance to found a new civic
society.
	   Something like this ``post-communist morass'' was predictable,
Havel said last December. ``Hardly anybody, however, foresaw how
deep, serious and protracted it would be.''
	   The Czechs, a friend in Prague remarked to me, are ``running
like mad'' to reach a place the West has already left.
	   ``Becoming a democracy,'' like ``joining Europe,'' are mantras
invoked in almost every conversation with an Easterner. But the
divisions wrought by an especially violent century make it hard to
agree on what the mantras really mean.
	   Across the half of Europe once under Soviet sway, democracy's
cornerstone, the rule of law, has scarcely, if ever, been known.
Rules imposed brutally from above were feared, not respected. To
most Easterners, therefore, democracy means not a free society
governed with the people's consent, but the freedom to do anything,
everything, unfettered by any rules. Chaos results.
	   In addition, each society is splintered, often violently, into
pro- and anti-communists, criminals and innocents, different
ethnicities and religions.
	   And now, Wild East capitalism has added new gulfs: between haves
and have-nots, slick gun merchants in Mercedes limos and masses
left jobless and destitute by a system that went bankrupt.
	   After 1945, Europe _ particularly West Germany _ recovered from
the devastation of World War II thanks to a guiding American vision
for political and economic resurgence known as the Marshall Plan.
	   After 1989, there was no such plan. East Germans are the only
ones in the former Soviet bloc to enjoy something similar _ the
money lavished on them by their West German compatriots. But they
do not feel part of the mainstream German body politic, often
voting for extreme right-wingers or the former Communist party.
	   In the 1990s, tens of billions of dollars have poured into
Europe's East, partly through business and governments _ but also
through organized crime. Myriad governmental and private groups try
to build free media, small businesses, or that most elusive of
things _ the rule of law. Easterners grope through what Djilas'
son, Aleksa, a political scientist in Belgrade, calls ``an
institutional vacuum.''
	   ``If you don't have institutions,'' he says, ``it's like living
in darkness.''
	   In such darkness, citizens are more vulnerable than ever to the
whims of bad leaders who have usurped their citizens' dreams to
become more dictators than democrats, or to opposition figures like
Russia's virulent anti-Semitic Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
	   Emil Constantinescu and the center-rightists who in 1996 finally
achieved Romania's first peaceful change of power have proven as
unable _ or unwilling _ to fight corruption or implement reform as
the ex-communists they replaced.
	   In Serbia, notes author Slavoljub Djukic, a friend of Djilas and
author of three books on President Slobodan Milosevic, ``the
so-called opposition was formed in the worst possible way, by
people who had neither the wisdom, ability or vision to create a
new society.''
	   Not all the Eastern leaders are bad: there is a big difference
between former Soviet satrapies like the Baltic states and their
neighbor Belarus under Alexander Lukashenko, an admirer of Stalin
and Hitler; between Havel's Czech Republic, and the Slovakia of
Vladimir Meciar.
	   It will take 50 years for Serbia to recover from 11 years under
Milosevic, Protic predicts as we sit in a sun-dappled Belgrade
cafe, both acutely aware of the physical beauty around us
contrasting with the mental exhaustion and decay that are Serbia
today.
	   ``I believe that no other East European country had such
possibilities for democratic development as Serbia,'' says Djukic.
Thanks largely to Milosevic, he notes, ``what happened was the
complete opposite.''
	   Milosevic, a 56-year-old schoolteacher's son, rules virtually
invisibly from behind the scenes and is rarely seen in public. His
wife, Mira Markovic, is the power behind the throne.
	   Milosevic got power through Machiavellian scheming against his
own best friend and longtime political patron, and by exploiting
the nationalism that replaced the collective identity imposed or
bred by communism.

	   Under cover of that populism, says Lila Radonjic, head of an
independent TV network Milosevic now threatens to silence,
``complete communist structures remained in place. The entire
machinery simply changed its uniform.''
	   One important holdover is the special brand of hypocrisy bred by
communism _ paying lip service in public to imposed ideals that
always were ridiculed in private. In eastern Europe, says Radonjic,
``duplicity is very much a characteristic.'' In Milosevic's world,
``nothing is sincere.''
	   Hence, paradoxes abound. In social conversation, they are a rich
source of humor. Politically, they bolster the strong, and leave
the public paralyzed by bewilderment.
	   This spring, for instance, Milosevic rallied the Serbs against
foreign mediation in the conflict over secessionist Kosovo
province, only to welcome U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke two weeks
later. No one is known to have protested the abrupt about-face.
	   Such acceptance of whatever the leadership says stems from the
feudal empires that for centuries dominated eastern Europe,
particularly the Balkans.
	   When, in 1918, shaky independent countries were formed from the
ruins of those empires, old ways died hard.
	   Men like Djilas, usually the first in their peasant families to
get an education, became Communists in rebellion against the
authoritarian regimes of the 1930s. In World War II they became
partisans, leaving behind families, many of whom were massacred.
After 1945, they got their turn at laying down the law, destroying
old ways and appropriating old wealth.
	   ``The New Class,'' Djilas dubbed them in his first
anti-communist book, banned in his own country until the late
1980s.
	   Djilas stayed on the sidelines of what has proven a feckless
opposition in a Yugoslavia shrunken to just Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Yet it is to Montenegro, a territory of 600,000 people, that
many are looking to find some hope, however slim, for the future.
	   That's because its president, Milo Djukanovic, is a smart
politician with a future to play for. As a former Milosevic ally,
he knows the strongman's wily ways. He has now turned against
Milosevic, and that has earned him Western backing.
	   But Djukic fears Serbia's crisis cannot be resolved through
ordinary politics. ``Dissatisfaction will pile up until it all
explodes. And then it will just be a question of who can save his
or her head,'' he says. ``It will all end in the streets.''
	   The Central Europeans are far from such apocalyptic visions.
	   Yet, even in Prague, Budapest or Warsaw, as the credit cards and
shopping malls slowly drown out the endless political bickering,
big questions loom.
	   What chance is there that, in my friends' lifetimes, these
countries will match western Europe's rule of law, economic vigor
and environmental standards? What will Asia's financial calamity
mean for them, or for the brash but shaky new wealth of Russia?
	   These questions often go untackled, overlooked by Easterners
chasing their dreams and Western investors making a buck. Fantasies
and fancy dress are much easier options.
	   Vlado Dapcevic, a Montenegrin contemporary of Djilas who spent
24 of his 82 years in Yugoslav jails, recalls his last release from
prison in 1988.
	   ``I found that people had lost the sense of truth,'' he says.
``When you tell them a very simple truth, they look at you as if
you came from another planet.''
	   The veteran Russian actor Mikhail Ulyanov was recently asked
about a glitzy Russian theater award ceremony, modeled on
Hollywood, but awkwardly grafted on to Moscow.
	   ``Poor actors,'' he remarked, ``playing at millionaires.''
	   ___
	   Back at the grave of Djilas and his parents, Toma, a wrinkled,
gap-toothed villager, is muttering his fears of foreigners and of
secret police. Why, he wonders, would anyone bother to seek out
such a humble piece of stone? Surely Djilas could have done much
more for his family, given his high office.
	   Indeed, Djilas appropriated a fine Belgrade home for his mother
in 1945. But then he turned his back on communism, exchanging the
Politburo for a prison cell, power for obscurity, in life as in
death, to be buried in this remote unvisited place.
	   On the family gravestone he inscribed:
	   ``This was all I could do for you. Son Milovan.''

From pork barrel to policy, Japan's politicians start making laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Being judged a successful politician in Japan has
long had a narrow focus: being able to raise lots of campaign cash,
channel national funds to local projects and, most important, get
re-elected.
	   Now, with the powerful, policy-generating central bureaucracy
awash in scandal and doubt, some Japanese lawmakers are trying
their hand at something new _ making laws.
	   Typically, government departments submit legislation directly to
the Cabinet, where it receives a cursory review before being handed
over to Parliament. There, lawmakers rarely amend bills, deferring
instead to the expertise of the bureaucrats.
	   But a series of influence-peddling scandals and policy blunders
over the past several months has tarnished the reputation of
Japan's bureaucratic elite _ creating a power vacuum for
politicians to capitalize on.
	   ``There was a time not so long ago when people thought
bureaucrats could do no wrong and so they were given wide latitude
over the law,'' said Yoshimasa Hayashi, a member of Parliament. ``I
expect to see a lot more bills submitted by lawmakers.''
	   During the most recent session of Parliament, which ended in
mid-June, 50 of the 167 bills submitted were generated by
lawmakers. That is more than double the average of any year in the
past decade.
	   Still, while almost all the bills that came directly from the
Cabinet passed, only seven lawmaker-sponsored bills became laws.
One of those compensates victims of the 1995 Tokyo subway nerve gas
attack and another revises valuations on land owned by banks.
	   Such legislation remains unusual enough it has earned a nickname
distinguishing it from other bills. It's called ``gi-in rippo'' _
``lawmaker law.''
	   The practice of allowing civil servants to dictate laws dates to
before World War II, when bureaucrats _ and Japan's military _
answered only to the emperor.
	   Postwar democratic reforms bolstered the hand of popularly
elected legislators and stripped the military of its voice in
policy-making. But the mandarins in government agencies_ culled
from the top graduates of the nation's best universities _ retained
enormous, often unchecked, influence.
	   Bitter turf wars and self-interest are often factors in
bureaucratic thinking. And because much of the bureaucracy's
decisions are made without open debate on the floor of Parliament,
much of Japan's official policy is shrouded in secrecy.
	   Public misgivings mushroomed this year amid disclosures about
fumbled attempts to handle serious problems such as Japanese banks'
bad loan crisis. Outrage was also stoked when several bureaucrats
were arrested for accepting bribes in the form of lavish
wining-and-dining.
	   As a result, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has made
streamlining the bureaucracy one of his main policy goals. Many
other politicians are also championing administrative reform ahead
of the July 12 elections for Parliament's upper house.
	   The issue is not merely a domestic matter.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton confronted this shadow power in
April when he chastised Tokyo's bureaucracy for blocking reform
proposals to jump start the anemic Japanese economy _ and by
extension that of Asia.
	   ``We have come to a stage where we need politicians'
decisions,'' said Minoru Makihara, chairman of Mitsubishi Corp.,
the big trading company. ``Legislation not dependent on the
bureaucracy must increase.''
	   But lawmakers who sponsor legislation can expect precious little
support.
	   ``Few lawmakers have the time or the expertise to draft bills on
their own,'' said Eiichi Sugimoto, a senior staff member of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party.
	   While U.S. lawmakers often have dozens of people on their
staffs, legislators in Japan are limited to just three paid
assistants _ only one of whom is supposed to focus on policy
issues.
	   There are no Japanese equivalents to Washington's well-staffed
Congressional Research Office, General Accounting Office or
Congressional Budget Office. Each house of Parliament has only a
small legal bureau with about 70 employees.
	   Some analysts doubt whether politicians would use greater
resources for lawmaking work.
	   ``Even if each lawmaker had 20 taxpayer-paid staff members, most
would just be put to work on political tasks, not policy matters,''
said Fumiaki Kubo, a political science professor at Keio University
in Tokyo.

Two Cuban swimmers say they plan to defect to United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS HAWLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Two Cuban swimmers who disappeared
from a Puerto Rican training camp appeared on television Thursday
night, saying they planned to defect to the United States.
	   Nubis Rosales and Daimara Munoz, members of Cuba's national
women's swimming team, were interviewed by WLII-Channel 11 with
Sergio Ramos, a lawyer known for helping Cubans apply for asylum.
	   The swimmers had disappeared Tuesday night from camp in Vega
Baja, about 20 miles west of San Juan.
	   ``It was difficult to do. I left my mother, my sister,'' Rosales
said. ``I didn't talk about my decision with my family or anyone. I
did it because I wanted to be here, free.''
	   Munoz, who is divorced, said she left a 2-year-old daughter in
Cuba.
	   By late Thursday, the women hadn't contacted the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said INS Deputy District
Director Myrna Oriette Pere.
	   Ramos, the attorney, couldn't immediately be reached by
telephone.
	   Rosales and Munoz missed practice Tuesday evening, and when
their teammates returned to their rented house in Vega Baja, the
two women were gone, said Jose Vazquez, head coach of the Cuban
swimming team.
	   Both women were gold-medal winners in the 1993 Central American
and Caribbean Games. They were among 27 Cuban swimmers training for
this month's Goodwill Games as guests of the Puerto Rico Swimming
Federation.
	   ``I've lost a medal with them,'' a disgusted Vazquez said. ``For
10 years I've been training them. I trusted them, and now they've
left when the team needed them most.''
	   He said earlier reports that the two women had stolen $100 from
his wallet were incorrect.
	   ``I don't congratulate them,'' Vazquez said. ``I would have
congratulated them if they had won their three medals, gone back to
Cuba and done this the legal way, like everyone else.''
	   The rest of the Cubans practiced at Vega Baja's municipal
swimming pool on Thursday, including Rodolfo Falcon, a silver medal
winner in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and Neisser Bent, who
won a bronze medal.
	   The delegation returns to Cuba Friday.
	   If the women do seek political asylum, immigration officials
from Miami will interview them to determine if they have been
persecuted in Cuba, said Charles Kirk, INS Caribbean district
director.
	   The last Cuban athlete to defect in Puerto Rico, a U.S.
territory, was Jose Perez, a runner who won the bronze medal in the

New monument to defeat of communism in Berlin sidesteps politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ This is a city of history and, as it follows, a
city of monuments: the angel-topped Victory Column, the imposing
Brandenburg Gate, the many sculptures and statues of Tiergarten
park.
	   These monuments are imperial, realistic _ and by today's
thinking, passe. But putting up a new monument in Berlin is no easy
thing. What should it look like? Where should it stand? What should
it stand for?
	   Former U.S. President George Bush avoided that debate
altogether.
	   While Germans are still arguing over memorials to the Holocaust
and the Berlin Wall, Bush and a group of supporters on Thursday
unveiled their own monument to the fall of communism.
	   Titled ``The Day the Wall Came Down,'' the 7-ton bronze
sculpture shows five horses _ representing freedom _ leaping over
fragments of the Berlin Wall. The horses have flaring nostrils,
straining muscles and perky ears, which is how artist Veryl
Goodnight, of Sante Fe, New Mexico, says she envisioned them in a
dream.
	   Bush was president in 1989 when the wall dividing communist East
Berlin from the democratic West was torn down. And his memorial
sits next to the city's new Allied Museum, devoted to the U.S.,
British and French occupation of postwar West Berlin.
	   Meanwhile, on the other side of town, construction workers are
putting the finishing touches on the German government's own Berlin
Wall memorial.
	   Rather than celebrating freedom, this one is meant to be
mournful _ remembering lives lost and families torn apart by the
Cold War.
	   Located next to the longest remaining stretch of original wall,
the memorial is a 70-yard (64-meter) replica, complete with a
gravel ``death strip,'' the zone patrolled by East German guards.
Sheets of metal on either end act like mirrors, giving the illusion
that the wall goes on and on.
	   After years of debate, the memorial is to debut Aug. 13 _ the
37th anniversary of the wall's construction. Even at this late
date, people are protesting.
	   The Berlin Wall victims association doesn't like the
inscription, which reads ``to the victims of the division of
Germany.'' Instead, the group wanted ``to the victims of communist
tyranny,'' which it says is a clearer condemnation of the former
East Germany.
	   A church at the site, upset that the wall ran right over its
graveyard, wanted it gone completely.
	   Another group of people whose property was confiscated to make
way for the wall says Germany should return the land to it.
	   When Bush and his sculpture group got together three years ago,
they thought their memorial might go where the original wall had
stood, or at a central location near the Brandenburg Gate.
	   These ideas were short-lived, says Alexander Longolius, the
executive director of the Checkpoint Charlie Foundation and one of
the supporters of Bush's privately funded project.
	   ``If we put it right where the wall was ... well, all of us know
the political debate going on,'' he says. ``We shied away from
debates.''
	   The Allied Museum was a perfect compromise, says Longolius:
Declaring the monument ``a gift'' from Americans to Germans helped
dodge the question of aesthetics.

Vaccine intended to prevent AIDS may instead cause the disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A genetically weakened virus that many hoped would
be a safe and effective vaccine against AIDS instead appears to
mutate into a strain that actually causes the disease.
	   The strategy is intended to ward off HIV infection by setting up
a low-grade infection with a harmless version of the virus that had
been cleansed of its most dangerous genes. However, those who
tested the strategy on monkeys reported Thursday that within a few
years the virus mutates into a killer.
	   The approach _ what scientists call a live attenuated virus _
was thought by many to be the best hope for creating a vaccine to
stop the worldwide epidemic of AIDS.
	   San Francisco-based Vaxgen Inc. recently gained U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approval to begin testing on humans of a
possible AIDS vaccine that doesn't contain a live strain of the
virus.
	   But Dr. Robert Gallo of the University of Maryland said that if
the live attenuated approach fails, it means AIDS vaccine
development is no farther ahead than it was in 1984 when little was
known about the epidemic's cause.
	   ``We have no guarantee that we will ever have a vaccine,'' said
Gallo.
	   Some doctors have advocated trying a live attenuated AIDS
vaccine on people. They contend that in areas where the risk of
catching HIV is extremely high, an effective vaccine would make
sense even if does carry a slight risk.
	   Researchers earlier reported that the weakened virus can cause
AIDS in infant monkeys. However, the data presented at the 12th
World AIDS Conference is the first to show that it can make adult
animals sick, too.
	   Creating an AIDS vaccine is a top priority of researchers but
also an extraordinarily difficult one. The AIDS virus attacks the
very parts of the immune system that are ordinarily called into
action by effective vaccines.
	   The live attenuated vaccine for AIDS was proposed by scientists
at the New England Regional Primate Center in Southboro,
Massachusetts. To test it on monkeys, they made a version using
HIV's close cousin, the simian immune deficiency virus, SIV. In
macaque monkeys, they found that the vaccine seemed to completely
protect them from catching what should have been deadly doses of
the full-strength virus.
	   However, in 1995, Dr. Ruth Ruprecht of Dana Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston discovered that the weakened virus triggered
the simian version of AIDS when given to baby monkeys. Defenders of
the approach countered that no one would ever give a live
attenuated vaccine to human babies, because their immune systems
are immature, and the approach still made sense for adults.
	   ``What we saw in infants is a fast-forward version of what could
happen in adults with an attenuated vaccine,'' she said at the AIDS
conference.
	   Ruprecht vaccinated 15 adult monkeys over the past three to five
years. One has died of AIDS. Three others have high levels of virus
in their blood.
	   Among nine infant monkeys vaccinated, six have developed AIDS
and five of them are dead. The other three have pre-AIDS
abnormalities.
	   The version of the vaccine she tested was weakened by deleting
parts of three genes that were thought necessary for it to cause
illness. She said the weakened virus mutates so rapidly that
strains eventually emerge that are able to thrive.
	   ``There is a mini-Darwinian experiment going on in every single
vaccinated animal,'' Ruprecht said. ``In the end, we have
disease.''
	   Los Angeles AIDS specialist Charles Farthing, who wants to test
a live attenuated HIV vaccine in people, called Ruprecht's latest
discovery ``more concerning'' than her earlier work in infants.
Still, he said, monkey AIDS is an even more virulent disease than
human AIDS, and the human vaccine would be weakened even more than
the monkey version she tested.
	   ``Looking at SIV in monkeys gives you a misleading impression of
what would happen in human beings,'' he said. ``This is not safety
data for humans.''

Holbrooke expected in Belgrade to meet Milosevic

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a new effort to bring peace to
Kosovo, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke has scheduled another meeting
with the man responsible for the crackdown in the Yugoslav
province, President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Friday's meeting in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade is part of
diplomatic efforts to end the violence if Kosovo, where hundreds of
people have died in recent months in fighting between ethnic
Albanian militants and Serb-led Yugoslav forces.
	   NATO officials have said they reserve the option to use military
force if all else fails. But the alliance's top leader insisted
Thursday that he prefers a diplomatic solution, warning that the
mistakes of earlier Balkan conflicts must be avoided in the
strife-torn province.
	   Secretary-General Javier Solana's support for peacemaking
efforts came just hours after the U.S. Embassy in the Yugoslav
capital of Belgrade announced that a new diplomatic monitoring
mission will start Monday. The mission will include American,
Russian, Austrian and Polish diplomats.
	   The diplomats will observe freedom of movement, which has been
hampered both by Serb police blocking access to regions where
anti-guerrilla operations are taking place, and Kosovo Albanian
fighters extending their grip in the central part of the province.
	   Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic was part of a separate
diplomatic effort.
	   Solana, who spoke in Sarajevo before leaving for Tirana,
Albania, said that NATO forces, which staged a display of air power
in the region last month, are continuing their preparations for
further action _ if necessary.
	   ``The situation we had in Bosnia should not be repeated,'' he
said. ``The international community will not allow that to
happen.''
	   In Tirana, an Albanian government official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Solana had asked the government to use
all its influence to bridge differences between the Kosovo Albanian
political leadership, which has sought a peaceful solution, and
militants, so that they can speak with one voice.
	   Hundreds of people have died since Yugoslavia started the
crackdown Feb. 28. Ethnic Albanian leaders have been pressing for
military intervention to halt the campaign.
	   Officials in Serb-led Yugoslavia maintain the crackdown is aimed
at wiping out ``terrorists'' and restoring order to the restive
province. They also accuse the Kosovo Liberation Army of attacks on
Serb civilians.

U.N. chief: All Nigerian political prisoners will be freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Apparently moving to polish Nigeria's
long-tarnished reputation internationally, the military government
will release all political prisoners, including the country's
leading opposition figure, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said.
	   The concession, which would free at least 250 prisoners, is the
latest sign that Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar is making a concerted
effort to break from the harsh policies of his predecessor, the
late Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   ``I'm leaving Nigeria with the stage set for the release of all
political detainees,'' Annan said Thursday at the end of his
four-day visit to this oil-rich but impoverished country. ``The
government will make an announcement at the appropriate time.''
	   Foremost among Nigeria's political prisoners is Moshood Abiola,
the apparent winner of presidential elections in 1993 that were
later annulled. He was arrested a year after the vote when he
declared himself president.
	   Annan said he had met with Abiola and that the opposition leader
had decided to relinquish his claim to the presidency and cooperate
with Nigeria's junta in making a peaceful transition to democracy.
	   ``I found him more realistic than some of us outside. Chief
Abiola realizes that a lot has changed,'' Annan said, adding that
Abiola was in good health. Abiola's priority is to rebuild his life
after more than four years in prison and then he will assess his
political support, the U.N. chief said.
	   Abiola has plenty of rebuilding to do. His fortune and his
personal life have suffered deeply during his imprisonment. Two of
his many wives have died _ one in an assassination-style slaying _
and his enormous business empire has largely collapsed.
	   The visit by Annan, a Ghanian, is itself a sign of the
widespread hope that Nigeria will reform itself. Annan is the
highest-profile diplomat to meet with the government since Abacha
executed leading playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November
1995, provoking international outrage.
	   Abacha's death last month from a heart attack, and the
assumption of power by Abubakar, has provided the opportunity for
political change in Nigeria, Annan said.
	   In his few weeks in power, Abubakar has met with opposition
leaders and international envoys, and has already freed some
political prisoners. As were those moves, Thursday's announcement
was met with encouragement.
	   ``We cannot but welcome such a development if it materializes,''
the French ambassador to the United Nations, Alain Dejammet, said
in New York. Nigeria, West Africa's most populous country, ``is a
very big power, very important, which can play a very active
role.''
	   ``With such prospects, it will be fully for the benefit of the
U.N., and of Africa and of Nigeria.''
	   The Clinton administration said Thursday that a delegation of
high-level diplomatic, military and foreign aid officials would
visit Nigeria next week.
	   ``There is a moment of opportunity here,'' State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington.
	   The head of the delegation, Under Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering, a former ambassador to Nigeria, had planned to visit the
African nation a month ago to try to persuade Abacha to turn over
power to a civilian government.
	   But he had to cancel the trip after Nigerian authorities
demanded the United States reinstate the U.S. visas of Nigerian
officials. That sanction was one of several imposed by the
administration to show displeasure with Abacha's rule, viewed in
the United States and elsewhere as corrupt, heavy-handed and
undemocratic.
	   Political jailings were rampant during Abacha's lengthy
dictatorship; between 250 and 280 people are believed still held
across Nigeria. All are kept in regular prisons except for Abiola,
who has been detained in the relative comfort of a government guest
house in Abuja, the capital.
	   The news of Abiola's release thrilled his family.
	   ``We're very happy that my father is coming home at last after
four years of unjustified and inhumane treatment,'' his daughter
Wura Abiola said in an interview in London.
	   But she added that it was too soon to predict his future plans,
saying he wants ``time to reflect and to make the right decision
for Nigeria going forward.''
	   Many Nigerian dissidents rejected the claim that Abiola had
surrendered his hold on the presidency.
	   ``There is no way Abiola can renounce the mandate without even
seeing his family or political associates,'' the National
Democratic Coalition, a prominent opposition group, said in a
statement released in Lagos. ``NADECO and the 14 million voters who
voted for him in 1993 cannot be a party to this so-called
renunciation.''
	   The statement came after the Concord newspaper, a Lagos-based
daily owned by Abiola, reported Thursday that the international
community had been pressuring Abiola to give up his presidential
claim.
	   There was no immediate response to that contention.

Ringleader of deaf vendors deported to Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A man who pleaded guilty in a New York court
to smuggling deaf Mexicans into the United States and forcing them
to work as trinket vendors has been deported to Mexico to face
money laundering charges, police reported.
	   Alfredo Rustrian Paoletti, know by the deaf workers as ``the
Hearing Man'' because he is not deaf, was placed under arrest at
the Mexico City airport Wednesday.
	   The money laundering charges stem from the estimated dlrs 1
million per year that Rustrian Paoletti and other ringleaders
earned by forcing deaf Mexicans to hawk trinkets in subways and
shopping malls.
	   A New York court has ordered the proceeds of those operations be
distributed among the deaf Mexicans.
	   In October 1997, Rustrian Paoletti 37, one of 20 people indicted
in the exploitation scheme, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
recruit, smuggle, transport and keep prisoner the deaf Mexicans.
	   Three other people are also facing charges in the case in
Mexico.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks lower in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Friday
amid little reaction to Japan's highly anticipated plan to
restructure its ailing financial sector. Tokyo stocks fell on
profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 140.56 yen in early trading, up 1.38 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York rate of 140.95
yen overnight.
	   The Japanese government announced details of its ``bridge bank''
plan Thursday to clean up the country's bad debt-ridden banking
system.
	   But they contained little that hadn't already been announced or
leaked to the media. The plan also made no mention of a hoped-for
permanent tax cut.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 91.46 points, or 0.56 points, to 16,380.12 points in the first
30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the average closed up 108.69
points, or 0.66 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 7.29 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,263.17. The
TOPIX closed down 0.29 points, or 0.02 percent, the day before.
	   Share prices started lower Friday on profit-taking after the
Nikkei average climbed the previous day for the seventh consecutive
session, during which the key index gained a total of 1,416.98
points, or 9.4 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.295 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.305 percent, driving its price up to 111.23 yen from 111.16 yen.

Desperate to escape Kosovo, Albanians fleeing to Bosnia of all
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SREDNJE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Desperate to escape the Serb
crackdown in Kosovo, a growing number of ethnic Albanians are
fleeing to of all places Bosnia, which is just recovering from its
own ethnic war.
	   The fact that people would seek shelter in Bosnia _ which became
a symbol of cruelty and suffering during the 1992-1995 war _ shows
the desperation of Kosovo Albanians as the conflict in their
homeland continues unabated.
	   ``Day and night men with black masks would storm into my
house,'' said Mona Hadjaj, 55, who arrived in Bosnia two months ago
with 10 family members.
	   One night, she recalled, Serbian-speaking gunmen burst in and
warned ``what we did in Sarajevo is nothing compared to what we
will do here.''
	   The next night, Albanian-speaking gunmen warned they would kill
her if she sided with the Serbs. ``It's total madness over there,''
she said.
	   There are no reliable figures on how many Kosovo Albanians have
fled to Bosnia since Serb forces launched a crackdown against
separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for
independence from Serbia.
	   Serbia, along with Montenegro, forms all that remains of
Yugoslavia.
	   During the past four weeks, about 170 Kosovo Albanians have
sought help from the Bosnian office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees. Most are draft-age men and mothers with children.
	   But a U.N. official in Geneva, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the actual number of Albanian refugees in Bosnia is
probably higher because many never register with international
organizations.
	   Instead, some seek shelter with relatives in Bosnia, which was
part of Yugoslavia until it broke away in 1992, triggering a 3
1/2-year war. Others eke out a miserable existence in shell-pocked
houses abandoned by Croat or Serb families who fled Sarajevo during
the fighting.
	   Those who do register end up in refugee centers, such as the one
in Srednje, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Sarajevo.
	   One of the refugees, Edvin Hajdarbasic, said he left Kosovo
after receiving a draft notice from the Yugoslav army, which many
young Albanians consider the enemy.
	   The choice, he said, was to report for duty and fight his fellow
Albanians or join the KLA. Instead, his father, Sucro, drove the
five members of the family to Bosnia.
	   Edvin said they hope to be resettled in ``America, Canada,
Germany, anywhere we can have a decent life.''
	   But UNHCR spokesman Chris Janowski said in Geneva that it is
unlikely many of the Kosovo Albanians will be accepted by third
countries. And their presence is already straining the resources of
the Bosnian government, which faces serious problems resettling its
own refugees.
	   In April, the head of UNHCR, Sadako Ogata, estimated about 1.8
million people from the former Yugoslavia remain displaced, most of
them from Bosnia and Croatia.
	   On Wednesday, six busloads of Bosnian Muslims returned to the
northern city of Tuzla from Germany. So far, Bosnian Serbs have
refused to let them return to their homes in Serb-controlled
territory.
	   But Munib Musevic, director of the Srednje refugee center, said
his facility cannot house the Bosnian Muslims because it is full of
Kosovo Albanians.
	   Mrs. Hadjaj, whose family lives in an abandoned house in
Sarajevo, turned to the city's Gypsy community for help, since her
daughter is married to a Gypsy.
	   The Gypsies, themselves on the fringes of Bosnian society, gave
them 50 kilos (110 pounds) of flour and four kilos (8.8 pounds) of
sugar. To supplement their food supplies, family members scour
through public trash cans.
	   Mrs. Hadjaj's 12-year-old grandson, Arton, spends his afternoons
in the outdoor market collecting vegetables which fall off delivery
trucks. Arton said he knows of at least 10 other Kosovo Albanians
who do the same.

Mexico compensates relatives of Chiapas massacre victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The government of
southern Chiapas state has paid dlrs 3,900 to relatives of eachof
the 45 victims of a Dec. 22 massacre by a pro-government
paramilitary group.
	   The damage payment for each victim was divided among surviving
children and spouses. Residents of the hamlet of Acteal _ where the
massacre occured _ who were wounded in the shootings received
between dlrs 1,100 and 2,800 for injuries.
	   ``This shows the (Chiapas government's) willingness to comply
with recommendations made by the National Human Rights
Commission,'' Robert Munoz Lievano, assistant state interior
secretary, said at a ceremony Thursday. The commission is the
government agency that called for victim reparations.
	   However, human rights activist Marina Jimenez said the state
government, most of whose top officials resigned after the
massacre, has not done enough to punish the killers. The victims
belonged to a group sympathetic to leftist rebels.
	   ``They still have yet to punish the killers and masterminds
behind the killings,'' said Jimenez, a member of the Fray Bartolome
de las Casas rights center.
	   Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising in Chiapas in
January 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights. Peace
talks between the government and the rebels have been stalled for
nearly two years.
	   The state government claims that paramilitary gangs like the one
responsible for the Acteal massacre no longer exist in Chiapas.
	   In a speech Wednesday in Chiapas, President Ernesto Zedillo
blamed foreign observers and local peace mediators for stirring
unrest in the state.
	   In an open letter to Zedillo Thursday, Washington-based Human
Rights Watch/Americas denied those charges.
	   Zedillo's criticism of international groups ``not only punishes
the bearers of bad news, but also converts them into possible
targets for violence,'' Human Rights Watch said.
	   The government has expelled dozens of foreign observers and
political activists from Chiapas in recent months, accusing them of
interfering in domestic politics.

Blues sign Geoff Courtnall to three-year deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By R.B. FALLSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ The St. Louis Blues kept another of their
big-money free agents Thursday, agreeing to a three-year contract
with left wing Geoff Courtnall.
	   The signing came two days after the Blues decided they wouldn't
try to re-sign Brett Hull, their career leading scorer. That gave
them enough money to keep Courtnall, 35, who led the team with 31
goals and was third in scoring with 62 points.
	   He's perhaps most valuable as an agitator.
	   ``He's a guy that really gives us energy on the ice,'' general
manager Larry Pleau said. ``It's something we felt real good
about.''
	   Of the four Blues who could have been unrestricted free agents,
Hull is the only one still on the market. Defenseman Steve Duchesne
signed with the Los Angeles Kings Thursday, and the Blues signed
All-Star defenseman Al MacInnis to a three-year, dlrs 15 million
contract last month.
	   Pleau said the Blues hadn't been negotiating with Duchesne.
	   ``We were just talking with Geoff and looking at forwards, and
kind of keeping an eye on defense,'' Pleau said. ``When you've got
limited funds, you can't just go out and spend.''
	   Courtnall also talked with the Dallas Stars, New York Rangers
and New York Islanders, but he wanted to stay in St. Louis. He had
been seeking a dlrs 10 million deal.

United States facing Israel-Palestinian problems on two fronts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States faces a battle on two
fronts next week: A resolution condemning Israel before the
Security Council and a debate in the General Assembly on the status
of the Palestinian mission.
	   Washington had tried to prevent both from reaching the United
Nations, arguing that any decision by the members of the world body
could jeopardize the delicate Middle East peace process.
	   But Arab members overruled U.S. objections and pushed both
initiatives onto the agendas of the 15-member Security Council and
the 185-member General Assembly.
	   On Thursday, Bahrain circulated an Arab-sponsored resolution to
council members that would condemn Israel for planning to expand
the border of Jerusalem and demand the decision be rescinded.
	   The council was expected to take up the issue early next week,
possibly Monday, sources said.
	   Bahrain, the lone Arab state on the council, has been leading
efforts to condemn Israel's June 21 decision to extend Jerusalem's
boundaries to include several towns and expand some municipal
services from Jerusalem to West Bank settlements.
	   According to a draft of the resolution, sanctioned by Arab
states, the council would condemn Israel for the move and demand it
take back the decision.
	   The draft also stresses ``that Israeli settlements in the
Palestinian and other occupied Arab territories are illegal and
constitute a major obstacle to peace.''
	   The United States could veto the resolution, but such a move is
considered unfavorable diplomatically.
	   Washington, though, has said the decision was regrettable
because it would alter the status and size of Jerusalem, one of the
most contentious issues in the stalled peace negotiations.
Palestinians want Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state.
	   America's other problem was in the General Assembly, where no
member has a veto.
	   Arab states want to upgrade the Palestinian's status from an
observer mission to that of a nonvoting member. A debate was
expected midweek.
	   The proposed new designation would make little difference in the
daily work of the Palestinian mission. But it would affirm
international support for the Palestinians in the protracted peace
process.
	   On Thursday in Washington, State Department James P. Rubin said
the United States was ``strongly opposed'' to the move ``because of
its potentially negative effects on the peace process and because
of the bad precedent it would set for the U.N. system itself.''
	   Despite U.S. opposition, resolutions favoring the Palestinians
are routinely approved with huge margins in the General Assembly.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York but without the same privileges as missions of
U.N. member states.
	   The PLO's status was upgraded in 1988 when the General Assembly
decided to designate the PLO as ``Palestine.''

Davies surprises even herself at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kim Williams moving into tie for lead; Will be
UPDATED with completion of play &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ It looks like Laura Davies will have to
change her travel plans.
	   After struggling most of the year, the Englishwoman figured it
would be more of the same in the U.S. Women's Open this week. But a
3-under-par 68 Thursday put her into a tie for the first-round lead
and threatened to keep her away from home a while longer.
	   ``The way the year has gone, I am expecting two rounds and be on
my way back to London Saturday morning,'' Davies, the 1987 Open
champion, said earlier this week.
	   Kim Williams of Brentwood, Tenn., who has never won 12 years on
the LPGA tour, shot a surprising 68 to gain a share of the lead
with Davies.
	   Despite Thursday's score, Davies was taking nothing for granted.
	   ``I'm so low on confidence, that's the trouble,'' she said.
``Out there today, I was panicking.
	   ``I am hoping I will be playing in all four rounds,'' she said.
``I would have to have a really bad day tomorrow. Who knows, the
way things have been going?''
	   Briton Alison Nicholas might be in the market for Davies' ticket
to London after opening defense of her Open title with a 78.
	   ``I hit a few good ones, but as I got further through the round,
I struggled. I got myself into some grass (on No. 10) that was
taller than I was,'' said Nicholas. ``I got out with a sand wedge.
A big thrash, it was. I closed my eyes at that point.''
	   Two-time Open champion Annika Sorenstam averted a second
straight first-round collapse after an early triple bogey on the
par-4 fifth hole of the Blackwolf Run Golf Course dropped her to
3-over.
	   ``I think I played really good golf _ on 17 holes,'' said
Sorenstam, the 1995 and '96 Open winner. ``There was just one hole
I had trouble on.''
	   Sorenstam recovered on the strength of five birdies, the last on
No. 18, a par-4 that is the toughest on the course. Davies, her
playing partner, also birdied the hole, putting her approach within
an inch of the cup.
	   ``It was just a dream finish, really,'' Davies said. ``Honestly,
I don't know how the pitch didn't go in.''
	   Sorenstam went into last year's Open trying to become the first
player to win the women's most prestigious title three straight
times. But a 77 in the first round ended her hopes and a 73 the
next day put her three strokes shy of the 36-hole cut.
	   Sorenstam returns to the Open playing perhaps the best golf of
her life, with victories in her last two starts and 10 top-10
finishes in 11 tournaments, including seven times in the top four.
	   When she triple-bogeyed the fifth hole, putting her tee shot
into water on the right side and then chipping over the green,
Sorenstam couldn't help but think about that triple-bogey at
Pumpkin Ridge last year.
	   ``For a few seconds, I did,'' Sorenstam said. ``But I told
myself, `This is only Thursday, put this behind you and go on.
There are a lot of good holes to come up.'
	   ``I won't give up,'' Sorenstam added. ``I'm going to keep
grinding. That's the lesson I learned last year.''
	   Leslie Spalding, Se Ri Pak and Pat Hurst fired 69s on the Pete
Dye-designed layout renowned for greens so fast that men's two-time
Open champion Ernie Els suggested the women practice by putting in
a bathtub.
	   The course was indeed demanding but not backbreaking.
	   ``The course is perfect,'' Spalding said. ``I guess we got a
little rain last night, so it is a little softer out there.''
	   Helen Alfredsson of Sweden aced the par-3 eighth hole, becoming
the 13th woman to score a hole-in-one in the Open.
	   ``I thought it was a little short,'' Alfredsson said. ``I had a
good line. I never saw it. It was just a matter if it was long
enough. Everybody went crazy, which was kind of fun.''
	   U.S. Open courses are longer than those the women usually play,
and that favors long and accurate hitters such as Davies and
Sorenstam. At 6,412 yards (5,834-meters), Blackwolf Run is the
second-longest ever played for a Women's Open.
	   ``I like a course where long hitters are given a chance,''
Davies said. ``All year we play such short golf courses that I
could hit my 5-iron off a tee and still be in play. This is nice
where you hear girls struggling and they're whining about hitting
woods in. I think it's fabulous.''
	   After 36 holes, the 60 lowest scorers and any tying for 60th
place, or anyone within 10 strokes of the lead, will make the cut.
The winner will receive dlrs 267,500 from the purse of dlrs 1.5
million.

Land mine protocol goes into effect Dec. 3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A treaty banning non-detectable, plastic
land mines has been ratified by enough countries and will go into
effect Dec. 3, the United Nations announced Thursday.
	   The treaty is an early appendix, or protocol, to the overall ban
on land mines, which has been signed by over 100 countries since a
conference in Ottawa last year after a Nobel Peace-prize winning
campaign by a land mine group.
	   Twenty-one countries, one more than needed, have ratified the
protocol to date, a U.N. spokesman said.
	   The accord bans the non-detectable, plastic mines which can kill
and injure decades after the end of a conflict and introduces
technical rules to limit the lifespan of anti-personnel mines
planted outside marked fields to three months.
	   But it gives signatories nine years to switch to the detectable,
self-destructive variety.
	   The ban also expanded the scope of an earlier weapons treaty to
internal as well as international conflicts.
	   And it imposes new export restrictions _ including an immediate
ban on transfer of non-detectable mines. It limits sales to only
governments and authorized state agencies who have promised to
respect the treaty.
	   U.N. officials said the overall land mine ban, known as the
Ottawa Convention, had been ratified by 23 of the required 40
governments and predicted it would go into effect in the first
quarter of next year.
	   The International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its former
leader Jody Williams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for their
work in bringing world attention to the issue.

New York warns of sanctions against Swiss banks over Holocaust-era

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American officials have increased the pressure
on Swiss banks, with New York City and New York state threatening
to bar short-term investments with the banks, which are suspected
of holding the assets of Holocaust victims.
	   Thursday's move comes one day after a commission representing
hundreds of U.S. finance officials cleared the way for sanctions,
saying negotiations between the banks and Holocaust survivors
seeking their families' assets ``reached a total, stone-like
impasse,'' said Alan Hevesi, commission chairman. There had been a
moratorium in place before on sanctions.
	   California, a commission member, announced Wednesday it will not
seek new contracts with U.S. subsidiaries of Swiss banks.
	   New York state, which with California has the largest pension
funds linked to Swiss banks, said Thursday that if there is no
settlement by Sept. 1, state and city officials will bar short-term
investments with the banks.
	   The banks and Swiss investment firms also will be forbidden from
selling state and city debt, said Hevesi, who is the New York City
comptroller. If the impasse continues, he said, the bans will be
extended to additional Swiss financial services in November and to
all Swiss companies in January.
	   Other commission members are also taking or considering action.
	   In New Jersey, the legislature is considering a bill that would
require the state to divest some dlrs 66 million in stock invested
with Union Bank of Switzerland until assets are returned to
Holocaust survivors. Vermont, Rhode Island and Kentucky also are
considering the possibility of sanctions.
	   Last year, Massachusetts ended its dlrs 120,000-a-year contract
with Union Bank.
	   Hevesi said he hopes U.S. officials will allow a measured
process of sanctions to give negotiators time to resolve the
issues. That didn't mollify Swiss banking officials.
	   ``The Swiss banks are outraged,'' said Ulrich Pfister, a
spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. ``Sanctions are
unjustified and counterproductive. We will study all measures we
can take against them.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said
sanctions by individual states or cities could hurt U.S.-Swiss
relations and urged continued negotiations.
	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe. But victims' relatives
say bank officials stalled survivors and their heirs after World
War II, claiming they could not find accounts or demanding
nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to relatives of
those who died in concentration camps.
	   Three Swiss banks made a take-it-or-leave-it offer of dlrs 600
million last month. It was rejected by Jewish leaders as being far
less than the dormant wartime assets Holocaust victims say the
banks stole from their families.
	   Melvyn Weiss, lawyer for more than 31,000 plaintiffs in a
lawsuit against Swiss banks, said Jewish groups have proposed a
dlrs 1.5 billion settlement that would cover claims against all
Swiss banks as well as the Swiss government.

U.S. congressmen warn Haitians of loss of aid

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ U.S. congressmen warned Haitian
legislators Thursday their poverty-stricken nation will lose the
financial support of the United States if they don't quickly
install a new government.
	   Haiti hasn't had a prime minister since June 1997, when Rosny
Smarth resigned to protest fraud in legislative elections.
	   The U.S. delegation, led by Michigan Democrat John Conyers,
warned that Congress ``is inclined to cut all assistance to Haiti
if, in one or two months, there isn't a (new) government,'' said
Haitian Rep. Joseph Jasmin.
	   ``We told them that perhaps their conception of democracy is not
necessarily the same as ours,'' Jasmin said.
	   Because of political infighting, Haiti has been without a fully
functional government since Smarth resigned.
	   The de facto government is being run on the 1997 fiscal budget,
since it has not submitted a 1998 budget to Congress. Plagued by
absenteeism, the Senate has not convened since April 15.
	   President Rene Preval has designated a new premier three times.
Haiti's Congress rejected each nomination, accusing Preval of
complicity in the tainted April 1997 legislative elections.
	   With no new government or elections in sight, international
lenders are withholding millions of foreign aid dollars for Haiti,
the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
	   U.S. congressional Republicans, meanwhile, have objected to a
request by President Bill Clinton to double U.S. aid to Haiti from
dlrs 70 million to dlrs 140 million this year.
	   The Clinton administration has failed to resolve the crisis,
despite several visits by former National Security Adviser Anthony
Lake and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   In 1994, Clinton sent 20,000 troops to Haiti to oust a military
regime that deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a bloody
1991 coup and subsequently killed 4,000 civilians. Aristide
returned from his U.S. exile after the invasion and was succeeded
by Preval in 1995 elections.
	   Conyers and Representatives William Delahunt, Democrat of
Massachusetts, and John Christensen, a Nebraska Republican, met
with Preval and Aristide during their visit, which ended Thursday.

Blair urges Northern Ireland to `hear voice of reason,' heads home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony
Blair urged extremists to ``hear the voice of reason,'' but left
Northern Ireland with Protestant marchers and Catholic protesters
still on a stubborn collision course.
	   The Orange Order, Northern Ireland's conservative Protestant
brotherhood, is threatening to defy an official ban on its annual
parade this Sunday from the rural Drumcree Anglican church past
Catholic homes along the Garvaghy Road of Portadown.
	   Anti-Orange protesters there have sat down on the road for the
past three summers, forcing authorities to decide whose rights
should prevail. The confrontation has triggered widespread violence
each year, and appears to be doing so again.
	   While in Northern Ireland, Blair toured one of 10 Catholic
churches attacked overnight Wednesday by arsonists, then met with
key political and religious figures at the British government's
Stormont headquarters in east Belfast.
	   ``I'm not here to negotiate over the situation at Drumcree.
That's not something I can do. What I can do is ask people to
listen to the voice of reason,'' he said before the meetings.
	   Blair didn't meet with Orange leaders or the protesters.
	   As Blair left Northern Ireland about midnight, vandals
apparently retaliating for the church fires torched Altnaveigh
Orange Hall outside the predominantly Catholic town of Newry.
	   Blair talked at length with David Trimble and Seamus Mallon, the
newly elected Protestant and Catholic leaders of Northern Ireland's
embryonic cross-community government, the cornerstone of April's
peace accord. He also met the leaders of the Catholic, Anglican and
Presbyterian churches, and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, whose
IRA-allied party organized opposition to several Orange parades
starting in 1995.
	   Since 1995 the Portadown Orangemen have triumphed over the
protesters, each time marching past Garvaghy Road's hostile
Catholics under police and army escort and back into the center of
the otherwise Protestant town.
	   In 1995, after a round-the-clock standoff, the protesters agreed
to wave placards from the curb as the parade passed. In 1996 police
blocked the parade but caved in after Orangemen massed in the tens
of thousands at the Drumcree church and Protestants rioted
elsewhere for four nights. And in 1997 authorities opted to permit
the parade and saturate Garvaghy Road with riot police and
soldiers, which sparked four nights of widespread Catholic rioting.
	   In all cases the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's
predominantly Protestant and terrorism-hardened police force, has
prevented direct clashes between Orangemen and Garvaghy Road
Catholics.
	   Orange leaders vow this time to rally for weeks at Drumcree if
necessary to wear down police resolve. They refuse to enter direct
negotiations with the protesters, particularly their leader, former
Irish Republican Army prisoner Breandan MacCionnaith.
	   Instead, as Blair had his behind-closed-doors meetings, two
senior Orangemen and MacCionnaith sparred bitterly live on Ulster
Television.
	   ``If I had the Orange Order where I wanted them, they would be
sitting down across the table with me,'' said MacCionnaith. He said
their refusal ``demonstrates an inability to treat this community
with respect and as equal human beings.''
	   Jeffrey Donaldson, an Ulster Unionist Party member of British
Parliament and a deputy grand master of the Orange Order, said it
was ``rich of a convicted IRA terrorist'' to lecture others about
equality.
	   ``This is the man who was involved in the bombing of the British
Legion Hall,'' said Donaldson, referring to a 1974 IRA attack in
Portadown for which MacCionnaith was convicted of playing a
supporting role. ``What respect has Breandan MacCionnaith ever
shown to the unionist and Protestant people in Portadown? None
whatsoever.''

Mini-tour unknowns grabs one-stroke lead in GHO

<TEXT>
	   CROMWELL, Connecticut (AP) _ Pete Morgan, who had to qualify to
make the field, birdied his last hole Thursday for a 6-under-par 64
and a one-stroke lead in the first round of the Greater Hartford
Open.
	   Morgan, 35, has played mostly mini-tours the past 10 years,
opened his round with three straight birdies. The Harwich, Mass.
native who lives in the Tampa, Fla., area shot a 69 Monday to earn
a spot in the field.
	   Hartford is only his fourth PGA Tour event since turning pro in
1989.
	   Casey Martin, playing his first tour event after suing for the
right to use a cart in competition, had a 1-over 71.
	   Morgan, who started on the back nine, came to the par-4 No. 9
sharing the lead with Kenny Perry and Scott Hoch. Morgan's 15-foot
birdie putt gave him a 64 and a one-shot lead.
	   ``I knew where I stood. I don't have very many opportunities
like this,'' Morgan said. ``I was trying to get to six (under) and
trying not to make a bogey at the same time.''
	   In fact, he made no bogeys in a round highlighted by a 30-foot
(9-meter) chip for birdie on No. 11.
	   While Morgan played in relative obscurity, Martin drew one of
the largest galleries of the day. Martin, who plays on the Nike
Tour, got a spot in the field this week through a sponsor's
exemption.
	   Martin, who also started on the back, was 1-under through five
holes but got into trouble when he tried to drive the 296-yard 15th
hole. He took a bogey to fall back to even-par and had two more
bogeys the rest of the way against one birdie.
	   ``I know I can play a lot better,'' Martin said. ``I just hope
it shows up here tomorrow or in the next couple of days.''
	   Perry, coming off a three-week layoff, started his round with a
birdie on No. 10, the tightest driving hole on the 6,820-yard
(6,206-meter) course. He made the turn with a 4-under 31 and
birdied Nos. 1-2 to reach 6-under.

Hall of Famer keeps chin up

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Heartbreak didn't wait until Sunday for
Nancy Lopez this year.
	   The four-time U.S. Open runnerup who lost by a shot to Alison
Nicholas in 1997 fizzled in the first round of the Open on
Thursday, stumbling to a 6-over-par 77 at the Blackwolf Run Golf
Course.
	   And it took a birdie on No. 18 _ her only one of the day _ to
keep this from being her worst Open performance since the third
round at Indianapolis in 1978, when she shot an 8-over 79.
	   ``The 18th is always a good hole to birdie,'' said Lopez, who
kept her chin up. ``I guess it makes your dinner taste better.''
	   But this had to be a bitter pill for her to swallow.
	   Lopez, 41, a member of the LPGA Hall of Fame, has won 48
tournaments, three LPGA championships, more than dlrs 5 million in
prize money and millions of fans coast to coast.
	   But never an Open.
	   Last year, she was the first woman to shoot in the 60s all four
rounds of the Open, yet lost to Nicholas by a shot in a dramatic
finish on No. 18 at Pumpkin Ridge in Oregon.
	   Lopez, who was won everything there is in women's golf except
for the Open, really felt good about her chances this year.
	   Instead, she is in danger of missing Friday's cut.
	   Earlier this month, she prepped on an Open course for the first
time in her career, flying here with her husband, Ray Knight, as a
guest of Herb Kohler, president of Kohler Co., which owns the
challenging course.
	   After practice rounds this week, she proclaimed she had never
felt better heading into an Open, especially on such a tough
course.
	   But the sneak preview of Pete Dye's unforgiving layout didn't
help her much on Thursday as she collected seven bogeys, five on
the front nine.
	   ``I think I was more disappointed for the people who were
watching,'' Lopez said. ``It didn't bother me. They were all
expecting me to do well and I felt bad for them.''
	   Lopez, who took second as an 18-year-old amateur in the 1975
Open and was runnerup in '77 and '89, went into a prolonged funk
over her fourth brush with victory last year.
	   ``It took me about three months to get over it,'' she said.
	   But she was more philosophical about her disappointment Thursday
in her 22nd Open.
	   Even after finishing the front nine with three straight bogeys,
she didn't let her emotions get the best of her.
	   ``I never really felt angry today,'' Lopez said. ``Usually, with
three bogeys like that in past Opens, I've felt frustrated. I never
felt that today. I felt like I still had a chance. I knew I was
hitting well. I kept saying, `Just keep going and something
positive will start happening and you might start making some
birdies.'''
	   It wasn't until the final hole that her perseverance paid off.
	   ``I played the last five holes really strong, really good _ the
way I felt I was going to play all day,'' she said. ``That was good
because I finished with a birdie on 18 and that made me think
something was happening. I finally got my comfort zone with the
irons and what I was doing distance-wise.
	   ``Now,'' she said with a shrug, ``I have to go out and start
that way tomorrow.''

Aboriginal land rights bill returns to Parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A controversial bill to restrict
Aborigines' land rights is expected to be passed into law next week
after a deal was struck between Prime Minister John Howard and key
independent legislator Brian Harradine.
	   The legislation was returned to Parliament on Friday for the
third time as the body's lower house passed about 80 new amendments
to the native title bill using the conservative coalition
government's dominant numbers.
	   The bill will go to the narrowly divided upper house, the
Senate, on Monday, where Harradine has said he will give it his
crucial vote after this week's deal.
	   By reaching the compromise, Howard avoids having to dissolve
Parliament and call an early election to resolve the problem while
the polls show his popularity at an all-time low, at 34 percent.
	   The bill limits claims by Aborigines on access to the vast
tracts of lands that the government leases to ranchers, farmers and
miners _ some 42 percent of Australia's land mass.
	   However, Howard still faces unrest among government politicians
who say the bill does not go far enough.
	   Howard told Parliament the new amendments would deliver greater
predictability to farmers than any other possible outcome.
	   ``The agreement reached between the government and Sen. Brian
Harradine, if given effect to by this house and the Senate, will at
long last deliver to the people of Australia a resolution of an
extraordinary difficult issue,'' Howard said.
	   ``It will provide the basis of fairly resolving an issue which
has caused doubt and uncertainty, and over a period of almost five
years has engendered and not improved relations between indigenous
people and other Australians.''
	   Under the agreement, the government will give Aborigines the
same negotiating rights as farmers and ranchers on mining leases,
but under state-based land management regimes rather then a federal
scheme.
	   The government also agreed to abandon a six-year deadline for
the lodging of native title claims.
	   Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said Howard's package was flawed
and would not resolve the native title issue because it would be
challenged in the courts.
	   ``Anybody who kids themselves that this 400 pages of amendments
to a 130 page bill is actually going to resolve this issue for all
time is a person who is regularly addicted to the triumph of hope
over experience,'' Beazley said.
	   Aboriginal leaders have condemned the legislation, saying it
unfairly restricts Aborigines' rights.

North Korean leader urges bumper crop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korean leader Kim Jong Il issued
a special order to his hunger-stricken country's military and party
to help farmers increase agricultural production, an official
report said Friday.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Kim sent a
telegraphic order Wednesday to farmers and their helpers, urging
them to celebrate the communist regime's 50th anniversary this year
with ``increased production of rice, vegetable, fruit and meat.''
	   Kim was expected to use the Sept. 9 anniversary to complete his
ascension to power. Kim, 56, now supreme military commander and
ruling Workers Party general secretary, has yet to become state
president.
	   ``Deeply aware that rice is precisely socialism ... the whole
party, the entire army and all the people should actively assist
socialist rural communities, thus reaping a bumper harvest this
year without fail,'' Kim said.
	   Kim thanked farmers, soldiers and other helpers who successfully
finished this year's rice-transplanting ``with devoted efforts,
upholding our party's agriculture-first policy,'' KCNA said.
	   Rice is one of North Korea's staple crops, along with corn and
wheat.
	   Hunger and malnutrition remain serious problems in North Korea
after years of floods, drought and agricultural mismanagement in
the isolated, Stalinist country.
	   On Thursday, the U.N. World Food Program said North Korea will
need another 500,000 tons of food aid this year in addition to what
has already been pledged.
	   The Rome-based agency said the food supply situation ``remains
precarious and is expected to worsen over the next two critical
months as stocks become exhausted.''
	   Also Friday, a federation of South Korean civic and charity
groups began shipping 1,000 tons of fertilizer to the North in
humanitarian aid.

Despite bad back, Williams shares lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with play suspended with two groups on the course &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Four years after the terrifying night
she was struck by a stray bullet, Kim Williams shot the round of
her life in the U.S. Women's Open.
	   Despite pain from a bad back that acted up so much she had to
lay down on the 12th tee, Williams fired a 3-under-par 68 Thursday
on the Blackwolf Run Golf Course to gain a share of the lead with
Laura Davies of England.
	   Williams, who has never won in 12 years on the LPGA tour, had no
expectation of continued success on Friday.
	   ``Who knows how my back will feel tomorrow?'' she said. ``I'm
happy just that I was able to play. That was a big concern, that I
wasn't going to be able to play.''
	   After all, her back, which she injured in the second tournament
of the year and then aggravated a month ago, limited her to nine
holes of practice in the week leading up to the Open.
	   The pain got so bad at the turn that she began wearing a back
brace between shots.
	   Not that she was complaining.
	   Not after what happened to her in Youngstown, Ohio, in 1994. As
she was walking into a drugstore, Williams was struck in the neck
by a stray bullet from a holiday reveler firing a gun a half-mile
away.
	   ``You gain a perspective going through something like that,''
Williams said. ``When I was laying on that floor bleeding to death,
I never thought, `Oh, my God, I never won a U.S. Open,' or `I don't
have enough money.'
	   ``Keep your life in balance and be appreciative of the fact that
you're even here and able to play in the Open.''
	   Davies didn't expect to be in a share of the lead.
	   After struggling most of the year, the Englishwoman figured it
would be more of the same in the Open this week. But her 68
threatened to keep her away from home a while longer.
	   ``The way the year has gone, I am expecting two rounds and be on
my way back to London Saturday morning,'' Davies, the 1987 Open
champion, said earlier this week.
	   Despite Thursday's score, Davies was taking nothing for granted.
	   ``I'm so low on confidence, that's the trouble,'' she said.
``Out there today, I was panicking.
	   ``I am hoping I will be playing in all four rounds,'' she said.
``I would have to have a really bad day tomorrow. Who knows, the
way things have been going?''
	   Briton Alison Nicholas might be in the market for Davies' ticket
to London after beginning defense of her Open title with a 78.
	   Two-time Open champion Annika Sorenstam averted a second
straight first-round collapse after an early triple bogey on the
par-4 fifth hole dropped her to 3-over.
	   ``I think I played really good golf _ on 17 holes,'' said
Sorenstam, the 1995 and '96 Open winner. ``There was just one hole
I had trouble on.''
	   Sorenstam recovered on the strength of five birdies, the last on
No. 18, a par-4. Davies, her playing partner, also birdied the
hole, putting her approach within an inch of the cup.
	   Sorenstam went into last year's Open trying to become the first
player to win the women's most prestigious title three straight
times. But a 77 in the first round ended her hopes and a 73 the
next day put her three strokes shy of the 36-hole cut.
	   Sorenstam returns to the Open playing perhaps the best golf of
her life, with victories in her last two starts and 10 top-10
finishes in 11 tournaments, including seven times in the top four.
	   When she triple-bogeyed the fifth hole, putting her tee shot
into water on the right side and then chipping over the green,
Sorenstam couldn't help but think about that triple-bogey at
Pumpkin Ridge last year.
	   ``For a few seconds, I did,'' Sorenstam said. ``But I told
myself, `This is only Thursday, put this behind you and go on.
There are a lot of good holes to come up.'
	   The 14-hour round was suspended because of darkness with two
groups still on the course. Those six golfers will complete their
rounds Friday morning.
	   Leslie Spalding, Se Ri Pak and Pat Hurst fired 69s on the Pete
Dye-designed layout renowned for greens so fast that men's two-time
Open champion Ernie Els suggested the women practice by putting in
a bathtub.
	   The course was indeed demanding but not backbreaking.
	   Helen Alfredsson of Sweden aced the par-3 eighth hole, becoming
the 13th woman to score a hole-in-one in the Open.

United douse Fusion 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Jaime Moreno scored twice and Roy Lassiter
added a goal as D.C. United defeated the Miami Fusion 3-1 Thursday
night.
	   D.C. (14-5) dominated the Major League Soccer game, out-shooting
the Fusion 28-7. Moreno scored goals in the 40th and 55th minutes.
	   The Fusion (6-11) played a man down the entire second half after
Diego Serna was ejected with a red card in the 43rd minute.
	   Miami did make it interesting with a goal by David Vaudreuil in
the 73rd minute. It was Miami's only shot on goal in the contest.
	   United, which hit the crossbar twice and had several more near
misses, put things away with Lassiter's score in the 76th minute.
	   D.C. improved to 9-1 at RFK Stadium this season.
	   The United defense, which had given up 10 goals in the past
three games, was bolstered by the return of U.S. national team
defenders Eddie Pope and Jeff Agoos.
	   D.C. keeper Scott Garlick has four shutouts this season, two
coming against the expansion Fusion.
	   While Colombia, like the United States, was knocked out of the
first round of the World Cup, Miami did not have the services of
playmaker Carlos Valderrama on Thursday. The Colombian star is
expected to return to the Fusion in time for a July 8 U.S. Open Cup
game against the Orlando Nighthawks.

Duchesne returns to Los Angeles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LOUINN LOTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Defenseman Steve Duchesne signed a three-year
contract with Los Angeles on Thursday, bringing him back to the
Kings for the second time in his National Hockey League career.
	   Duchesne, a free agent, had not been negotiating with the St.
Louis Blues, who swept the Kings 4-0 in the first round of the
playoffs. He led Blues defensemen in scoring last season and was a
key to the team's power-play unit. The three-time all-star was
fourth in scoring among NHL defensemen last season with 56 points.
	   ``I'm disappointed the Blues didn't make me an offer,'' Duchesne
said during a conference call. ``But I'm very happy to be back in
Los Angeles. The Kings are definitely the place where I want to
go.''
	   Duchesne, 33, played five seasons for the Kings from 1986-91. He
is still the team's leading goal scorer among defensemen with 95
and second on the Kings' career scoring list among defensemen with
292 points.
	   His three-year deal includes an option for a fourth season.
Terms were not disclosed.
	   ``I know they have the chance to go very far and win the
(Stanley) Cup one day and for that reason, definitely, I want to be
here,'' said Duchesne, adding that he hopes to finish his career in
Los Angeles.
	   Coach Larry Robinson welcomed him back.
	   ``Steve, it's about time you got back here,'' Robinson said.
``Steve makes us one of the best defensive corps in the NHL. I
think we're a big, physical team but last year, we took way too
many penalties. I think Steve can bring a lot of leadership. We've
lost a lot of games because our power play didn't go well.''

Tense showdown between Israeli and Palestinian troops; Gaza sealed

	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In the tensest showdown in nearly
two years, Israeli and Palestinian troops scuffled Thursday and
pointed guns at one another from hastily dug fortifications outside
Jewish settlements in the southern Gaza Strip.
	   A seemingly routine argument over the use of a road led to the
confrontation which quickly escalated. Scores of Palestinian trucks
blocked access roads to the settlements and in response, Israel
brought in armored personnel carriers and sealed off the entire
Gaza Strip.
	   At about 5 a.m. Friday _ some 12 hours after the standoff began
_ there were first signs that the situation was being resolved.
Palestinian policemen were seen leaving their position near the
Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom and a Palestinian official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. mediators had
negotiated a compromise.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai had appealed to the
U.S. Mideast peace envoy, Dennis Ross, and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, for help in defusing the
situation.

Graf appreciates playing without pain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEEPTI HAJELA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWARK, New Jersey (AP) _ Two months ago, struggling to regain
her form after a series of injuries, Steffi Graf was frustrated.
	   Frustrated at her physical problems, frustrated at having to
withdraw from tournaments, frustrated enough that she could see the
day when she would no longer play.
	   ``I was pretty close'' to quitting, she said Thursday in a
telephone conference call from Germany. ``I thought, `I can't take
it too much longer.'''
	   Now, despite losing last week at Wimbledon, Graf is feeling
better _ physically and about her future in the game.
	   ``There have been no physical problems over the last five or six
weeks,'' she said. ``It's given me the hope and confidence that I'm
able to keep on doing what I love to do.''
	   Graf, 29, will be joining the field at the A and P Tennis
Classic in Mahwah, which starts July 13 and runs until July 19. She
has won the exhibition five times. Anna Kournikova, who beat Graf
at Eastbourne this year, and Mirjana Lucic are among the others
competing in the event.
	   Graf still has to decide on her schedule after the competition.
She said she would play in the U.S. Open in September, and in the
interim might head to the Fed Cup. If she doesn't play Fed Cup, she
said she would stay in the United States after Mahwah and play
tournaments in California and Montreal.
	   Graf, who has dominated women's tennis for the past decade, has
been attempting a comeback since reconstructive surgery on her left
knee after last year's French Open.
	   She has won 103 titles, 21 of them Grand Slam events. She's won
Wimbledon seven times, the French and U.S. Opens five times each
and the Australian Open four times. She held the No. 1 ranking for
377 weeks, longer than any other player.
	   In 1988, she won all four majors plus the gold medal at the
Seoul Olympics. Her last tournament victory came in May 1997 in
Strasbourg, France.
	   But her return has been difficult. Last week at Wimbledon, she
lost to Natasha Zvereva in the third round. She had beaten Zvereva
in 17 previous meetings.
	   Graf, competing in only her fifth tournament of the year, said
the lack of matches hurt her, making it a tense situation.
	   ``I felt I was really under pressure ... I didn't feel I was
very relaxed at all,'' she said. ``I wasn't ready to play.''
	   She said she was looking forward to the next few months, getting
more matches under her belt against top players. She said she
wasn't thinking about whether she would return to Wimbledon next
year, and will take things as they come.
	   As for overtaking the top spot in the rankings again, Graf said
she's not even thinking about it. She's just happy to be able to
play without serious pain.
	   ``I appreciate being able to be on the court and move the way I
want to,'' she said.

Pak not acting like a rookie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Se Ri Pak, the rookie from South Korea
who won the LPGA Championship in May, wasn't the least bit
intimidated by the big crowds and high stakes in the U.S. Women's
Open on Thursday.
	   Pak said the bigger the tournament, the calmer her nerves.
	   ``I like for many people to watch and the big, loud ovations, I
like that, too,'' said the shy 20-year-old who fired a 2-under 69
in the first round.
	   Pat Hurst, who also shot 69, said she wasn't surprised by Pak's
worry-free manner.
	   ``She has won I don't know how many tournaments in Korea. She is
their big star athlete. Not just golfer, but athlete,'' Hurst said.
``I think in order to do that, she has got to have all the mental
capabilities to withstand all the pressures that are coming from
her country alone.
	   ``I think she does have the mental toughness that it takes to
play an Open golf course. Her age is irrelevant,'' Hurst said.
	   Herb Kohler, president of Kohler Co., which owns Blackwolf Run
Golf Course, site of the Open, has lauded Pak every chance he's had
to promote the tournament.
	   ``Se Ri Pak, watch her play,'' Kohler said. ``I think she can do
more winning in her rookie year than Tiger Woods did.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HONK HONK: &LR;  An estimated crowd of 21,000 attended the opening
round of the 53rd U.S. Women's Open at Blackwolf Run.
	   But the morning was marred by hour-long traffic delays, drawing
complaints from fans and prompting organizers to add 1,000
additional paved parking spots to alleviate the congestion over the
holiday weekend, when record crowds of 25,000 to 30,000 are
expected.
	   ``This championship is worth waiting for,'' said Judy Bell, past
president of the U.S. Golf Association.
	   Cars slowed to a crawl within five miles of the golf course on
Interstate 43 and Highway 23.
	   Parking lots for 4,000 cars, or 15,000 spectators, were prepared
for Thursday. An additional 1,000 parking spots were mowed out in
pastures surrounding Blackwolf Run when traffic began to swell.
	   Organizers had been expecting 16,000 spectators for the first
round of the 72-hole tournament. They underestimated by 5,000.
	   ``The problem was that we could not park cars in fields fast
enough to accommodate these crowds,'' championship manager Lisa
Luigs said.
	   Luigs said the 1,000 additional parking spots that were added
are at the Kohler Co. plant. Kohler, maker of bath and kitchen
fixtures, owns Blackwolf Run.
	   Golfer Martha Nause, who grew up a few miles from the course in
Sheboygan, said she wasn't surprised by the big crowds.
	   ``The crowds are huge and they are enthusiastic, and probably
because I'm local, I'm feeling it a bit more. But the other players
have commented to me that the size of the crowds is great,'' Nause
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOMESTATE HEROES: &LR;  Sherri Steinhauer of Madison finally got to
play in front of a home crowd Thursday.
	   Because the LPGA doesn't have a tour stop in Wisconsin, most of
her family and friends rarely have gotten to see her play in
person.
	   ``It was fun to play in front of these galleries,'' said
Steinhauer, who shot a 5-over 76 in the first round. ``It reminded
me of when I was a kid. They weren't a distraction, and you can
feel the support out there. That makes it a lot of fun.
	   ``I play all year in different parts of the country and I never
got that feeling,'' she said.
	   Steinhauer may be a homestate favorite, but Martha Nause grew up
just a few miles down the road in Sheboygan. She qualified for the
Open two weeks ago.
	   ``The reception I got on the first tee when they announced me
made me weak in my knees,'' Nause said. ``Then, I had to regroup
and hit my first shot.''
	   Nause shot a 74.
	   ``That was the most fun, hard round of golf I've ever played,''
she said.

World Cup: Cobi Jones of U.S. team chides media
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Cobi Jones says reporters ``played a
large part'' in the split between some veteran players and the
coaching staff during the United States' last-place performance at
the World Cup.
	   Jones, who returned to the Los Angeles Galaxy on Thursday, said
conversations with teammates led him to conclude some reporters
were ``very intent on escalating'' the split and criticism of coach
Steve Sampson, who resigned Monday after the Americans went 0-3.
	   ``Some players said everything they said was taken out of
context,'' Jones said Thursday. ``They didn't want to say anything
or were saying stuff like, `That's a decision for the coach,' or
said they didn't have anything to say until after. Even that was
printed, with the impression they were going to try to hammer the
coach afterward.''
	   Jones also chided teammates he didn't identify for being
publicly critical of Sampson's 3-6-1 formation and lineup while the
Americans still had a possibility of advancing to the second round.
	   ``The thing that's disappointing if they want to do it, they
should have done it when the World Cup was over,'' he said.
``Coming out in the middle distracted the team from focusing on the
game.''
	   Jones said Sampson's resignation was justified because ``the
coach is always going to be held responsible for the team'' and
``you're not going to be able to change 22 players, but you can
change one coach.''
	   However, Jones said the players also bear a measure of
responsibility for finishing last among 32 nations.
	   ``We have to look at ourselves and say all of us _ players and
staff _ have a part,'' he said.
	   Asked about the possible return of Bora Milutinovic as U.S.
coach, Jones said, ``Bora seems to do a great job with all the
teams he has. He'd do a great job with the U.S. if he came back.''
	   Milutinovic was the U.S. coach from 1991-95, leading it to the
second round of the 1994 World Cup. U.S. Soccer Federation
president Alan Rothenberg says his top candidates include
Milutinovic, Carlos Alberto Parreira and Carlos Queiroz.

Sloan signs new three-year contract
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG BEACHAM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Now that Jerry Sloan is signed to a new
three-year contract, Karl Malone can concentrate on important
things like tag-team wrestling.
	   Sloan's agreement with the Utah Jazz, which was finalized last
week when the coach was in town for the National Basketball
Association draft, runs through the 2000-2001 season. Sloan had one
year remaining on his previous deal, but Jazz general manager Tim
Howells said the deal signed last week was completely new.
	   Malone, who will wrestle Dennis Rodman on July 12 in a
pay-per-view match, has said he wouldn't play in Utah for any other
coach. He has also been critical of Jazz management's handling of
Sloan's contract limbo.
	   ``I've said it before, I'm not going to be here if Jerry isn't
here,'' Malone said last month. ``They need to make that commitment
to him or Karl Malone will find someplace else.''
	   Sloan, vacationing at his farm in southern Illinois, and Malone
were unavailable for comment Thursday.
	   Sloan, who is easily the National Basketball Association's
longest-tenured coach, will begin his 11th season with the Jazz
this fall. Houston's Rudy Tomjanovich is the only other coach who
has been with his team longer than six full seasons.
	   Sloan, 56, has been Utah's head coach since early in the 1988-89
season when he succeeded Frank Layden. He guided the Jazz to
consecutive Western Conference championships in the last two
seasons, both of which ended with losses in the NBA Finals to the
Chicago Bulls.
	   The Jazz and Sloan have been in agreement on the new deal for a
month now, but the contract wasn't signed until the finals were
finished. The deal was reported in The Salt Lake Tribune on
Thursday.
	   The Jazz have won four Midwest Division titles, as well as the
two conference championships, under Sloan. Utah has never won fewer
than 47 games and finished lower than third in the division since
Sloan has been at the helm.
	   Terms of the deal were not released.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks lower in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday currency, stock and bond prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Friday morning
as investors gave a thumbs down to Japan's long-awaited plan to
restructure its ailing financial sector. Tokyo stocks fell on
profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 140.89 yen as of midday, up 1.71 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo but just below its late New York rate of 140.95
yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 90.81 points, or 0.55 points, to 16,380.77 at the close of the
morning session. On Thursday, the average climbed 108.69 points, or
0.66 percent.
	   Thursday night, the Japanese government announced details of its
promised ``total plan'' to clean up the country's bad debt-ridden
banking system.
	   But the plan contained little that hadn't already been announced
or leaked to the media. Its center piece was a new law allowing
``bridge banks,'' which would take over loans from failed
institutions.
	   Bridge banks would make it easier for the government to allow
ailing banks to go bankrupt while preventing a collapse of
confidence in the already-shaky financial system.
	   But investors had wanted more, including commitments to use
public money to speed up the writeoff of bad debts.
	   The plan also made no mention of a hoped-for permanent tax cut.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section dropped 9.17 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,261.29. The
TOPIX closed down 0.29 points, or 0.02 percent, the day before.
	   Share prices also fell on profit-taking following seven straight
gains by the Nikkei 225 that saw the benchmark average add 1,416.98
points, or 9.4 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.315 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.305 percent, driving its price down to 111.08 yen from 111.16
yen.

Tense showdown between Israeli and Palestinian troops; Gaza sealed

	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In the tensest showdown in nearly
two years, Israeli and Palestinian troops on Thursday scuffled and
later pointed guns at one another from hastily dug fortifications
outside Jewish settlements in the southern Gaza Strip.
	   A routine argument over the use of a road led to the
confrontation. Scores of Palestinian trucks blocked access to roads
to the settlements and in response, Israel brought in armored
personnel carriers and sealed off the entire Gaza Strip.
	   At 5 a.m. Friday _ about 12 hours after the standoff began _
there were signs that the situation was being resolved. Palestinian
policemen were seen leaving their positions near the Jewish
settlement of Kfar Darom and a Palestinian official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said U.S. mediators had negotiated a
compromise.
	   On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai appealed
to U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, for help in defusing the
situation.
	   ``The situation is extremely delicate,'' said Mordechai's
spokesman Avi Beniahu.
	   There has been sporadic friction between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police in recent months. However, Thursday's standoff
was the most tense since September 1996, when scores of people were
killed in gunbattles between Israeli and Palestinian troops.
	   About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is controlled by the
Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops are deployed in and near
Jewish settlements and control several access roads. Israeli and
Palestinian troops conduct joint patrols on major thoroughfares.
	   Thursday's incident began in the afternoon when Palestinian
Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a
convoy of 22 Palestinian cars to use a coastal route it controls.
	   Israeli soldiers allowed Shaheen to use the road because as a
Cabinet minister he has special privileges, but asked the other
motorists to turn back. Shaheen insisted that all cars be allowed
to pass.
	   Dozens of Palestinian police arrived at the scene and quickly
engaged in shouting matches with Israeli troops. The two sides
angrily pushed each other and pointed their weapons at one another.
	   The Israeli army accused Palestinian police of orchestrating
``intentional disturbances'' by setting up roadblocks at major
intersections in the strip.
	   At Kfar Darom junction, near the Jewish settlement of the same
name, Israeli troops stationed three personnel carriers in the
middle of a road linking two major Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds of
vehicles were brought to a standstill for hours.
	   As the standoff dragged on, army bulldozers hauled in sand to
set-up extra military positions along the road, and Palestinian
police crouched in the fields just a few dozen meters away.
	   At one point, American and British diplomats arrived in the area
to try to mediate, but to no avail. Israel radio said Ross, Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Egypt's ambassador to Israel were
also trying to calm tensions.
	   The showdown came at a time when Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
remained deadlocked over the scope of an Israeli troop withdrawal
in the West Bank.
	   The United States proposed in January that Israel withdraw from
13 percent of the land, a plan accepted by the Palestinians.
However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he
could not hand over the land unless the Palestinians made a greater
effort to crack down on Islamic militants.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ All three crewmen of a downed U.S.
military helicopter were found dead in a remote, mountainous area
northeast of Seoul, American officials said Friday.
	   Searching the rugged terrain in heavy rain, soldiers found the
dead crewmen and the wreckage of their Black Hawk helicopter late
Thursday near Kapyong, a town about 45 kilometers (27 miles)
northeast of Seoul.
	   The identities of the dead were withheld until their families
could be informed.
	   The helicopter was on a training flight when it crashed Tuesday.
Heavy rain had hampered U.S. search and rescue operations.
	   The helicopter was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Aviation
Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division.

Japan plans to delay launch of space shuttle to 2003
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's space agency plans to postpone the launch
of a Japanese-made space shuttle by three years to 2003 due to
budgetary and technical difficulties, an agency spokesman said
Friday.
	   The delay marks the latest setback for Japan's ambitious space
program, which has been plagued by a series of recent mishaps.
	   The shuttle was originally scheduled to debut in 2000, but the
National Space Development Agency of Japan has requested the
postponement because of tighter budgets and unspecified trouble
collecting test data, said agency spokesman Hironobu Takara.
	   A formal decision will be made by Japan's Space Activities
Commission, a space program umbrella organization under the Prime
Minister's Office.
	   Separately, NASDA also plans to redesign its ``J-1'' rocket to
cut costs by using a Russian-made engine, Takara said.
	   The 20-ton unmanned craft, called the Hope-X, is designed to
conduct scientific experiments and ferry payloads into space of up
to 3 tons. It is modeled after the U.S. space shuttle.
	   The Hope-X will be launched into orbit atop a powerful booster
rocket and then re-enter the earth's atmosphere on a pre-programmed
route for a runway landing.
	   NASDA's most recent rocket launch in February failed to place a
communications satellite into proper orbit due to engine trouble.
	   Other accidents include the unexpected sinking of a prototype
shuttle in the Pacific Ocean in 1996 and the crash of a satellite
into the Pacific a year earlier after it veered out of orbit.

Report: Ex-wife of top Malaysian tycoon demands millions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The former wife of one of
Malaysia's most powerful businessmen is demanding that he divulge
all his assets so she can claim a large share of the empire she
helped to build, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Norani Zolkiffli, the ex-wife of politically well-connected
tycoon Halim Saad, filed a 500 million ringgit (dlrs 125 million)
property claim in Malaysia's Islamic high court, the Sun newspaper
said.
	   In the statement filed on Thursday, she said she will ``apply
for a court order ordering him to declare all his assets and its
value'' so they can complete their divorce settlement.
	   Norani said she had assisted her husband in expanding his
corporate kingdom as well as helping him buy shares in Renong Ltd.,
the country's biggest conglomerate that has interests in hotels,
construction and other businesses.
	   ``The defendant became a billionaire after his marriage to the
applicant in 1979 when he acquired shares in Renong Ltd.,'' she
said.
	   Norani said her former husband owns five houses in Malaysia as
well as homes in England, France, New Zealand and Vancouver,
Canada. He also owns 11 vehicles, including several Mercedes
Benzes, BMWs and two private jets, she said.
	   Norani also told the Syariah High Court she wants her husband to
hand over another 50 million ringgit (dlrs 12.5 million) to support
their children, who now live with her.
	   Malaysia's religious courts try divorces and other
family-related cases involving Muslims. Other cases and all
proceedings involving the country's non-Muslim minorities are tried
by civil courts.
	   Halim has seven days to file a defense.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ One year after China took command of Hong Kong,
U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke up for freedom and human rights
Friday and said this once-booming port city can help ``lead Asia
out of turbulent times'' in financial markets.
	   On the final day of his nine-day journey, Clinton addressed
community and business leaders on the theme of ``building stability
in Asia for the 21st century.'' The White House billed it as the
second most important address of his trip, after his Beijing
University speech on human rights and the steps China should take
in the 21st century.
	   Ending his trip on the themes that opened it, Clinton said,
``Political freedom, respect for human rights and support for
representative government are both morally right and utlimately the
best guarantor of the stability in the world of the 21st century.''
	   Clinton's address carried a political and economic message of
cooperation and trust. ``Americans can remember three wars we have
fought in Asia,'' he said. ``We must make it our mission to avoid
another.'' Scolding India and Pakistan for their nuclear tests, he
said the two South Asian nations ``bucked the tide of history.''
	   With Asia's economy in a tailspin, Clinton said that ``too many
booming economies, too many new skyscrapers now vacant and in
default were built on shaky foundations of cronyism, corruption and
overextended credit, undermining the confidence of investors with
suddent swift and severe consequences.''
	   He said that Hong Kong, grappling with its own economic woes,
``can help Asia out of turbulent times as it contributes to China's
astonishing transformation, by providing investment capital and
expertise and privatizing state enterprises and sharing legal and
regulatory experiences.''
	   Clinton said the future of Hong Kong under China should be one
of more democracy, not less, with no intrusions on freedom here.
``All this must continue,'' he said. ``I look forward to the day
when all of the people of Hong Kong realize the rights and
responsibilities of full democracy.''
	   He said some leaders worry that loud voices of dissent ``can
pull a nation apart,'' but said he fundamentally disagrees. He said
no set of leaders has the wisdom to make all the decisions without
hearing opposing views. ``Ideas are creating wealth in this
economy,'' the president said.
	   With the United States nudging Hong Kong toward a more
democratic system, Clinton pointedly called Hong Kong ``a world
symbol of trade, enterprise, freedom and global interdependence.''
	   In a show of support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians,
Clinton meets Friday with opposition leader Martin Lee and others
among the 20 legislators who won recent elections. The president,
though, had no plans to meet an additional 40 legislators who were
not selected by a direct vote of the people.
	   Clinton met over dinner Thursday night with Tung Chee-hwa, Hong
Kong's chief executive who was installed by the Beijing regime. In
a dinner toast, Clinton looked back over his trip and said he was
``profoundly appreciative'' to Chinese President Jiang Zemin for
helping make his trip to China ``a remarkably successful attempt to
continue to build our partnership for the future.''
	   And in a message sure to resound in Hong Kong, Clinton said he
was encouraged by signs ``that we can build together a future that
is more stable, more prosperous and free.''
	   Tung, in turn, assured Clinton that Jiang had reaffirmed his
commitment to maintain autonomy for Hong Kong, one year after the
former British colony returned to Chinese rule after 156 years.
	   ``The central government leaders are determined to ensure the
implementation of the basic law,'' Tung said, referring to the
rules under which Hong Kong is administered.
	   Fears that Beijing would crack down on demonstrators and push
political opponents to the margin after the July 1, 1997,
transition have so far proved unfounded.
	   Instead, Asia's sagging economy has eclipsed political concerns.
	   Tourism is down 20 percent while unemployment is at a 15-year
high. Sharing the woes felt across Asia, Hong Kong's housing values
and stock market have declined.
	   Clinton said that ``this present financial crisis, too, will
pass, if we work together with discipline and vision to lift the
fortunes of our neighbors.''
	   He is the first U.S. president to visit Hong Kong.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Police detained 350 striking subway
workers who set the tracks on fire Friday, bringing morning
commuter traffic to a standstill in South Korea's second largest
city.
	   Police in Pusan, a port city 350 kilometers (217 miles) south of
Seoul, said they planned to formally arrest union leaders accused
of organizing the illegal protest.
	   The subway workers went on strike Friday and staged a sit-down
on the subway tracks, demanding better working conditions and job
security.
	   When management sent in non-union workers to keep the trains
running on time, striking workers set fire to chairs and other
furniture which had been placed on the tracks and doused with paint
thinner.
	   Thousands of police were dispatched to remove the union workers.
	   Several striking workers climbed a 15-meter (50-foot)-high wall
separating the subway from a city block and threatened to jump off
to protest the police crackdown. But they later climbed down
voluntarily, the national news agency Yonhap reported.
	   No serious injuries were reported and subway operations returned
to normal three hours after police moved in.
	   Citing a growing deficit, the subway company has planned to cut
its work force. But weeks of talks with labor representatives have
failed to produce an agreement.
	   Management has wanted to use only one driver in each train _ an
idea vehemently opposed by the union. Currently, each train also
has an assistant driver.
