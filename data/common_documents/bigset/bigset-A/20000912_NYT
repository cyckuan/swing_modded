   ALBANIA JOINS TRADE GROUP
</P>
<P>
   Albania has become the 138th member of the World Trade
Organization, eight years after it applied to join. Mike Moore,
director of the Geneva-based global trade group, said the accession
of the formerly Communist-ruled country means the WTO can ``help
foster greater peace, stability and development in southeastern
Europe.'' Albania was one of the last redoubts of orthodox
Communism until 1992, when it was transformed by elections and
free-market economic changes. But Albania remains one of the
smallest and weakest countries in the region, hurt by years of
isolation and proximity to the armed conflicts in the Balkans. &QR;

   PHARMACEUTICALS ACQUISITION
</P>
<P>
   The Dublin-based drugmaker, the Elan Corp. acquired Dura
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of San Diego, for $1.8 billion in stock,
paying 0.6715 of an Elan ADR for each Dura share. The purchase,
Elan's third acquisition this year, raises its North American sales
force to more than 1,000. Dura's antibiotics and its Spiros brand
of inhaler had sales of $301 million in 1999. The products will
broaden Elan's offerings, which are now focused on painkillers and
treatments for breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease. &QR;

<P>
   The financial services arm of the General Electric Co., GE
Capital, is close to announcing a deal worth (PS)1 billion, or
about $1.42 billion, for Scottish Life Assurance, the mutual
pension provider, people close to the situation said. Details of
the deal are likely to be announced late in the week. GE Capital
approached Edinburgh-based Scottish Life after it decided not to
pursue a bid for Scottish Provident, another Edinburgh mutual life
insurer that agreed last week to sell itself to Abbey National for
(PS)1.8 billion. Scottish Life, with assets of (PS)9.7 billion,
would give GE Capital a foothold in the British pension market. &QL;

   A leading building materials manufacturer, Blue Circle PLC of
Britain, reported a 14 percent rise in profits for the first half
of the year, to (PS)125.8 million, or about $179 million, helped by
cost-cutting and a recovery in Asia. But the results were hurt by
the company's extensive spending to thwart a hostile takeover by a
French rival, Lafarge SA Blue Circle's chief executive, Rick
Haythornthwaite, had persuaded investors to reject Lafarge's
takeover offer in May, telling them that Blue Circle, which makes
about half the cement used in Britain, was better off independent. &QR;

FIRED DIPLOMATIC EMPLOYEE CAN SUE SAUDIS, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan has ruled that a former
employee of the Saudi Mission to the United Nations who claimed
that she was fired for espousing women's rights may sue for
discrimination despite Saudi claims that her suit is barred under
diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of the U.S. District Court, held that
the suit by Rajaa Al Mukaddam, who worked as a senior speechwriter
in the Saudi Mission for 14 years before she was dismissed in 1998,
fit a narrow exception to diplomatic immunity, opening the door to
the possibility of monetary damages against the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   Al Mukaddam, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Lebanon, claimed
in her lawsuit that she had also endured several years of sexual
harassment and hostility from ``male fundamentalist members'' of
the Saudi Mission, which increased after she complained.
</P>
<P>
   Al Mukaddam, whose age was not available, claims that she was
abruptly fired after she made a presentation to the United Nations
secretary general about creating a foundation to provide support to
one million poor women worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Saudi government said it was considering its
options, which include an immediate appeal to the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, an exceptional step allowed in lawsuits against
foreign governments. Usually, pretrial rulings may not be appealed
until a trial is over.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Alexandra A.E. Shapiro, said the Saudi Mission fired
Al Mukaddam ``for legitimate and nondiscriminatory reasons,'' but
would not elaborate. She said the ruling placed the Saudi
government and potentially other foreign governments in a position
where they are ``essentially subject to blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi government, she said, would either have to waive its
diplomatic privileges to defend itself in the lawsuit _ for
example, allow Saudi officials to testify _ or simply not defend
the suit and be forced to pay a judgment ``even where, as in this
case, the claims have no merit,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the United States could find itself in similar
situations abroad; for example, it might have to defend its
employment practices at a diplomatic mission in a country with a
very different legal system or customs, like one governed by
religious law.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbi C. Sternheim, who represents Al Mukaddam, said that her
client had no comment because the case was pending, but that Al
Mukaddam was ``very pleased'' with the ruling, ``and we are
confident that we will prevail at further proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking the suit's dismissal, the Saudi government said Al
Mukaddam was ``a professional civil servant whose duties were to
carry out a foreign policy function,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis cited the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976
and the Vienna Convention, both of which it said gave its mission
absolute immunity with regard to hiring and firing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis' view was supported by the United Nations. A U.N.
official, defending the immunity argument, wrote to the judge that
any measure that might hinder the ability of a mission to function
would contravene the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the decision, which was released Friday, Kaplan did
not address the merits of the suit, and accepted the allegations as
true for the limited purpose of deciding whether to allow the suit
to go forward. Kaplan ruled that Al Mukaddam fit an exception to
diplomatic immunity that applies to commercial activity.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also noted that she was hired in the United States and
was not a Saudi civil servant, and that her work, which included
research and clerical tasks and drafting speeches that were
delivered by Saudi officials to the United Nations, was not of a
diplomatic nature.

HOME PRICES HIT RECORD HIGH IN AUGUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News staff writer Kathleen Sweeney contributed to this
story.) &HT;    By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   TUJUNGA, Calif. _ San Fernando Valley single-family housing
prices soared to a record $255,000 during August, finally
recapturing the value lost during the deep recession of the early
1990s, a trade group said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sales also rebounded, with escrow closing on 1,204 single-family
homes, an annual gain of 6.5 &UR;  &LR; percent, said the Van Nuys-based
Southland Regional Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Home prices also reached record levels in the Santa Clarita
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   During the 12 months ending in August, the median price for a
resale home increased $43,000, a gain of 20.3 &UR;  &LR; percent. The median,
the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less,
is now $10,000 higher than the previous record of $245,000, reached
three times during 1989, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most homeowners long ago recaptured any lost equity, but this
record median price drives a stake through the statistical heart of
the last recession,'' said Mitch Davis, president of the Realtors
group.
</P>
<P>
   The last year of the 1980s was the best, as far as prices, and
so far 2000 is shaping up to be even better. For the first eight
months of this year, the median averages $235,000 vs. $234,187 for
the comparable period of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials and analysts had predicted that the lost
value would be made up this year. But the timing was uncertain. So
the timing and spread of August's record blindsided some observers.
Prices have been marching upward for months. Prices hit $236,000
during July, an annual gain of 8.3 &UR;  &LR; percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not shocked but certainly surprised the median price
shot up as quickly as it did,'' said Jim Link, executive vice
president of the Realtors group.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp appreciation is being attributed in part to a tight
supply of single-family homes for sale, a long-running problem in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Any price gains are good news for homeowners like Chatsworth
resident Gene Synder, a general contractor, who paid $230,000 for
his home 10 years ago. It wasn't that long ago that similar homes
in his neighborhood were selling for $170,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got killed,'' he said of the recession that saw prices
plunge throughout the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder could probably sell his home for about $260,000 now, he
says. But he's still not in the clear yet; he said he's put about
$100,000 worth of sweat equity into improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for a ``For Sale'' sign in his front yard any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going anywhere. I'm still on the wrong side of this
thing but in 2020 this house has got to be worth 300 grand,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Winnetka resident Matt Velie, a manufacturers sales rep, is of
like mind. He bought his house for $78,000 in 1978 but owes more
than that on it today because of some business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A house across the street is listed at $239,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy that I own this house,'' he said. ``It's taken
a while for (the value) to go back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts note that there is also a downside to such a sharp
price spike because it reduces affordability.
</P>
<P>
   During July, only 36 &UR;  &LR; percent of the households in Los Angeles
County could afford the median-priced home of $211,150.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a number that everyone will accept and say, Gee, the
market is back,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles Economic Development Corp. ``It's great news, especially if
you own a house.''
</P>
<P>
   But as prices rise, more and more people are pushed out of the
market because they can't afford to buy.
</P>
<P>
   This could lead to serious ramifications, especially for the
fast-growing tech sector in the West Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's growing rapidly and trying to attract young, talented
employees. The question is, are people going to be able to afford
housing?'' Kyser said. ``The bottom line is we haven't built enough
housing anywhere in L.A. County.''
</P>
<P>
   But Link at the Realtors group points out that a one-month jump
by itself is not a trend and prices may retreat in September.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of 2000 he is still predicting price appreciation of
between 5 percent and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One reason prices are rising is that the inventory of homes for
sale is falling. Last month there were 5,023 active listings, down
16 percent from a year ago. A number twice that total is typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current inventory represents a three-month supply in a
huge region that would be better served, that is reduce pressure on
prices, with a minimum six-month inventory . . . based on the
current sales rate,'' Link said.
</P>
<P>
   The condominium market was also strong during August. Escrow
closed on 399 units, up 12.1 percent from a year ago and the median
price was $140,000, an annual gain of 15.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Home prices in the Santa Clarita Valley also hit a record-high
in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clarita Valley Division of the Southland Regional
Association of Realtors released figures Monday that showed the
median resale price of single-family homes rose to $250,000,
beating the previous record set in July by nearly $5,000.

SCIENTISTS DECLARE A PRIMATE GROUP EXTINCT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd graf to correct date of paper's publication)  By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in several centuries, a member of the primate
order, the taxonomic group to which human beings belong, has become
extinct, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The vanished primate, Waldron's red colobus, was not nearly as
charismatic as, say, a chimpanzee or orangutan. Indeed, debate has
not yet ended on whether the loud-mouthed, red-cheeked monkey from
the rain forest canopy of Ghana and the Ivory Coast deserved full
status as a species in its own right or should remain a colobus
subspecies.
</P>
<P>
   But now that debate is moot, a team of primate experts reports
in a paper in the October issue of the peer-reviewed journal
Conservation Biology.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists say this is just the beginning of what they foresee
as a growing stream of extinctions of West African primates and
other wildlife. Fragmentation of forests by logging and road
building has created isolated islands of animals that are now being
systematically trapped and shot by hunters supplying the lucrative
trade in bush meat, which is flowing to urban restaurants and no
longer is just a staple of rural villagers.
</P>
<P>
   In the paper, the five authors, led by John F. Oates, an
anthropologist from Hunter College in Manhattan, conclude, ``The
extinction of Waldron's red colobus may be the first obvious
manifestation of an extinction spasm that will soon affect other
large animals in this region unless more rigorous protection is
applied immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   For biologists, proposing that something is extinct requires a
special level of confidence because no one wants to be the expert
who gets it wrong, and this time around, at least according to
several scientists familiar with the study, the authors' confidence
is justified.
</P>
<P>
   Ross D.E. MacPhee, an expert on extinction and the curator of
mammals at the American Museum of Natural History, said the
authors, by carefully monitoring the monkeys' habitat and history
over several decades, have created a rare, valuable picture of the
evolutionary endgame regardless of the monkey's status as species
or subspecies.
</P>
<P>
   Extinction is a process, not an event, he said, adding ``most
species do not wink out in an instant.'' With the disappearance of
Waldron's red colobus, scientists have had a front-row seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very legalistic sense, loss of this monkey may not amount
to a species-level extinction,'' MacPhee said, ``but it marks
something that may be even more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The last primate extinction documented by science occurred in
the early 1700s, MacPhee said, with the disappearance from Jamaica
of Xenothris mcgregori, a species similar to the capuchin monkeys
used by organ grinders. The next most recent extinctions occurred
in Madagascar in the 1500s, he said, with the loss of several giant
lemurs.
</P>
<P>
   Current lists of extremely endangered primates include lemurs
from Madagascar, tamarins from Brazil, langurs from Vietnam,
Sumatran orangutans, gorillas, and a variety of monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The last sightings of Waldron's red colobus were in the 1970s,
and a concerted seven-year effort to visit every last scrap of the
swampy rain forests the monkey preferred ended late last month in
the Ivory Coast without even a hint of its presence, said W. Scott
McGraw, an anthropologist at Ohio State University who led the
latest trip and is a co-author of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy forest is loud, but this was like being in a
deserted cathedral,'' McGraw said. ``You don't hear anything, you
don't hear birds. You stumble over snares and shotgun shells.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw said he offered large bounties to bush-meat hunters who
could lead him to red colobus _ $100 if he could hear the monkey's
distinctive call or $200 for a sighting _ with no results.
Satellite photographs were searched for any forgotten forest
tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Many ecologists have projected that dozens of obscure species of
plants and animals are becoming extinct each year as tropical
forests are invaded by farmers, loggers, and hunters. But these
vanishings are all theoretical.

   What makes the apparent end of Waldron's red colobus noteworthy,
scientists say, is that it was a conspicuous, large mammal _
weighing up to 20 pounds _ and also because it was related, albeit
distantly, to the scientists who studied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't really worry about cockroaches or newts too much,
but when you lose a large primate that's a culmination of lots of
years of evolution and with which we share a lot of genes, the
consequences to humans of that kind of loss _ both practical and
emotional _ are much greater,'' said John G. Robinson, a
primatologist and vice president of Wildlife Conservation
International, which supported recent searches for the monkey.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron's, Procolobus badius waldroni, is one of about a dozen
variations of red colobus monkey, a group with distinctive long
limbs and tails and a voracious appetite for the leaves of tropical
treetops.
</P>
<P>
   The monkey was first described by scientists in 1936, based on
eight specimens shot in 1933 in what is now Ghana by Willoughby P.
Lowe, a collector for British museums. It was named for one F.
Waldron, who was described in various references as a traveling
companion of Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, deforestation and hunting were already threatening
the monkey, although it remained common in a few places in southern
Ghana, where packs could be seen roaming the forest canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the authors of the paper, Peter Grubb, a zoologist and
African mammal expert associated with the Natural History Museum in
London, said that, with better management of game preserves in
Ghana and the Ivory Coast, the monkey probably could have been
saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the forest reserves there were logged over and areas that
were to become national parks were whittled away until they were
tiny,'' Grubb said. He said it is probably worth waiting awhile
before Waldron's is formally relegated to history, ``but it doesn't
sound like there's much hope.''

SEDER WANTED A FINAL SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 KICKER-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
Rookie kicker Tim Seder said Monday that he would have liked to
have ``taken a whack'' at a game-winning field goal from 61 yards
on the Cowboys' final play of a 32-31 loss at Arizona on Sunday
night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If successful, the kick would have been the third-longest field
goal in NFL history behind only New Orleans' Tom Dempsey (1970) and
Denver's Jason Elam (1998), who share the record of 63 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to make a kick like that, everything has to go just
right,'' said Seder, who tried a 58-yarder in preseason that was
short. Earlier in that same Oakland game, he made a 47-yarder that
would have been good from 58 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Seder, who coached football, baseball and basketball at an Ohio
high school the past two years before making the Cowboys' roster,
was thinking like a coach Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But he never questioned coach Dave Campo's decision Sunday
night, saying, ``I don't think it was a bad call by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys faced their final fourth down Sunday night with 14
seconds remaining, no time outs remaining and the ball at the
Arizona 43. Randall Cunningham tried to dump a fourth-and-10 pass
off to Michael Wiley in the right flat, hoping that the rookie
could run to the down marker and scoot out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   This would have given Seder (5-foot-9, 180 pounds) a more
plausible shot at winning the game from 51 yards. He remains
perfect this season from 34, 38 and 44 yards.
</P>
<P>
   NFL kickers are getting stronger. Since 1991, four field goals
of 59 yards or more have been made, including Elam's record-tying
kick two years ago. The others were Buffalo's Steve Christie (59 in
'93) and Atlanta's Morten Andersen (60 in '91 and 59 in '95).
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kicker, you're always prepared to kick a field goal.
That's what a kicker wants to do,'' said Seder, who until nine days
ago hadn't kicked in a regular-season game since 1997 at Division
II Ashland (Ohio) University.  &LR; tagtop:Ray Buck (817) 390-7096

AIKMAN IS STILL NO. 1 FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
IRVING _ The Cowboys do not have a quarterback controversy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo thought he made that point clear before
backup Randall Cunningham took the field for injured starter Troy
Aikman against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. He reiterated that
point in the locker room after Cunningham's brilliant performance
in the Cowboys' 32-31 loss to the Cardinals. Cunningham, who
connected on his first 13 passes en route to completing 24 of 34
passes for 243 yards and three touchdowns, would go back to the
bench when Aikman was ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   Trying again not to be misunderstood, Campo echoed those
sentiments at least three times Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it very clear that Troy is our starting
quarterback if he's ready to go,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   The first-year coach, who said he's ``still hurting real bad''
for his first victory, acknowledged staying up at night agonizing
over the Cowboys' poor play, but not about who is going to start at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall played well,'' Campo said. ``I feel comfortable that
we have a guy we can win games with. At the same time, Troy is our
starting quarterback. We have to get him in there as soon as we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   If Aikman, 33, has his way, he will be ready to go Monday when
Dallas (0-2) plays at Washington (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was plagued by lingering headaches and nausea last week
after suffering a concussion against the Philadelphia Eagles on
Sept. 3. He was forced to sit out of the Cardinals game by Cowboys
owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But Aikman, who has suffered eight concussions in his NFL career
and one in college, said Monday he's approaching practice this week
like he will play against the Redskins. He said the headaches have
dissipated, and the only thing that would block his return would be
an adverse reaction to the workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go through a week of practice and see how things go,''
Aikman said. ``I plan on playing unless symptoms occur throughout
the week once I start working out.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman experienced recurring headaches after strenuous workouts
on his own last week. He said he will consult with Cowboys doctors
before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Campo and Jones are both on board with Aikman's plan to return.
They maintain that Aikman's health would be the only mitigating
concern with his return, not the spark that the scrambling
Cunningham seemingly brought to a Cowboys offense that was
punchless under Aikman in a 41-14 loss to Eagles a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman didn't complete a pass on five attempts and was sacked
four times before leaving the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get both of them ready,'' Jones said. ``And we'll be
conferring with the doctors throughout the week. But the decision
will be based on how Troy's responding. Troy's health will be the
biggest consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said he would like to make a decision on his starter by
Thursday. He also said that a good performance by Cunningham
doesn't temper the fact that the Cowboys are still winless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be what the doctors say and what Troy says,''
Campo said. ``Health is the No. 1 issue on him. Obviously, I'm very
happy with what Randall did. But we didn't win the game. Let's not
forget, Troy Aikman won 90 games in the 1990's, the best of any
quarterback in one decade. Troy is our guy. He will go in and do a
great job.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Aikman, his job as a starter is to play when he's
healthy _ without regard to his backup having a hot hand. Aikman
has been the Cowboys' starter since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to get myself ready to play,'' Aikman said. ``When I
feel I can do that, I do that. I don't look at the surrounding
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, 37, says his job is to play when Aikman's not
healthy. The former two-time league MVP understood that when he
signed with the Cowboys during the off-season. He has no problems
with his role now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to do whatever is called,'' Cunningham said. ``It's
that simple. I respect the Cowboys and I respect Troy. There is no
room for division on this team. I know what my role is. When they
say go, I go. When they say sit, I sit.''  &LR; subheds:Briefly Middle
linebacker Dat Nguyen suffered a sprained medial collateral
ligament in his left knee and will be out two to four weeks. Barron
Wortham will replace him in the starting lineup. Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones said he is disappointed with the Cowboys' 0-2 start,
but he isn't ready to abandon playoff hopes yet because of
league-wide parity. The Cowboys worked out defensive tackle Ron
Moore and safety Earl Wiley on Monday. Both are considered
practice-squad candidates.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The entertainment industry circled the wagons
Monday, defending itself against government claims that violent
material was being aggressively marketed to children in complete
disregard for its own ratings system.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, music and video gaming industries came under fire
from a 104-page Federal Trade Commission report released Monday
which claims that entertainment companies ``routinely target
children under 17 in their marketing of products their own ratings
systems deem inappropriate . . . due to violent content,'' said FTC
Chairman Robert Pitofsky.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate,
seized on the report to warn he would push for legislation if the
entertainment industry fails to improve on its own self-policing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America defiantly
proclaimed its commitment to artistic freedom while saying it
abides by a ratings system that tells parents what their kids are
buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an industry, we are not in the business of dictating
content to our artists,'' said Hilary Rosen, the RIAA's chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Video gamers congratulated themselves over the report's finding
that they had the most comprehensive regulatory system of the three
industries blasted in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Interactive Digital Software Association said it recently
established an advertising review counsel to further enforce
anti-targeting guidelines established six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that any such practices exist and violate our
codes, we condemn them and six months ago took steps to prevent
recurrences in the future,'' said association President Doug
Lowenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Most Hollywood studios declined to comment on Monday's report,
saying they had not yet had time to review it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we are marketing our material appropriately, but we
are reviewing our marketing practices to ensure this is the case,''
said Ken Green, spokesman for The Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association of America withheld comment until
Wednesday, when its president, Jack Valenti, is scheduled to
testify at a Senate hearing on media violence.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled to testify is Democratic vice presidential
candidate Sen. Joseph Liberman, D-Conn, a longtime critic of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning in Illinois, Gore threatened to punish
Hollywood if it did not ``clean up its act'' on marketing violence
to children.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on the ``Oprah'' television talk show, he said families
share a responsibility for what their kids see and hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to be done privately,'' Gore said. ``What
we're calling for in this case is industry self-restraint and
self-regulation. It's about parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called for the FTC study in June 1999, two
months after the school shooting in Littleton, Colo., in which
music and other media influences on the gunmen were called into
question.
</P>
<P>
   While the motion picture, recording and electronic gaming
industries do identify and label content not appropriate for
children, they routinely market those products to kids under 17,
the report concluded, calling these actions ``pervasive and
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC did not propose a regulatory or legislative remedy,
suggesting instead that these industries help increase parents'
understanding of ratings systems and press retailers to restrict
minors from buying inappropriate content.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the industries should self-police
themselves with new or expanded codes that prohibit these marketing
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions, not censorship, was the appropriate response, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainer Steve Allen, a crusader against sex and violence in
movies and on TV said government intervention is still a
possibility if the entertainment industry does not change these
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger is if you get the American television viewers
and parents angry enough you're going to get censorship,'' Allen,
78, said from his office in Van Nuys. ``So the offenders would be
well advised to say we've gone a little too far -- maybe we
shouldn't have shows that are this vulgar.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said it's his bet that Hollywood will not heed these
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics were likewise pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Hollywood going to clean up Hollywood? It's never going to
happen,'' said Allen Wildmon, spokesman for the American Family
Association. ``It's like the fox guarding the chicken house.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-regulatory programs of these industries, such as movie
ratings and content warnings on records and games, do little good
if individual companies in turn market the same products to teens,
as the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Recording industry officials said they market artists -- not
violence -- and that parents -- not the government -- have the
responsibility to safeguard their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission's own survey reports that a predominant 77
percent of parents are already aware of the current rating system
for music, and a similarly large majority are 'somewhat' or 'very
satisfied' with the current system of rating music,'' according to
the RIAA's Rosen.

HOME PRICES HIT RECORD HIGH IN AUGUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
( Repeating to correct dateline) &HT;    (Daily News staff writer Kathleen Sweeney contributed to this
story.)
 &HT;    By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ San Fernando Valley single-family housing prices
soared to a record $255,000 during August, finally recapturing the
value lost during the deep recession of the early 1990s, a trade
group said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sales also rebounded, with escrow closing on 1,204 single-family
homes, an annual gain of 6.5 &UR;  &LR; percent, said the Van Nuys-based
Southland Regional Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Home prices also reached record levels in the Santa Clarita
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   During the 12 months ending in August, the median price for a
resale home increased $43,000, a gain of 20.3 &UR;  &LR; percent. The median,
the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less,
is now $10,000 higher than the previous record of $245,000, reached
three times during 1989, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most homeowners long ago recaptured any lost equity, but this
record median price drives a stake through the statistical heart of
the last recession,'' said Mitch Davis, president of the Realtors
group.
</P>
<P>
   The last year of the 1980s was the best, as far as prices, and
so far 2000 is shaping up to be even better. For the first eight
months of this year, the median averages $235,000 vs. $234,187 for
the comparable period of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials and analysts had predicted that the lost
value would be made up this year. But the timing was uncertain. So
the timing and spread of August's record blindsided some observers.
Prices have been marching upward for months. Prices hit $236,000
during July, an annual gain of 8.3 &UR;  &LR; percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not shocked but certainly surprised the median price
shot up as quickly as it did,'' said Jim Link, executive vice
president of the Realtors group.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp appreciation is being attributed in part to a tight
supply of single-family homes for sale, a long-running problem in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Any price gains are good news for homeowners like Chatsworth
resident Gene Synder, a general contractor, who paid $230,000 for
his home 10 years ago. It wasn't that long ago that similar homes
in his neighborhood were selling for $170,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got killed,'' he said of the recession that saw prices
plunge throughout the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder could probably sell his home for about $260,000 now, he
says. But he's still not in the clear yet; he said he's put about
$100,000 worth of sweat equity into improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for a ``For Sale'' sign in his front yard any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going anywhere. I'm still on the wrong side of this
thing but in 2020 this house has got to be worth 300 grand,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Winnetka resident Matt Velie, a manufacturers sales rep, is of
like mind. He bought his house for $78,000 in 1978 but owes more
than that on it today because of some business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A house across the street is listed at $239,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy that I own this house,'' he said. ``It's taken
a while for (the value) to go back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts note that there is also a downside to such a sharp
price spike because it reduces affordability.
</P>
<P>
   During July, only 36 &UR;  &LR; percent of the households in Los Angeles
County could afford the median-priced home of $211,150.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a number that everyone will accept and say, Gee, the
market is back,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles Economic Development Corp. ``It's great news, especially if
you own a house.''
</P>
<P>
   But as prices rise, more and more people are pushed out of the
market because they can't afford to buy.
</P>
<P>
   This could lead to serious ramifications, especially for the
fast-growing tech sector in the West Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's growing rapidly and trying to attract young, talented
employees. The question is, are people going to be able to afford
housing?'' Kyser said. ``The bottom line is we haven't built enough
housing anywhere in L.A. County.''
</P>
<P>
   But Link at the Realtors group points out that a one-month jump
by itself is not a trend and prices may retreat in September.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of 2000 he is still predicting price appreciation of
between 5 percent and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One reason prices are rising is that the inventory of homes for
sale is falling. Last month there were 5,023 active listings, down
16 percent from a year ago. A number twice that total is typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current inventory represents a three-month supply in a
huge region that would be better served, that is reduce pressure on
prices, with a minimum six-month inventory . . . based on the
current sales rate,'' Link said.
</P>
<P>
   The condominium market was also strong during August. Escrow
closed on 399 units, up 12.1 percent from a year ago and the median
price was $140,000, an annual gain of 15.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Home prices in the Santa Clarita Valley also hit a record-high
in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clarita Valley Division of the Southland Regional
Association of Realtors released figures Monday that showed the
median resale price of single-family homes rose to $250,000,
beating the previous record set in July by nearly $5,000.

&HT;    HOME PRICES HIT RECORD HIGH IN AUGUST

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ San Fernando Valley single-family housing prices
soared to a record $255,000 during August, finally recapturing the
value lost during the deep recession of the early 1990s, a trade
group said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sales also rebounded, with escrow closing on 1,204 single-family
homes, an annual gain of 6.5 &UR;  &LR; percent, said the Van Nuys-based
Southland Regional Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Home prices also reached record levels in the Santa Clarita
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   During the 12 months ending in August, the median price for a
resale home increased $43,000, a gain of 20.3 &UR;  &LR; percent. The median,
the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less,
is now $10,000 higher than the previous record of $245,000, reached
three times during 1989, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most homeowners long ago recaptured any lost equity, but this
record median price drives a stake through the statistical heart of
the last recession,'' said Mitch Davis, president of the Realtors
group.
</P>
<P>
   The last year of the 1980s was the best, as far as prices, and
so far 2000 is shaping up to be even better. For the first eight
months of this year, the median averages $235,000 vs. $234,187 for
the comparable period of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials and analysts had predicted that the lost
value would be made up this year. But the timing was uncertain. So
the timing and spread of August's record blindsided some observers.
Prices have been marching upward for months. Prices hit $236,000
during July, an annual gain of 8.3 &UR;  &LR; percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not shocked but certainly surprised the median price
shot up as quickly as it did,'' said Jim Link, executive vice
president of the Realtors group.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp appreciation is being attributed in part to a tight
supply of single-family homes for sale, a long-running problem in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Any price gains are good news for homeowners like Chatsworth
resident Gene Synder, a general contractor, who paid $230,000 for
his home 10 years ago. It wasn't that long ago that similar homes
in his neighborhood were selling for $170,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got killed,'' he said of the recession that saw prices
plunge throughout the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder could probably sell his home for about $260,000 now, he
says. But he's still not in the clear yet; he said he's put about
$100,000 worth of sweat equity into improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for a ``For Sale'' sign in his front yard any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going anywhere. I'm still on the wrong side of this
thing but in 2020 this house has got to be worth 300 grand,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Winnetka resident Matt Velie, a manufacturers sales rep, is of
like mind. He bought his house for $78,000 in 1978 but owes more
than that on it today because of some business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A house across the street is listed at $239,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy that I own this house,'' he said. ``It's taken
a while for (the value) to go back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts note that there is also a downside to such a sharp
price spike because it reduces affordability.
</P>
<P>
   During July, only 36 &UR;  &LR; percent of the households in Los Angeles
County could afford the median-priced home of $211,150.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a number that everyone will accept and say, Gee, the
market is back,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles Economic Development Corp. ``It's great news, especially if
you own a house.''
</P>
<P>
   But as prices rise, more and more people are pushed out of the
market because they can't afford to buy.
</P>
<P>
   This could lead to serious ramifications, especially for the
fast-growing tech sector in the West Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's growing rapidly and trying to attract young, talented
employees. The question is, are people going to be able to afford
housing?'' Kyser said. ``The bottom line is we haven't built enough
housing anywhere in L.A. County.''
</P>

HUNDREDS OF STATE PRISON INMATES AT RISK IN BOGUS MEDICAL
TEST  CASE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   California state prisons have identified at least 650 inmates
who have no records of retesting for AIDS, hepatitis or other
serious diseases four years after a private lab was shut down for
faking results on prisoner medical tests.
</P>
<P>
   A Chronicle investigation disclosed the phony lab test scandal
in July. Since then, the Department of Corrections has ordered
medical staff members to hand-search the medical records of all
162,000 inmates housed in the state's 33 prisons.
</P>
<P>
   B.C.L. Clinical Labs of Santa Fe Springs (Los Angeles County)
closed its doors in December 1996 after state inspectors found
evidence that the lab was simply making up results on vital medical
tests and typing them into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Prison rights advocates said the harm caused by such fraud can
reach far beyond prison walls _ when inmates complete their
sentences and return to their families with potentially incorrect
diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negligent care of prisoners affects not only their health, but
the health of their communities,'' said Cynthia Chandler, director
of the Women's Positive Legal Action Network in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 11 prisons had contracts with B.C.L. between July
1995 and December 1996, all prison medical records are being
searched because inmates are frequently transferred from one
facility to another. ``This is a long, arduous process,'' said
Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the Corrections Department.
</P>
<P>
   A review of records of 150,000 inmates has so far turned up more
than 4,000 inmates who had medical tests run by B.C.L., Thornton
said. Of those, the Corrections Department has concluded that most
inmates were retested within the past four years or that there was
no medical need to retest. But Thornton said that 650 inmates
appear to have no record of a repeat of critical tests that might
include pap smears for cervical cancer and screens for AIDS,
hepatitis and other infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said some of the 650 inmates have already received new
tests as a result of the investigation or will get them if any
doubt remains. ``It's apparent that the potential for problems is
there,'' she said. ``We will err on the side of caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those retested so far, Thornton said, none turned up with
unexpected illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton has no estimate of the cost of the record search or of
the retesting. After current inmate records are screened, the
department will attempt to track inmates who had B.C.L. tests but
have since been paroled.
</P>
<P>
   The record search and retesting effort comes almost four years
after the Department of Corrections was warned that B.C.L. lab test
results could not be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that
in February 1997, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
issued letters to at least seven California prisons warning them
that the conditions found at the lab posed ``immediate jeopardy to
patient health and safety.'' The letters recommended ``immediate
follow-up, particularly in the area of pap smears and HIV
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Chronicle investigation found scant evidence of any
attempt to retest inmates whose laboratory results were suddenly
thrown into question. At the request of the newspaper, a San
Francisco prison rights law office, Legal Services for Prisoners
with Children, examined 13 records of female inmates who had
medical tests performed by B.C.L. within six months of its closure.
Only two showed any evidence of a repeat test. One was retested for
a thyroid condition. The other had received a second AIDS test, but
it was given 13 months after her initial screening by the suspect
lab.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Willmott, litigation coordinator for the law office, said
the belated retesting of inmates is a step in the right direction,
but she remains skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there should be some oversight by the Legislature of
this retesting program,'' she said. ``If this problem hadn't been
exposed, these people would never have been retested.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Corey Weinstein, a San Francisco medical consultant for
prisoners, said he also believes that the Corrections Department's
handling of the problem needs to be examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we trust a department that sat on information like
this for four years, and then begrudgingly begins to do it?'' he
said. ``To regain my confidence, the people responsible for this
ever happening need to be identified, and let go.''
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections officials maintain that doctors at
each of the 11 prisons were well aware that there were problems
with B.C.L.'s testing, and that prisoners got the retesting they
needed. They concede, however, that they have yet to find any
record of a large-scale retesting program after the discovery that
the lab had been fabricating test results.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokeswoman Thornton said the current count of prison
records is preliminary. Records at all but six facilities have now
been fully screened. She declined to identify the prisons where the
work is not completed.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-year period in which B.C.L. contracted with 11
prisons, doctors at several facilities complained of slow response
times and unreliable test results. The Robert J. Donovan
Correctional Facility in San Diego spotted problems with B.C.L.
Labs only days after the start of its contract with them in July
1995 and terminated its contract after only two months. But other
prisons, apparently unaware of the problem facing other
institutions, were starting up new contracts up to a year later,
because B.C.L. offered bids at half the price of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said a review of state records showed that the lab had
signed nine contracts for services totaling $736,000, but the state
had actually paid the lab $336,000.

 &HT;    JUROR WANTS TO NULLIFY HER GUILT(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By E.J. MONTINI(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Patricia Wharton didn't realize she had the power to
set a guilty man free. It's what she wanted to do. It's what she
would have done if she'd known she could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I would have,'' she says. But, she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had proven its case. The evidence was there.
Still, Wharton and a few other jurors in the Maricopa County case
were convinced that defendant Steven Boyd should not go to prison.
They didn't believe justice was being served.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went back into the jury room, we thought we had no
choice but to follow the letter of the law,'' she says. ``So, we
found him guilty. It wasn't until afterward that we found out we
(beginitalic)did (enditalic)have a choice. Law or no law, we could
have found him not guilty. Now I feel terrible. I want every person
who's going on jury duty to know that they have this option.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``jury nullification.'' All it means is that a jury
can vote its conscience, no matter the law or the evidence. They
can do what they decide is right. In Arizona, like most other
states, jurors aren't told about this. If anything, they're
frightened by judges and prosecutors into thinking it's something
they can't do. That they must vote strictly according to guidelines
outlined by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's right,'' Wharton says. ``I believe jurors
should know they have this kind of power.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt strongly enough about it to write to me and forward a
copy to Gov. Jane Hull. In it, she describes how Steven Boyd was
arrested after being caught driving erratically. He said he had
been taking a sleep-enhancing supplement sold at health food stores
and was disoriented by its delayed effects. The supplement was
similar to one that nearly killed Phoenix Suns player Tom Gugliotta
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd claimed to have been an uninformed consumer who had a
seizure, like Gugliotta. Prosecutors believe Boyd knew exactly what
he was doing, however, and that he was an abuser, not a victim.
Either way, Boyd was driving impaired on a suspended license.
That'll get you jail time in Arizona, as Boyd will find out when
he's sentenced later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us on the jury thought that was wrong,'' Wharton says.
``Sometimes, a lawbreaker isn't necessarily a bad person, and
sending him to prison seems like a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's public defender, Gregory Navazo, agrees. He would have
liked to tell the jurors about the nullification option, but that's
not permitted in Arizona courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to dance around it,'' Navazo says. ``You can ask them
if they would think of themselves as criminals in similar
circumstances. You can ask them to do the right thing. But you
can't address nullification specifically.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been attempts to pass a law in Arizona requiring
judges to inform juries about nullification. None made it through
the Legislature, thanks to lobbying from prosecutors like Maricopa
County Attorney Rick Romley. Nullification wouldn't happen often,
no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   In a guest column he wrote once for (beginitalic)The Arizona
Republic(enditalic), however, Romley said instructing juries about
the option would allow objectivity to be replaced by ``sympathy,
prejudice and whim.''
</P>
<P>
   Or worse. At least as far as prosecutors are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   It would actually let jurors use their common sense.

   LOS ANGELES _ This was no contest for drips.
</P>
<P>
   A student at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design is the
winner of Price Pfister's first-ever Pfaucet of the Pfuture
contest, the Pacoima-based company said Monday. Winner Silas Beebe
gets $10,000 and a boost to a career going anywhere but down the
drain. Price Pfister gets to keep all 30 faucet designs in the
competition as its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students did a good job of recognizing what is needed out
in the marketplace,'' said Price Pfister President Les Ireland.
``They thought about style but they also thought about
functionality.''
</P>
<P>
   Beebe's winning design, called ``Water Go,'' is a looping
bathtub faucet that encloses a bath caddy on which a bar of soap, a
candle, a razor or other items can be placed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to incorporate functions like a bath caddy and make
the faucet do something other than just pour water,'' said Beebe, a
27-year-old transplant from Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Other top entries featured a faucet without handles that turned
on simply with a push upward and one named ``Chameleon'' in which a
temperature-sensitive film shows the user how hot or cold the water
is by changing color.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe said he had already designed the faucet for his product
design class, so entering it in the contest was easy. He gets a
$5,000 scholarship and his school gets an additional $5,000 for his
victory. He said his horoscope told him he was going to win a
contest the day he submitted the entry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his bathroom fixture conquest, Beebe said he wants to
get into other kinds of design consulting such as automotive
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully this success will translate to other things,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 designs entered, visitors to Price Pfister's Web site
narrowed the list down to 10. A panel of industrial design experts
then picked the winners.

 EVEN A LUNATIC DESERVES RESPECT  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bobby Knight, now there's a sad story: Great
coach and molder of young men, brought down by a rude teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Why, oh why, has the Youth of Today not learned to be polite and
respectful and hold a civil tongue in its head?
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting that Knight's bosses at the Indiana University
ordered him to behave last May, put him on ``zero tolerance''
notice, and then tolerated at least four instances of
Knight-typical abusive and bullying behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At Indiana, they've raised the bar for zero tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   It's a floating, flexible zero.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, maybe now Bobby will have time to join a
raging-lunatic support group.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's loss could be San Francisco's gain. Citizen Tom Krebs
suggests that Mayor Willie Brown hire Knight to serve as Muni coach
_ ``Teaching respect and courtesy to drivers and passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   If you take the job, Bobby, pack a lunch. And heat.
</P>
<P>
   FIRESTONE, give that company credit for not rushing out with a
warning on its faulty tires years ago and throwing the public into
a panic.
</P>
<P>
   Now the word is out, and Firestone tires are no longer selling
like hotcakes, but they are  &UR; riding  &LR; like hotcakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about renaming the company
Firestone-Bridgestone-Gravestone?'' suggests Leon Unruh.
</P>
<P>
   And Cuffs Corbett chimes in, ``Their new ad slogan could be a
slight modification of the old Revolutionary War flag _ ``No tread
on me.'' And they could change the company name to ``Liarstone.''
</P>
<P>
   SOME OF US quibble with terminology.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone refers to the problem as ``tread separation.'' But as
Christopher Lierle says, ``When a vital part splits off
permanently, causing wreckage and lawyers, who but Firestone and
San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales would call it `separation'? Sounds more
like `tread divorce' to me.''
</P>
<P>
   I like the ``complaint'' part of the news accounts. The stories
refer to ``X number of complaints about Firestone tires, including
Y number of deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   If your wife and kids die in a flaming car wreck caused by
faulty tires, you hate to get shuttled off to the Complaint Dept.,
where you stand in line behind irate people with balky toasters.

   HE DIDN'T check to see if the limo had Firestones.
</P>
<P>
   But John Bejarano passed the roadside remains of a limousine
that had been burned to a crisp.

   John could still make out the license plate: COOKS 6.

   I ASKED for mini-gripes.

   ``Mine,'' says Sheppard Levine, ``is columnists whose
familiarity (with the city) is so shallow they don't know the

</P>
<P>
   The good Sheppard is referring to a recent item here, a man
complaining of Golden Gate Bridge drivers who pay at the far left
toll booth then quickly cut across all the lanes to exit at 19th
St.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be quite a trick. It's 19th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I'm learning.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE WAY, how city-knowledgeable are the FasTrak people, who
set up the automatic-pay bridge toll system?
</P>
<P>
   Even though a lot of drivers do take that 19th Ave. exit, the
FasTrak lane is the far left. Maybe that's just the way the city
leans.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, you first-exit FasTrakers, on the daring
flying-crossover maneuver. All those other drivers aren't flipping
you off, they're saying, ``You're No. 1!''
</P>
<P>
   TOO HIP an event: A jazz concert /book-signing, tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Only in San Francisco, probably. ``Jazzography'' is the book,
and authors Mars Breslow and Dan Guaraldi will be signing their
volume of profiles of current San Francisco jazz greats.
</P>
<P>
   And some of those very same greats will be signing and jamming _
Larry Vuckovich, Noel Jewkes, Marcus Shelby, Vince Lateano ...
</P>
<P>
   At Whitehall-Jazz, Pier 33 on the Embarcadero.
</P>
<P>
   WE MARVELED, fans and writers alike, at how executive Carmen
Policy worked creative magic under the NFL salary cap to bring top
talent to the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Then Policy left for the Cleveland Browns, and now he has been
fined $500,000 by the NFL for rule-busting salary-cap shenanigans
during his 49ers days.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Carmen and former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo are no
longer buddies. Carmen could have Eddie deliver the half-million to
NFL headquarters, in small bills in a briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   THE KIDS are swinging away, and I ask birthday dad Steve Didion
where he got the traditional U.S. Space Shuttle pinata.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Pinatas.com, &LR; '' he says. ``Seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe those folks already have this covered, but why do kids
get all the fun? How come there are no adult pinatas? Why can't we
swing bats at generic models like IRS auditor, boss or cell-phone
screamer? Or at specific models like Rush Limbaugh, the Prez, Jerry
Springer, even this columnist!
</P>
<P>
   For me, it would beat darts in the eyeballs. Reader Tom Krebs
(mentioned in first item) suggests somewhat kiddingly (I think),
``Get a bigger picture in your column. I'm having trouble with
these mini-darts.''
</P>
<P>
   That solves a mystery. I  &UR; wondered  &LR; who do that voodoo that he
do so well. And why my pimples kept popping themselves.

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS MISSOURI'S LIMITS ON POLITICAL
PARTY CONTRIBUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A federal appeals court handed Missouri's
major political parties a potent weapon Monday when it tossed out
the state's limits on what political parties can contribute to
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling, found
that limits on contributions by political parties violated the
parties' First Amendment rights to disseminate their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon immediately promised to
appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. He said he would
seek an order that would allow the state to enforce the limits
while the case is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, a Democrat, said the decision showed ``a stunning lack of
understanding of what really happens in campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will allow contributors to circumvent the state's
limits on individual donations by giving hundreds of thousands of
dollars to the political parties, which can now forward the money
to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public understands that big money makes big corruption,''
Nixon said. ``This lets contributions through the back door so the
public cannot tell who is supporting these candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Missouri Republican Party, which brought the lawsuit
challenging the state's limits, called the ruling a victory for
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a powerful precedent that allows political parties to
continue to be a major factor in communicating ideas to the
public,'' said state GOP Chairman John Hancock. ``A party and its
candidates have the same interests in espousing principles and
values.''
</P>
<P>
   The state law adopted in 1994 had limited party committees to
maximum contributions of $11,175 in cash plus an equal amount of
in-kind support, such as shared office expenses or printing of
signs. Those amounts are roughly 10 times the maximum contribution
allowed from an individual, corporation or a political action
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th Circuit in 1998 threw out the limits on individual
contributions. But the U.S. Supreme Court overruled that decision
last January when it ruled that the limits were a reasonable way to
halt the corrupting influence of money on political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, state law allows party committees to make unlimited
contributions to statewide candidates during general election
campaigns or uncontested primaries. During contested primary
campaigns, they are limited to a maximum of $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas also limits contributions to party committees. The
maximum ranges from $5,000 to $25,000, depending on the identity of
the giver and the type of party committee. Missouri allows
unlimited contributions to party committees.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's decision, written by Judge Morris Sheppard Arnold,
the court found that the First Amendment rights of political
parties to contribute money were weightier than the more general
rights of individuals to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold concluded that political parties are often
indistinguishable from their candidates. So limits on the party's
spending are tantamount to limits on a candidate's spending. Such
limits are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by Judge Pasco Bowman, who wrote the 8th Circuit's
1998 opinion that threw out the individual limits.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold wrote that candidates are their parties' standard-bearers
and they often appeal to party principle. Candidates and parties
influence each other so they present a united front until their
identities effectively merge, the opinion said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In large measure, the speech of (a party's) candidates is its
own speech...A principal way in which they express themselves is
through the speech of their candidates,'' Arnold wrote. ``In fact,
parties and their candidates are often virtual alter egos.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Gibson dissented, saying the Supreme Court's
decisions upholding limits on individual contributions should apply
to this case. He noted that a plurality of the Supreme Court in a
1996 case rejected the idea that political parties and their
candidates are identical.
</P>
<P>
   He also derided the majority decision's waffling on the
relationship between candidates and their parties. At one point,
the court noted that the two have ``observable differences'' and
the two do not always correspond to each other. Yet the majority
concluded that they are the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon this shifting foundation, the court constructs its entire
opinion,'' Gibson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said candidates are distinguishable from their parties.
They are the only part of the democratic system that is directly
accountable to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elected officials vote; parties don't,'' he said. ``That is
why the Supreme Court upheld the limits'' on contributions they
could accept.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, however, said parties put candidates in a powerful
context that the public understands. Therefore, parties should not
be limited in their support.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri law allows donors to make unlimited contributions to a
political party, but it limited how much each party committee could
give to candidates. Nixon said the ruling opens a gaping loophole
that will allow people who have made the maximum donation to funnel
additional contributions through the party.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock rejected Nixon's contention. He said the Republican
Party would never pass money from a donor to a candidate just
because a donor requested it. Large contributions to the party, he
said, are not a way to evade individual limits.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that, during several months when the courts had limits
on hold, the Democratic Party contributed more to its candidate for
governor than did the Republican Party. Republican Jim Talent
received at least $700,000 from party committees; Democrat Bob
Holden received $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th Circuit decision also rejected the contention that party
contributions were corrupting. The court said the potential evasion
of individual limits did not justify limits on the parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scheme burdens the free speech rights of political
parties in order to control the activities of someone else,'' the
decision said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon called the decision a dramatic intrusion into the state's
electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law was upheld by the District Court and now, by a
one-judge majority, the court would allow political parties to
circumvent a law in effect since 1994,'' Nixon said. ``When
candidates for the top three races in the state are within one or
two points of each other, this could really matter...The judiciary
could be deciding these races.''

UNION: BILLIONS IN FUNDS DIVERTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News staff writer Kathleen Sweeney contributed to this
story.) &HT;    By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles County has diverted $3.4 billion in
surplus from employee retirement savings to pay its share of
retirement benefits, according to a claim filed by employee unions.
</P>
<P>
   The unions, which represent 90,000 employees, said Monday the
surplus should be spent on their benefits and using it violates a
1996 state Attorney General's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   If the county rejects the claim, which was filed last week, the
union intends to sue, said Santa Monica attorney Stephen Silver,
who filed the claim on behalf of the Coalition of County Unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Attorney General's opinion is pretty specific that the
money in question could only be used for the benefit of retirement
plan members, not to relieve the county of any obligation to make
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   County Chief Administrative Officer David Janssen admitted the
county has made employer contributions out of the pension surplus,
but he said the county disagrees with the Attorney General's
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the county entered into an agreement with LACERA that
allowed for excess earnings during a five-year period to be
credited to the county's contribution credit reserve fund to offset
the employer's normal contribution, which is about $250 million a
year.

 PLAN WOULD OK BLOOD DONATIONS BY GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN  &HT;     By CHRISTOPHER HEREDIA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Federal health officials this week will consider
easing a regulation that bars most gay and bisexual men from
donating blood, a 1985 rule that critics say is badly outdated.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal backed by the American Association of Blood Banks, an
industry advocacy group, would permit donations by men who have not
had sex with other men for one year. It will be considered Thursday
by the Blood Products Advisory Committee of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration during a meeting in Gaithersburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the proposal, including some federal health
officials, will testify that advanced tests can reveal the presence
of the HIV virus in a matter of weeks after infection. That may be
reason to lift the 15-year-old rule that prohibits men from
donating blood if they have had sex with other men after 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the AIDS crisis prompted the FDA to impose that
prohibition in 1985 when blood banks began extensive testing.
Before then, thousands of people developed AIDS through
contaminated blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   But today, experts say, new tests are in place that can detect
the virus's genetic material just 20 days after infection. That
represents ``a big step forward'' and is cause to reconsider the
ban, said Dr. F. Blaine Hollinger, a medical professor from Houston
and chairman of the FDA's blood products advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have better questionnaires and screening and the
tests are more sensitive, perhaps the time has come that we could
make another decision regarding the length of time one would want
to delay allowing (a gay man) to donate,'' Hollinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for lifting the ban, including gay San Francisco
Supervisor Mark Leno and the Blood Centers of the Pacific, have
called the current policy discriminatory because it focuses on gay
men and doesn't address the rise in HIV infections among
heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexual and bisexual men are not the only ones prohibited
from giving blood. There are also bans against current and former
intravenous drug users, people who have worked as prostitutes
during the last 23 years, those who have had sex with prostitutes
in the last year, hemophiliacs who have received clotting factor
concentrates and people who have visited or lived in Nigeria,
Cameroon and six other African countries since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, people donate about 12 million pints of blood per
year. In recent months, blood banks _ including the Blood Centers
of the Pacific _ have issued emergency appeals for more donors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Busch of the Blood Centers of the Pacific in San
Francisco, who will attend Thursday's meeting, said the current ban
doesn't make sense. He predicts federal officials will relax the
ban, but will probably side with a national hemophiliacs
organization that wants a five-year period of abstinence before gay
and bisexual men can donate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to make the window period more analogous to
other high-risk behaviors, like heterosexual sex with multiple
partners,'' Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory committee will make its recommendation to the FDA.
If it's a favorable recommendation, the FDA could then undertake
it's own studies. A spokeswoman for Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala said Shalala probably will support the
FDA's final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will step cautiously through controversial
terrain, Busch said. With every HIV infection from a blood
transfusion _ an estimated 1 out of 700,000 pints of blood _ there
is tremendous public backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult environment,'' he said. ``There continues to
be a lot of misunderstanding and concern on the public's part. The
safety of the public blood supply is extremely important. This
could be a defensible first step that gets us part of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Blood Centers of the Pacific collected 100,000 units
of blood. Only three of those units tested positive for HIV, center
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you draw the line?'' Busch said. ``It's an equity
issue. Why is it OK for a woman who has had anal intercourse to
donate blood but not for a gay man who is HIV negative? The data
does justify relaxing the window period.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno, who has lobbied the FDA for years to lift the ban, called
the consideration of the 12-month window period ``a step in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he isn't sure how much it will help, given
that few people abstain from sex for 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that the prohibition against gay men
donating blood especially through this period of severe blood
shortages is wrong,'' Leno said. ``The FDA should be asking
appropriate questions, not whether you're a man who has sex with
men, but what kind of sexual activity have you've engaged in.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Confidence in Screening
</P>
<P>
   Sara Foer, spokeswoman for the American Association of Blood
Banks, said her organization will advocate for a 12-month window, &LR; 
``because we don't believe the safety of the nation's blood supply
will be impacted'' by the change.
</P>
<P>
   Blood collected at banks across the country are screened by nine
tests for infectious diseases, Foer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a change that isn't going to be made unless there is a
100 percent belief that the safety of the blood supply will be
protected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leno said that may take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time it will be substantiated there there is no added
risk to the safety of the nation's blood supply from gay men
donating,'' he said. ``It's not with whom you have sex, it's the
kind of sex you're having. If you have practiced safe sex, your
blood will be negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA has set themselves up for a tough task.''

STATION CALLS LAWSUIT FILED BY PARTNERS LAST WEEK A `NUISANCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A $120 million lawsuit filed in Jackson County Circuit Court
last week by business partners is a ``nuisance'' that will be
defended vigorously, Station Casinos Inc. says.
</P>
<P>
   Partners that co-own Station Casino Kansas City's 170-acre land
parcel sued the Nevada-based gaming firm late Friday afternoon for
more than $120 million in alleged damages, in part over the
Missouri Gaming Commission's decision last month to strip the firm
of its state casino license.
</P>
<P>
   The partners, all Mississippi or Nevada businesses, also alleged
that Station, as managing partner of their joint land venture,
entered into a ``secret lease'' that subleased part of that land to
a day-care center for employees' children for $1 a year for at
least 20 years. The plaintiffs said they learned of the sublease
only in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nuisance suit,'' a Station spokesman in Las Vegas
said in a prepared statement. ``It is simply an unfortunate case of
our partners attempting to take advantage of the sensationalized
atmosphere in Missouri affecting our company.''
</P>
<P>
   Jess H. Dickinson, a Gulfport, Miss., lawyer for the plaintiffs,
said Monday that the partners were upset that Station acted
unilaterally to sublease land and arranged a pending sale of the
casino without consulting them first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't treat partners that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group in 1993 assembled the joint venture to buy land for a
casino site, and its members receive income from Station's
estimated $90,000 monthly rent payment.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that Station's
controversy with the Gaming Commission, along with the other
allegations, amounted to breach of contract and breach of fiduciary
duty, and they seek to dissolve the partnership. They claim $20
million in actual damages and seek $100 million in punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission held a two-day inquiry in Kansas City last
month into events surrounding a former Station lawyer's guilty plea
in federal court earlier this year. Michael Lazaroff admitted to
multiple felonies, including misappropriation of law firm funds
that included a questionable $500,000 bonus payment from Station.
</P>
<P>
   When Station executives refused to honor the commission's
subpoenas and testify under oath last week, the commission voted
5-0 to revoke the company's state gaming licenses. The casinos
would remain open during Station's expected appeal of that action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what I heard and saw in Kansas City and based on
information we've gathered in our investigation, there is
substantial concern on our part that Station is going to lose their
(Missouri casino) license,'' Dickinson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the commission's consideration of Station's
proposed sale of its Kansas City and St. Charles casinos to an
insider group of executives is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs in the lawsuit are First Holdings Co., and its sole
proprietor, C.D. Tyner; and Lenny Sawyer Consulting Inc., all of
Mississippi; Barrick Properties Inc. of Nevada; and the Kansas City
Stations Joint Venture, which includes Station Casinos Inc. as
general partner.

SCIENTISTS TRY TO FORESEE MARRIAGE BREAKDOWNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Think of it as a warning light on the dashboard of
love.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of university researchers announced Monday that they can
scientifically and mathematically predict how likely and how soon a
newly married couple will untie the knot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a snapshot of a marriage early in its life, and you
study that snapshot, and you figure out what are the patterns of
emotional expression and emotional regulation that occur,'' said
Robert Levenson, a psychology professor at the University of
California, Berkeley, who did the study with University of
Washington psychology professor John Gottman.
</P>
<P>
   Like an overheated sports car, couples who run hot, letting
their emotions flare during arguments, are likely to burn out
sooner, probably within the first seven years, the researchers
found in their 14-year study of 79 married couples from
Bloomington, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slow-burning couples -- for them the problems lie dormant
for many years until something comes up to stir the pot, like
having teen-age kids and their problems,'' Levenson said. This type
of marriage often ends during a midlife crisis, the researchers
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``These couples stifle things and do not raise issues with their
partner,'' Gottman said in a prepared statement. ``Their marriages
are a suppression of negative emotions and a lack of positive
emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists determined which couples were simmering,
boiling or just warm for each other, much the same way some cooks
monitor a roast turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1983, the two researchers, then colleagues at Indiana
University, strapped electrodes and heart monitors and other
devices to the couples and videotaped them arguing with each other.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers tracked the marriages of the 79 to see whether
and how soon they divorced. Gottman and Levenson and then came up
with a formula to predict whether and when couples would divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated mathematical formula includes numbers of
thoughts of divorce, amount of perspiration measured by skin
conductivity levels, humor during the discussion, marriage length,
amount of anger and something called ``facial action units'' -- or
frowns, smiles and grimaces caught on tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be able to develop warning lights that tell us that
something is likely to break'' in a marriage, Levenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some local psychologists and marriage counselors were wary of
reducing human relationships to a math problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relationship. It's one's humanity. It's complex, but
not that kind of complex,'' said Alice Dollinger, an Encino couples
therapist for about 15 years. ``My experience says that the
overwhelming predictor of an unhealthy, unhappy marriage is a lack
of empathy,'' which is best measured by human interaction, not
mechanical monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Johnson, staff psychologist at California State University,
Northridge, and coordinator of the campus Dispute Resolution
Program, praised Gottman's earlier research, saying he uses it in
his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're under stress, it causes chemical changes,'' and
that's something that a researcher can monitor in a laboratory,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Rivera, 25, and his wife, Sandra, 21, said they see more
than chemistry in their two-year marriage and business partnership
running GQ Balloons in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they can predict something like that, because
even if somebody has a bad temper, it depends on whether they want
to work it out,'' said Sandra Rivera, who admitted that she is
``the loud one'' during arguments.
</P>
<P>
   But her husband, whom both acknowledged is ``the quiet one''
during disputes, sees things more simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like my relationship to last, like her parents','' he
said, pointing to his wife, who was holding the couple's
7-month-old son, Anthony IV. ``Their relationship lasted for 25
years.''

PITCHING DIRECTION UNDER DISCUSSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The pitching coaches from throughout the Anaheim
Angels organization will meet today to discuss the club's direction
with its pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the topics on the agenda will concern injuries -- how to
prevent them and why so many of their younger pitchers have come
down with arm, shoulder and even rib cage injuries recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels understand a Tim Belcher or Ken Hill are going to
have health issues, but this year has seen injuries to their future
-- Ramon Ortiz, Seth Etherton, Jarrod Washburn, Jason Dickson,
Scott Schoeneweis and Matt Wise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to look at everything happening within the
organization,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ''Our philosophy of
pitch counts, to the mechanics we're teaching, to the medical end
of it. I'd be surprised if we can narrow it down to one thing. I
think it's a combinations of things. It's one of the things
(general manager) Bill Stoneman has on his plate this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no secret the key to a championship-caliber club is the
health of the pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching coaches in the organization are: Bud Black (major
league level), Greg Minton (Triple-A Edmonton), Howie Gershberg
(Double-A Erie), Kernan Ronan (Single-A Lake Elsinore), Randy
Kramer (Single-A Cedar Rapids), Zeke Zimmerman (short season
Single-A Boise) and Mike Butcher (Rookie League Butte).
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Scott Karl will be skipped in the starting rotation this
week, replaced by reliever Al Levine, who will start Friday in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Karl is 0-2 with a 9.53 in three starts since signing with the
club three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're at the point where Scott needs the oppurtunity
to pitch,'' Scioscia said. ''But it's a catch-22 because we can't
afford that luxury at this point in the season. We're looking for
productive starts right now, and Scott has had a problem getting
his feet on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn (four innings) and Etherton (three innings) each threw
a simulated game and reported feeling good. However, neither one
will pitch in another game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn has a stress fracture in his left shoulder and Etherton
has tendinitis in his right shoulder.

CANCER TREATMENT DRUGS TO BE EXEMPT FOR NOW FROM PAYMENT CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is holding back on plans
to cut Medicare reimbursements for drugs used for outpatient cancer
treatments. However, it will adjust payments on 32 other types of
drugs after an investigation found the government was paying too
much.
</P>
<P>
   Oncologists and many lawmakers, including several from Missouri,
balked when the Health Care Financing Administration announced
three months ago that it wanted to reduce reimbursement for
chemotherapy given at doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors acknowledged that the money they receive for the drugs
often exceeds prices they pay wholesalers, but they said that makes
up for getting too little for the time and expertise needed to
administer the drugs. They lobbied Congress to oppose the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration said in a letter to Congress that 14 drugs used in
cancer treatments and three used on hemophiliacs would be exempt
from Medicare payment changes set for Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of those 17 drugs will be studied further, and a
proposal will be made to accompany any reduction in reimbursements
with an increase in fees paid for giving those drugs, administrator
Nancy-Ann DeParle said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal would be to have more accurate pricing for both
chemotherapy drugs and chemotherapy administration in place at the
same time,'' DeParle wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican who sponsored a bill
to stall cuts in chemotherapy reimbursements pending a review, said
he welcomed DeParle's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Clinical Oncologists said in a statement
Monday it also was relieved by the announcement and intends to work
with the administration to update the fee schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said cutting reimbursement for cancer drugs would mean
they could no longer afford to administer them in their offices and
that patients would have to go to hospitals for treatment. About 90
percent of chemotherapy is done on an outpatient basis.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to cut payments stemmed from a study showing huge
markups in prices doctors billed Medicare for cancer drugs. They
made profits ranging from 11 percent to 900 percent, said Donna
Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said adjusting payments on 49 drugs eligible for
Medicare reimbursement, including the cancer drugs, would save
taxpayers $2.9 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 17 drugs for cancer and hemophilia patients will
not be reduced as planned, savings will still be significant by
adjusting payments on 32 other drugs, DeParle said. Those changes
constitute about 70 percent of the projected savings, she said.

 CAL GRANT GETS $1.2 BILLION EXPANSION  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   California's leaders took a bold step Monday, promising to pay
tuition at the state's public colleges and universities _ or nearly
$10,000 toward a private education _ for every low- and
middle-income student with good grades.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Los Angeles Monday, Governor Gray Davis
signed into law a massive expansion of the Cal Grant program,
committing at least $1.2 billion annually for every eligible
student starting in the 2001-2002 academic year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is telling students that if you work hard and do
your part by studying hard, then we as leaders will do our part to
help you pay for it,'' said Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes at a time when the governor and legislators
armed with a bounty from the budget surplus are focusing on
improving education. But the Cal Grant plan makes financial need a
key requirement in awards, unlike other programs touted by Davis
and being adopted around the nation. Those largely benefit middle
class families, rely on grades and offer tax breaks and benefits
based on performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Davis has made improving education and expanding
access to quality education the number one priority of his
administration,'' McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1960 master plan, California promised the top 12.5
percent of graduating high school seniors seats in the University
of California system, while the top third would be guaranteed a
space in the California State University system.
</P>
<P>
   But the law signed into law Monday is the first time the state
has come up with the money to make college a reality for eligible
students who previously could not afford it.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the state set aside an established sum for the
grants, handing out awards to applicants according to a ranking of
need and grades. When the money ran out, eligible students were
left out.
</P>
<P>
   UC Berkeley freshman Charlene De Leon, 18, said the new
guarantee of money for college is vital for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worry wasn't that I need to go to this particular college
or that college. I had to worry about how I was going to pay for
it,'' she said. ``Just getting in wouldn't be enough. I would not
be able to go to college without financial aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, which legislators called the most
significant increase in access to higher education since the GI
Bill, any student meeting the eligibility requirements will get a
grant.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is expected to reach 30 percent of the students
attending California high schools. When Davis took office last
year, there was enough Cal Grant money to reach only 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Students fitting income and asset requirements who earn at least
a 3.0 grade point average, or a ``B,'' will be eligible for grants
that cover tuition at the state's public institutions _ up to a
maximum of $1,428 for CSU and $3,249 for UC _ and about $9,700
toward a private university such as Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible students earning a 2.0 average, or a ``C,'' will get a
grant of up to $1,551, which they can use to pay for textbooks and
other incidental costs at community colleges. Part-time students
enrolled at least half-time _ six credit units a semester _ will
also qualify for grants. Students have within a year of high school
graduation to apply, although Davis agreed to award 22,500 new Cal
Grant awards to adult students who have returned to or are newly
entering college. Cal Grants will also be extended to students who
complete community college within five years of high school
graduation and whose academic record allows them to transfer to
four-year universities.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are available to students whose families have no more
than $45,400 in assets. The annual income ceiling for eligibility
varies, from $23,500 for students who are independent to $74,100
for students from families of six or more. As family size drops, so
does the income ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco State University math professor Daniel Fendel said
the infusion of financial aid would allow students to worry less
about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of students who have families and are working
long hours. Anything that will help them out is welcome. It really
is needed,'' he said. ``If they can cut down on their work hours a
bit and have more time for their classes it will make them better
students.''
</P>
<P>
   CSU spokesman Ken Swisher said Monday that the system's
Chancellor Charles Reed heralded the aid program as ``historic''
and a renewal of the California dream.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher said it will open the doors of higher education for many
more people, especially those who are first generation college
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many students who shrug their shoulders and say
it doesn't matter what I do in school, I won't be able to afford
college,'' Swisher said. ``It lets students know that if they want
to work hard, they can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Davis called the bill he signed Monday ``landmark,''
the Democratic governor initially opposed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   He backed a $71 million increase in money for the Cal Grant
program in his budget proposal _ which did not include the
educational guarantee _ far less than lawmakers had proposed. To
win Davis' support, the bill's champion, Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton, D-San Francisco, linked the Cal Grant to another
Davis-backed bill giving $1,000 merit scholarships to students who
score in the top 10 percent of their school on aptitude tests or in
the top 5 percent statewide.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis had vetoed one of the bills, the other would have died
with it. Burton also told Davis that because of unanimous GOP
support, the governor might risk an override if he vetoed the plan.
Burton and Davis negotiated during the summer and finally reached
an agreement in August that narrowed the scope and cost of the
program, while maintaining the guarantee of an education to needy
students.

UNION THREATENS MTA SHUTDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &HT;    By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Union leaders across Los Angeles County escalated
tensions Monday over MTA labor talks, vowing to shut down the
transit agency's bus and train lines if no agreement is reached by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The county Federation of Labor said if there's a strike, now set
for 12:01 a.m Friday, members of other unions would be encouraged
to join transit workers on picket lines, to halt work at
construction sites and refuse to make deliveries of gas and other
products to MTA sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to shut it down. We are going to shut down the
MTA,'' said Miguel Contreras, executive secretary-treasurer of the
Los Angeles County Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials responded to the
threat by accusing the unions of stalling negotiations and warning
that a secondary strike by other unions could halt even limited
service, which the agency hopes to provide by staffing 100 buses
with supervisor drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were certainly disappointed that a day when we thought a
lot could get accomplished in bargaining ended up not being worth
anything,'' said MTA Chief Operating Officer Allan Lipsky. ``We
think it's another example of the unions' failure to take
negotiations seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is less about wages and benefits than MTA's
insistence that work rules be eliminated that put its operating
costs as much as 50 percent higher than other bus services in the
county.
</P>
<P>
   The unions defend the work rules and have made imposing the MTA
contracts on the proposed Valley transit zone the key issue they
will strike over. A measure to achieve that was approved by the
Democratic-controlled Legislature and is on Gov. Gray Davis' desk,
but he has not indicated what he will do.
</P>
<P>
   Transit zone supporters have suspended their planning efforts,
saying the work rule issues and legislation make a separate bus
agency under local control economically unworkable. They said they
will honor existing contracts, but want the right to negotiate
their own contracts in the future and to privatize expanded
services if they can't reduce the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the MTA and its three major unions have been
bargaining for months on contracts for the 4,268 rail and bus
operators of the United Transportation Union, the roughly 2,000
mechanics of the Amalgamated Transit Union and the 638
communications workers of the Transportation Communications
International Union.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders accused the MTA of stalling negotiations to
consult with San Fernando Valley and San Gabriel Valley leaders who
are pushing for autonomous transit zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MTA is bargaining in bad faith, crippling the negotiations
and hanging the public out to dry,'' said Neil Silver, president of
the Amalgamated Transit Union which represents MTA maintenance
workers and mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Lipsky said it was ironic that transit workers were asking other
unions for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be looking for the same support that the janitors
had. We want to remind you that our bus drivers make an average
$50,000 a year, where our bus riders make an average $15,000 or
less,'' Lipsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real victims of this strike by the union are in fact the
MTA's bus and rail passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipsky said the MTA has plans to try to keep about 100 buses
running during a strike. Management personnel would operate and
maintain those buses.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that striking union members might succeed in
shutting down those lines, too, leaving many of the most
transit-dependent passengers with few, if any, options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even that, we aren't certain,'' he said. ``There's no question
that a transit strike would mean that most of our passengers
wouldn't be able to find alternative public transportation.''

VALDES' STOCK PLUMMETING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sometimes a player shuns a long-term deal because a
bigger contract awaits. Ismael Valdes took that gamble and, in
Vegas terminology, crapped out.
</P>
<P>
   He was once a highly sought-after commodity who turned down a
lucrative contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Now Valdes,
despite being 27, has seen his career teeter to where industry
officials believe he'll be fortunate to get anything more than a
one-year, incentive-laden contract next season as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   It's based on performance and reputation. Neither have been
strong, but the latter took another brutal hit Monday when he was
scratched hours before his scheduled start against the Arizona
Diamondbacks. The numbness he experienced in his right pinkie
finger has left Valdes' status as day to day, but with a contingent
of young pitchers now in the fold, it's uncertain when his next
start will be.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Eric Gagne, who got into town about 4 p.m. after
being recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque, started in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who is 0-3 with a 6.08 ERA with the Dodgers and 2-7 with
a 5.64 ERA overall, was examined by Arizona team physician Dr.
David Zeman. Dodgers trainer Stan Johnston said the numbness could
be an after-effect of Valdes being hit with a line drive last
Wednesday against Pittsburgh, but Valdes added he had no problems
throwing a bullpen session in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be pressure on the sensory nerve,'' Johnston said.
``Everything else is fine. Blood supply and other things you worry
about are fine. Right now it's being treated as a neuro problem.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's another problem for Valdes, whose stock in the
free-agent market has plummeted this season. Even though Valdes was
9-14 last year, his stock was high because of a 3.98 ERA. But
questions of his mental toughness were always an issue and Chicago
Cubs manager Don Baylor questioned it soon after the winter trade
had sent Valdes to the Cubs. Since then, Valdes has had trouble
with his shoulder, hamstring and blisters.
</P>
<P>
   In a nightmare season, Valdes also has a six-game suspension
pending. An appeal hearing date has not yet been set, but the
office of the commissioner is looking at either Friday or early
next week. Either way, it's going to be in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Valdes said. ``I don't know what to tell
you. I'm telling you, I've never experienced that before. It's
crazy. It's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More callups: In addition to right-hander Eric Gagne, the
Dodgers also recalled left-hander Jeff Williams and infielder Hiram
Bocachica. The moves were made because Triple-A Albuquerque was
eliminated from the Pacific Coast League playoffs Sunday night in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will add three more players to the roster. Catcher
Angel Pena, once thought of as the future catcher of the Dodgers,
and right-handers Mike Judd and Al Reyes are expected to join the
club Thursday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Pena's addition is perplexing, especially since a sprained left
thumb kept him from catching lately. The Dodgers soured terribly on
Pena, 25, in the last two seasons to the extent they tried to trade
him throughout the season. The Dodgers also plan to offer Pena to
beef up trades during the offseason, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Outfielder Bruce Aven (strained oblique) could
return to action Thursday. . . . Tom Goodwin extended his hitting
streak to a season-high 12 games, two shy of tying his career best,
with a homer in the fifth inning.!dlim!!end!

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, the Republican television
commercial on prescription drugs looks like a run-of-the-mill
attack advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   The announcer starts by lauding Bush's proposal for dealing with
prescription drugs, and criticizing Vice President Al Gore's plan.
Fragments of the phrase ``bureaucrats decide'' _ deriding Gore's
proposal _ then dance around the screen.
</P>
<P>
   But then, if you watch very closely, something else happens. The
word ``RATS,'' a fragment of the word ``bureaucrats,'' pops up in
one frame. And though the image lasts only one-thirtieth of a
second, it is in huge white letters, larger than any other word on
the commercial. The tagline of the advertisement declares, ``The
Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats Decide.''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, though, in a tightly contested
presidential race, the Democrats have given the 30-second
advertisement more than a quick glance. After being alerted by an
eagle-eyed Democrat in Seattle, aides to Gore examined the
advertisement frame by frame, spotted the suspicious word, and gave
a copy of a slowed-down version to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Castellanos, who produced the 30-second commercial for the
Republican National Committee, insisted that the use of the word
was ``purely accidental,'' saying, ``We don't play ball that way.
I'm not that clever.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked, then, when he noticed the word in the commercial,
Castellanos said, ``That's all I want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But several Republican and Democratic admakers who were told of
the commercial, as well as many independent academics, said they
were startled that such a word would appear and said it appeared to
be a subliminal attempt by the Republicans to discredit Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief media consultant, Mark McKinnon, said he had not
noticed the word ``rats'' when he reviewed the advertisement before
it was broadcast. Most people probably have not noticed either,
although some people who watched a tape of the commercial at normal
speed on Monday _ albeit very carefully _ said it was visible.
</P>
<P>
   After being told of the word, McKinnon said the commercial
should be corrected because it ``certainly might give reporters or
anybody else who looked at it'' a reason to stir up attention.
</P>
<P>
   But after reviewing the ad, he amended his comment.
</P>
<P>
   ```Rats' is not a message,'' McKinnon said. `` `Bad plan' or
`seniors lose' might be. But `rats?' We're just not that clever. I
just watched it five times in a row. Hard as I looked, couldn't see
`rats.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every professional admaker interviewed said that given
the technology by which commercials are assembled frame by frame,
it was virtually impossible for a producer to not know the word was
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way that anything Alex Castellanos does is an
accident,'' said Greg Stevens, a veteran Republican admaker here.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Baker, chief of the office of political programming at the
Federal Communications Commission, said if the word was
deliberately inserted in the commercial, that would be ``an
extraordinary development'' and reflect ``reckless'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While he said the commission does not explicitly prohibit
subliminal advertising, Baker explained that ``we have policy
statements and public notices that indicate they are inherently
intended to be deceptive and might be contrary to the public
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell West, a political scientist and expert on political
advertising at Brown University, said: ``It is really extraordinary
that something like this would appear. This is the first time I've
heard of anything like this in a presidential campaign ad. The risk
of a major voter backlash from something like this could be very
high because, above all else, voters don't like to be fooled.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ferguson, the president of Young &AMP; Rubicam, who heads the
Bush campaign's group of Madison Avenue advertising consultants,
seemed astonished when told of the ad. ``Are you serious? That's
unbelievable,'' he said. ``I hope we haven't stooped to that.
That's pretty bad. I thought that was illegal anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The party has spent an estimated $2.5 million on the commercial,
which is still being broadcast in 33 markets. The advertisement has
run roughly 4,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Strother, the president of the American Association of
Political Consultants and a veteran Democratic admaker, said,
``There is absolutely no way this can be an accident. I'd be
stunned if it was a mistake. If that's an accident it's counter to
everything I know about political consulting. When you're running a
presidential race, you're really, really super sensitive to every
frame of that spot. You're looking at what words are on the
baseball cap that people wear.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that subliminal messages embedded in advertisements
could influence people became popular in the 1950s, when James
Vicary, an advertising executive, reported that he had increased
the sales of Coke and popcorn during a moving by flashing ``Drink
Coke'' and ``East Popcorn,'' on the screen. (Vicary's report turned
out to be a hoax.)
</P>
<P>
   Three decades of research on subliminal advertising, however,
have convinced the majority of psychologists that the public is not
so easily manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subliminal advertising and psychotherapuetic effects from
subliminal tapes are ideas whose scientific status appears to be on
a par with wearing copper bracelets to cure arthritis,'' wrote Dr.
Timothy E. Moore of York University in Toronto in The Skeptical
Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   But Ronald C. Goodstein, a marketing professor at Georgetown
University's business school who has studied subliminal advertising
extensively, said the word ``RATS'' could have the effect of
``making people feel more negative toward Gore'' although he said
there was ``no way that people are going to switch votes because of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Gore campaign, the word was first spotted by
Gary Greenup, a 64-year-old retired Boeing technical writer in
Seattle. Greenup taped the commercial soon after it was first
broadcast in late August and slowed the tape down to reveal the
word. ``It somehow caught my eye,'' he said. Usually, he added, ``I
don't look this closely at ads _ mostly I'd just as soon not view
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenup called the King County Democratic Party, which alerted
the Gore campaign. Greenup said that while he was a Democrat he was
not active in local politics. ``I'm not working in the party,'' he
said. ``I contribute a little annually _ it's very very small.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial's embedded message also attracted the notice of
Fox News, which mentioned it briefly on ``Special Report With Brit
Hume'' two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican admaker who defended Castellanos was Sal Russo.
``I'm not as conspiracy minded as everyone else is,'' he said. ``I
can't imagine that that's deliberate. I've got to think it's
inadvertent.''
</P>
<P>
   Castellanos is a veteran advertising strategist who is known as
one of the toughest in the business. His most infamous
advertisement, broadcast in 1990 for Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolnia, showed the hands of a white man tearing up a letter he
received from a prospective employer. The advertisement was
intended to stir resentment among white voters toward Helms' black
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   When Castellanos worked for Bob Dole's presidential campaign
four years ago, he produced some hard-edged commercials that
campaign officials rejected. One featured a montage highlighting
President Clinton as corrupt set to the song, ``You Cheated, You
Lied.''

JETS SQUEAK PAST PATRIOTS, 20-19 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The pleasantries of this family feud had
been dispensed with early, the back slaps and handshakes exchanged
among the eternally intertwined teams. But then the muscling began,
and the Jets showed that the end of the Tuna Bowl era may not mean
the end of this passionate rivalry or the Jets' curse over the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   In what evolved into a blood feud of defenses, the Jets battled
the team coached by the man who left them like scorned lovers, and
who can still design a defense to stall an offense.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots Coach Bill Belichick's defense held the Jets over and
over, stopping drives on just three plays four times entering the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Only late in the game, after scoring only one touchdown midway
through the first quarter, did the Jets finally burst free.
Trailing by 12 points in the fourth quarter, the Jets engineered
two touchdown drives to win a thriller that will only manage to add
more passion to this series, 20-19.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Richie Anderson made 5 receptions for 78 yards in a
85-yard drive that ended with Wayne Chrebet's juggling touchdown
pass that closed the Patriots' lead to 19-14.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with offensive players waving towels to exhort the howling
crowd, the rookie Shaun Ellis sacked Patriots quarterback Drew
Blesoe on third down with 2 minutes 42 seconds left. After a
momentary scare when punt returner Dedric Ward fumbled the punt
before it was recovered, the Jets took over on their own 28-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who had been stymied and
frustrated much of the night, launched a 44-yard pass toward the
left sideline and Dedric Ward, who was being covered by former Jet
Otis Smith. The pass was caught for 44 yards. After the two-minute
warning, Testaverde took the snap and then found Chrebet standing
at the left orange pylon at the goal line. Chrebet somehow caught
the ball in traffic and got into the end zone. Two plays, 72-yards,
Jets win.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin's 2-point conversion attempt failed, but the Jets
defense _ which had kept the Jets in the game throughout the night
while the offense spun its wheels _ held again. Ellis and his
fellow rookie John Abraham sacked Bledsoe again, planting the
Patriots on their own 26-yard line at third down with 1:38
remaining. Bledsoe would be sacked again, his sixth sack of the
night, and the Jets could finally exhale. The curse of the Tuna was
still on their side, even if Bill Parcells was no longer on their
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Groh stalked off the field at the end of the first half, glaring
at his players as he stomped toward the locker room with the Jets
trailing by 12-7. He had plenty to be annoyed about. While his
defense was able to hold the Patriots to four first-half field
goals, his offense was sputtering and his special teams were a
nightmare. For the glass-half-empty crowd, this must have been a
sure sign that Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, the prodigal coach,
had harkened back to his defensive guru days to outsmart his former
colleague and the man who ultimately replaced him as the Jets' head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could have expected an offensive slugfest between two
teams coached by defensive-minded coaches. Testaverde was under
pressure and his line of vision was frequently obscured.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets' special teams were the difference in a half
dominated by defense. The Jets allowed the Patriots to gain
marvelous field position on three of its drives _ Troy Brown
returned punts 51, 21 and 38 yards _ while the Jets' own kick
returners failed to generate such results, with three drives
starting at the 20-yard line. Starting deep in its own territory _
the best starting position was the 34-yard line _ the Jets' offense
also misfired on its own. Testaverde was overthrowing receivers,
failing to see open teammates downfield and watching as his
receivers dropped balls. When this happened in the first half of
last week's victory over Green Bay, the Jets simply handed the ball
to running back Curtis Martin until a helmet made contact with his
left knee and slowed him down. Martin was slowed tonight, too, and
so the offense had little balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets went three-and-out on their first drive, and the
Patriots quickly moved the ball into position for Adam Vinatieri's
first field goal. But Testaverde had his only highlight of the
first half on his second drive, leading the Jets on a 74-yard,
12-play march that ended in a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end
Fred Baxter that briefly gave the Jets a 7-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But that was it for the offensive movement. On the Jets' first
drive of the second quarter, after a second Patriot field goal,
Testaverde threw a pass intended for Martin on the left sideline.
New England's Antonio Langham stepped in front of Martin at the
Jets' 38, snared the ball, then tiptoed down the sideline to the 14
yard-line.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the defense held, and Vinatieri kicked a 30-yard field
goal to give the Patriots a 9-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets went three-and-out on their next three drives, but were
fortunate that the Patriots could muster little better. Patriots
quarterback Drew Bledsoe was battered by Tampa Bay's superior
defense last week, but the Jets did not need to sack him repeatedly
to limit him to just 90 yards passing on 10 completions, getting
him just once.
</P>
<P>
   At the half, the teams shared dismal offensive numbers: 140
yards total offense for the Patriots, 143 for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   More ominous, though, was that, while Testaverde was suffering
with 6 completions in 21 attempts for just 94 yards, Martin was
unable to pick up the slack, rushing for just 39 yards on 8
carries. &QL;

BAD SEASON LEAVES GREER FOCUSED ON FUTURE (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
The hardest season of Rusty Greer's career is coming to a slow,
agonizing end. It has been a season of injuries, uncertainty about
his next contract and mounting losses for his team.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has tried to remain upbeat, but it has been difficult. Like
Rafael Palmeiro and other members of past division-winning teams,
he is used to winning, being in pennant races this time of the year
and looking forward to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been frustrating and hard and disappointing,'' Greer
said. ``There again, though, you learn about yourself and learn how
to deal with things and be better for it. It's easy to ride the
ship when it's smooth water. But when it gets rough, that's when
you really see what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer, like just about everybody employed by the Rangers,
eagerly looks forward to the off-season to see what will happen,
both with the team and with
</P>
<P>
   his contract situation. It could be a critical time for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have an option on Greer's contract for next season
at $4.5 million, and there is little doubt they will pick up the
option. But he is unsigned beyond 2001. There have been sporadic
talks with management since spring training, but everything was
shut down when the club started to falter in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to sit down as soon as possible and try to get
something worked out so I could hopefully be here for my whole
career, or at least the near future,'' Greer said. ``I can sit here
and speculate what might happen, but the only people who really
know are the guys in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be general manager Doug Melvin, who wants to keep
Greer but said the time to talk is in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big part of our club; I don't think that has changed,''
Melvin said. ``I've always had that interest. But it's hard to
speculate until you see the numbers. I wanted to re-sign Aaron Sele
and Todd Zeile. But until you sit down and talk, you really don't
get a sense of where it's going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer said the contract has not been a distraction this season
but could be next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has affected me,'' Greer said. ``Certainly
you think about it because it's part of the job, and that's what
affects you both now and down the road. As far as on the field, I
hope it hasn't affected me at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to get something done before the beginning of
next season. If not, then, if you go into the season, it could be a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The distractions this year were from injuries. He had a strained
hamstring that put him on the disabled list in April. He used that
time to have ankle surgery. Then, while on a medical-rehabilitation
assignment in the minors, he hurt his shoulder, and his return was
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   He missed six weeks, didn't get back into the lineup until May
27 and found himself far behind everybody else. An admittedly slow
starter, Greer didn't find himself back at the top of his game
until after the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers are returning to normal, even if the six-week
absence will prevent him from reaching his customary 100 runs
scored and 100 runs batted in. He is hitting .302. His on-base
percentage is .379, and his slugging percentage is .463. Melvin
likes to add a player's on-base percentage and slugging percentage,
and deems anything over .800 as showing a productive season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a couple of nice streaks and swung the bat well,''
manager Johnny Oates said. ``All of us, as we get older, can't do
some things well as we used to, but there are some things we can do
better. He's still a guy you'd like to have up there with the game
on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer said: ``I feel very, very good. I think that my body has
responded well. Numbers-wise, with another 100 to 140 at-bats,
you'd see things right where they normally are. I've been happy
with the way things have gone. It's more of a relief in my mind
that everything is all right with the ankle where I don't have to
worry about it going into spring training next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer gives the Rangers some flexibility by being able to hit in
any of the top three spots in the lineup. Oates is even reviving
the notion of batting him leadoff if the Rangers are able to
acquire the big bat they eagerly seek in the middle of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusty's a guy, depending on the rest of the lineup, that could
hit first, second or third,'' Oates said. ``He could be a sixth
guy. There are so many roles he could fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer has never fretted where he bats. He would just like to
play on a winning team, he would like to do it injury-free and he
would like to do it for the Rangers beyond next season.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he could forget about what happened this year. nn

SPORTS COLUMN: VULTURES SERENADE BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Above the west tunnel in Giants Stadium,
several dozen fans, many in Jets jerseys, were perched like
vultures, waiting for Bill Belichick to appear. And when the
Patriots coach did appear, the boos descended. Heavy, hearty boos.
Cruel boos. Among the serenade of those boos a heavy, hearty voice
could be heard above the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gutless pig,'' that heavy, hearty voice boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the climate on Monday night when the Jets deflated the
Patriots, 20-19, in a dazzling renewal of their rivalry as
Belichick, who joined the Patriots as head coach instead of
fulfilling his Jets' contract as Bill Parcells's successor,
returned to Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Belichick and Al Groh, who did succeed Parcells, were on
Parcells' staff, they would put together the defensive game plan
and then bring it to Parcells, who often would say with his
familiar sarcastic grin, ``What have you geniuses come up with this
week?''
</P>
<P>
   And for more than 50 minutes on Monday night, Belichick appeared
to be the genius. His defenses were stifling the Jets' offense. But
suddenly Vinny Testaverde, after throwing five passes to Richie
Anderson, found Wayne Chrebet for a 2-yard touchdown that pulled
the Jets to within 19-14.
</P>
<P>
   The next time the Jets had the ball Testaverde completed two
quick passes for 78 yards _ 44 to Dedric Ward, then 28 to Chrebet
for the winning touchdown. On the Patriots sideline, Belichick's
shoulders slumped. On the Jets' sideline, Groh was the resident
genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't anything specific that woke up the offense, maybe
just a sense of urgency,'' Groh said later. ``It was do or die.''
</P>
<P>
   During the warm-up, Groh walked over to Belichick, shook hands
and chatted for maybe two minutes as they stood on the
red-white-and-blue National Football League shield at midfield. And
after the game, he had a quick conversation with Belichick on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just exchanged pleasantries before the game; we'd been
through a lot of battles together in this stadium,'' Groh said.
``After the game, I just wished him well. I knew he just wanted to
get out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh and Belichick were on the same coaching staff for seven
seasons with the Giants, Browns, Patriots and Jets; they remain
friends. But Parcells was not at the game, having explained that
his presence would have been ``too much of a circus.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Jets, a real rivalry has been rare, if only because in
most of their 40 previous seasons the Jets (and their American
Football League ancestors, the Titans) were seldom good enough to
create a real rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   In the years leading up to and following their Super Bowl III
victory, the Jets briefly had a coast-to-coast rivalry with the
Oakland Raiders that flared in 1967 when Joe Namath had his
cheekbone shattered (and helmet knocked off) by defensive end Ike
Lassiter.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as Parcells joined the Jets after having taken the
1996 Patriots to the Super Bowl, the Jets-Patriots rivalry burst
into flames. It singed not only the souls of the fans along the
I-95 corridor but also the National Football League
schedule-makers.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth straight season, the Jets and Patriots were
playing in prime time, the third straight season on Monday night.
But the three other games had all been at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells returned to Foxboro on a Sunday night in the 1997
season, he was hooted by fans waving banners and wearing T-shirts
that implored ``Grill the Tuna.'' When he strode onto the field for
the warm-up, he was greeted with shouts of ``Show me the money,''
meaning his reported six-year $14.4 million Jets contract.
</P>
<P>
   That night the Jets would've won had John Hall made a 29-yard
field goal in the final seconds, but the Patriots blocked the low
kick, then won in overtime, 27-24.
</P>
<P>
   In that season's rematch, Parcells, ``looking for a spark,''
benched Neil O'Donnell at halftime, inserted Glenn Foley at
quarterback and the Jets rallied to win, 24-19.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the Jets swept both games. In the 1999 season opener
Testaverde would crumple to the artificial turf in Giants Stadium
with a torn left Achilles' tendon and the Patriots held on to win,
30-28. But the Jets won the Monday night rematch, 24-17, behind Ray
Lucas's two touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday night the vultures had the last laugh on Bill
Belichick. &QL;

STARS APPEAR HUNGRY AGAIN, NOT BLOATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ The mountains are still emerald green, the stream
that chatters through the Vail Valley is still icy cold and the air
is crisp and clean, but there's something distinctly different this
year about Stars training camp.
</P>
<P>
   No Cup hangover.
</P>
<P>
   Last September the Stars spent the first week of camp telling
everyone that asked that there would be no problem gearing up for
another run at the Stanley Cup, even though their glazed eyes told
a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Stars were just trying to convince themselves. In the
process, they even fooled head coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight allows Hitchcock to contemplate last September with a
sharper eye now, but he can still remember how surprised and
pleased he was with his team's performance here and in exhibition
games a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was confusion,'' Hitchcock said as he sat on a bench in the
afternoon sun in Vail Village on Monday, sipping a cup of coffee.
``I'd prepared myself for the worst, but we came into this training
camp, and man, we were flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told \Rgeneral manager\R Bob \RGainey\S\ just before the
start of the season, `Man, Bob, this is unbelievable. This team
hasn't missed a beat.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was Gainey, who has been there himself, who sounded the first
word of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget what he said,'' Hitchcock recalled. ``He
looked at me in that way he has and said, `We're in trouble.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What do you mean we're in trouble? We look great.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `We're running on last year's energy. We're not
running on this year's energy, and when the tank goes empty, Hitch,
we've really got our work cut out for us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for Hitchcock to believe, based on how his team
seemed to be responding in camp, but he knew that Gainey had played
on Stanley Cup winners. If anyone would know how difficult it is to
get energized for another run, it would be him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the best description for it I've ever heard,''
Hitchcock said. ``He said, `When the tank empties, it's going to be
like when you have a big turkey dinner at Thanksgiving, and you eat
until you're full, and then an hour later someone taps you on the
shoulder and tells you its time to eat again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take another bite. You're already stuffed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Stars found themselves a month into the season
last year. The sustained energy from winning the Stanley Cup in
Buffalo finally ran out. They couldn't take another bite.
</P>
<P>
   For the next month the Stars struggled to figure out whether
they really wanted to pay the price to get back into serious
contention for another run. It could have gone either way.
</P>
<P>
   You know the rest of the story.
</P>
<P>
   There's a big difference between winning the Cup and losing it
in six games, as the Stars did last June against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The hunger is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling around this team right now among the leaders is
the same feeling we had after the \Rconference championship\S loss
against Detroit \Rtwo years ago\S: Ticked off. Disappointed. Mad.
Focused. All of those things. In a lot of ways, the plate is
empty,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know other organizations would say, `Man, you got to the
finals, you did great.' Not this group. We have loftier goals than
that. And so there's this feeling that redemption is a big part of
what's going on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock can sense the difference in his veteran players,
people like Mike Modano, Brett Hull, Mike Keane, Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a methodical energy within the framework of the
leadership,'' Hitchcock said. ``They are very low-key serious.
They're leading the drills, they're leading the scrimmages. They're
not loose, they're focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Hand-in-hand with this refreshed determination to make a third
consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals is a decision by
Hitchcock and Gainey that to stay the same is to risk stagnation.
Thus, they will make a minor alteration to their precious system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not dramatic but it's funny how when you make one little
change in your system it affects a ton of things on the ice,''
Hitchcock said. ``We've decided to be more aggressive defensively,
putting more pressure on the puck, and we think that will lead to
more chances offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable on-ice manifestation of the team's new
pressure tactics will be a new emphasis on the fourth line.
</P>
<P>
   That means younger, faster, meaner, and did I say faster?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence that we can play four lines significant
minutes and not affect things,'' Hitchcock said. ``It means
Modano's line will play 18-20 minutes instead of 25 minutes. It
means the fourth line won't play eight minutes, it'll have to play
12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we're going to have to play at a tempo that the other
team can't compete at. Our fourth line is going to have to be an
energy line. It's not going to a line of mixing and matching like
it has been in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Brenden Morrow, Roman Lyashenko and Jon Sim, with the
occasional dash of Blake Sloan or maybe rookie Ryan Christie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been a team that's had two lines that check and
two lines that score,'' Hitchcock said. ``We want to have three
lines that score and one that checks.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more emphasis on offense ... what a concept.
</P>
<P>
   So the Stars are clear-eyed and focused. Cup hangover is long
gone. They open the exhibition season Thursday night in Denver and
play the Blues on Saturday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost hockey time in Texas, folks, and with the summer the
Rangers have had and the way the Cowboys have started, not a moment
too soon. nn

CUBAN: KNIGHT CAN HAVE JOB WITH MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 THRU-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If Mavericks owner Mark Cuban gets his way, Bobby
Knight won't be unemployed for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a huge fan, Bobby has a standing offer to join the Mavs as
a consultant,'' Cuban said Monday. ``I would offer him a job in a
heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight was fired Sunday from his longtime job as the Indiana
University men's basketball coach. Cuban, an IU graduate, is very
fond of Knight and even paid him a visit when the Mavericks played
the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis in February.
</P>
<P>
   With Knight's legendary status in Indiana, many of his followers
are having difficulties coping with his dismissal. Cuban, who has
given generously to the IU program, admitted as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult in some respects, because I know how important
coaching is to him, and no one wants to be fired under those
circumstances,'' Cuban said. ``On the other hand, it's liberating.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he takes another coaching job, my guess is he is going
to be incredibly motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cuban plans on hiring Knight, he might have to move quickly.
New Pacers coach Isiah Thomas said he wants Knight to be an
assistant on his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's welcome to sit on my bench at any time,'' Thomas told a
Detroit radio station. ``I would love for him to mentor me the way
Tex Winter has for Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genius that \RKnight\S has to give is strategically
unmatched. I would definitely offer him a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas played two years for Knight at Indiana before leaving for
the NBA in 1981 as a first-round draft pick of the Detroit Pistons.
Thomas guided the Hoosiers to the '81 NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Thomas and Knight's close player-coach relationship _
and the fact that Indianapolis is a stone's throw away from
Bloomington, Ind. _ Knight might be more inclined to work for the
Pacers than the Mavericks. But that won't stop Cuban from pursuing
a man who, despite the many controversies, would instantly push the
Mavericks into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bobby is a great coach,'' Cuban said. ``From an NBA
perspective, his players always come well prepared to the league
and the coaching shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as whether he will coach again, I don't know. He may
decide his future lies in discovering new fishing spots around the
world.'' nn

DAVID E. BELL, BUDGET DIRECTOR FOR KENNEDY, IS DEAD AT 81 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Elliott Bell, who was President John F. Kennedy's director
of the Bureau of the Budget and then his administrator of the
Agency for International Development, died on Wednesday at his home
in Cambridge, Mass. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, said his daughter, Susan Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Bell taught population sciences and international health at
Harvard from 1981 to 1988, when he retired from its faculty.
</P>
<P>
   After previous budget experience in the Roosevelt and Truman
administrations and after serving as administrative assistant to
President Harry S. Truman from 1951 to 1953, Bell was budget
director in 1961 and 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Kennedy chose him for the post, in December 1960,
Bell faced photographers and was asked to ``make out like you're
saying something; say `One, two, three, four.'''
</P>
<P>
   With a faint smile he chose a more budgeteer-size figure and
declared, ``Forty-five billion.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal Current Biography said in 1961, in a profile of
Bell: ``The post of budget director is recognized as one of the
most responsible in the government. The bureau is the central point
where all the far-flung federal programs meet, where estimates of
needs and resources are studied and adjusted, and often where
allocations of resources are decided.''
</P>
<P>
   In early 1961, when Kennedy was deliberating, at a meeting of
experts, about how to expand the space program, Bell is said to
have asked skeptically where the money would come from.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1962, when Sen. Paul H. Douglas, D-Ill., said, at a
hearing of the House-Senate Joint Economic Committee, that he and
many astronomers questioned the wisdom of spending billions to land
a man on the moon, Bell defended the space program. He said there
was no stunt involved.
</P>
<P>
   In budget policy, he turned out to be neither tightfisted nor a
free spender. He advocated using the budget to stimulate or
restrain economic activity as the situation might warrant. He also
dedicated himself to getting people to understand the role of the
budget and the different ways of looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1962, after about two years at the budget bureau, he had
given the budget a new appearance and new concepts. He got federal
agencies to engage in planning as they never had before. He strove
to interweave the budget more closely with national economic
policy. In addition, he greatly reduced the physical size of the
printed budget, making it a volume that could fit into a reader's
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Having been chosen by Kennedy to become in 1962 the chief of the
country's foreign-aid agency _ a post that was called in those days
the job nobody craves _ Bell took up his new duties, still in
Washington, in December of that year.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1965, his dedication and modesty in running the Agency
for International Development had brought him praise in the capital
_ even from members of Congress, the scene of many skirmishes about
foreign aid policy.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1963, he had come to be known among foreign-aid watchers
in Washington as a quick study, an alert decision-maker and ``the
guy who can save this program if anyone can.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at that time, he said: ``Fundamentally, AID's
purpose is national security. By national security, we also mean a
world of independent nations capable of making economic and social
progress through free institutions. Economically, we're not aiming
for standards of living; we're aiming for internal dynamics,
self-sustaining growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Under him, the agency put far more emphasis on planning
concerning specific countries and on a firm awareness of America's
national interest. ``We have tried to apply a cold and realistic
eye, and to look several years ahead,'' Bell said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped down from the post in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 to 1980, he was variously a vice president and an
executive vice president at the Ford Foundation, where he oversaw
its international activities. He served concurrently for a time as
a consultant to Frank Press, President Jimmy Carter's science
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was born in Jamestown, N.D., and received a bachelor's
degree in 1939 from Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., where he
was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and a master's degree in economics
from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary Barry Bell, whom he married in
1943; a daughter, Susan Bell of Putney, Vt.; a son, Peter B., of
Watertown, Mass.; a sister, Barbara Bell Dwiggins of San Luis
Obispo, Calif; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

DODGERS BEAT DIAMONDBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Los Angeles Dodgers found a way to keep Eric Gagne
from being too charged up for a start, but it's kind of
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   First, sit him through a minor-league game the night before.
Then, have him hop on a plane, preferably in Memphis, Tenn., at
4:30 a.m. and send him through Dallas, Albuquerque and Las Vegas
before arriving at the ballpark. In this particular instance, send
him to the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and wait until two hours before the game to tell him he's
starting.
</P>
<P>
   It worked Monday as Gagne, pressed into duty because Ismael
Valdes was injured, pitched six shutout innings as the Dodgers beat
Arizona 6-3 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   It pulled the Dodgers (75-69) within 2 games of the second-place
Diamondbacks. However, the Dodgers remain 10
</P>
<P>
   behind front-running San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gagne's third major-league win and second this season.
His other victory came June 6 when he pitched six innings against
Texas. Gagne allowed one hit and struck out seven in his most
impressive major- league start.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gagne only got the nod due to circumstance. Valdes
was scheduled to start but was scratched about two hours before the
game because of numbness in his right pinkie, which he said caused
him to lose control of his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne had arrived about 30 minutes before the decision was made
and after he spent all day on a plane. He was in Memphis, where
Triple-A Albuquerque was in the playoffs. But the only reason he
was in Phoenix was the Dukes were eliminated from the playoffs
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If Gagne had pitched this way during the first half of the
season, though _ which the Dodgers perhaps didn't expect _ there
never would have been a Valdes episode to allow Gagne this start.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gagne faltered through the first four months of the
season, going 1-6 with a 5.85 ERA, the Dodgers felt their only
chance to make a run at the playoffs was to acquire a veteran
pitcher. Valdes, traded away during the offseason and bad-mouthed
by the Dodgers for his lack of toughness and courage, was the only
viable option.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we discussed (trading) Ismael (in the offseason), one
reason we could do that is I thought Gagne was going to be a No.
2,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``That's how high I had
him and I wasn't alone, based on what he did in September. And I
still feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Dodgers' coaching staff is concerned, it is not a
matter of if, but when Gagne will become a top-notch starter in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne's biggest issue was overcoming early control problems and
that plagued him against the Diamondbacks. He allowed a two-out
single to center to Luis Gonzalez in the first inning and walked
the next two batters. Gagne got out of the inning by retiring Matt
Williams on a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne gave up two more walks in the outing but retired 12
consecutive batters in between.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers led 1-0 after the first inning on Gary Sheffield's
RBI double. They increased it to 5-0 in the fifth inning, which Tom
Goodwin led off with his first homer as a Dodger. Mark Grudzielanek
doubled and scored on Sheffield's double, which gave him 104 RBI.
It also marked the 10th consecutive plate appearance in which
Sheffield reached base via walk or hit.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green then singled to score Sheffield and Eric Karros flew
out to left field for the second out. But Todd Hundley singled and
Adrian Beltre followed with a double to center field to score Green
and make it 5-0.

SEYBOURN LYNNE, 93; RULED IN CIVIL RIGHTS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seybourn H. Lynne, the federal judge who in 1963 prohibited Gov.
George C. Wallace from barring two black students from attending
the University of Alabama, died on Sunday in Birmingham. He was 93
and was the longest serving active judge on the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor of a sovereign state has no authority to obstruct
or prevent the execution of lawful orders of a court of the United
States,'' Lynne said in an opinion first written in pencil on
yellow legal paper.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion was the first Lynne had written in the first person
in 29 years on the bench, and it starkly reflected his anguish
about the civil rights revolution raging across the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the people of Alabama,'' he said, but he insisted that
the law of the land came first. ``I know many of both races are
troubled and like Jonah of old, are `angry even unto death,''' he
wrote. ``My prayer is that all of our people, in keeping with our
finest tradition, will join in the resolution that law and order
will be maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne was hardly a leader in integration. In 1956, he was the
dissenter in a three-judge panel's decision to integrate city buses
in Montgomery, and later that year he declined a Justice Department
recommendation to convene a grand jury to investigate charges that
the civil rights of three black ministers had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he had no opinion on a similar panel's warning
against setting up a private all-white bus line to circumvent the
integration ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Often, he opposed the positions of Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., a
judge on the same federal court who became a hero to civil rights
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's decision on desegregating the state university was seen
by many as a simple reiteration of a 1956 court order to admit
another black student, Autherine J. Lucy, who had been quickly
expelled by the board of trustees, which said it wanted to stop
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many historians have come to see Lynne's order as part
of a deal he made with the Kennedy administration: The students,
Vivian Malone Jones and James Hood, could be admitted to the
university at the same time that Wallace would be allowed to make a
showy display, then stand aside and avoid arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, Lynne seemed to become friendlier to civil
rights demands. In 1966, he joined Johnson in ruling that
segregation of jails was unconstitutional. In 1969, he ordered the
integration of Birmingham's most exclusive cemetery, a decision
that resulted in a barrage of hate mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the middle of the road,'' said Julian Butler, a
Huntsville, Ala., lawyer who clerked for Lynne in 1965. ``He moved
more slowly than other federal judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason was his discomfort with the movement's
disruption of the old Southern ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tactics of some of the protest got under his skin,'' said
Robert L. Potts, a law clerk for Lynne in 1969 and 1970 and now
president of the University of North Alabama. ``He thought some of
it was less than honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Potts, who worked on the cemetery desegregation case, said
the judge underwent a ``growth process.''
</P>
<P>
   Seybourn Harris Lynne was born on July 25, 1907, in Decatur,
Ala. He graduated from what is now Auburn University and the
University of Alabama's law school. While a law student, he was
track coach and an assistant football coach at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   He then worked in his father's firm in Decatur, where his
grandfather, a Confederate Civil War veteran, had begun the family
practice. In 1934, he was elected to a county court, where he
served until his election as a state circuit judge in 1940. In
1942, he joined the Army, serving as a military judge in the
Pacific and winning a Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, President Harry S. Truman appointed him a federal judge
for northern Alabama, and he became chief judge of the district. In
1973, he took senior status, although he continued to hear cases
until earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne, who lived in a Birmingham suburb, was a Southern
gentleman with scant patience for wayward lawyers. His skill at
pressuring them to settle cases became legendary, and so did his
ability to guess what a jury would award.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press dispatch in 1963 noted how he would
sometimes close his eyes during court proceedings, then come to
life and recite testimony word for word. He read every Supreme
Court decision and could cite passages after just one reading, his
former clerks said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne's wife, the former Katherine Donaldson Brandua, and his
one child, Katherine Roberta Lynne, preceded him in death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Congress named the federal building in Decatur, across
the street from his birthplace and boyhood home, the Seybourn H.
Lynne Federal Courthouse.

EDITORIAL: A VANISHING SECURITY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The criminal investigation and prosecution of Wen Ho Lee, which
largely collapsed last weekend with his agreement to plead guilty
to a single felony count, must be reviewed by an independent
examiner to determine if racial profiling or other unfair tactics
were used by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had planned to plead guilty to improperly downloading
classified defense documents at the Los Alamos laboratory. But the
plea hearing has been postponed until Wednesday. Federal
prosecutors are expected to drop the 58 other counts against him,
allowing him to go free after nine months in detention. The
remaining count does not indicate any intent to harm the United
States or assist a foreign nation, the central claim the government
initially sought to prove.
</P>
<P>
   This is a stunning turnabout for government officials who
previously insisted that the downloaded data contained the ``crown
jewels'' of America's nuclear arsenal that could change the global
balance of power if transferred to a hostile nation. In recent
weeks these assertions were undermined by new information. The lead
agent with the FBI admitted in court to having testified falsely.
Several top nuclear scientists testified that the vast majority of
the information was already in the public domain. The data was not
classified as secret or even confidential until after Lee was fired
from Los Alamos last year.
</P>
<P>
   As the case came unglued under the prodding of Judge James A.
Parker, evidence has mounted that Lee may have been singled out
because of his Chinese ancestry. Robert Vrooman, former head of
counterintelligence at Los Alamos, and Charles Washington, former
acting head of counterintelligence at the Energy Department,
submitted affidavits saying that Lee had been targeted as a suspect
because of his background. Washington said that others suspected of
serious security violations had escaped prosecution, and many were
merely ``verbally counseled'' for mishandling classified data.
</P>
<P>
   Parker had ordered the government to turn over for his review
thousands of pages of documents this week, including classified
material compiled by the Energy Department on racial profiling
tactics and State Department records on individuals who had
breached national security but were not prosecuted. In ending the
case, the government will conveniently avoid those disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress and the public should not be satisfied with this
resolution. President Clinton should appoint a politically
independent person of national standing to review the entire case.
The nation deserves to know if national security secrets were ever
compromised at Los Alamos, and whether the government unfairly
singled out Lee and other Chinese-Americans for investigation. If

EDITORIAL: UNWORTHY PANDERING FROM MR. GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   In threatening to aim punitive legislation at the entertainment
industry, Vice President Al Gore has crossed a line that no
Democratic presidential candidate should ever cross. His party has
a tradition of protecting free expression. Gore and his running
mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, betray that tradition by advocating
what would amount to government censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statements came as the Federal Trade Commission produced
a report requested by President Clinton after the ghastly shooting
at Columbine High School. In it, the commission charges that the
producers of movies, music and computer and video games have
marketed inappropriate material to young people, violating the
spirit of their own ratings system. The FTC recommended tightening
enforcement of ratings curbs, a step that the industry should
consider as a matter of civic responsibility and political
prudence.
</P>
<P>
   But in delivering the report, the Trade Commission chairman,
Robert Pitofsky, cautioned against setting up a federal ``thought
police.'' Gore tried to skirt that problem by saying he would back
legislation to give the FTC broader power to punish the
entertainment industry for ``deceptive advertising,'' but that he
would do so in a way ``consistent with the First Amendment.'' That
is sophistry that seems to reinforce the charge by the Republican
nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, that Gore will say anything
to get elected.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential candidate can properly promise to jawbone
Hollywood into responsible behavior on this serious national
problem. But to seek the votes of cultural conservatives by
advocating new legal restrictions on commercial speech is a
dangerous assault on civil liberties and the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as the FTC noted in its report, there is no concrete
evidence linking violent or sexual content in popular culture with
the violent actions of teen-agers with guns. That does not mean
that the industry can refuse to help parents exercise control over
what their children watch. But that must be done through voluntary
labeling and a rigorously enforced rating system. The
Gore-Lieberman approach glosses over the fact that R-rated movies
are not barred to teen-agers. The rating requires that those under
17 must be accompanied by an adult. Barring the marketing of R
movies on television shows that have a large teen audience would
violate the rights of other viewers of these shows who are 18 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   These difficulties make it all the more dangerous to wield a
legislative or regulatory cudgel. The proper place for enforcing
the rating ban against unaccompanied teen-agers going to R-rated
movies is at the movie theater. An unwarranted expansion of federal
regulatory power over advertising content is not the solution.

GAGNE RETURNS, DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Los Angeles Dodgers found a way to keep Eric Gagne
from being too charged up for a start, but it's kind of
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   First, sit him through a minor-league game the night before.
Then, have him hop on a plane, preferably in Memphis, Tenn., at
4:30 a.m. and send him through Dallas, Albuquerque and Las Vegas
before arriving at the ballpark. In this particular instance, send
him to the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and wait until two hours before the game to tell him he's
starting.
</P>
<P>
   It worked Monday as Gagne, pressed into duty because Ismael
Valdes was injured, pitched six shutout innings as the Dodgers beat
Arizona 6-3 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exhausted. Just exhausted,'' said Gagne, who allowed one
hit, struck out seven and most likely earned a few more starts. ``I
had 15 or 20 minutes of sleep, so I guess sleeping is overrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne was a starter of circumstance. Valdes had been scheduled
but was scratched about two hours before the game because of
numbness in his right pinkie, which he said caused him to lose
control of his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne began the day in Memphis, where Triple-A Albuquerque was
eliminated in the playoffs Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a (scouting) meeting and I didn't even listen in the
meeting because I was so tired I was just trying to stay awake,''
said Gagne, who learned he would start after the meeting.
``(Dodgers manager) Davey (Johnson) came up to me and said, `You
might pitch.' I'm like, `Oh, that's good.' But I didn't think about
today (Monday). I thought about (Tuesday) or the next day. It was
fun, though. To go out and pitch six innings and not give up a run
feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gagne had pitched like this during the first half of the
season _ something the Dodgers expected _ there never would have
been a Valdes episode to allow Gagne this start.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gagne faltered through the first four months of the
season, going 1-6 with a 5.85 ERA, the Dodgers felt their only
chance to make a run at the playoffs was to acquire a veteran
pitcher. Valdes was the only viable option.
</P>
<P>
   During his early-season struggles, Gagne's biggest issue was
overcoming early control problems, something which plagued him
against the Diamondbacks. He allowed a two-out single to center to
Luis Gonzalez in the first inning and walked the next two batters.
Gagne got out of the inning by retiring Matt Williams on a called
third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne gave up two more walks in the outing but retired 12
consecutive batters between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the Gagne we knew from last year,'' Johnson said. ``He
was nibbling (early), feeling his way, and then it looked like he
got his confidence and was lights out after the first two innings.
That's why we projected him to be one of our big, successful
starters this year. It was good to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers led 1-0 after the first inning on Gary Sheffield's
RBI double. They increased it to 5-0 in the fifth inning as Tom
Goodwin homered and Sheffield, Shawn Green and Adrian Beltre each
had run-scoring hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't let his emotions get in the way, especially with two
outs,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said. ``After about the second
or third inning, he really settled down and focused on location. He
threw great pitches with full counts and behind in the count.''

EDITORIAL: TRIBULATIONS AND TRIUMPHS IN SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Baseball and football have yet to produce their main story lines
for 2000, and the summer Olympics that open this week in Australia
will generate many of the year's most memorable athletic images.
But for sports aficionados this past weekend provided plenty of
nourishment. The University of Indiana finally summoned the
gumption to fire Bob Knight as basketball coach, a gifted young
Russian tennis player gave the sleepy world of men's tennis a badly
needed jolt and Tiger Woods added another golf title to one of the
greatest championship years anyone has ever achieved in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of Knight was long overdue. His abusive treatment
of players, colleagues and officials was condoned by university
administrators because Knight brought the school three NCAA
championships and 11 Big Ten Conference titles in 29 years at
Indiana. His bullying behavior continued even after the university
set a ``zero tolerance'' policy for the coach last spring. Even so,
Myles Brand, the university president, managed to ignore the strict
code until a confrontation between Knight and a student last week
became a public issue. Knight's unruly partisans might ponder the
example of John Wooden, who won 10 NCAA titles at UCLA without
intimidating his players.
</P>
<P>
   After dominating men's tennis for a decade, and collecting a
record 13 Grand Slam titles, Pete Sampras may have met his
successor on Sunday in the U.S. Open. Marat Safin, a 20-year-old
Russian with an overpowering serve and laser-like ground strokes,
disposed of Sampras in three quick sets. His emergence may give the
men's game the kind of compelling new rivalry that women's tennis
enjoys with the wondrous Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, and
their top rivals.
</P>
<P>
   As for Tiger Woods, a year of unsurpassed excellence seemed
complete after he won the PGA tournament last month, giving him
three of golf's four major titles in 2000. But by triumphing in the
Canadian Open on Sunday, Woods brought his overall victory total
this year to nine and became only the second player to win the
U.S., British and Canadian Opens in the same year. Someone will
have to win a bucket of gold medals in Sydney to eclipse Woods as
athlete of the year. &QL;

the sanctions' effect on people. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-SEX-ED (Beijing) _ For several years now, a small New

   &UR; CAMPAIGN _ (Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-AD (Washington) _ At first glance, the Republican
television commercial on prescription drugs looks like a
run-of-the-mill attack advertisement. The announcer starts by
lauding Bush's proposal for dealing with prescription drugs, and
criticizing Vice President Al Gore's plan. Fragments of the phrase
``bureaucrats decide'' _ deriding Gore's proposal _ then dance
around the screen. But then, if you watch very closely, something
else happens. The word ``RATS,'' a fragment of the word
``bureaucrats,'' pops up in one frame. And though the image lasts
only one-thirtieth of a second, it is in huge white letters, larger
than any other word on the commercial. The tagline of the
advertisement declares, ``The Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats
Decide.'' By Richard L. Berke.

   MEDICARE-REFORM _ A look at the Medicare debate in the
presidential campaign: George W. Bush jumped into the Medicare wars
this week, promising that, if elected, he would form a White House
task force that would send legislation to Congress within nine
months to transform the 35-year-old government insurance program
into an efficient, largely private health care marketplace. But
many health care experts __ and sadder-but-wiser veterans of past
Medicare wars __ say that the last decade has shown the immense
difficulties in accomplishing such reforms. The philosophical
differences between the two parties over how to reshape Medicare
are large and enduring. The experience with private HMOs in the
Medicare program has been rocky, with hundreds of thousands of
Medicare beneficiaries dropped in recent years by health plans who
say they cannot make a profit. By Robin Toner.

<P>
   FORD-IGNITION (Undated) _ When thousands of car owners
complained in the 1980s and 1990s that their Fords unexpectedly
stalled, often on highways and while making left turns across
oncoming traffic, top company executives repeatedly assured
regulators that there was no way to know what might be causing the
problem. But throughout the period, Ford documents show, the
company's engineers, safety officials and even its board of
directors were aware of growing problems with one particular part _
a computerized ignition system attached to the engine's distributor
_ that would shut the engine down if it got too hot. By Stephen
Labaton and Lowell Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOS-ONLINE (Washington) _ On Monday, U.S. regulators put aside
antitrust concerns and approved formation of Covisint, a mammoth
online marketplace for the world's largest automakers. However, the
Federal Trade Commission, which voted to allow the venture to
proceed, said the government cannot say that implementation of the
Covisint venture will not cause competitive concerns, and it
reserved the right to take such further action as the public
interest ``may require.'' Covisint is an Internet marketplace joint
venture of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler
AG, Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co., along with two information
technology companies, Commerce One Inc. and Oracle Corp. _ By Chris
Marquis.

   REAL-LIFE-MARKETING (Benton Harbor, Mich.) _ Tony Barbee was
never one for household chores. Even in college, he brought his
laundry home to mother, and he shunned the stove in favor of the
local Burger King or Kentucky Fried Chicken. But for two months
this summer, Barbee, now 30, and six other young recruits took part
in an unusual training program that might be considered the
corporate equivalent of realty-based television. A small group of
new hires at Whirlpool is essentially sentenced to live together in
a large house, where during the course of their stay they prepare
more than 900 plates of food; wash no fewer than 120 bags of
laundry; and perform countless hours of loading and reloading of
the company's refrigerators, dishwashers and dryers. _ By David
Barboza.

major options exchanges for years agreed to retrain competition by
not seeking to trade options already traded on other exchanges. The
exchanges _ the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange, the Pacific Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange _ signed a consent decree with the Justice Deparment, and
accepted a censure by the SEC, but did not admit doing anything
wrong. By Floyd Norris.

<P>
   SCI-FIRES-NUKES (Undated) _ Fires in and around nuclear
facilities understandably make people nervous, and so this has been
an unnerving summer in the American West, where the wildfires that
ravaged millions of acres edged into several major complexes.
Scientists outside the Energy Department who reviewed the air
monitoring data from the fires at Los Alamos and Hanford agreed
that there did not seem to be any cause for alarm. But the risks of
radiation releases during and after wildfires at contaminated
nuclear sites are still not very well understood by scientists, let
alone the public. By Jon Christensen.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENETICS-SOCIETY (New York) _ Just before the Fourth of July
holiday, an international scientific consortium announced at a
White House celebration that it had largely deciphered the DNA
instructions encoded in the human chromosomes. Once the hoopla died
down, we who are involved in the work have turned to preparing a
scientific paper to be submitted later this year describing the
findings. But while scientific revolutions may start with dry,
objective data, but ultimate impact depends on human interpretation
in a societal context. So, I was glad to visit the Exit Art Gallery
in Soho for the opening of a different kind of genome annotation
project, a show entitled ``Paradise Now: Picturing the Genetic
Revolution'' by 39 artists probing the social meaning of genetics.
By Eric S. Lander.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DRUGS-CHILDREN (Undated) _ Starting this December, a new
Food and Drug Administration rule mandates that any new adult drug
that the FDA decides could be used by children with the same
disease must undergo pediatric study, and its manufacturers must
list doses for children on the label. We have a conversation with
Dr. Dianne Murphy, associate director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research. By Alexis Jetter.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DRUGS-TESTS (Washington) _ In a hearing today, the FDA tries
to hammer out details of how ethically to test drugs on children.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undted) _ The Personal Health column: The
Sugar Association is trying to convince Americans that consuming
large quantities of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and snacks does not
harm one's nutritional status, body weight or long-term health. But
the research the association cites to support its contentions shows
how statistics can often be misleading if they present only part of
the story. Here is what you should know about the appalling
increase in sugar consumption by Americans _ especially children _
and the effects this increase is having on health. By Jane E.
Brody.
</P>

NEW ENGLAND LAWMAKERS SCRAMBLE TO AVERT HEATING CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Looking worriedly ahead what could be another
winter heating crisis, Massachusetts lawmakers are rushing to pass
legislation creating a special home heating oil reserve for New
England. They are also pressuring President Clinton to release
emergency heating aid early, so that low-income families aren't
caught short when the weather turns cold.
</P>
<P>
   While the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided
Sunday to up its production of crude oil by 800,000 barrels a day,
there is great skepticism in Washington that the 3 percent hike in
output will bring down the cost of heating homes. The oil will take
several months before it arrives in the United States and is
refined into heating oil _ assuming, a Department of Energy
official noted, that refiners don't elect to use the crude oil to
make gasoline, which could be more profitable for them in the short
term.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many believe the price of heating oil _ which hit a
household budget-breaking $2 a gallon last winter _ will get even
higher this winter, presesenting a severe, even life-threatening
problem for low-income Northeasterners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that a crisis is coming,'' said Josh Young,
spokesman for Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD), a
non-profit organization that distributes government heating
assistance to needy families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's scrambling madly to try to deal with this,'' said
Representative James McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. ``We need
to be more aggressive ... and not be caught off-guard.''
</P>
<P>
   With Congress distracted by upcoming elections, and the Clinton
administration down to its final few months in power, Massachusetts
Senators and Representatives are pushing hard to get some relief
before the expected adjournment the first week of October.
</P>
<P>
   The question is a tricky one for Congress and the White House.
Neither party wants to go home to constituents angry about high
gasoline prices or anxious about whether they can pay to heat their
homes this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many lawmakers are skittish about artificially
manipulating the supply of a product sold and traded on the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   What the two sides have largely agreed to is a package designed
to help consumers by easing temporary dips in heating oil supply,
but under tight restrictions to protect the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to pass a bill this week providing for a
2-million gallon heating oil reserve serving the Northeast. The
reserve would offer immediate help if a cold snap depletes
commercial heating oil stock.
</P>
<P>
   But the oil could only be released if there is a ``regional
supply shortage of significant scope and duration,'' and if the
difference between crude oil prices and heating oil prices has
risen by more than 60 percent over the past five winters, said Tina
Kreischer, spokeswoman for the Senate Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources. Committee chairman Frank Murkowski, Republican
of the oil-producing state of Alaska, insisted on the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Without the trigger provision, private oil refiners would have
no incentive to buy crude oil and store it, since they would have
to worry about being undercut by a government operation, Kreischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of the energy bill, sponsored by Senator Edward
M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, would create a pilot program
to restructure the way heating oil distributors such as ABCD in
Boston buy their oil. Under the Kennedy scheme, a distributor would
be guaranteed a certain price for a gallon on heating oil for the
entire winter if it paid a 4- or 5- cent-per-gallon fee as a sort
of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant step which will begin stabilizing home
energy prices over the long term,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some on Capitol Hill have called for the release of crude oil
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, meant for extreme
emergencies such as a war. Clinton has been reluctant in the past
to unleash the oil, but ``all options remain on the table,'' said
White House spokesman Jake Siewert. ``We're going to look and see
how the market reacts'' to the OPEC decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and McGovern
also stuck a provision into the energy bill that would require a
yearly study, delivered to Congress every September 1, assessing
the coming heating oil situation for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The entire delegation, meanwhile, has been urging Clinton to
allow early release of some of the $600 million in aid under the
Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which serves
110,000 Massachusetts families. Clinton is considering the request,
but there may be a legal problem in releasing emergency funds
before an actual emergency, a White House source said.
</P>
<P>
   But the real culprit, said David M. Nemtzow, president of the
Alliance to Save Energy, is the free-using, heavy energy
consumption in the United States, where prosperity has contributed
to even bigger oil demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has four percent of the world's population,
yet we use 23 percent of the world's energy,'' Nemtzow said. ``It's
out of control.''

LUCIRA AIMING TO TRACE HOT PCS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When his laptop computer was stolen three years ago, Ravi
Hariprasad got so mad he started a company to do something about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hariprasad's Boston-based Lucira Technologies Inc. is about
to release a product it says will be able to trace hot PCs whenever
they are used to connect to the Internet. The company also claims
its software will upload lost data and render the remaining
material unusable _ a repossession service for the information age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision of where we're going is to give everyone some
really powerful protections they don't really have now,'' said
Hariprasad, 24, who dropped out of medical school at the University
of Pennsylvania to become Lucira's president. ``You've got car
security and house security. But people walk around with this
information on their laptops and are only starting to think about
what they've got there.''
</P>
<P>
   A competitor is Absolute Software Corp. in Vancouver, British
Columbia, which also provides software that traces the whereabouts
of its host computer. Lucira says it will compete on price, giving
away its software free to most consumers beginning in a month or
two and charging a fee, perhaps around $20, to activate it to find
a stolen machine.
</P>
<P>
   It also just hired as a privacy officer Keith Enright, known for
the privacylaw.net Web site he maintains. Enright's job will be to
ensure Lucira only tracks the whereabouts of laptops that have been
reported stolen. He said the whole business should improve data
confidentiality as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more consumer-level sales there are of laptops, the more
people are going to start relying on these devices for their
confidential medical and financial information,'' Enright said.
</P>
<P>
   Laptop safety has been a hot topic among computer-security
consultants for years, since the machines are often worth thousands
of dollars and are easily lifted _ in both senses of the word.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey taken by the FBI and the Computer Security
Institute, thefts of laptops accounted for losses of $13 million
among 150 companies surveyed in 1999. Claims by laptop owners
accounted for 88 percent of personal-computer claims of $1.9
million last year, according to Safeware Inc., a Columbus, Ohio,
insurance agency.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the claims related to accidents, the company said, but
theft accounted for about $550,000 of claims.
</P>
<P>
   Lucira's products are meant to do something about it. The
software doesn't take up much room _ about 100k of memory _ and is
installed on a computer's hard drive in a manner Lucira says is
impossible to detect without sophisticated snooping tools.
</P>
<P>
   The software is written so that whenever its host computer is
connected to the Internet, it downloads from Lucira a list of
computers considered stolen.
</P>
<P>
   If the laptop's own number is on the list, it then sends to
Lucira its present Internet-protocol address, or the route it is
using to connect to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Next, after the laptop is signed off, the software instructs the
laptop's modem to redial itself to Lucira directly, where the
company uses an advanced caller-ID system to pinpoint the phone
line being used to tap into the network. The software also turns
off the laptop's speaker during the call to make it hard to detect
the connection.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, these steps should all provide Lucira enough
information to help police find and retrieve the stolen machine.
Hariprasad also describes a feature that would eventually allow
users to retrieve files from their stolen machines _ or even to
destroy or encrypt files they consider confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't suck back your whole hard drive, but we could get
back a few files you specify,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it has several millions of dollars in venture
funding. Hariprasad and four other cofounders still own a majority
stake. The company says it is in discussions with several big
hardware makers about incorporating its software in its designs.
</P>
<P>
   The company has ties to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and plans to test the software soon on the school's
computers. A board member is Gerald Isaacson, MIT's data-security
manager.

HOFFSTEIN HOLDS FAST AMID MARKET STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a guy whose stock is down 85 percent this year, and who
regularly gets calls from shareholders asking if his company is
going out of business, Gordon Hoffstein is remarkably calm and
confident.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that confidence may be born of experience. Hoffstein,
47, the chief executive of Be Free in Marlborough, Mass., has built
and sold two successful companies in the past. It also doesn't hurt
that he is sitting on nearly $170 million in cash, enough to last
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffstein insists he is confident for another reason:
because Be Free has a promising future that the stock market has
yet to recognize. Could he be right?
</P>
<P>
   Be Free specializes in affiliate marketing on the Internet. The
process works like this: if you're on a baseball site reading about
the Red Sox, you might find a link that takes you to the site of
Fogdog.com, a retailer selling Red Sox caps. Or if you're perusing
a site on fly fishing, you might see a link to an offer by L.L.
Bean for a fishing outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Be Free provides the connective tissue between the Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't hard to see why the stock is in the dumps. It closed
Monday at $5.25; in February it hit $56; it debuted last November
at $12. The market figures Internet retailing is like the Red Sox's
season, a lost cause. Internet advertising is even more unloved,
especially since virtually everyone now agrees that banner ads on
the Internet don't work.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffstein argues that investors are missing the point. Yes,
it's true banner ads don't work, he says, but for Be Free that is a
plus, not a minus. ``Companies still have to find customers,'' he
said in an interview last week. ``What are they going to do? Hire a
blimp? Scream in an open stadium?''
</P>
<P>
   The correct answer is: no, they will try affiliate marketing
instead. With Be Free's programs, retailers pay only when a
customer makes a purchase. In other words, they pay for
performance. Another set of Be Free clients, search engines such as
Lycos and Yahoo, pay for traffic that is driven to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   As ad budgets get squeezed, the hope is the online world will
turn to affiliate marketing _ and Be Free _ to make their dollars
go further.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Humphreys thinks investors are making a second mistake
about Be Free. ``I don't think this mode of interacting with
customers (e-commerce) is going away,'' said Humphreys, a partner
at Matrix Partners, a Waltham venture capital firm that owns a
stake in Be Free.
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys said that while some dot-coms may disappear, plenty of
dot-coms and established traditional players will continue to grow
their Internet businesses. Because Be Free has a number of
blue-chip clients _ AOL, E-Trade, Staples.com, Gap _ its business
will grow along with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company's fans point to another strength, Be Free's cash
pile. The company has the money to hang on and to make
acquisitions. Its chief rival, Linkshare, is a private company,
which in the current stock market would have trouble going public.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the possibility that Be Free itself will be
acquired. ``I would not be surprised if they were bought out by
someone looking to become a powerhouse in e-marketing,'' said Ethan
McAfee, an analyst at T. Rowe Price, and one of a number of
analysts who, unsolicited, brought up the buyout scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Hoffstein has a track record of selling companies. In
1996 he sold PCs Compleat, a computer retailer, for $134 million.
In 1990 he sold Microamerica, a computer distributor, for $96
million. In the pre-Internet era, $100 million was a lot of money.
Hoffstein's former venture partners, who are with him again this
time, can't say enough good things about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would back him any time I could,'' said Ted Dintersmith, a
partner with Charles River Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Hoffstein faces an uphill path. The stock market
remains hostile to e-commerce firms, especially those that lose
money. Analysts say Be Free won't be profitable before the end of
2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Another negative: while sales are growing, they are not
exploding. Be Free had revenue of just over $4 million in the
second quarter, a number that is not going to bowl anyone over.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hoffstein's confidence remains unshakeable. He concedes that
some Internet companies have business models that will never lead
to success. Be Free just doesn't happen to be one of them. ``We
have a model that is sustainable, we have good growth and we will
be highly profitable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is that bravado justified? Stay tuned.

UNIVERSITY FUND DRAWS HOT DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Perhaps one of the best kept secrets in Boston venture capital
_ until recently _ has been Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking billion-dollar funds or megadeals. The
school's Community Technology Fund has been quietly plugging away
since 1975, when cofounder Matthew Burns squeezed $2 million from
BU's endowment to invest in such ventures as Amos Hostetter's
Continental Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fund is still modest at $55 million. But its profile
is rising, following a string of successful investments and
early-stage tech deals.
</P>
<P>
   From relative obscurity, CTF has recently jumped to one of the
20 most active backers of Boston-area start-ups, according to
rankings by PricewaterhouseCoopers. And the pace is still surging:
The group has done seven deals in the first three months of its
fiscal year, already eclipsing the five deals it did last year.
</P>
<P>
   CTF has participated in rounds for Digital Broadband
Communications, a high-speed Web access company; C-Port Corp., a
chip and software maker; and, last month, Coriolis Networks, a
fiber optics company, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Crawford, 40, is chief dealmaker. He's a UMass engineer
who joined the fund in 1994, having previously done telecom market
planning for Boston Edison. Before that, he was a venture
capitalist with 3i Corp., a British investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford says the group's assets are evenly split between
information technology companies and life sciences companies. But
his chief focus now is on the former. His target investment is
$500,000 to several million.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal expected announced Monday, CTF is in a later-stage,
pre-IPO round for Mapletree Networks, a Norwood maker of software
and hardware used in routing voice and data traffic, alongside
Hostetter's Broadband Ventures Fund.
</P>
<P>
   How does a little fund get in on hot deals? The university
connection is the key, people who've done business with the fund
say. Entrepreneurs and venture capital firms want access to BU's
top engineering and science professors. The school's Photonics
Center, a cutting-edge facility for the study and commercialization
of light-related technogy, is another big draw. But perhaps the
biggest allure is a pipeline to job-seeking students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a huge differentiator,'' says Sean Aruda,
MapleTree's chief executive. He made contact with CTF in an unusual
way: He got a cold call from the group. Plenty of venture
capitalists would be turned away without a personal introduction.
But recruiting, Aruda says, ``is the thing that keeps me awake at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of the 7,822 graduates of BU's various
schools graduated with degrees in science or technology areas. The
venture group is glad to help graduates land jobs with promising
companies. It's also in the business of helping professors license
technology and raise venture funding for ideas developed in the
school's labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the real test,'' says Burns, 64, a formal Naval officer
and Harvard Business School grad who sits on many boards. ``After
six months or a year, can you take this out and raise money?''
</P>
<P>
   Most big schools with engineering and science departments have
licensing operations to help professors patent their inventions and
profit from them. The goal these days is to gain equity stakes in
companies built around those technologies to generate profits for
the university and the professors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the venture group's biggest successes is Sequenom, a
genomics company based in San Diego with Boston offices. CTF first
invested in the company in 1995, backing BU professor Charles
Cantor, a cofounder. CTF has reaped a return greater than 100
percent on its bet.
</P>
<P>
   The recent successes overshadow a biotech investing debacle that
took place in the 1980s and 1990s. The school had invested heavily
in money-losing Seragen Inc. under the watch of former president
John Silber and suffered huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   But CTF appears to have a sterling reputation. When it's not
making direct investments, the group is advising the university on
outside venture funds in which to invest endowment funds. BU has
invested more than $60 million of its $900 million endowment in
funds from Charles River and Commonwealth to Bessemer and Alta.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fitzgerald, a general partner with Commonwealth Capital
Ventures in Wellesley, says CTF was able to get in on its third
fund, a $170 million pot closed in June, because of a long
relationship with Crawford. He acknowledges that there's so much
money in the market, it's tough for small players like CTF.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the thing is grossly oversubscribed by big guys, they're
going to have a hard time getting in,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   CTF squeaked its way into a recent round with one of the
region's hottest fund-raisers, telecom player Quantum Bridge
Communications, partly thanks to the entrepreneurs' BU ties.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gwynne, a cofounder at Quantum Bridge, says investors and
customers were clamoring to get into the Andover start-up's $102.5
million round in the second quarter. CTF didn't get to put in
nearly what it wanted to, but $100,000 was a coveted foot in the
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense for us to spread our investors over multiple
sources,'' Gwynne says. And it didn't hurt that more than 20
Quantum Bridge employees hold BU degrees.

   An online payments system with BankBoston roots is on its way to
a second round of venture funding and a key relationship with Wall
Street's Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Clareon Corp., a Portland, Maine-based B2B payments company,
announced $30 million in second-round financing led by Technology
Crossover Ventures of Palo Alto. Morgan is also a large investor.
</P>
<P>
   Among the returning investors is BancBoston Ventures, which has
backed the deal since March, when Kate Barrand and six other
executives spun their start-up operation out of the bank with
former CEO Chad Gifford's blessing. Fleet is now the number three
investor in the company.

IRELAND SUPPORTS ITS TARNISHED SWIMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Given how much of the last four years she has spent
with lawyers, it is hardly surprising that as her contemporaries
take part in the Olympic Games in Sydney, Michelle Smith de Bruin,
Ireland's most decorated swimmer, will begin law school here in the
city that James Joyce once said wouldn't know the truth if it bit
it in the arse.
</P>
<P>
   After all, for whatever is left of de Bruin's tarnished legacy,
she can thank the law. It was her lawsuits that put off the
inevitable: being seen as someone who used performance-enhancing
drugs, or at least someone who tried to mask the evidence. It was
her threatening legal action that led Ireland's swimming body to
back down and allow her to retain 26 individual Irish records,
despite her international reputation as a cheat.
</P>
<P>
   The law has allowed her to remain a champion, if only in name.
There are the three gold medals from Atlanta. The two golds at the
European Championships at Seville. And nearly every record in Irish
women's swimming. They all stand.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the law aside, there is the inescapable conclusion that
Michelle Smith de Bruin, Ireland's greatest champion, has been
judged by the great bulk of people of the world, including Ireland,
a cheat. She and her affable lawyer Peter Lennon can claim
innocence as long as the day is long. But they might as well be
whistling ``Dixie'' and claim it is ``A Soldier's Song,'' Ireland's
national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   To some, their protestations of innocence, their claims of a
conspiracy orchestrated by Americans and somehow assisted by
numerous other countries (several of which dislike if not hate the
United States) are an embarrassing reminder of an Ireland that was
poor, insecure, unsophisticated, and desperate to be accepted into
the big leagues of nations.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in Ireland today, a rich Ireland that for nearly a
decade has had the most robust economy in Europe and has had to
hire Spaniards and Italians to serve natives in their suddenly
cosmopolitan restaurants, there are many who still defend their
greatest, most infamous champion.
</P>
<P>
   David Dwyer, an architect who has helped reshape Dublin from the
Victorian backwater that Joyce once described into one of Europe's
most vibrant capitals, said de Bruin was unfairly singled out. He
believes that most of the world's best swimmers use
performance-enhancing drugs. De Bruin should be blamed only for
getting caught, Dwyer suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her performance was excellent,'' he said of the Olympics. ``If
she did it, it was understandable. She wasn't the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar sentiments have been voiced by those excusing the sticky
fingers of Charles J. Haughey, who in the 1980s and early 1990s was
Ireland's prime minister on three separate occasions, and who
managed to solicit at least $12 million from businessmen.
Prosecutors who are currently trying to put Haughey in jail, or at
least shine a relentless light on the relentless corruption in
Irish politics, believe Haughey took far more than that.
</P>
<P>
   But walk around Dublin, and you'll hear something like this from
Pat Kelly, a God-fearing cabbie: ``Our Michelle did nothing wrong,
except succeed. It's the same with your man Charlie. People in this
country don't like success.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly may use pronouns differently than you and I, but he had
one thing right. Some Irish have a peculiar attitude toward
success. They resent it. It's called begrudgery, and it is
considered a national affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Pat Coogan, whose just-published book about the Irish
diaspora, ``Wherever Green is Worn,'' should be required reading
for anyone who had a great auntie from County Galway, once
observed, ``The one problem with the Irish is begrudgery.''
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to de Bruin and her lawyer, you would think it was
begrudgery that ensured her downfall. But getting to listen to de
Bruin isn't easy. An interview with the Globe last Friday was
canceled, apparently because of a Newsweek article that mentioned
her in the same sentence as disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben
Johnson. As Lennon explained, if there was any chance of that
perceived slight being overlooked, it was lost Friday afternoon
when the Evening Herald, a Dublin tabloid, ran a front-page splash
saying de Bruin had been tossed back in the fray of drug-taking.
The article, by a reporter in Dublin who rewrote wire copy, quoted
an American swimmer who mentioned de Bruin in passing, in response
to an Australian rival who had suggested he was using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelle is not very happy with the media at this time,''
Lennon said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet Michelle Smith de Bruin is nothing if not a creation of
the media, especially in Ireland. Aside from Stephen Roche, who won
the Tour de France in 1987, and perhaps Sonia O'Sullivan, the Cork
woman who is one of the best middle-distance runners in the world,
no other Irish athlete accomplished anything on the international
stage remotely as impressive as de Bruin's three golds and a bronze
in Atlanta, followed in 1997 by two golds and two silvers at the
European Championships. The Irish media fell over themselves
lauding de Bruin's achievements, and the nation, which by the mid
1990s had become one of Europe's richest countries, enjoyed her
success vicariously.
</P>
<P>
   But if most Irish journalists prayed at the altar of St.
Michelle, there were a few who became the proverbial skunks at the
garden party. While their contemporaries reached for thesauruses
for superlatives to heap on de Bruin, Tom Humphries of the Irish
Times, Paul Kimmage of the Sunday Independent, and Eamon Dunphy, a
Sunday Independent columnist and host of Ireland's most popular
drive-time radio show, began to smell a rat _ a water rat, at that.
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy, Humphries, and Kimmage were disturbed that de Bruin's
husband, who was also her trainer, had been banned as a shot putter
for using steroids. The trio pointed out that de Bruin's remarkable
improvement at the relatively late age of 26 was unprecedented in
swimming. Humphries did the math and found that the average age of
the previous 10 gold medalists in the 400-meter freestyle was 16.9
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a nation as broadly ignorant of the science of swimming
as we Irish were could have swallowed it all without question,''
Humphries declared.
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy, a former professional soccer player, admits to admiring
many of de Bruin's qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's tough, smart, resourceful, and guilty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy accuses the national broadcaster, Radio Telefis Eireann,
as being the most egregious of mythmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``RTE drove the hype machine,'' said Dunphy. ``RTE never
mentioned in its coverage that her husband and trainer was a banned
athlete, that he had used the sort of performance-enhancing drugs
that she was suspected of using. They ran this crap about how Erik
de Bruin had miraculously transformed her into one of the greatest
swimmers of all time, but they somehow forgot to tell the Irish
people that Erik de Bruin was a cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of questioning de Bruin, many questioned the
integrity of Dunphy, Humphries, and Kimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mirror called me a rat,'' said Dunphy. ``Some of the other
papers called Tom and Paul worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The response of potential sponsors was more telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the sponsorship deals Michelle expected never
materialized,'' said Dunphy. ``Corporate Ireland never got behind
her. They, like us, smelled a rat.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all came crashing down on Jan. 10, 1998, when Al and Kay Guy,
a couple who perform drug testing on Irish athletes, came to the de
Bruin home in Kilkenny. When the urine sample was tested, it was
found to contain enough whiskey to kill an elephant. In August
1998, swimming's world governing body imposed a four-year ban on de
Bruin for tampering with a urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   De Bruin appealed the finding to the Court of Arbitration for
Sport in Switzerland, whose findings included the fact that a
steroid, androstenedione, was found in three samples taken from de
Bruin between August 1997 and March 1998. The court also rejected
as unfounded de Bruin's claim that someone else had tampered with
her sample. The court said de Bruin ``was the only person who had
the motive and opportunity to manipulate the sample.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of Ireland's heroes died for their country, Humphries
says de Bruin lied for it. Humphries, who is in Sydney covering the
Games for the Irish Times, believes the de Bruin affair has
irrevocably tarnished sports in Ireland, and he is disturbed that a
generation or more of Irish girls will be trying to beat the
records of someone who used drugs to become the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no cleaner or dirtier than anyone else,'' Humphries
concluded. ``Our innocence has been stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   De Bruin is a late bloomer. In a sport dominated by teenagers,
she became a champion at 26. She will enter law school this month
as a 30-year-old. Her lawyer says she is appalled that the opening
of the Sydney Games has triggered so many negative references to
her case.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon says he and his client believe recent allegations that a
widespread use of drugs by American athletes was overlooked proves
there is a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come from a powerful country, you get a rap on the
knuckles,'' said Lennon. ``If you're like Michelle, and you come
from a small country like Ireland that is not supposed to win these
medals, they go after you with a vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she is innocent. Or perhaps she only believes she is
innocent. Or maybe, just maybe, being Irish, Michelle Smith de
Bruin knows that in Ireland, like South Boston, they will make you
and break you but never forsake you. They did it to Charles Stewart
Parnell, the 19th century home rule leader, throwing lime in his
face when he courted a married woman. They did it to the leaders of
the Easter Rising in 1916, spitting on them before the British
executed them.
</P>
<P>
   In Ireland, the begrudgers love to build you up to tear you
down, but in the end, they almost always come around.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, they almost always wait until you're dead.

   Tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Plantagenet?
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence is one thing, but who knew that ``Monday Night
Football'' viewers would need Regis Philbin to watch a game?
</P>
<P>
   Where in the name of George Carlin did Dennis Miller dig up that
little kernel?
</P>
<P>
   For those not keeping track, the House of Plantagenet started
their rule of Britain in 1154 with Henry II and ended in 1400 with
Richard II. Their rule was characterized by internal feuding, like
the Hatfields and McCoys, and Miller was trying to make the simple
point that there was bad blood between the Jets and Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   In case that analogy didn't work, Miller threw out a shot at
popular rapper Eminem and his much-publicized divorce. Ppphheewww.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Miller knows that sort of stuff. He might want
to host a new game show, ``Guess What I'm Talking About.''
</P>
<P>
   And what was that followup joke in Miller's opening? You
remember the one about the game being decided by whoever had ``the
best Woody''? Get it? The Jets owner's name is Woody Johnson and
the Patriots have center Damien Woody.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. People are talking about ``Monday Night Football''
again, and that is a good thing, at least according to Don
Ohlmeyer, the show's executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between Miller's jokes about Sigmund Freud and his
calling the referee Alfred Hitchcock, the first half ended, and
with the exception of an occasional observation by analyst Dan
Fouts, no one in the ABC booth told viewers just why the game was
pretty boring up till that point.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way. The halftime piece narrated by Chris Berman on
classic NFL hits, though probably seen thousands of times before,
was the most entertaining thing in the first 90 minutes of the
telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing the fellas in the booth could do about that _ except
maybe tell us why. Instead viewers received pieces of irrelevant
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the fact that the Patriots had penetrated inside the
20-yard line four times in the first half and came away with only
field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts stepped up to the plate on several fairly obvious points.
Jets linebacker James Farrior blitzed in the second quarter and
hurdled Kevin Faulk to drill Drew Bledsoe in the back for a sack.
``You have to stay high when you are pass-blocking,'' said Fouts,
pointing out that Faulk tried to block Farrior below his knees.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, when Antonio Langham missed an
interception and allowed Wayne Chrebet to score what turned out to
be the winning touchdown, Fouts screamed, ``You gotta make that
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   That was as good as it got. When Miller talked about Adam
Vinatieri missing on his fifth field goal attempt, Fouts actually
said on national television: ``That's why they call the game
football, Dennis. You have to kick the ball through the uprights.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Jerry Glanville would come up with something that lame.
</P>
<P>
   With everyone focused on Miller, the real key is the other new
man in the booth, Fouts. Through three exhibitions and two
regular-season games, Fouts has been just all right. By all
accounts, he was one of the most respected players when he
quarterbacked the San Diego Chargers. He is also considered a great
guy.
</P>
<P>
   But this is football, and more than in any other sport, opinions
_ and strong ones at that, based on facts _ are what matter.
Ohlmeyer said he has talked with Fouts about being ``more
opinionated,'' but that has proven to be a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Even with facts, Fouts has been selective. During last week's
game between the Rams and Broncos, Fouts said that St. Louis
quarterback Kurt Warner had thrown five interceptions in the Red
Zone last year. But he neglected to mention that Warner threw only
13 interceptions altogether and had one of the lowest interception
percentages (2.6) in the league.
</P>
<P>
   And Fouts's opinions are questionable. In the fourth quarter
Monday night, the Patriots were driving once again into the Red
Zone. Fouts suggested that they should run the ball on third and 4
to get better position for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Patriots set up without a running back, and
passed to Faulk for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Ooops.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots scored a touchdown two plays later, so instead of
going up by 8 points, as Fouts figured they would if they ran the
ball, they went up 19-7.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything was bad. The camera attached to the referee's cap
was excellent, enabling viewers to see the game from field level.
Having Michael Douglas visit the booth was a good thing. Not giving
him a microphone was inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   And, for whatever it's worth, Damien Woody was taken out of the
game with an injury in the fourth quarter.

A DUEL OF CUBA'S BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the place where they once were considered on a par
with the best who ever pitched, this game went mostly unseen.
</P>
<P>
   But the fanaticos will know. They always do. Someone on the
island will rig up a radio antenna, or pick up a signal on an
illegal satellite dish fashioned from kitchen appliances and old
carburetors.
</P>
<P>
   A box score will be transcribed from the play by play, then
passed from hand to hand, one village to the next. It may take a
day or two, but in the end they will all know that Rolando Arrojo
beat El Duque Monday night in Yankee Stadium, 4-0, in a game that
kept Red Sox postseason hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Arrojo wore a Red Sox uniform, and Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez was decked out in pinstripes, they can never
belong to Boston and New York. Not when there are so many back in
Cuba who remember their epic duels from the life they left behind,
when Arrojo pitched for Viella Clara and El Duque was the ace for
Los Industriales of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, they won more than 300 games. ``When they pitched
against each other in the playoffs,'' said journalist Steve
Fainaru, the former Globe staffer who is writing a book on
Hernandez, ``it was like Seaver against Gibson.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fainaru's comment was translated to him after the game,
Arrojo did not disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teams met five times in the playoffs,'' he said, with
teammate Rich Garces acting as translator. ``I think he won two and
I won two. They were all great games. One game I pitched a
two-hitter against him, and lost, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like being in the movies, the two best actors in the
same movie. It was always a great show.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo was the first to leave the island, stealing away in the
dead of night from a hotel in Albany, Ga., where the Cuban national
team was staying prior to the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who had been teammates with Arrojo on the national
team, followed later, navigating the straits of Florida to find
refuge in Miami. Both found riches in their new homeland, Arrojo
receiving $7 million to sign with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, El
Duque $6.5 million to become a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's so complicated for all of these guys,'' said Milton
Jamail, University of Texas professor of political science and
author of ``Full Count: Inside Cuban Baseball.'' ``They're real
patriots, even though they leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In Yankee Stadium, this went beyond countrymen pitching against
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is my best friend in baseball,'' Arrojo said of El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   While warming up before the game, the friends met briefly in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wished each other good luck,'' said Arrojo. ``I said to
him, `Let's both have a good game today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who has had elbow problems and last month endured a
four-game losing streak, pitched well. He gave up a leadoff walk to
Trot Nixon and a home run to Jose Offerman to begin the game, then
a single and two-run home run to Manny ``Friend of Sammy''
Alexander in the second.
</P>
<P>
   He then retired 10 in a row until Offerman walked with two out
in the fifth, and got out of a bases-loaded jam in the sixth by
striking out Jason Varitek and Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   But this night, Arrojo was better. Nixon made a leaping grab at
the wall to take away Tino Martinez's bid for extra bases with Paul
O'Neill on first to end the first inning. The Yankees would not
advance a runner to third all night, Arrojo finally leaving with
two on and one out in the eighth, when he walked David Justice and
gave up a bloop single to Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   But closer Derek Lowe induced O'Neill to tap into an
inning-ending double play, and the Red Sox avoided a two-city sweep
against the Yanks, salvaging one here after losing three straight
to the Bombers in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, who allowed just five hits while whiffing seven, is now
5-2 since being acquired by the Sox at the end of July. It helped,
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said, that Arrojo did not shake off
catcher Varitek the way he did in his last start last Wednesday
against the A's, one in which he lasted just three innings and took
a 6-4 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what was huge tonight?'' Kerrigan said. ``When we had
the bases loaded with one out (in the sixth) and didn't score, you
could feel the momentum shifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then Arrojo came out that inning and shut them down. He's
comfortable in that situation. He's comfortable in the spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   They already knew that in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque knew, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to congratulate him on a great performance,'' he
said in the Yankees' clubhouse. ``We have pitched against each
other many times. How many? I'm not sure.''

TROUBLE BY THE SACKFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New England Patriots' offense is on
pace to give up 96 sacks this season. That's all you need to know
about it for now.
</P>
<P>
   Six sacks a week ago and a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Six sacks Monday night and a heartbreaking loss.
</P>
<P>
   Six sacks a game and you beat as many teams as the Patriots have
beaten so far this season. You beat none.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Patriots had no business being in position to
defeat Tampa Bay at the end of a six-sack debacle. But there they
were at the Buccaneers' 22-yard line with the clock running out and
a chance to steal a win they didn't deserve staring at them. They
didn't do it. Six sacks and endless pressure on Drew Bledsoe were
the reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   They controlled the tempo and the field for 57 1/2 of the 60
minutes they played against the New York Jets, but they couldn't
protect their quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the Patriots couldn't score in the Red Zone
and, in the end, as good as their defense supposedly is, it
couldn't do what Tampa Bay's did a week earlier either. It couldn't
hold its ground with the game on the line, and the Patriots'
offensive line couldn't hold its ground and so they lost again.
Lost a game they did deserve, 20-19, to fall to 0-2 with emphasis
on the word ``fall.''
</P>
<P>
   With 9:56 to play, the Patriots held a 19-7 lead despite having
driven inside the Jets' 20 six times. They had the lead and had
Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde baffled.
</P>
<P>
   But when it counted most, the Patriots collapsed on both sides
of the ball, which is what troubled teams do.
</P>
<P>
   With the game on the line, a defense that likes to call itself
great gave up back-to-back touchdown drives of 85 yards in 10 plays
and 72 yards in two plays. The Jets' offense walked over the backs
of New England's supposedly great defense with Testaverde finding
tiny Wayne Chrebet for touchdown passes of 2 and 28 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The last touchdown pass came one play after fellow receiver
Dedric Ward hauled in a 44-yard reception despite blanket coverage
by Ty Law, a catch former teammate Keyshawn Johnson would have been
proud to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   The defense the Patriots thought they could rely on had cracked
the way Tampa Bay's had not. When it counted most, the Buccaneers'
defense held a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   When it counted most, the Patriots' defense split open like an
over-ripe melon and it was suddenly 20-19 Jets with 1:55 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was ample time for New England to pull this game
out with a fifth Adam Vinatieri field goal, but the Patriots didn't
because they spent most of the time remaining pulling their
quarterback off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Incomplete pass under pressure on first down.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe knocked flat by rookies Shaun Ellis and John Abraham on
second down for a 6-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   Incomplete under duress on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe knocked flat on fourth down by Abraham again after the
rookie blew past left tackle Bruce Armstrong and ran over the
Patriots' weary quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Six sacks, just like a week ago. Four sacks in the final two
drives of the day. Six times 16 equals 96. Six times 16 also equals
a disaster in the making.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of what happened are clear: When the Patriots needed
to answer on offense, they couldn't because their quarterback was
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   When they needed to answer on defense, they couldn't because
they couldn't put Testaverde on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Football is a simple game when played the way it is being played
by the Patriots. You keep your quarterback upright, you win. You
get him knocked flat six times, you don't.
</P>
<P>
   You can talk all day about time of possession and how at one
point the Patriots had an advantage of nearly 14 minutes in that
critical category.
</P>
<P>
   You can talk about how they dominated the Jets for much of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   You can talk about how they were still in position to beat the
Buccaneers and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   You can talk about how they are 0-2 by an average of just 3
points per loss.
</P>
<P>
   You can talk about a lot of things if you want, but that's all
it would be. Talk.

LATE CHANGE IN FORMATION TURNED THE TIDE FOR JETS 
</HEADLINE>

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This is a game neither team will forget
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets, looking hopelessly beaten for 45 minutes,
rallied for two fourth-quarter touchdowns by a guy who wasn't
supposed to play.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Chrebet made a series of incredible catches in the fourth
period, two for touchdowns, including the winner with 1:55 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Just 24 hours earlier, the Jets didn't think Chrebet was going
to be able to play. On Saturday, he injured a calf muscle in
practice without being hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't even practicing in pads,'' said Jets coach Al Groh.
``He went up to catch a pass and landed awkwardly and he came away
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, in the team hotel a few miles away from Giants
Stadium, Chrebet was icing his injured leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt that he will be able to play,'' Groh said at the time.
``It doesn't look good. But we really won't know until kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet played, but for the first 45 minutes of this strange
game, he looked out of it like the rest of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots led, 19-7, with less than 10 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of one drive in the second period, Bill Belichick's
brilliantly conceived game plan was being executed to
near-perfection by his team.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the fourth period, the Patriots had controlled the
ball for more than 28 minutes, 12 more than the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   In the second and third periods, the Jets had the ball in
Patriots territory for just five seconds. Not five plays. One play
for five seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' offense couldn't do a thing. Quarterback Vinny
Testaverde appeared confused by the Patriot secondary. He hurried
some throws and wasn't quite sure what to do with others.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense tried to contain the Jets' outstanding
runner, Curtis Martin, and force Testaverde to try to beat it
through the air.
</P>
<P>
   It worked well, but only for 50 minutes. Completely frustrated,
the Jets went from their regular offensive formations, into an
``empty nest'' formation, where the running back lines up on the
flank.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Jets came alive. Testaverde rediscovered Chrebet,
and the two made beautiful music.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the final minutes, they sliced the Patriots' spread-out
defense with beautiful throws and catches. And by being spread out
on defense, and forced to cover rather than charge, the Patriots
collapsed and lost a game they deserved to win.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did everything to win. They did not have a single
turnover. No fumbles. No interceptions, despite Drew Bledsoe
throwing 43 passes. They ran the ball surprisingly well, and
effectively, keeping the Jets honest. Through the first three
periods, the Patriots made almost all of the key third-down plays
on both sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense got Testaverde &AMP; Co. off the field in a
hurry. The Jets' defense couldn't do the same with Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   But then it all changed with the ``empty nest.'' It wasn't that
the Patriots' defense left receivers wide open, but rather that
Testaverde, who was wild with his pitches all night, made a number
of perfect throws, and Chrebet, with no sign of a limp or gimp, did
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   This is a game the Jets can build on the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   This is a game the Patriots hope they can rebound from, to get
ready for an undefeated Minnesota Viking team at Foxborough next
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy.

TRANSMETA HOLDS OUT ON BENCHMARKS FOR NEW CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SANTA CLARA, CALIF. _ There are lies, damn lies. And then
there are benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story about semiconductor benchmarks, those fickle
numbers that are supposed to tell us how computer chips stack up
against one another. Think of it as an Olympic decathlon in which
the contestants are Pentiums, Athlons, PowerPCs, Alphas, and
Celerons _ chips that crunch squillions of instructions and act as
the ``brains'' of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The newest athlete on the field is the Crusoe, a chip made by
Transmeta Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   What's so special about the Crusoe? Transmeta claims the chip
consumes far less power than its competitors, thereby conserving
precious battery life. Anyone whose laptop has run out of juice in
the middle of a task, with no power plug in sight, knows the value
of this.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this fall, consumers will start to see the Crusoe
processor in ultra-light laptops and other types of portable
computers made by Sony, Gateway, IBM, Fujitsu, NEC, and Hitachi.
</P>
<P>
   Sony next month will come out with a notebook computer with a
600-megahertz Crusoe processor. It will have roughly double the
battery life of Sony's previous model, which has a 400-megahertz
Pentium II processor made by Intel Corp. The new 2.2-pound Sony
VAIO PictureBook can run up to 5.5 hours on a standard lithium-ion
battery, as opposed to up to 2.5 hours on the older machine.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is what Sony, an investor in Transmeta, is
claiming. There is no reason to doubt Sony. It's just that few
outside of Transmeta's circle truly know how good the Crusoe is. To
wit, there exist no independent testing _ or benchmarking _
comparing the Crusoe to its rivals, particularly the Pentium made
by Intel, the heavyweight champion of the chip industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal that they haven't allowed us to evaluate any
units,'' said Kevin Krewell, senior analyst at MicroDesign
Resources in Sunnyvale, Calif. ``They make a lot of claims, but
there's no way we can verify those claims.''
</P>
<P>
   You would think Transmeta would be eager to show the world how
well the Crusoe performs in the industry's decathlon, so to speak.
But Transmeta has so far boycotted the event, arguing that current
benchmarks aren't suited to the Crusoe. Instead, it is quietly
lobbying independent testing labs to introduce new benchmarks that
will measure Crusoe's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, Crusoe is less power-hungry than other chips, and
the Pentium tends to perform slightly faster, even under
Transmeta's internal tests. It comes down to speed versus battery
life, and Transmeta officials argue that current benchmarks give
too much weight to speed and not enough to power usage.
</P>
<P>
   In a white paper on the topic, Daniel McKenna of Transmeta
writes that ``traditional benchmarks are inadequate to address the
requirements of the new mobile computing paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Intel also has something to say on this topic.
</P>
<P>
   George Alfs, Intel's programs manager, argues that benchmarks
shouldn't change just to show off a new chip design. They should
change only to reflect new ways people use their computers, such as
surfing the Internet or playing digital video discs, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benchmarks should reflect the work people do on their
computers,'' Alfs said. ``You don't want to change the benchmarks
just to make someone's hardware look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that so bad?
</P>
<P>
   No, says Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies Inc., a
technology consulting firm in Campbell, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens all the time in our industry,'' Bajarin said.
``When a new category comes along, the old rules often don't apply.
So it's up to the newcomer to try to introduce some new rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, independent chip testers such as MicroDesign
Resources and Ziff-Davis Laboratories will have to wait until the
fall to get their hands on the Crusoe to publish their own test
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benchmarking is an art to some extent,'' said Krewell, who
admits that Transmeta has little to lose by holding out. ``It can
be manipulated and misused. But at its best, it does give some
indication of relative performance. At least that's what we hope
for _ we hope for the best. And then it's up to customers to make
the right choice.''

ANTIVIRUS RESEARCHERS FEND OFF HOSTILE PALM PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before viruses and Trojan horse
programs began to target those popular pocket computers from Palm
Inc. So the recent announcement of a hostile Palm program called
Liberty came as no surprise to Carey Nachenberg, chief antivirus
researcher at Symantec Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing research on the Palm platform for quite
awhile,'' said Nachenberg, whose company is one of several that
have introduced software to fend off Liberty. ``The problem was if
you produce an antivirus software for a product that doesn't have
viruses, you almost coax the virus writers into writing one.'' So
Symantec held off until a real threat appeared.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in late August, when the Swedish developer of a
Palm-based game called Liberty deliberately created a Trojan horse
version of the product. This version would destroy all data stored
on the device. The developer of the program said he never intended
for his program to become publicly available, but it did, thereby
becoming the first known case of a destructive program written
especially for the Palm. And it gave Nachenberg the green light to
develop a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Nachenberg admits that the Liberty program is relatively
harmless. After all, most Palm users have copies of their data
stored on their desktop computers. But he warned that as palmtops
and cell phones become more sophisticated, they will inevitably
fall prey to a cascade of new attack software.
</P>
<P>
   Today's cell phones, for instance, are fairly dumb devices. But
there are already phones that use the Palm operating system. That
would make them smart enough to run dangerous programs. Imagine
10,000 cell phones all dialing 911 at the same moment. That's the
sort of think Nachenberg and his colleagues are preparing for.
``It's really an arms race,'' he said, ``between the antivirus
(programmers) and the virus writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies around the world use the RSA encryption algorithm to
protect their data from snoops. Now the patent on the code has
expired and Bedford-based RSA Security Inc. faces a horde of
competitors who can sell RSA-based data security products of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news for RSA? Not really. ``That was a very small portion of
our business,'' said RSA spokesman Steve Casey. While the RSA
algorithm is embedded in many of its products, direct sales and
licensing fees for the algorithm brought in only about $500,000
last year, compared to total revenues of $218 million. Casey said
that RSA makes most of its money by selling its own customized
implementations of the algorithm, and that the company is prepared
to compete with all comers.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Schneier, president of the encryption consulting firm
Counterpane Internet Security Inc., agrees that the expiration of
the RSA patent is no big deal. But he says it's because so many
encryption users have standardized around other algorithms whose
patents expired years ago. ``None of the standards are RSA,'' said
Schneier. For instance, Pretty Good Privacy, perhaps the most
famous encryption program, uses the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, which
expired three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' said Schneier, ``it's a really big non-event.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy duty Unix operating system and its upstart younger
brother Linux have a reputation for being more secure than
mass-market software like Microsoft Windows. But that doesn't mean
they're perfect. Last week saw announcements of newly discovered
security flaws in Unix and Linux that could serve as catnip to
ambitious computer vandals.
</P>
<P>
   The SecurityFocus Web site (www.securityfocus.org) reports on a
newly discovered exploit that uses the printing functions of Unix
or Linux machines to trick them into running subversive commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been known for quite a while,'' said SecurityFocus
chief technology officer Elias Levy. ``It wasn't until the last two
or three months that we saw an increase in the number of security
problems that were found.'' Levy said major Unix software vendors
like Sun Microsystems Inc. were working on patches to repair the
bug. ``Most of the Linux vendors have done so already,'' he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ANDOVER, Mass. _ Over the last year, as Lucent
Technologies stock has plunged roughly 50 percent, the
gallows-humor line has been that Lucent's famed red swirl logo
symbolized its lifeblood going down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   But the world's largest telecommunications company is fighting
its way back, jettisoning its slow-growing office network
installation business and taking other steps to sharpen its focus
on advanced communications gear, especially optical devices.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the company's more promising new initiatives is
taking shape here at its landmark Merrimack Valley plant, a 2
million-square-foot behemoth whose heritage dates back five decades
to its Western Electric days making phone switches.
</P>
<P>
   The North Andover plant is where Lucent is developing a new
product called the LambdaRouter, an all-optical switching device
that, in a single refrigerator-sized box, could move 10 times as
much traffic as now passes through the entire Internet, or 10.2
trillion bits of data per second.
</P>
<P>
   How big a market the product might find remains unclear. Even
some of Lucent's severest critics, though, acknowledge that the
Lambda project has the potential to revive Lucent's tattered image
as an innovator and market leader.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's woes, including projections of lower than expected
earnings this quarter, are of more than passing interest in
Massachusetts. The state has more than 9,000 Lucent employees, the
third-largest US cluster after New Jersey and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3 1/2 years after it was spun off from AT&AMP;T, Lucent stock
soared 11-fold, giving the company ample currency to go on a buying
binge that included the acquisition of seven Bay State companies
since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Those include Excel Switching of Hyannis, Nexabit Networks of
Marlborough, Kenan Systems of Cambridge, and Spring Tide Networks
of Maynard, companies whose businesses span most of the range of
telecommunications boxes and software.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year, while its $43 billion in revenues still
represented the largest share of the $200 billion global
communications-gear market, Lucent stock has been hammered amid
repeated warnings it would miss earnings forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent remains a leader in wireless equipment and many other
telecom categories. But it has been widely seen as lagging behind
Nortel Networks in catching the hot optical market, and behind
Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks in selling Internet routers,
while struggling to prevent a ``brain drain'' of talent from the
start-ups it has acquired.
</P>
<P>
   With the world's communications networks groaning under the load
of exploding Internet traffic, a major quest for the industry is
developing purely optical switches and routers that move data
streams without converting them into electricity, which can create
bottlenecks on Net superhighways.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent earlier this summer recorded its first revenue sales of
the Lambda device, to a phone carrier that declines to be
identified, and it has begun ramping up a 100-worker production
line at the 5,600-person North Andover factory to crank out the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   While Lucent for now can claim to be at the front of the pack,
it faces certain competition from other companies building
all-optical switches. Two of them, Nortel's Xros unit and Calient
Networks of Silicon Valley, plan to ship their products as early as
next year.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers say its rapid development of the Lambda
device from a brainstorm at Lucent's famed Bell Labs research
center into a revenue-generating product represents a success for
the company, perhaps as important for symbolism as for sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few recent technology decisions that they did
make right,'' said Steve Saunders, editor of the online optical
networking newsletter LightReading, which has been withering in its
critical coverage of Lucent and has portrayed its top management as
bungling bullies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's Lucent getting ahead in a market early and playing to
the strengths of Bell Labs,'' Saunders said. ``The LambdaRouter is
definitely one of the few bright spots for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts and competitors are less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Clavenna, a leading optical industry consultant who
recently left Pioneer Consulting LLC in Cambridge to start his own
business called PointEast Research, said, ``The LambdaRouter is a
good product, and they deserve credit for commercializing it
quickly. But I see it having a fairly limited opportunity in the
market. It's not going to be a billion-dollar product line.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rick Thompson, director of product marketing with Sycamore
Networks in Chelmsford, a rapidly growing optical networking
start-up, sniffed: ``I really look at it as more of a science
project. There's not really much application for it in the network
in its current state.''
</P>
<P>
   The guts of the Lambda machine are two devices the size of a
postage stamp that each contain 256 mirrors. Each of the mirrors,
no bigger than the dot on top of this i, can redirect traffic from
one fiber-optic strand to another. Within a year, Lucent expects to
increase capacity to over 1,000 mirrors, something both Xros and
Calient promise to deliver as well.
</P>
<P>
   One huge advantage is that the device does not care whether
traffic headed from, say, Boston to London is coming in at 45
megabits or 40 gigabits per second; it simply switches it over to
the outbound fiber line by bouncing it off a little mirror aimed to
within thousandths of a degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a model of how we hope to get products to market
faster than we ever have,'' said Mike Kahl, a senior Lucent
production executive at Merrimack Valley. ``It's central to being
in the leadership role of optical. We expect this to be a real
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   One limitation is that, for the near term, the device will have
limited capability to manage traffic beyond redirecting it.
</P>
<P>
   It can be compared to a system for moving luggage through an
airport: It gets bags from one airplane to another in less than the
blink of an eye, without needing to run them through a sorting
room, but for now has virtually no way of checking to make sure the
bags are not damaged and no way of quickly verifying to an airline
manager that they made it to the right plane.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Sycamore's Thompson said ``we are not losing
sleep over this'' because his company remains convinced carriers
want switches that incorporate traffic-managing software, even if
traffic has to pass through an electrical router.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's Merrimack Valley plant produces virtually everything
used in a fiber-optic network except the fiber lines themselves,
including ``multiplexers'' that cram 80 wavelengths of light and
someday soon as many as 160 wavelengths on a fiber that once may
have carried only a single channel.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five months, according to Michael Jones, Lucent's
manufacturing vice president, the plant has tripled its ability to
produce the 10-gigabit modules where Nortel has a commanding lead.
It plans to double capacity again by the end of the year through
better organizing production schedules.
</P>
<P>
   But, he acknowledged, ``It's still not enough. It still (limits)
our ability to sell a lot of products. As much material as we can
find to bring here, we can find demand to ship against.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent executives note that, for all the inroads made by Nortel
and others, Lucent remains the only company that can boast it is
number one or number two in four main categories of optical
communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has already seen some dirty laundry from the North
Andover plant aired in a bitterly contested trade-secret lawsuit it
filed against 10 employees who defected to a new 2,500-person Cisco
optical factory being built in Salem, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, who have been assisted by Cisco in their
defense, charged Lucent with everything from gender discrimination
and tyrannical treatment of employees at North Andover to
widespread toleration of shoddy workmanship to hustle products out
the door. Lucent has denied all these charges.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to archrival Cisco Systems, which like Lucent has been
on a buying binge of promising start-ups in Massachusetts and
elsewhere, Lucent has been seen as doing a poor job of
incorporating talent into the company and staving off a ``brain
drain'' once entrepreneurs cash in their Lucent stock.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, for example, Lucent spent $900 million buying terabit
router maker Nexabit Networks of Marlborough last June, only to see
its founder leave within a year to open an optical-networking
start-up literally across the street from Nexabit, with several of
his former employees moving with him.
</P>
<P>
   Vast swaths of upper management at the former Cascade
Communications in Westford bailed out after Lucent bought Cascade
successor Ascend Communications for nearly $20 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cascade alumni have since founded or become senior executives at
several hot start-ups, including Sycamore Networks and Unisphere
Solutions in Chelmsford, Sonus Networks of Westford, and Equipe
Communications in Acton _ a talent pool that could have done
wonders for Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to work at Lucent?'' said one Cascade veteran who is
now a top executive of a start-up and asked not to be named,
reflecting widespread disenchantment with Lucent's corporate
culture.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, however, that Lucent has begun tapping
entrepreneurial-minded executives at companies it has acquired to
take larger roles in turning around the organization. Both of its
top optical officials, for example, come from smaller start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Akers, founder and chief technical officer of Spring
Tide Networks, a network-management devices maker that Lucent
bought earlier this summer for $1.3 billion, will become chief
technical officer for Lucent's entire data networking division as
part of that deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the new job, Akers will oversee the lashing together of
products from the former Cascade and Nexabit as well as a
half-dozen other divisions making everything from digital
subscriber line gear to dial-up modems and converged switches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent has a tremendous amount of technology and a lot of
smart people, and they have a really good Internet-protocol
strategy,'' Akers said recently. ``I think we really just need to
get the message out about what we have. I think Lucent has pretty
much gotten a bad rap.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging it will be a shift moving from a 150-person
start-up, Akers said being able to put the famed Lucent brand and
logo on his Spring Tide devices ``is a large benefit to us'' in
gaining credibility in the market and sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to being an engineer,'' Akers said. ``You're
excited at seeing your product reach its full potential. That's
what we can do with Lucent.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They were the new generation at the oldest mutual fund firm in
the business.
</P>
<P>
   It was the late 1980s and they were barely 30 years old _
hotshot stock analysts and fund managers at MFS Investment
Management. They spent their Friday evenings at a Back Bay watering
hole called Montana's, talking about the market, their company, and
how things would run if they were in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, they were in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a tremendous sense of possibility,'' says Kevin
Parke, one of the wunderkind crowd, now 40 and chief equity officer
at MFS.
</P>
<P>
   The boss, chief executive Jeff Shames, 45, recalls, ``We were
the kiddie corps.'' When he became equity chief at 32, he says, ``I
had never managed anyone in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he and his colleagues have managed to turn a historically
significant but slow-moving investment shop into a top-10 fund firm
that's quadrupled in size since 1995, to $160 billion. They have
ridden the growth-investing boom to the big time. Now they talk and
worry about the challenges of becoming a big company, about the
stock market _ and taking MFS public.
</P>
<P>
   MFS, with about $1.5 billion in annual revenue, is on track to
earn nearly $170 million this year. The Boston mutual fund group
accounts for nearly one-third of the earnings of its parent, Sun
Life Financial Services of Canada. And executives of both companies
are talking more about a public stock that reflects MFS's
significant value.
</P>
<P>
   Shames estimates that the company, one of the industry's fastest
growers since 1998, could be worth $5 billion to $7 billion in an
IPO. If the market put a more lavish premium on it, akin to recent
buyout prices for investment firms, the price could rise as high as
$9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Life, Canada's biggest life insurer, would make out
handsomely in such a deal. It bought MFS for a mere $55 million in
1982. And for the managers of MFS, who already own 22 percent of
the company, it would mean greater incentives to stay aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would ultimately like to have some piece of us go public,''
Shames says. ``We're active in that discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject is more front-and-center than ever before now that
Sun Life itself is a public company. It demutualized and sold
shares in October, and its stock has risen 139 percent, to $20.31.
Though the company's headquarters is in Toronto, the stock trades
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   That's not half bad for an insurance stock in a year that's
favored technology companies, analysts say. But the pressure will
now be on Sun Life to show investors it's reaping the full value of
MFS. The firm's private shares, held by its managers, have risen in
value fivefold in three years, Shames says, based on a formula of
asset growth, profits, and revenue.
</P>
<P>
   There's a potentially huge pot of gold awaiting the top managers
of MFS, a strange irony for a place that has long boasted more
about its culture than its compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for individual glory, go somewhere else,''
Shames says. ``If you want the biggest paycheck, go to Fidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that MFS doesn't like stars. It does, from John Ballen,
41, who succeeded Shames as president and runs the firm's popular
Emerging Growth fund, to Maura Shaughnessy, manager of one of the
best utility funds in the nation and of the Capital Opportunities,
another big seller.
</P>
<P>
   Two MFS stars quit last year, breaking a long tradition of
minuscule turnover. John Brennan and Chris Felipe, part of the
Montana's crew and what Shames calls the MFS ``youth movement'' of
1987, quit to start their own hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still too early to tell what the impact is of losing
Felipe and Brennan,'' said Sarah Bush, mutual fund editor for
Morningstar Inc.'s adviser Web site. ``One of the reasons it seems
not to have hurt the shop is that they really do have a very deep
analyst bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation is part of the mantra at MFS. Fund managers' bonuses
depend in part on how helpful they are to analysts. In this
research-driven culture, Shames says, it's not enough to simply
post solid returns on your fund and hide in your office. Managers
and analysts are expected to take an active interest in all sectors
of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gets carried away with their own self worth,'' Shames
says. The firm enjoys a reputation across Boston and the industry
as a great place for investment pros to work. Shames seems to care
about that more than most CEOs: ``If it's not fun, the success part
isn't as worthwhile,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, there's nothing more fun than managing money.
``It's a blast every day, being a money manager,'' he says. Shames
and his colleagues want to hang on to their small-company culture.
And that's getting harder.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday meetings of the executive committee take not just a
couple of hours, but nearly all day. MFS is expanding its
international investment capabilities, whereas in the mid-1990s, it
hired an outside firm to run non-US funds. It wants to gain market
share outside its core growth area, especially in value funds. And
it's working to do more investing for institutions, such as pension
funds and corporate 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been out of the institutional business for 20 years,''
Shames says. Now the firm has 120 people working on the sector,
plus $30 billion of assets, up from $2 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Shames spends much of his time worrying about whether people are
happy at MFS, which now has 3,000 employees at 500 Boylston St. and
at Downtown Crossing, plus offices in London, Tokyo and Singapore.
It's about to open a Phoenix office for 900 new employees, because
space is so tight in Boston. And the quarterly employee meetings
with Shames that used to take place in a lunch room now are held a
block away, in an auditorium at the John Hancock Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the analyst at heart, Shames tries to see into the future
of MFS. He worries about the stock market falling after this long
bull run. And he mulls how to avoid the pitfalls of success. ``It's
great to be where we are,'' Shames says. ``The big thing is the
growth _ managing the growth.''

<P>
   The federal government lost what may be a key battle in the drug
war last week over doctor-recommended use of marijuana for medical
purposes. The federal government deserved to lose.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup for the
Northern District of California issued a permanent injunction
forbidding the government from threatening California doctors for
recommending medical marijuana to their patients (Dr. Marcus Conant
v. Barry R. McCaffrey).
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, the
Compassionate Use Act or Medical Marijuana Initiative. The law
states, in part, that ``seriously ill Californians have the right
to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical
use is deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician
who has determined that the person's health would benefit from the
use of marijuana in the treatment of cancer, anorexias, AIDS,
chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any
other illness for which marijuana provides relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 215 specifically protects physicians who recommend
marijuana: ``(No) physician in this state shall be punished, or
denied any right or privilege for having recommended marijuana to a
patient for medical purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Drug Czar Barry R. McCaffrey's claims to the contrary,
doctors across the nation have found that marijuana is a very
effective anti-nausea drug, stimulates appetite and takes the
cutting edge off cancer and other pain _ with few side effects.
</P>
<P>
   A mere two months after Proposition 215 was passed, the Office
of National Drug Control Policy issued the Clinton administration's
official response: ``a practitioner's action of recommending or
prescribing Schedule I controlled substances is not consistent with
the `public interest' and will lead to administrative action by the
Drug Enforcement Administration to revoke the practitioner's
registration.'' The response also stated that the U.S. Department
of Justice would review cases for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, like peyote and
heroin. Schedule I drugs do not have established medical value.
Therefore, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Justice
and McCaffrey began threatening to take away doctors' ability to
dispense medical drugs if those same doctors recommended medical
marijuana to their patients _ despite California's law.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is ample evidence that the Clinton administration
fashioned its punitive response after California and Arizona had
each passed medical marijuana initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after California's Proposition 215 took effect, a
DEA agent began investigating Robert Mastroianni, a physician in
Pollock Pines, because he had allegedly written a marijuana
recommendation for one of his patients. This action by the DEA
stopped most doctors from talking freely to their patients about
the use of medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors filed a class action lawsuit in a federal district
court against McCaffrey and federal government drug agencies. The
point of the doctors' original lawsuit is that drug agencies were
interfering in the doctor-patient relationship and keeping doctors
from giving patients their best medical advice. The lawsuit asked
for a temporary injunction against the government _ to halt the
unwarranted harassment of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors won that lawsuit on April 30, 1997, but the terms
laid out by U.S. District Court Judge Fern M. Smith weren't clear
enough to protect the doctors from further harassment.
</P>
<P>
   So the doctors went to court again and asked that the temporary
injunction be made permanent and urged the court to define the
terms of allowable communication more clearly. The doctors sought a
clear demarcation line that says a doctor can recommend medical
marijuana to a patient without being in jeopardy of retaliatory
action by the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   However, doctors cannot dispense or prescribe marijuana for the
patient without falling outside the law. The doctors did not seek
the authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The new ruling does just what the doctors hoped it would. It
permits California doctors to recommend the use of medical
marijuana and enter it on the patient's charts without worrying
about being penalized.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union's attorneys, representing
doctors and patients, crafted their brief carefully so that it
raised a First Amendment issue only. Can doctors speak freely to
their patients without drug agents interfering?
</P>
<P>
   Alsup analyzed the legislative history and language of the bill
that created the drug laws. He notes: ``Congress did not address
whether the government may revoke a physician's registration based
on the physician recommending a Schedule I drug to a patient. The
term `recommend' does not appear in Section 824 of the statute. The
legislative history is silent as to whether Congress intended that
such conduct could constitute a ground for revocation. As stated,
no case law addresses the point. No regulations have been issued.
All that exist are statements by the government, including the
administration's Response, giving its current view of the
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress did not address the issue and the drug agencies
had not issued rules regarding doctor recommendations, the judge
decided that the First Amendment must take precedence. He wrote:
``The government itself would allow physicians to `discuss' the
pros and cons of marijuana therapy with their patients. In some
cases, however, it will be the professional opinion of doctors that
marijuana is the best therapy or at least should be tried. If such
recommendations could not be communicated, then the
physician-patient relationship would be seriously impaired.
Patients need to know their doctors' recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also noted that a patient armed with such knowledge
may enter the public debate about the medical use of marijuana.
``In the marketplace of ideas, few questions are more deserving of
free-speech protection than whether regulations affecting health
and welfare are sound public policy. ... To hold that physicians
are barred from communicating to patients sincere medical judgments
would disable patients from understanding their own situations well
enough to participate in the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge permanently enjoined the government from revoking a
doctor's DEA registration ``merely because the doctor recommends
medical marijuana to a patient based on a sincere medical
judgment'' and prohibits the government from initiating any
investigation solely on those grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Will the government appeal? Gretchen Michael, press officer for
the U.S. Department of Justice, would not say. She said that she
can't discuss strategy of ongoing cases.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is narrowly written to protect the doctor-patient
relationship in regard to medical advice _ based upon the rights
guaranteed under the First Amendment. There seems little room to
overturn the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the eight states that have passed medical marijuana
laws fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington. An appeal from the federal district court in northern
California would go directly to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals _ known to be a liberal court.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling from the federal appeals court that affirms the lower
court would force the government to toe the line in all those
states.
</P>
<P>
   One almost hopes that the Department of Justice decides to
appeal Judge Alsup's well-argued decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies have always wrestled with two questions in tandem:
what to sell and how to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to sell is a big one, because in choosing
one way, sellers almost always foreclose other possibilities.
Commodity dealers selling on spot markets, for example, do not also
offer continuous replenishment programs. Mass merchandisers with
fixed prices do not invite negotiation. And auction houses do not
sell through mail order.
</P>
<P>
   Companies know that by limiting themselves to one main selling
mechanism, they sacrifice a lot of potential customers and leave a
lot of money lying on the table. But they've had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the same things in different ways has traditionally been
too complex and has required radically different physical setups.
How, for instance, can a mail retailer bring together enough
interested buyers to run a reasonable auction?
</P>
<P>
   PROLIFERATING CHOICES
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed in the age of the Internet, where business
is increasingly unconstrained by the laws and limitations of the
physical world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the many different ways one could purchase a ticket on
American Airlines' Web site. Travelers can book tickets through
Sabre, the company's traditional reservation system; choose from a
limited number of deeply discounted fares using NetSAAvers; secure
special fares based on membership in one of a number of affinity
programs, such as Senior TrAAvelers; arrange customized trips based
on a personal profile stored in Personal AAccess; or select
vacation packages, purchasing air tickets as part of a bundled
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, someone who goes to Dell's Web site can buy a
customized computer using the company's famous online system
configurator or bid in an auction for a popular setup. LandsEnd.com
augments its fixed-price catalog with a Dutch auction for
overstocks. Streamline.com offers buyers basic grocery ordering as
well as a continuous replenishment option for staple items.
</P>
<P>
   All these sites are early examples of all-in-one markets _
markets that offer, side by side, alternative ways for buyers and
sellers to transact business.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why companies are moving quickly to offer more
ways to buy. They recognize that the same buyer may want different
transaction mechanisms under different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   A clotheshorse may love certain purchasing methods when bargain
hunting for basics, yet shun them when shopping for an outfit for a
special occasion. A person may not care about ticket prices when
traveling for business, but he may be the king of the cherry
pickers when it comes time to plan a family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to offer multiple transaction approaches allows
companies to win a larger share of existing customers' business as
well as bring new types of buyers into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   A THREE-STAGE EVOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   All-in-one markets have evolved in three stages. Stage one saw a
great deal of innovation in online transaction mechanisms. Many
companies experimented with mechanisms that had previously been
unknown in their industries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, iBeauty.com introduced continuous replenishment to
the online health and beauty business, enabling automatic
reordering of fragrances and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies pioneered entirely new transaction mechanisms.
Priceline.com, for example, introduced the world to the ``demand
collection system'' _ where buyers post the price they are willing
to pay and invite sellers to either accept or decline the business.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata pioneered electronic group buying. It allows individuals
to gather into buying blocks, leveraging their combined purchasing
power to drive prices down.
</P>
<P>
   In stage two, companies rushed to combine transaction approaches
on their Web sites. Of the 320 leading e-commerce sites we studied,
two-thirds already employ multiple transaction mechanisms, and 30
percent support three or more mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the growing availability of off-the-shelf software
for handling Web transactions, such as OpenSite's auction package,
these numbers are sure to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're entering stage three: the aggregation of many sellers
onto the sites that already feature more than one selling
mechanism. An early leader in this trend is Travelocity.com.
</P>
<P>
   Like the American Airlines site, Travelocity combines several
transaction mechanisms. But unlike American Airlines, it provides
access to travel services from a range of airlines, hotels and
rental car agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of all-in-one markets was inevitable. By enabling
frictionless movement among ways of doing business, they benefit
both buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this trend runs counter to the conventional wisdom
about e-commerce. Many observers predicted that the wide reach and
low transaction costs of the Internet would push all transactions
toward a single mechanism _ open-market price competition. It seems
that the ultimate market for e-commerce isn't one for all. it's all
in one.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows that it usually costs companies less to conduct
business over the Web than through traditional channels. An online
banking transaction, for instance, costs just 2 cents, compared
with 36 cents for an ATM transaction and $1.15 for a
teller-assisted transaction. So it's not surprising that many
companies are desperately trying to attract consumers to the
Internet channel.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising, however, is that most have had dismal
results. In retail brokerage, for instance, only 2 percent of
households trade online. And the figures for the airline industry
are even worse: Less than 0.1 percent of households purchase
tickets through airline Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the numbers so low? In large part, it's because many
companies have bought into the myth that the Internet is a
self-service channel. They assume they should let their online
customers help themselves to whatever product or service they need
_ be it reserving their own airline tickets or configuring their
own automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that when a company does less, the customer ends
up doing more _ and most customers don't want to do more. In many
cases, self-service sites just leave customers frustrated and
annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when customers visit a typical airline Web site,
they are invariably confronted with a self-service search engine.
If they know exactly when and where they want to travel, the Web
site will generate a list of feasible flights. But if they want to
find the cheapest ticket and are flexible on the dates and
destinations, they have to conduct search after search, often
re-entering basic information such as seating preference and
billing address.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, customers who contact that same airline's call
center have a markedly different experience. They can give the
sales agent far less specific information, and the agent does the
unpleasant work of searching through the flight databases.
Customers only have to state their preferences once and then choose
between the best alternatives. Sales reps can even check for
upgrades or request special meals.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be surprising, then, that air travelers have been
slow to move to the Web for ticket purchases.
</P>
<P>
   A better approach to e-commerce is ``coproduction.'' In this
model, a company uses technology to shoulder many of the tasks
involved in shopping and buying, relieving the burden on the
customer.
</P>
<P>
   The coproduction model recognizes that although customers like
having choices, they don't want too many. They appreciate it when
companies offer prescreened alternatives geared to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Coproduction also recognizes that customers want to state their
preferences only once. Through coproduction, companies focus on
customer service, not self-service.
</P>
<P>
   Some of e-commerce's brightest stars are already using the
coproduction approach. Dell Computer, for example, performs a host
of back-end transactions that are invisible to customers _ such as
grouping its products by customer segments and displaying only
in-stock items. That way, customers can help themselves _ they can
configure their computers and check the status of orders but they
aren't overwhelmed with choices.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has also developed hundreds of custom Web pages for its
most valuable corporate customers. These pages display only those
computer configurations that have been preapproved by the
customer's company, and the prices reflect negotiated discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also provides detailed purchasing reports and customized
inventory analyses so managers can use the Web pages to enforce
product standards and increase productivity. Far from pursuing a
self-service strategy, as most people assume, Dell has in fact
shouldered as many of the customer's transaction-related functions
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   You can help your company adopt a coproduction strategy by
taking the following four steps:
</P>
<P>
   First, deconstruct the entire transaction process _ from the
identification of the customer need to order fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Second, distinguish between those functions that are currently
performed by your company and those performed by your customer.
</P>
<P>
   Third, pinpoint which of the customer functions you can take
responsibility for _ establishing the boundaries of your company's
reach into the transaction _ and assess the costs and benefits of
taking on each task.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, find ways to expand your reach beyond a single
transaction to create more value for the customer _ as Charles
Schwab does by issuing e-mail alerts to customers when their stocks
make big moves.
</P>
<P>
   The Web promises not only to reduce corporate transaction costs
but also to enhance customer convenience. To fulfill that promise,
though, companies need to move beyond the self-service myth.
</P>
<P>
   Making it easy and enjoyable for visitors to use your site
through a coproduction strategy will translate into more customers,
greater loyalty and higher profits.

 By PAUL NUNES, DIANE WILSON and AJIT KAMBIL  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies have always wrestled with two questions in tandem:
what to sell and how to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to sell is a big one, because in choosing
one way, sellers almost always foreclose other possibilities.
Commodity dealers selling on spot markets, for example, do not also
offer continuous replenishment programs. Mass merchandisers with
fixed prices do not invite negotiation. And auction houses do not
sell through mail order.
</P>
<P>
   Companies know that by limiting themselves to one main selling
mechanism, they sacrifice a lot of potential customers and leave a
lot of money lying on the table. But they've had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the same things in different ways has traditionally been
too complex and has required radically different physical setups.
How, for instance, can a mail retailer bring together enough
interested buyers to run a reasonable auction?
</P>
<P>
   PROLIFERATING CHOICES
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed in the age of the Internet, where business
is increasingly unconstrained by the laws and limitations of the
physical world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the many different ways one could purchase a ticket on
American Airlines' Web site. Travelers can book tickets through
Sabre, the company's traditional reservation system; choose from a
limited number of deeply discounted fares using NetSAAvers; secure
special fares based on membership in one of a number of affinity
programs, such as Senior TrAAvelers; arrange customized trips based
on a personal profile stored in Personal AAccess; or select
vacation packages, purchasing air tickets as part of a bundled
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, someone who goes to Dell's Web site can buy a
customized computer using the company's famous online system
configurator or bid in an auction for a popular setup. LandsEnd.com
augments its fixed-price catalog with a Dutch auction for
overstocks. Streamline.com offers buyers basic grocery ordering as
well as a continuous replenishment option for staple items.
</P>
<P>
   All these sites are early examples of all-in-one markets _
markets that offer, side by side, alternative ways for buyers and
sellers to transact business.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why companies are moving quickly to offer more
ways to buy. They recognize that the same buyer may want different
transaction mechanisms under different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   A clotheshorse may love certain purchasing methods when bargain
hunting for basics, yet shun them when shopping for an outfit for a
special occasion. A person may not care about ticket prices when
traveling for business, but he may be the king of the cherry
pickers when it comes time to plan a family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to offer multiple transaction approaches allows
companies to win a larger share of existing customers' business as
well as bring new types of buyers into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   A THREE-STAGE EVOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   All-in-one markets have evolved in three stages. Stage one saw a
great deal of innovation in online transaction mechanisms. Many
companies experimented with mechanisms that had previously been
unknown in their industries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, iBeauty.com introduced continuous replenishment to
the online health and beauty business, enabling automatic
reordering of fragrances and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies pioneered entirely new transaction mechanisms.
Priceline.com, for example, introduced the world to the ``demand
collection system'' _ where buyers post the price they are willing
to pay and invite sellers to either accept or decline the business.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata pioneered electronic group buying. It allows individuals
to gather into buying blocks, leveraging their combined purchasing
power to drive prices down.
</P>
<P>
   In stage two, companies rushed to combine transaction approaches
on their Web sites. Of the 320 leading e-commerce sites we studied,
two-thirds already employ multiple transaction mechanisms, and 30
percent support three or more mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the growing availability of off-the-shelf software
for handling Web transactions, such as OpenSite's auction package,
these numbers are sure to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're entering stage three: the aggregation of many sellers
onto the sites that already feature more than one selling
mechanism. An early leader in this trend is Travelocity.com.
</P>
<P>
   Like the American Airlines site, Travelocity combines several
transaction mechanisms. But unlike American Airlines, it provides
access to travel services from a range of airlines, hotels and
rental car agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of all-in-one markets was inevitable. By enabling
frictionless movement among ways of doing business, they benefit
both buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this trend runs counter to the conventional wisdom
about e-commerce. Many observers predicted that the wide reach and

 &HT;    Forever wrapped around Biddy's paw
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Last month the cat took sick. She's wel now,
but I'm scheduled for counseling. The vet recommended it.
</P>
<P>
   My feelings weren't hurt nor was I surprised that Doc had so
quickly diagnosed the secondary problem. After all, he'd done just
fine with the first. Biddy was suffering from a urinary tract
irritation. Antibiotics and a change
</P>
<P>
   of diet cleared that up.
</P>
<P>
   My ailment, on the other hand, is much more complicated. In
fact, I suspect the medication has not yet been discovered that
will prevent a 10-pound ball of fur from reducing an otherwise
stable adult to a babbling psychotic who jumps to every meow.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy's grab for power was not premeditated _ just timely. She
did what any pussycat with an ounce of gumption would do once the
signs were clear that her human was beginning to crumble before her
saucer-size blue eyes. She moved in, took over, and made changes.
Now, we do it all her way.
</P>
<P>
   The transition began a couple of months ago when Biddy
discovered she was capable of raising my anxiety level in direct
proportion to the intensity of her howls, including a few that
registered on the Siamese Richter scale in
</P>
<P>
   Baden-Baden.
</P>
<P>
   In June she had an upset tummy which meant a trip to the vet.
Little she hates worse than being folded into her cardboard cat
house, riding in the car, and odd animal noises _ unless, of
course, it's the clucking of her raccoon
</P>
<P>
   buddy who comes almost nightly to talk through my office screen.
</P>
<P>
   Doc checked her out and prescribed antibiotics and vitamins, and
while my plastic was being swiped through the money slot, the nurse
handed me three bottles and an eyedropper. ``Twice a day,'' she
directed, ``until they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentally, I canceled all plans for the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy recovered rapidly. A lot faster than I did from our
``chase and medicate'' scuffles. She won a few skirmishes, but the
ultimate victory was mine. The cat got well.
</P>
<P>
   In July, since it was obvious Biddy was not going to cooperate
by letting me scrub her teeth with the chicken-flavored toothpaste
Doc gave me, I took her in for a professional job. She came home
sparkling but wobbly, so I moved her quilt-lined basket and water
dish onto the porch, next to the swing where I was working. She got
such a kick out of it that she now demands we spend entire days out
here.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of August, after Biddy's urinary were diagnosed, my
symptoms became even more apparent. With medication and a change of
diet, Biddy was healing on schedule. Meanwhile, my condition was
rapidly deteriorating. That's when she took charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before first light, she screams me out of the hammock with
demands to be brushed, fed, and watered. Then she shrieks for an
``attagirl'' because she's been to the basement and used her
sandbox. She yowls at the pantry door for
</P>
<P>
   her Mason jar _ the one filled with catnip and reconstituting
mice.
</P>
<P>
   And so go the days and nights of Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of weeks, this fuzzy martinet has perfected a
variety of verbal directives that she expects to be obeyed _
immediately and absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Although I have reminded her that I'm only a dumb people and
she'll have to be patient, she's relentless. Our once normal
person-cat relationship has been reduced to a quibbling series of
demands and threats (hers) and groveling (mine).
</P>
<P>
   Although I don't like the direction it has taken, I suspect my
training is almost complete. I'm conditioned to jump at every howl,
and able to detect displeasure in the subtle cant of a velvety
brown ear or the uneven slap of a tail. I've learned that
``Nyeoow!'' means ``at once'' and ``Yikk!'' translates to, ``What
makes you think I'm going to eat that?''
</P>
<P>
   Doc was right. Biddy is doing just fine. Now I'm the problem.

Doc had so quickly diagnosed the secondary problem. After all, he'd
done just fine with the first. Biddy was suffering from a urinary
tract irritation. Antibiotics and a change of diet cleared that up.
My ailment, on the other hand, is much more complicated. In fact, I
suspect the medication has not yet been discovered that will

 &HT;    Nickel would be fitting tribute to Reagan's fiscal legacy
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the rare enough occasion that Sen. Phil Gramm is dead-solid
right on something, we should shout it out. Gramm wants a Ronald
Reagan coin.
</P>
<P>
   I say give it to him.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm was talking the other day about how U.S. coins are
``crummy.'' I don't see that. But he chairs the Senate committee in
charge of currency. He wants to design coins.
</P>
<P>
   Again, I can't see any reason for it. They're fine. But as a
constituent, let me say Gramm can do less damage to American
currency this way than, say, by finding new ways for mega-banks to
eat America.
</P>
<P>
   So let him design a coin. I propose a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I think there's anything wrong with today's nickel. Not
at all. Anyone who calls Jefferson's image crummy has picked a
fight with me.
</P>
<P>
   But we can have more than one nickel. We have more than one
dollar and half dollar.
</P>
<P>
   So we can have a Reagan nickel.
</P>
<P>
   What we need is something different, something that reflects
Reagan's contributions to currency.
</P>
<P>
   Principally, what he contributed to currency was debt. And it
was no small debt. It was billions and billions of dollars, much of
it borrowed to pay for a military build-up and tax cuts for the
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was a president who spoke of less government and more
budget austerity, though he budgeted more on the military than it
could spend. To compensate, sometimes the Pentagon would spend a
corporal's week's salary on a toilet seat, or more on a hammer than
Dan Quayle could spend on a week of greens fees.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Reagan was tight with some forms of federal
spending. For instance, to save a few pennies and soothe moist
corporate brows, he killed tighter federal regulations on tires.
Those rules were set to take effect after a 1978 recall of 14
million Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Firestone has had to recall 14 million more
tires. Many people have died. So much for the assumption that a
penny saved is earned. Sometimes a penny saved is just a dumb
allocation of pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Reagan talked a good austerity game, his principal
contribution was showing how to borrow one's way to prosperity.
It's no sin. See it on late-night cable infomercials. In the
corporate world of the go-go '80s it became absolutely the thing.
It was leveraging.
</P>
<P>
   Another Reagan contribution was financial deregulation. It was
applauded frantically by savings and loans in 1982. By 1988 a host
of them had loaned out their last nickel and were frantic for
rescue. We found extra currency. We borrowed it.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but it was good debt. In the long run, debt was the best
friend of Reagan and worshipful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Being no fans of social spending, they knew that as the debt
climbed, government would have to be downsized. Debt made it harder
to justify Rooseveltian impulses. Government as enemy? Truly it a
self-fulfilling condition. And it was Reagan's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Though hardly the inventor of borrow-spend economics, Reagan
took it to new levels. He set government on a course to borrow
trillions of dollars to pay for his prosperity, as he cursed big
spenders.
</P>
<P>
   He could do all this because it wouldn't be his problem. Someone
else would pay it all back.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a Reagan nickel would serve us well. It would remind
us of what we have and what we owe. Instead of ``five cents,'' the
2000 edition could say ``five trillion dollars owed.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be minted in fine balsa wood.
</P>
<P>
   Future generations could carry around those wooden nickels as a
reminder and a receipt. Having a wooden nickel with Reagan's
likeness might inspire Americans to beware of blue-sky fiscal
scams.
</P>
<P>
   I say, give that man a nickel.

 &HT;    Being in debt is not always a bad thing
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Borrowing money is not always a grimy and unspeakable
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Financial experts acknowledge that some debts _ mortgages or
education loans among them _ are good ones. They help build your
future.
</P>
<P>
   Bad debts are the ones that make you feel good today but mess up
your life for months or years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is in learning to use the one in moderation and the
other not at all.
</P>
<P>
   For 25-year-old Laura Wynn, the dark side included 10 credit
cards and bills for gas, food, clothes and entertainment. There was
also a $1,500 ring, purchased by a long-gone boyfriend. She got to
keep the ring, but she also kept the credit card bill.
</P>
<P>
   Her recollection of that period illuminates an all-too-common
cycle for the unwary: ``I was not making any money at all, but I
was trying to live a nice lifestyle,'' she recalls now. ``I started
getting calls from creditors at home, then at work. I was afraid I
was not going to be able to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the booming economy, some American families are getting
deep in the hole. Median family debt stood at $33,300 in 1998, up
sharply from $23,400 only three years earlier. That includes
mortgages, credit cards and other kinds of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Debt distress is on the increase, too. The chart shows the
growth in the percentage of families who are late paying their
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Another worrisome trend: In 1989, one of every 10 families
reported that payments gobbled up more than 40 percent of their
incomes. By 1998, one in eight families crossed that threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners often define bad debt as short-term
obligations that last longer than the item you bought and that have
no financial payback.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card debts are the most common. An additional problem is
that the interest rates are punishing, often 18 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Good debt includes the loans that help build your financial
future. ``Most people cannot buy a home without going into debt,''
said William G. Hammond, a certified financial planner. ``That's
good debt because you're building your equity, your net worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Education loans generally count as good because they tend to
increase earning power.
</P>
<P>
   Small-business loans also are constructive, assuming the
business thrives. ``If you can borrow money at 8 percent and get a
15 or 20 percent return from a business, that's good debt,'' said
Hammond.
</P>
<P>
   The main question with good debt is, how much is enough? The
Financial Planning Association suggests that total debt, not
counting mortgages, should be no higher than 10 percent to 15
percent of take-home pay.
</P>
<P>
   There's a common sense element, too. ``An obligation makes sense
if it fits into your budget and you have clear plans for keeping up
the payments, even if a short-term disruption in income occurs,''
said Suzanne Boas, president of the Consumer Credit Counseling
Service of Greater Atlanta. ``It doesn't make sense if you're just
gambling on future success to repay the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why planners like Hammond advise against borrowing money
to play the booming, alluring stock market. ``It strikes me as
speculative,'' he said. ``That's people who are day-trading, not
long-term investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing to play the market is more common than you might
think. According to the Federal Reserve Board, about one family in
10 has refinanced a first mortgage and put at least a fraction of
the money into investments. In 1998, 3.2 percent of all family debt
was used for investments.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the goal is to shed expensive and
nonproductive debts as quickly as you can. Laura Wynn took four
years to wipe out more than $6,000 she had charged on her 10 credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to quit running up debts. Remember the First
Rule of Holes: When you're in one, stop digging. For many people,
that includes cutting up credit cards or at least locking them away
in some inaccessible place, such as a safe deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to lay out a written plan for paying off your
debts. Some people like to pay off the smallest accounts first, but
the best bet is to start with accounts that charge the highest
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Boas strongly recommends regular checkups on your progress.
``You need to keep working toward your goal and measuring your
successes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also recommends setting up some sort of celebration of your
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers recommend using any savings you might have to pay
off high-interest debt. The rationale is that you'll do better in
the long run by eliminating 18 percent loans than by making a much
smaller rate on a savings account.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond disagrees. ``Should you pay debt or build a cash
reserve?'' he asks. ``The answer is that you need to do both. If
you have never gotten in the habit of saving money, you have to get
into the habit. Even if it takes longer to pay off those credit
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   However long it takes, the rewards are great. Wynn, once a
student at Georgia Perimeter College, had to get a job to pay her
debts. Now she is back in school, finishing a history degree at
Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   In her case, there's a bonus: If she goes for a master's degree,
she can now get a student loan. That puts her on the side of good
debts.

 &HT;    Therapy can help dental-related phobias
 &HT;    By Hap Lecrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A wave of anxiety swept over him when his alarm went off. As
drowsiness subsided, his mind searched for an explanation for this
vague since of dread. Moments later he realized that later that day
he had a dental appointment.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning proceeded, his anxiety mounted and gagging
sensations began as he approached the dentist's office. His heart
began to race, his palms became sweaty and he felt faint. The color
had drained from his face and his hands shook as he signed the
patient sign-in sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering the operatory and being seated in the dental
chair, his fear became so intense that her seriously considered
bolting for the door and leaving. White knuckles on the chair
handles accompanied by tightly clinched jaws alerted the dentist to
the psychological condition of this less than enthusiastic patient.
</P>
<P>
   Survey's have shown that up to 20 percent admit to fear of
dental activities. Many individuals avoid going to the dentist at
the expense of dental deterioration, gum disease and other dental
problems. Reasons given may include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fear of needles, fear of pain, and claustrophobia while in the
dental chair.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bad experiences with dental treatment earlier in life.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Negative media images of dentists and dental treatment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fear of loss of control during dental procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Neglecting dental treatment can threaten not only a patients
oral health but also their self-esteem resulting from bad
appearance and bad breath. More recently, reports linking gum and
heart disease have made adequate dental care even more important.
</P>
<P>
   Current dental training is including more and more psychological
components along with other more traditional elements of dentistry.
Helping patients reduce fear by using relaxation techniques,
hypnosis and other psychological techniques are assisting many
patients with ``dentaphobia.''
</P>
<P>
   Other areas of psychological intervention in dentistry include
patients suffering from temporomandibular disorder. This painful
sensation in a patients jaw hinge is often treated by using
appliances to prevent grinding of teeth. However, some patients can
be treated successfully by using biofeedback or other behavioral
techniques to address the stress that often underlies the clinching
and grinding problem which frequently results in headaches and
severe joint paint.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists are sometimes asked to address self-esteem issues
in patients seeking orthodontia treatment. These patients may
become so obsessed with the alignment of their teeth that they
insist on dental braces even when deemed unnecessary by the
orthodontist.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists may also be consulted when a dentist notices
enamel loss that is a result of stomach acid erosion of teeth due
to the purging in bulimia, a serious eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   With a large number of Americans approaching the age where more
dental problems can occur, psychologists can also assist in
adjustment to dental intervention in later life.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Last month the cat took
sick. She's well now, but I'm scheduled for counseling. The vet
recommended it. My feelings weren't hurt nor was I surprised that
Doc had so quickly diagnosed the secondary problem. After all, he'd
done just fine with the first. Biddy was suffering from a urinary
tract irritation. Antibiotics and a change of diet cleared that up.
My ailment, on the other hand, is much more complicated. In fact, I
suspect the medication has not yet been discovered that will
prevent a 10-pound ball of fur from reducing an otherwise stable
adult to a babbling psychotic who jumps to every meow. (Schuett,

 &HT;    Being in debt is not always a bad thing
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Borrowing money is not always a grimy and unspeakable
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Financial experts acknowledge that some debts _ mortgages or
education loans among them _ are good ones. They help build your
future.
</P>
<P>
   Bad debts are the ones that make you feel good today but mess up
your life for months or years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is in learning to use the one in moderation and the
other not at all.
</P>
<P>
   For 25-year-old Laura Wynn, the dark side included 10 credit
cards and bills for gas, food, clothes and entertainment. There was
also a $1,500 ring, purchased by a long-gone boyfriend. She got to
keep the ring, but she also kept the credit card bill.
</P>
<P>
   Her recollection of that period illuminates an all-too-common
cycle for the unwary: ``I was not making any money at all, but I
was trying to live a nice lifestyle,'' she recalls now. ``I started
getting calls from creditors at home, then at work. I was afraid I
was not going to be able to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the booming economy, some American families are getting
deep in the hole. Median family debt stood at $33,300 in 1998, up
sharply from $23,400 only three years earlier. That includes
mortgages, credit cards and other kinds of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Debt distress is on the increase, too. The chart shows the
growth in the percentage of families who are late paying their
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Another worrisome trend: In 1989, one of every 10 families
reported that payments gobbled up more than 40 percent of their
incomes. By 1998, one in eight families crossed that threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners often define bad debt as short-term
obligations that last longer than the item you bought and that have
no financial payback.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card debts are the most common. An additional problem is
that the interest rates are punishing, often 18 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Good debt includes the loans that help build your financial
future. ``Most people cannot buy a home without going into debt,''
said William G. Hammond, a certified financial planner. ``That's
good debt because you're building your equity, your net worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Education loans generally count as good because they tend to
increase earning power.
</P>
<P>
   Small-business loans also are constructive, assuming the
business thrives. ``If you can borrow money at 8 percent and get a
15 or 20 percent return from a business, that's good debt,'' said
Hammond.
</P>
<P>
   The main question with good debt is, how much is enough? The
Financial Planning Association suggests that total debt, not
counting mortgages, should be no higher than 10 percent to 15
percent of take-home pay.
</P>
<P>
   There's a common sense element, too. ``An obligation makes sense
if it fits into your budget and you have clear plans for keeping up
the payments, even if a short-term disruption in income occurs,''
said Suzanne Boas, president of the Consumer Credit Counseling
Service of Greater Atlanta. ``It doesn't make sense if you're just
gambling on future success to repay the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why planners like Hammond advise against borrowing money
to play the booming, alluring stock market. ``It strikes me as
speculative,'' he said. ``That's people who are day-trading, not
long-term investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing to play the market is more common than you might
think. According to the Federal Reserve Board, about one family in
10 has refinanced a first mortgage and put at least a fraction of
the money into investments. In 1998, 3.2 percent of all family debt
was used for investments.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the goal is to shed expensive and
nonproductive debts as quickly as you can. Laura Wynn took four
years to wipe out more than $6,000 she had charged on her 10 credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to quit running up debts. Remember the First
Rule of Holes: When you're in one, stop digging. For many people,
that includes cutting up credit cards or at least locking them away
in some inaccessible place, such as a safe deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to lay out a written plan for paying off your
debts. Some people like to pay off the smallest accounts first, but
the best bet is to start with accounts that charge the highest
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Boas strongly recommends regular checkups on your progress.
``You need to keep working toward your goal and measuring your
successes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also recommends setting up some sort of celebration of your
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers recommend using any savings you might have to pay
off high-interest debt. The rationale is that you'll do better in
the long run by eliminating 18 percent loans than by making a much
smaller rate on a savings account.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond disagrees. ``Should you pay debt or build a cash
reserve?'' he asks. ``The answer is that you need to do both. If
you have never gotten in the habit of saving money, you have to get
into the habit. Even if it takes longer to pay off those credit
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   However long it takes, the rewards are great. Wynn, once a
student at Georgia Perimeter College, had to get a job to pay her
debts. Now she is back in school, finishing a history degree at
Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   In her case, there's a bonus: If she goes for a master's degree,
she can now get a student loan. That puts her on the side of good
debts.

 &HT;    Therapy can help dental-related phobias
 &HT;    By Hap Lecrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A wave of anxiety swept over him when his alarm went off. As
drowsiness subsided, his mind searched for an explanation for this
vague since of dread. Moments later he realized that later that day
he had a dental appointment.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning proceeded, his anxiety mounted and gagging
sensations began as he approached the dentist's office. His heart
began to race, his palms became sweaty and he felt faint. The color
had drained from his face and his hands shook as he signed the
patient sign-in sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering the operatory and being seated in the dental
chair, his fear became so intense that her seriously considered
bolting for the door and leaving. White knuckles on the chair
handles accompanied by tightly clinched jaws alerted the dentist to
the psychological condition of this less than enthusiastic patient.
</P>
<P>
   Survey's have shown that up to 20 percent admit to fear of
dental activities. Many individuals avoid going to the dentist at
the expense of dental deterioration, gum disease and other dental
problems. Reasons given may include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fear of needles, fear of pain, and claustrophobia while in the
dental chair.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bad experiences with dental treatment earlier in life.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Negative media images of dentists and dental treatment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fear of loss of control during dental procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Neglecting dental treatment can threaten not only a patients
oral health but also their self-esteem resulting from bad
appearance and bad breath. More recently, reports linking gum and
heart disease have made adequate dental care even more important.
</P>
<P>
   Current dental training is including more and more psychological
components along with other more traditional elements of dentistry.
Helping patients reduce fear by using relaxation techniques,
hypnosis and other psychological techniques are assisting many
patients with ``dentaphobia.''
</P>
<P>
   Other areas of psychological intervention in dentistry include
patients suffering from temporomandibular disorder. This painful
sensation in a patients jaw hinge is often treated by using
appliances to prevent grinding of teeth. However, some patients can
be treated successfully by using biofeedback or other behavioral
techniques to address the stress that often underlies the clinching
and grinding problem which frequently results in headaches and
severe joint paint.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists are sometimes asked to address self-esteem issues
in patients seeking orthodontia treatment. These patients may
become so obsessed with the alignment of their teeth that they
insist on dental braces even when deemed unnecessary by the
orthodontist.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists may also be consulted when a dentist notices
enamel loss that is a result of stomach acid erosion of teeth due
to the purging in bulimia, a serious eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   With a large number of Americans approaching the age where more
dental problems can occur, psychologists can also assist in
adjustment to dental intervention in later life.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Computer and printer manufacturer
Hewlett-Packard Co. is in discussions to buy the management and
information technology consulting unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers,
the New York accounting and consulting giant.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released Monday by Hewlett-Packard said a cash and
stock deal for $17 billion to $18 billion is being considered.
</P>
<P>
   David Nester, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, confirmed
the talks but declined to provide specifics. The management and
technology consulting firm has about 30,000 employees worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would give Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard a
weapon in the increasingly important fight for the consulting and
software business that hardware manufacturers have been entering in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   With IBM the market leader, this business is seen as one avenue
for long-term growth at a time when sales of computers and systems
are tapering off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the hardware business versus the software
business and the servicing portions of the business in the
information technology arena, the better long-term growth is in
software services,'' said Wendy I. Abramowitz, an analyst with
Argus Research in New York. ``That's where a lot of old-line
hardware companies are looking to expand their focus. As
Hewlett-Packard is thinking of doing this, it sounds reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if consummated, would be Hewlett-Packard's first major
acquisition since new chief executive Carly Fiorina joined the
company last year. The company said it has been strengthening its
professional services abilities to come up with ways to help
clients use technology more to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would free PricewaterhouseCoopers of a regulatory
entanglement that began earlier this year when the Securities and
Exchange Commission, concerned about the potential for conflicts of
interest, began cracking down on the close relationships between
accounting firms' auditing and consulting divisions.
</P>
<P>
   In June the SEC proposed a ban on companies' providing
consulting services on a client's computer systems while auditing
the same client.

&HT;     STUDY SAYS LEADED GASOLINE STILL AFFLICTS SAN FRANCISCO BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Leaded gasoline, phased out over past decades,
will continue washing into the San Francisco Bay for 50 to 100
years, scientists at the University of California at Santa Cruz
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-knock tetraethyl lead that was added to gas-guzzling
cars of the 1960s polluted the air and eventually found its way
into the water supply. It is still found in the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year study was published in Tuesday's issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped putting lead into gasoline over a decade ago,''
said Russell Flegal, an author of the study and professor of
environmental toxicology at UC-Santa Cruz. ``Yet, our study
indicates it's going to be a very, very long time before the lead
gets flushed out of the Central Valley into the Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead, a naturally occurring element in trace amounts, can cause
severe health effects even at low concentrations. Nervous,
reproductive and blood-producing systems are particularly
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay contains less lead than drinking water, not enough to
threaten anyone's health, the scientists said. They do not believe
there is any harm in eating fish from the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The study attributes the stubborn presence of lead to the large
volume that fell as air pollution in California's Central Valley
and the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers estimated that cars burning leaded gas emitted
33,000 tons of lead in the drainage basins of the San Joaquin and
Sacramento rivers in the 1960s and 1970s, when the federal
government started phasing out leaded gas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 80 percent of the lead in the northern and central
portions of the Bay comes from the combustion of leaded gas during
that time. About 20 percent comes from the effects of hydraulic
gold mining during the 19th-century Gold Rush.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern end of the Bay, about 90 percent comes from
leaded gas, and 10 percent comes from the gold mining.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the phase-out of leaded gas began, only a
relatively small amount was sold in California. The state stopped
selling the fuel in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   However, the decline of lead in the San Francisco estuary has
been remarkably slow, while lead levels have fallen in urban air,
on the surface of oceans, in polar ice and snow and even in human
blood, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, only 1 to 10 percent of the lead emitted to the river
basins during the late 1980s and early 1990s had moved from the
rivers to the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Once contaminants are in the Bay, they stay there for a long
time. Eventually, the lead sediments move very slowly over years
out the Golden Gate Bridge to the ocean, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the natural flow of fresh water from rivers to the
ocean during rainy seasons and snow melts helped to flush out the
contaminants, but over the past decades, the damming and diversion
of water by agriculture, cities and industries have reduced that
flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study shows there is a link between Bay circulation and
the ability of the Bay to clean itself,'' said geochemist Douglas
J. Steding, lead author and doctoral candidate in the Earth
Sciences Department at the University of California at Davis. ``The
only way that the Bay can clean itself is if clean sediments come
into the Bay from the rivers, and we've yet to see that in the case
of lead.''

 &HT;     BUICK TAKES A STAB AT BOOMERS WITH NEW LeSABRE  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now is as good a time as any to buy a Buick, especially if you
can afford the $31,000-plus price of the 2001 LeSabre Limited
Sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Wow! This is a really nice car.
</P>
<P>
   I've never really been into large, cushy cars, having long ago
associated most of them with older folks who put more emphasis on a
smooth, soft ride than on crisp performance or exciting
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   But my tastes are changing, or else General Motors is starting
to make big, comfortable cars that appeal to me. I believe it's a
combination of the two, and that just like other aging baby
boomers, I'm getting to where I'm going to enjoy some of the finer
things in life.
</P>
<P>
   The LeSabre, though, doesn't force me to compromise, trading
performance for comfort. That's what's so marvelous about Buick's
best-selling car: It encompasses the best of both worlds. Besides
giving its occupants a fine ride in stylish surroundings without
gratuitous luxury trappings, it's downright fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the LeSabre was completely redesigned, coming on a
whole new chassis platform with performance refinements throughout.
Interior and exterior designs are new, although the exterior does
still look much like that of the previous LeSabre generation.
</P>
<P>
   That was clearly a concession to the car's existing owner body.
As Buick's best seller for at least the past decade, the full-size
LeSabre has one of the most loyal followings in the car industry.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million of these cars have been sold in the past 10
years, but the average age of buyers has been 66, something that
Buick and General Motors corporate marketing strategists know has
to change if the Buick brand is going to remain viable.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers, it seems, just haven't been jumping into Buicks
the way their parents did, and even now that boomers are aging,
many still seem to prefer the imports that sell for about the same
as the LeSabre _ such as the Toyota Camry, Lexus ES 300, Honda
Accord, Toyota Avalon and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Buick has high hopes that this new LeSabre will combine the best
of two centuries and two worlds: the attributes of the previous
LeSabre that attracted the post-60 crowd, and enough new and
slightly daring changes to endear this car to the now-graying kids
of current and past LeSabre owners.
</P>
<P>
   GM marketers probably would have let out a collective groan to
hear my significant other's initial assessment of the new LeSabre
as ``my parents' kind of car,'' but unfortunately, that's the
stigma the car has to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   It still is a big, comfortable family car that seats up to six
adults in relative comfort, cruises over bumps and potholes with
the grace one would expect of a Buick, and moves along at a crisp
rate of speed when the gas pedal is goosed.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some styling cues designed to appeal to the
younger set without turning off older folks who are considering
trading in their current LeSabres for a new one. Gone is the
boring, straight, '70s-era dashboard and instrument panel, replaced
by a curved dash and cockpit-style instrument cluster that are
clearly reminiscent of some other modern GM cars aimed at the baby
boomer such as the outstanding Oldsmobile Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   The designers dispensed with the gratuitous chrome exterior trim
that was as passe as disco dancing, replacing it with flush door
handles, body-color trim and curvaceous lines that make the LeSabre
a lot more stylish in an understated kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the car should continue to appeal to older consumers.
Buick says it couldn't afford to lose the current owners _ 53
percent of whom come back for another LeSabre when they need a new
car.
</P>
<P>
   The danger here was in making a new model so radically different
that current owners would be repulsed before a new crop of buyers
had been cultivated. Buick had been selling 150,000 of these cars a
year, making it the nation's best-selling full-size car, and it
would have been bad business to abandon those loyal buyers on the
gamble that a younger clientele would develop a taste for the
LeSabre.
</P>
<P>
   Ford made that mistake with its radical redesign of the midsize
Taurus in 1996; the once best-selling U.S. car has never regained
its former stature, and Ford has already redesigned it to tone down
its outrageous styling.
</P>
<P>
   So what would appeal to boomers in the LeSabre besides the
subtle but modern new styling? Among other things, Buick is banking
on the much-improved ride and handling, a Limited model with bucket
seats up front, sun roof, 12-disc CD changer, and such safety
features as active front head restraints, side air bags for the
front passengers, and four-wheel disc antilock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy just might work if Buick can persuade these
consumers that what they really need instead of that sport utility
vehicle they've been lusting over is a big, roomy and comfortable
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem standalone Buick dealers have with that
strategy is there is no big, fancy SUV in the showroom to lure
those customers. That will change next year, however, when Buick
introduces its first sport utility, the impressive all-new
Rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the new LeSabre comes in two styles: the base
Custom, with bench seating for six and prices starting about
$23,000, and the Limited, which comes with front bucket seats and a
rear bench, carries a base price of $27,885 (plus transportation),
and with bucket seats up front. I liked the console between the two
front seats in the Limited, something that older buyers may not
particularly appreciate, but young buyers will demand.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is GM's smooth 3.8-liter V-6, with 205 horsepower and
230 foot-pounds of torque. It is connected to a smooth-shifting
four-speed automatic transmission, and does an admirable job of
pushing the LeSabre along at highway speeds and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is firmer than before, and steering response is much
improved, making the LeSabre feel sportier and less like a big,
floaty boat. It's still no sports car, but boomers will appreciate
the handling improvements, and repeat buyers probably won't notice
that the ride isn't quite as soft as before.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment on the Custom includes air conditioning,
AM/FM radio, power windows/mirrors/door locks, keyless remote
entry, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, map lights,
intermittent windshield wipers and a security system.
</P>
<P>
   Limited models come with dual-zone climate control,
air-filtration system, dark walnut trim, a driver-information
center, power front seats, a premium stereo system with cassette
deck, and 15-inch aluminum wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with the ``prestige option package'' ($615),
which added auto-dimming inside mirror with compass, upgraded audio
system with compact-disc and cassette decks, moisture-sensing
windshield wipers, traction control, universal garage-door opener
and power reclining front seats; Medici red leather/vinyl seats
($750); the ``driver's confidence package'' ($730) that included a
heads-up speedometer display and active brake control; the ``grand
touring package'' ($235), which added 3.05 axle ratio, touring
suspension, blackwall 16-inch tires, leather-wrapped steering wheel
and variable-assist power steering; and memory driver's seat and
outside mirrors ($145).
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker was $31,015, including $655 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is a respectable 19 miles per gallon in the city
and 30 on the highway, making the LeSabre an excellent touring car.
The tank holds 18.5 gallons of gasoline, and unleaded premium is
recommended.

GRAY EMINENCES: GENE HACKMAN FENCES WITH MORGAN FREEMAN IN `UNDER
SUSPICION'

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color photo of Gene Hackman with Monica Bellucci in a
scene from ``Under Suspicion.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING 
 c.2000 Ian Spelling 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    Actors come and go in Hollywood.
 &HT;    Some burn brightly for a while and then fade away. Others never
quite make it, but survive on the fringes as supporting players.
It's the way of the world.
 &HT;    And then there are those rare few who defy the rules, who attain
a measure of stardom as character actors/leading men and stick
around seemingly forever. Gene Hackman is one such actor, and his
longevity in this eat-them-up-and-spit-them-out industry surprises
no one more than Hackman himself.
 &HT;    ``It especially crosses my mind when I have to go to see a film
I'm in,'' he says. ``I look at who that person is and I think, `My
God, why would anyone pay to see me?'
 &HT;    ``I also recognize the fact that I'm not objective at all about
my work, about watching my work,'' Hackman says. ``I can be very
objective about my work when I'm doing it, I think. At least I know
if it works or not when I'm doing it.
 &HT;    ``Once I get away from that and I'm looking at an image on the
screen, that's somebody else _ it's my great-grandfather.''
 &HT;    At 69, Hackman remains one of Hollywood's busiest and most
versatile actors. In the past couple of years alone, he has
appeared in the thriller ``Enemy of the People'' (1998), the
private-eye drama ``Twilight'' (1998) and the current football
comedy ``The Replacements,'' as well as ``Under Suspicion,'' set to
open in limited release on Sept. 22.
 &HT;    ``When I choose a film I don't choose it in terms of quality, I
choose it in terms of story,'' he says cryptically. ``There may be
a contradiction there.''
 &HT;    Hackman, sitting in a conference room at New York's Essex House,
smiles and shrugs.
 &HT;    ``If you have a strong enough sense of story about yourself and
your character, then the quality will take care of itself,'' he
says. ``Something will come out of that, because you've done it
strongly enough and honestly enough.''
 &HT;    There may be a contradiction there, too, but it helps explain
why Hackman committed to ``Under Suspicion.'' A remake of the
French drama ``Garde A'Vue,'' it casts Hackman as Henry Hearst, a
prominent tax attorney, and Morgan Freeman, Hackman's co-star in
``Unforgiven'' (1992), as Victor Benezet, captain of the police
department on the Caribbean island where both men live.
 &HT;    Benezet at first chats amiably about a high-profile murder case,
then zeros in on Hearst as the prime suspect. Over the course of a
single night the two men engage in a wily game of bluffs and
attacks, with Hearst's comely, much younger wife (Monica Pellucid)
and Benezet's overzealous underling (Thomas Jane) serving as vital
pawns.
 &HT;    ``I loved the original French film,'' says Hackman, who joined
Freeman as co-executive producers of the remake. ``I saw it with my
daughter almost 17 years ago. It was not a success in the United
States, but it was a huge hit in France.
 &HT;    ``I liked the idea of playing (Hearst),'' the actor says. ``He's
different from other roles I've played. He's a very successful guy,
but you wouldn't necessarily want him as your best friend, because
of his vanity and whatever else. The hairpiece falling off and all
of that was fun to play.''
 &HT;    Hackman describes ``Under Suspicion'' as being about prejudice,
but not in the sense that Hearst is white and Benezet is black.
 &HT;    ``It has to do with prejudice in terms of one's perception of
who people are and how we make mistakes in terms of being too quick
to judge merely because of lifestyles and money,'' he says, rubbing
at his scruffy gray beard. ``I liked that idea.''
 &HT;    Hackman, however, did not particularly enjoy producing the film.
In general, he says, he finds that splitting his focus detracts
from his performance. Moreover, it took years to get ``Under
Suspicion'' off the ground.
 &HT;    ``I was so tired of being turned down by a variety of people,
both actors and producers,'' Hackman says with a pained grimace.
``I still believed in the film, but I didn't think I could go on
with it after so long. I gave it to Morgan, and it took him two
years to find money, and he had a production company in place. He
found the money to do it, and it's a very low-budget film.
 &HT;    ``Morgan is a pro,'' Hackman says warmly. ``He's always
prepared, always knows what he's doing, but not in a rigid way.
He's able to shift.''
 &HT;    Hackman, too, can shift, as he's proven through the years by
amassing such credits as ``Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967), ``The French
Connection'' (1971), ``Night Moves'' (1975), ``Superman'' (1978),
``The Firm'' (1993), ``Crimson Tide'' (1995) and ``The Birdcage''
(1996), as well as his more recent films.
 &HT;    A five-time Oscar nominee, Hackman took home statuettes as Best
Actor for ``The French Connection'' and Best Supporting Actor for
``Unforgiven,'' but considers ``Scarecrow'' (1973) and ``The
Conversation'' (1974) his most underrated films.
 &HT;    By now, one might think, acting comes easy for Hackman, but he
insists that such is not the case.
 &HT;    ``In a funny way, it's harder,'' he says. ``I realize how much
I've left out, things I wish I hadn't done. So I'm more tormented
by acting, but I still love it.
 &HT;    ``In some ways I'm too quick to a shorthand, and yet I probably
work harder now than I ever have on each film,'' he adds. ``That's
probably because I realize that there are only a limited number of
films I have left in me, and I want to make them the best I can.''
 &HT;    Hackman is currently shooting ``The Heist,'' a caper film
written and directed by playwright David Mamet, and then will move
on to a military drama entitled ``Behind Enemy Lines.'' Already in
the can and awaiting release is ``Breakers,'' a comedy with
Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt as mother-and-daughter
grifters.
 &HT;    ``I play an 80-year-old billionaire tobacco tycoon,'' Hackman
says. ``I constantly have a cigarette in my mouth. I'm always
coughing and blowing off billows of smoke.
 &HT;    ``It was great fun,'' he says, chuckling. ``I probably went too
far with it.''
 &HT;    Actors who feel time slipping away often covet a ``King
Lear''-like part that will send them out on a high note. Hackman,
again going against the grain, feels no such compulsion.
 &HT;    ``My career is diverse enough that it would be fine if it
continued as it is now,'' says the actor, who lives in Santa Fe,
N.M., with his family and recently wrote his first novel, ``Wake of
the Perdido Star'' (Newmarket Press, 1999), with Daniel Lenihan.
``I like taking what's offered to me, as opposed to going out and
trying to develop something I think I'll be terrific in.
 &HT;    ``Many times you can find out what people think about you by
what's offered to you,'' he says. ``I'm being offered pretty much
the same kinds of roles I've always been offered, just with a
little more gray in them.''

 (Includes a color photo of Minnie Driver in a scene from
``Beautiful.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN 
 c.2000 Cindy Pearlman 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    Her name may be Minnie, but Minnie Driver is anything but
mouselike. Seemingly an island of togetherness in a sea of
Hollywood neurosis, she handles whatever comes her way, even if
it's a little ... well, weird.
 &HT;    Like the autograph hounds who accosted her recently in Los
Angeles, shouting ``We just love your work, Janeane!'''
 &HT;    Janeane?
 &HT;    ``People think I'm Janeane Garofalo a lot,'' Driver says with a
shrug. ``I don't know what it is. Maybe we're both quirky-looking
girls.''
 &HT;    Quirky enough that she apparently even looks like herself.
 &HT;    ``The other day, I got, `Oh, you look an awful lot like Minnie
Driver,''' she recalls. ``So in a most humorous way I said, `Oh,
thank you. I hear she's a great actress.'
 &HT;    ``The other person said, `Nah, I didn't like that last movie she
was in _ it was a piece of junk!'''
 &HT;    Driver sighs, and turns her attention to breakfast at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, where the tall, thin actress with the
mass of dark curls has come to talk about her latest film,
``Beautiful,'' opening nationwide on Sept. 22.
 &HT;    In the film, directed by Sally Field, Driver _ whose looks are
often described as ``quirky'' or ``unconventional,'' though by the
standards of anywhere but Hollywood she's a knockout _ plays a
young woman who is obsessed with beauty pageants.
 &HT;    The 29-year-old actress plays the character starting at age 18.
 &HT;    ``Believe me, that was a rough one,'' she says, laughing. ``I
gave the cameraman some gauze to put over the lens.''
 &HT;    Driver isn't a pageant buff, and had to learn a lot about it in
a hurry.
 &HT;    ``Those girls who compete in these beauty shows have it rough,''
the actress says. ``The competition is cutthroat, and you have to
learn all the tricks.''
 &HT;    Those tricks can be astoundingly detailed, she adds.
 &HT;    ``It always helps if you spray your bum with water before
putting on tights, so your butt is lifted,'' she says. ``You also
need to grease your teeth with Vasoline for that perfect wide
smile.''
 &HT;    Field, who is making her feature debut as a director, obviously
knows the other side of the camera intimately: She's a two-time
Oscar-winning actress, and brought that to her work on
``Beautiful.''
 &HT;    ``Sally was an amazing director,'' Driver says. ``She knows
exactly what you need to be in the moment as an actress, because
she is one of the best actresses to ever grace the screen. I could
tell by just looking at Sally for a nanosecond if she was pleased
with what I was doing.''
 &HT;    The idea of Driver anxiously seeking reassurance may surprise
those who know her public persona as a poised, self-confident Brit
who navigates Hollywood with no anxieties and the stiffest of upper
lips.
 &HT;    ``For some reason people don't think I have a care in the world,
which is not true,'' Driver says. ``People think I lead some
charmed existence, and I can't believe it. My life is not perfect.
There's always something inside that's troubling.
 &HT;    ``I'm just like you,'' she continues. ``Everybody has got some
worries. But as young actresses, we're packaged to keep people
coming to movies. We're molded to make other people want to be like
us or be us. It's just the fantasy of Hollywood.''
 &HT;    The child of divorced parents, Driver grew up in London with her
mother, a model and writer. She also spent time with her father, a
financial adviser who lived in the Caribbean. It was while
attending boarding school that she first found herself onstage.
 &HT;    ``I always loved writing,'' she recalls. ``That was so much a
reason of why I acted. I started out writing, and I was so
encouraged to create and use my imagination. My English teachers at
school inspired me to be so creative and free.''
 &HT;    Driver's big break came with the charming English drama ``Circle
of Friends'' (1995), in which she played the overweight Benny
opposite a young, handsome Chris O'Donnell. Among her later credits
are ``Good Will Hunting'' (1997), ``Hard Rain'' (1998) and ``Grosse
Pointe Blank'' (1997). Her most recent outing was opposite David
Duchovny in ``Return to Me'' (1999).
 &HT;    She's usually cast as smart, intense women who defy convention _
which, according to those who work with her, is pretty much
typecasting.
 &HT;    ``If you need a dumb actress to play a dumb part, that's really,
really sad,'' Driver says. ``Just don't call me.''
 &HT;    On the set she's quick to offer her opinion, whether or not it's
been asked for.
 &HT;    ``That's definitely true,'' Driver says. ``I don't feel like
there is anything at all that can't be said on a set. I don't think
one needs to defend herself for making a movie better.
 &HT;    ``People should know what you think,'' the actress adds. ``I'm
not the type of person who allows herself to blow in the wind while
others wonder what I'm thinking. This way when I'm old, I will have
no regrets.''
 &HT;    That applies to her love life as well, which has featured
several of the most eligible young men in Hollywood, including Matt
Damon, John Cusack and, for the past two years, Josh Brolin. She's
been portrayed as unlucky in love, but she won't have any sympathy.
 &HT;    ``With love there are so many permutations of it,'' she muses.
``I don't think there is any equation out there that explains it.
It's varied and completely unpredictable. It's a force of nature.
 &HT;    ``I also believe in timing,'' she adds thoughtfully. ``I don't
believe in there being just one person out there who is perfect for
you. I think there might be many people, who you may have even been
with, but you simply were not ready. Or they were not ready to be
with you.
 &HT;    ``I think a lot of forces have to align for us to recognize love
and accept it into our lives.''
 &HT;    It's particularly hard if, as was the case with her breakup with
Damon, the whole country is watching it happen.
 &HT;    ``Fame is a big drag,'' Driver says with a sigh. ``It totally
goes with the territory. Every actor with a burgeoning career in
Hollywood should go read `Faust.' It's true. It's the most
brilliant parable _ there is a pact that is made. It's part of the
deal.
 &HT;    ``You can whine about it until you're blue in the face,'' she
says, ``but you keep showing up at the premieres and wearing the
nice dresses. The light bulbs pop in your face because you put
yourself in that position. At times you feel very lucky. At other
times the whole situations seems unfortunate, if all you want to do
is act and not deal with the hoopla.''
 &HT;    She may be candid in her opinions, but Driver makes clear that
she won't be sharing any details about her life with Brolin or
about her possible future mother-in-law, Barbra Streisand. Like
many of the actors she most admires, she wants to keep her private
life private.
 &HT;    ``How much do you really know about Harrison Ford? How much do
you know about Jodie Foster?'' she says. ``How much do you really
know about Meryl Streep or Robert De Niro? That gives me hope that
you can keep a tiny part of your life for yourself.
 &HT;    ``I know people are interested in my private life, which is
flattering,'' she says. ``But if I keep my mouth shut, five minutes
will go by and we will be on to the next thing.''
 &HT;    As to her future, Driver has some new areas of interest.
 &HT;    ``One day I would like to write a script,'' she says, ``or maybe
even direct. I just need to find the discipline I found in acting
with these forms.''
 &HT;    Until then, however, she plans to keep acting and try to keep a
level head _ if only to keep her fellow Brits satisfied.
 &HT;    ``Over there they accuse me of being lost to Hollywood,'' Driver
says, rolling her eyes. ``I recently did a talk show and people
realized, `Oh, she's the same old Minnie.'''

DR. DRE: THE DOCTOR IS (WAY) OUT
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of rapper Dr. Dre.) 
 By GARY GRAFF 
 c.2000 Gary Graff 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    He came. He saw. He conquered.
 &HT;    And, most important, Dr. Dre did not go ``Up in Smoke,'' as his
critics had warned he would, when he took his gangsta-rap tour of
that name on the road during the past summer.
 &HT;    In fact, Dre _ a gangsta-rap pioneer with the group N.W.A. and
the producer of multiplatinum artists such as Eminem and Snoop Dogg
_ found himself helming one of the year's box-office hits.
Ostensibly launched to promote Dre's second solo album, the
five-times-platinum ``Dr. Dre 2000,'' ``Up in Smoke'' played to
521,000 fans in racially mixed crowds and grossed more than $24
million during its 45-date run, making it one of the most
successful hip-hop tours ever.
 &HT;    There were also no major incidents of lawlessness or misconduct
at any of the shows, which also featured Eminem, Ice Cube and
Warren G, among others. Only a move by the Detroit city government
to ban the violent, sexually explicit videos used during Dre and
Snoop's sets _ a ban currently the subject of a civil-rights
lawsuit filed against the city by Dre _ marred the otherwise smooth
concert run.
 &HT;    And Dre doesn't mind basking in the satisfaction of having
proved the naysayers wrong while also providing a very in-your-face
reminder of hip-hop's appeal.
 &HT;    ``It's real simple _ the music is hot,'' says the 35-year-old
Dre, who was born Andre Young in Compton, Calif. ``And it's
interesting. The stuff we're doing right now is different than
anything anybody else is doing. And I think when it's good, no
matter who you are or where you're from or what color you are,
you're going to get into it.
 &HT;    ``Everybody enjoys this music, no matter what the critics are
saying or anything like that,'' he says. ``And it's getting bigger
and bigger every year. I think it's going to be even bigger than it
is right now _ I think, in the years to come, you're going to be
able to see hip-hop shows played in stadiums.''
 &HT;    The tour wasn't without its share of controversy, though the
concerts themselves weren't disrupted. Prior to the tour's mid-June
start, Eminem faced gun and assault charges in two separate
suburban Detroit municipalities. Free on bond, he's slated to go to
trial during the early fall. Meanwhile, his wife attempted suicide
while the tour was in Detroit, and the couple subsequently decided
to divorce.
 &HT;    As if that weren't enough, a member of Snoop Dogg's entourage
received a misdemeanor citation for possession of marijuana during
a routine border stop after the tour's first date in San Diego, and
Nate Dogg was arrested on charges of kidnapping, making terrorist
threats, domestic violence and arson. He's free on $1 million bail.
 &HT;    So the shadow of gangsta rap's violent reputation hung over the
tour like a cloud of the chronic smoke that's celebrated in many of
the performer's songs. But Dre says that the performances eclipsed
any side issues.
 &HT;    ``I wanted it to stay high-energy,'' he says. ``I wanted people
to not want to take their eyes off the stage because they might
miss something.''
 &HT;    Dre says the morale on the tour remained high, despite the
numerous distractions. Many of the acts record for his
Aftermath/Interscope label, he notes, and he's worked on all of
their albums, which made camaraderie easier to come by.
 &HT;    ``This was the perfect tour with the perfect people,'' he says,
``and everybody was family on this. Everybody was helping out with
each other's problems, even. It's just a lot of fun.''
 &HT;    Dre _ who has a criminal record of his own _ has also tried to
offer an offstage hand to Eminem, whose second album, ``The
Marshall Mathers LP,'' had a six-week run at No. 1 during the late
spring.
 &HT;    ``I've just told him about the things that I went through and
had to deal with,'' says Dre, who lives with his wife and six
children in California's San Fernando Valley. ``It's really not
worth it _ for the couple of minutes it took you to get in trouble,
you could spend the rest of your life trying to get out of it. It
took me years upon years to get out of the few incidents that I
had.
 &HT;    ``So I just tried to tell him, and he definitely understands,''
Dre says. ``I think he's on the right path now. We're in the
position right now where we can not only build for ourselves, but
build for generations to come. We're in a position to make a lot of
money and leave something here for our kids and their kids.
 &HT;    ``Why f--k it up over some nonsense?''
 &HT;    With ``Up in Smoke'' in the history books _ although a European
tour is possible, as is a live album or home video _ Dre is
focusing on making new music. He's working with a number of acts,
including younger rappers such as Xzibit and Hitman, as well as an
R&AMP;B singer dubbed Truth Hurts, all of whom are recording albums.
 &HT;    But the most exciting prospect, he says, is a reunion of N.W.A.,
the controversial rap group that broke up during the early 1990s
after three platinum albums. Most of the group got back together to
close the ``Up in Smoke'' shows, however, with Snoop Dogg standing
in for the late Eazy-E.
 &HT;    Dre says a new album is indeed in the offing. The group members
are working on new material on the road, and will bring in the
group's fifth member, DJ Yella, when the tour ends later this year.
And while past opponents may not be cheering N.W.A.'s return, Dre
figures that in a mainstream market that's embraced hip-hop as a
commercial force, it should be viewed as a major musical event.
 &HT;    ``There's a few things written,'' Dre says. ``We've all sat
around already and tried to draw up a few blueprints for songs. We
have some ideas _ I have a few ideas for tracks, Cube has a few
ideas for songs and we're just going to get in there and mix it up
and see what happens. We have an idea that we really want to work
with Rage Against the Machine on. We would love to tour with those
guys.
 &HT;    ``We're definitely going to keep our edge,'' Dre says. ``We're
definitely going to come out and say a few shocking things. We plan
to say a couple of things that'll make Eminem raise an eyebrow or
two. I think we can do it.''
 &HT;    The rapper/producer adds that the ``Up in Smoke'' tour has also
inspired him to make new music for himself. If all goes well, a
successor to ``Dr. Dre 2000'' ought to take less than the seven
years it took Dre to follow up his solo debut, ``The Chronic.''
 &HT;    ``Before I came out here on the road, I had in my mind I was
never going to do another solo album,'' he says. ``Now I'm thinking
about it. Being here has motivated me enough to make me want to go
back in the studio.''
 &HT;    But if he does come out with another Dre album, he promises it
will be markedly different than its predecessors.
 &HT;    ``I can't come back with `The Chronic 3' or something like
that,'' Dre says. ``It'll definitely be something totally
different. I have an idea what I want to do. It's going to be a
concept album _ I like to say the music will sound like a mixture
between Kraftwerk and George Clinton.
 &HT;    ``Now, that will be pretty wild.''

GETTING TUBULAR: A PREVIEW OF FALL'S TOP TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color photo of Geena Davis in a scene from ``The Geena
Davis Show.'') 
 By THE STAFF OF TV GUIDE CANADA 
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    Fall is upon us, and with it the arrival of the latest
television shows _ one or two, perhaps, destined for pop-cultural
immortality, another handful for a run of several years and the
rest for the dustheap of television history.
 &HT;    Here's our predictions, admittedly highly subjective, of which
might end up in which pile. 
 -0- 
 BETTE (CBS)  
 &HT;    Premise: The Divine Miss M takes her larger-than-life persona to
the small screen in a self-parodic orgy co-starring Kevin Dunn as
her husband Roy, Lindsay Lohan as their teen-age daughter and
Joanna Gleason as Midler's manager.
 &HT;    Assets: Midler herself, of course, and an outstanding supporting
cast.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Some worry that the diva act will get on some
viewers' nerves.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: An eagerly anticipated powerhouse that looks likely
to deliver on its promise. 
 -0- 
 BOSTON PUBLIC (Fox)  
 &HT;    Premise: At a suburban high school, teachers _ including Fyvush
Finkel of ``Picket Fences'' _ struggle to help shape the futures of
their pupils.
 &HT;    Assets: Producer David E. Kelley, who created ``Chicago Hope,''
``The Practice,'' ``Picket Fences'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' has an
impressive batting average.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Kelley also created last season's ``Snoops.''
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Kelley seems to be aiming for the earnest timber of
``The Practice'' instead of the kookiness of ``Ally'' or
``Snoops.'' Good choice. 
 -0- 
 DARK ANGEL (Fox)  
 &HT;    Premise: James Cameron's television original casts Jessica Alba
as a genetically enhanced fugitive in a dark, near-future America,
aided by idealistic journalist Logan Cale (Michael Weatherly) and
pursued by the mysterious Lydecker (John Savage).
 &HT;    Assets: Alba should become a major breakout star, along the
lines of Sarah Michelle Gellar and Katie Holmes. The show itself is
sharp and well-crafted.
 &HT;    Liabilities: ``Dark Angel'' is scheduled against ``Angel,''
which attracts the same audience, as well as ``Frasier,'' ``Dharma
&AMP; Greg'' and ``The Drew Carey Show.''
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Cameron knows science fiction _ he made ``Aliens''
(1986) and the ``Terminator'' movies _ but this is a dark, complex
story that may be a hard sell. 
 -0- 
 ED (NBC)  
 &HT;    Premise: Ed Stevens (Tom Cavanagh) loses his job and his wife on
the same day, and decides to move back to his hometown.
 &HT;    Assets: Ed has the small-town magic of ``Northern Exposure,''
while Cavanagh and Julie Bowen, as his high-school sweetheart, make
an engaging couple.
 &HT;    Liabilities: A lot is riding on the untested Cavanagh's
likability.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Viewers will take a while to discover ``Ed,'' as
they did with ``Providence.'' But, once they do, they'll fall for
its charms. 
 -0- 
 THE FUGITIVE (CBS)  
 &HT;    Premise: Dr. Richard Kimble (Tim Daly), the one-armed man, a
pursuing lawman (Mykelti Williamson) ... you know the drill.
 &HT;    Assets: A fantastic cast gives this remake a real edge.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Viewers may feel they've seen it all before.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Good television never goes out of style, and this
smart update will keep the premise fresh enough to win over
viewers. ``The Fugitive'' could be the crossover hit that CBS is
hoping for. 
 -0- 
 THE GEENA DAVIS SHOW (ABC)  
 &HT;    Premise: Teddie Cochran (Davis) is a single New Yorker who meets
the man of her dreams (Peter Horton) and ends up engaged and living
with him, his two kids and his stern housekeeper in _ gulp! _ the
suburbs.
 &HT;    Assets: Davis and Horton, still beloved by fans of
``thirtysomething,'' have great chemistry.
 &HT;    Liabilities: It's a little tough to embrace Davis in such a
sublimated role.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Similarities to ``Sex and the City'' don't work to
the show's advantage. The romance works, but laughs could be in
short supply. 
 -0- 
 GIDEON'S CROSSING (ABC)  
 &HT;    Premise: The saga of Ben Gideon (Andre Braugher), a doctor with
enormous talent, a massive ego and a knack for getting involved in
his patients' lives.
 &HT;    Assets: Braugher is the big draw here, and fans of ``Homicide''
are sure to tune in. A large, intelligently chosen ensemble cast is
another plus.
 &HT;    Liabilities: The brooding camerawork and quiet, slowly paced
dialogue may pall on clicker-happy viewers.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Dark, verbose and ultimately rather boring. Our
diagnosis? Lighten up... stat! 
 -0- 
 GROSSE POINTE (WB)  
 &HT;    Premise: A ``Larry Sanders''-esque backstage saga of the
production of a contrived teen show about privileged kids in a
snooty American town, from ``Beverly Hills 90210'' producer Darren
Star.
 &HT;    Assets: Lots of insider dirt on ''90210'' and ``Melrose Place,''
plus Star's willingness to exploit them.
 &HT;    Liabilities: The pilot allegedly angered Aaron Spelling, Tori
Spelling and Shannen Doherty so much that Spelling Sr. called Star
personally to demand changes. Star agreed _ and any caution could
doom ``Grosse Pointe.''
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Who better than Star to skewer the ridiculousness
of teen TV? But it may be hard to keep coming up with new angles. 
 -0- 
 MADIGAN MEN (ABC)  
 &HT;    Premise: Successful, newly divorced Ben Madigan (Gabriel Byrne)
struggles to raise his teen-age son (John Hensley) in New York.
Matters get complicated when his crusty Irish dad, Seamus (Roy
Dotrice), arrives looking for a place to stay.
 &HT;    Assets: The acting and writing are top notch, and Byrne is
highly likable in a low-key, Anthony Edwards kind of way.
 &HT;    Liabilities: The tone of the show is rather quiet, going for
amusing more than flat-out funny. That may change, however.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Critical reviews will be positive, but that rarely
jibes with viewer reaction. 
 -0- 
 THE MICHAEL RICHARDS SHOW (NBC)  
 &HT;    Premise: Bumbling private eye (Richards) tries to carve out a
career in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Assets: Richards is a genius when it comes to physical comedy.
 &HT;    Liabilities: While casting isn't yet complete, the lineup so far
_ including William Devane, Tim Meadows and Bill Cobbs _is
guy-heavy.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Seems like a good bet, if viewers will accept
Richards in a role other than Kramer. We're pretty sure that they
will. 
 -0- 
 NIGHT VISIONS (Fox)  
 &HT;    Premise: Like ``The Twilight Zone,'' this series will feature a
new, creepy story each week _ or, in this case, two per week _ with
marquee actors and directors. Among the stars scheduled to appear:
Gil Bellows, Brian Dennehy, Cary Elwes, Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman
and Aidan Quinn.
 &HT;    Assets: It's been a while since we've seen an original,
big-budget anthology show like this.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Anthology shows are by definition inconsistent.
Still, this one should have a good batting average.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Good, old-fashioned, shiver-inducing fun that
should score with viewers. 
 -0- 
 TITANS (NBC)  
 &HT;    Premise: Superwealthy, bitter divorcees (Perry King and Victoria
Principal) battle for the affections of their children, including
their prodigal son (Casper Van Dien). Then mix in a sexy tramp
(Yasmine Bleeth), who's engaged to dad but recently slept with
junior. In other words, soapy.
 &HT;    Assets: Bleeth and Principal are ideally suited to insanely
over-the-top proceedings.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Van Dien is wooden, and the story line is awfully
silly.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Soap bubbles will soon be washed up. 
 -0- 
 WELCOME TO NEW YORK (CBS)  
 &HT;    Premise: An Indiana weatherman (Jim Gaffigan) joins a New York
morning show run by a hotshot producer (Christine Baranski), and
culture clashes ensue.
 &HT;    Assets: A great cast _ not only the likable Gaffigan and the
rapier-sharp Baranski, but also Sara Gilbert and Rocky Carroll.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Gaffigan is talented, but he's a no-name who won't
help CBS hype the show.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: With ``Spin City'' deprived of Michael J. Fox,
``Welcome To New York: could become the next workplace-comedy hit.

GRAY EMINENCES: GENE HACKMAN FENCES WITH MORGAN FREEMAN IN `UNDER
SUSPICION'

 (Includes a color photo of Gene Hackman with Monica Bellucci in a
scene from ``Under Suspicion.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING 
 c.2000 Ian Spelling 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    Actors come and go in Hollywood.
 &HT;    Some burn brightly for a while and then fade away. Others never
quite make it, but survive on the fringes as supporting players.
It's the way of the world.
 &HT;    And then there are those rare few who defy the rules, who attain
a measure of stardom as character actors/leading men and stick
around seemingly forever. Gene Hackman is one such actor, and his
longevity in this eat-them-up-and-spit-them-out industry surprises
no one more than Hackman himself.
 &HT;    ``It especially crosses my mind when I have to go to see a film
I'm in,'' he says. ``I look at who that person is and I think, `My
God, why would anyone pay to see me?'
 &HT;    ``I also recognize the fact that I'm not objective at all about
my work, about watching my work,'' Hackman says. ``I can be very
objective about my work when I'm doing it, I think. At least I know
if it works or not when I'm doing it.
 &HT;    ``Once I get away from that and I'm looking at an image on the
screen, that's somebody else _ it's my great-grandfather.''
 &HT;    At 69, Hackman remains one of Hollywood's busiest and most
versatile actors. In the past couple of years alone, he has
appeared in the thriller ``Enemy of the People'' (1998), the
private-eye drama ``Twilight'' (1998) and the current football
comedy ``The Replacements,'' as well as ``Under Suspicion,'' set to
open in limited release on Sept. 22.
 &HT;    ``When I choose a film I don't choose it in terms of quality, I
choose it in terms of story,'' he says cryptically. ``There may be
a contradiction there.''
 &HT;    Hackman, sitting in a conference room at New York's Essex House,
smiles and shrugs.
 &HT;    ``If you have a strong enough sense of story about yourself and
your character, then the quality will take care of itself,'' he
says. ``Something will come out of that, because you've done it
strongly enough and honestly enough.''
 &HT;    There may be a contradiction there, too, but it helps explain
why Hackman committed to ``Under Suspicion.'' A remake of the
French drama ``Garde A'Vue,'' it casts Hackman as Henry Hearst, a
prominent tax attorney, and Morgan Freeman, Hackman's co-star in
``Unforgiven'' (1992), as Victor Benezet, captain of the police
department on the Caribbean island where both men live.
 &HT;    Benezet at first chats amiably about a high-profile murder case,
then zeros in on Hearst as the prime suspect. Over the course of a
single night the two men engage in a wily game of bluffs and
attacks, with Hearst's comely, much younger wife (Monica Pellucid)
and Benezet's overzealous underling (Thomas Jane) serving as vital
pawns.
 &HT;    ``I loved the origina French film,'' says Hackman, who joined
Freeman as co-executive producers of the remake. ``I saw it with my
daughter almost 17 years ago. It was not a success in the United
States, but it was a huge hit in France.
 &HT;    ``I liked the idea of playing (Hearst),'' the actor says. ``He's
different from other roles I've played. He's a very successful guy,
but you wouldn't necessarily want him as your best friend, because
of his vanity and whatever else. The hairpiece falling off and all
of that was fun to play.''
 &HT;    Hackman describes ``Under Suspicion'' as being about prejudice,
but not in the sense that Hearst is white and Benezet is black.
 &HT;    ``It has to do with prejudice in terms of one's perception of
who people are and how we make mistakes in terms of being too quick
to judge merely because of lifestyles and money,'' he says, rubbing
at his scruffy gray beard. ``I liked that idea.''
 &HT;    Hackman, however, did not particularly enjoy producing the film.
In general, he says, he finds that splitting his focus detracts
from his performance. Moreover, it took years to get ``Under
Suspicion'' off the ground.
 &HT;    ``I was so tired of being turned down by a variety of people,
both actors and producers,'' Hackman says with a pained grimace.
``I still believed in the film, but I didn't think I could go on
with it after so long. I gave it to Morgan, and it took him two
years to find money, and he had a production company in place. He
found the money to do it, and it's a very low-budget film.
 &HT;    ``Morgan is a pro,'' Hackman says warmly. ``He's always
prepared, always knows what he's doing, but not in a rigid way.
He's able to shift.''
 &HT;    Hackman, too, can shift, as he's proven through the years by
amassing such credits as ``Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967), ``The French
Connection'' (1971), ``Night Moves'' (1975), ``Superman'' (1978),
``The Firm'' (1993), ``Crimson Tide'' (1995) and ``The Birdcage''
(1996), as well as his more recent films.
 &HT;    A five-time Oscar nominee, Hackman took home statuettes as Best
Actor for ``The French Connection'' and Best Supporting Actor for
``Unforgiven,'' but considers ``Scarecrow'' (1973) and ``The
Conversation'' (1974) his most underrated films.
 &HT;    By now, one might think, acting comes easy for Hackman, but he
insists that such is not the case.
 &HT;    ``In a funny way, it's harder,'' he says. ``I realize how much
I've left out, things I wish I hadn't done. So I'm more tormented
by acting, but I still love it.
 &HT;    ``In some ways I'm too quick to a shorthand, and yet I probably
work harder now than I ever have on each film,'' he adds. ``That's
probably because I realize that there are only a limited number of
films I have left in me, and I want to make them the best I can.''
 &HT;    Hackman is currently shooting ``The Heist,'' a caper film
written and directed by playwright David Mamet, and then will move
on to a military drama entitled ``Behind Enemy Lines.'' Already in
the can and awaiting release is ``Breakers,'' a comedy with
Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt as mother-and-daughter
grifters.
 &HT;    ``I play an 80-year-old billionaire tobacco tycoon,'' Hackman
says. ``I constantly have a cigarette in my mouth. I'm always
coughing and blowing off billows of smoke.
 &HT;    ``It was great fun,'' he says, chuckling. ``I probably went too
far with it.''
 &HT;    Actors who feel time slipping away often covet a ``King
Lear''-like part that will send them out on a high note. Hackman,
again going against the grain, feels no such compulsion.
 &HT;    ``My career is diverse enough that it would be fine if it
continued as it is now,'' says the actor, who lives in Santa Fe,
N.M., with his family and recently wrote his first novel, ``Wake of
the Perdido Star'' (Newmarket Press, 1999), with Daniel Lenihan.
``I like taking what's offered to me, as opposed to going out and
trying to develop something I think I'll be terrific in.
 &HT;    ``Many times you can find out what people think about you by
what's offered to you,'' he says. ``I'm being offered pretty much
the same kinds of roles I've always been offered, just with a
little more gray in them.''

THOROUGHLY MOUSE-LESS MINNIE: MINNIE DRIVER ON LIFE, LOVE AND THE

 (Includes a color photo of Minnie Driver in a scene from
``Beautiful.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN 
 c.2000 Cindy Pearlman 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    Her name may be Minnie, but Minnie Driver is anything but
mouselike. Seemingly an island of togetherness in a sea of
Hollywood neurosis, she handles whatever comes her way, even if
it's a little ... well, weird.
 &HT;    Like the autograph hounds who accosted her recently in Los
Angeles, shouting ``We just love your work, Janeane!'''
 &HT;    Janeane?
 &HT;    ``People think I'm Janeane Garofalo a lot,'' Driver says with a
shrug. ``I don't know what it is. Maybe we're both quirky-looking
girls.''
 &HT;    Quirky enough that she apparently even looks like herself.
 &HT;    ``The other day, I got, `Oh, you look an awful lot like Minnie
Driver,''' she recalls. ``So in a most humorous way I said, `Oh,
thank you. I hear she's a great actress.'
 &HT;    ``The other person said, `Nah, I didn't like that last movie she
was in _ it was a piece of junk!'''
 &HT;    Driver sighs, and turns her attention to breakfast at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, where the tall, thin actress with the
mass of dark curls has come to talk about her latest film,
``Beautiful,'' opening nationwide on Sept. 22.
 &HT;    In the film, directed by Sally Field, Driver _ whose looks are
often described as ``quirky'' or ``unconventional,'' though by the
standards of anywhere but Hollywood she's a knockout _ plays a
young woman who is obsessed with beauty pageants.
 &HT;    The 29-year-old actress plays the character starting at age 18.
 &HT;    ``Believe me, that was a rough one,'' she says, laughing. ``I
gave the cameraman some gauze to put over the lens.''
 &HT;    Driver isn't a pageant buff, and had to learn a lot about it in
a hurry.
 &HT;    ``Those girls who compete in these beauty shows have it rough,''
the actress says. ``The competition is cutthroat, and you have to
learn all the tricks.''
 &HT;    Those tricks can be astoundingly detailed, she adds.
 &HT;    ``It always helps if you spray your bum with water before
putting on tights, so your butt is lifted,'' she says. ``You also
need to grease your teeth with Vasoline for that perfect wide
smile.''
 &HT;    Field, who is making her feature debut as a director, obviously
knows the other side of the camera intimately: She's a two-time
Oscar-winning actress, and brought that to her work on
``Beautiful.''
 &HT;    ``Sally was an amazing director,'' Driver says. ``She knows
exactly what you need to be in the moment as an actress, because
she is one of the best actresses to ever grace the screen. I could
tell by just looking at Sally for a nanosecond if she was pleased
with what I was doing.''
 &HT;    The idea of Driver anxiously seeking reassurance may surprise
those who know her public persona as a poised, self-confident Brit
who navigates Hollywood with no anxieties and the stiffest of upper
lips.
 &HT;    ``For some reason people don't think I have a care in the world,
which is not true,'' Driver says. ``People think I lead some
charmed existence, and I can't believe it. My life is not perfect.
There's always something inside that's troubling.
 &HT;    ``I'm just like you,'' she continues. ``Everybody has got some
worries. But as young actresses, we're packaged to keep people
coming to movies. We're molded to make other people want to be like
us or be us. It's just the fantasy of Hollywood.''
 &HT;    The child of divorced parents, Driver grew up in London with her
mother, a model and writer. She also spent time with her father, a
financial adviser who lived in the Caribbean. It was while
attending boarding school that she first found herself onstage.
 &HT;    ``I always loved writing,'' she recalls. ``That was so much a
reason of why I acted. I started out writing, and I was so
encouraged to create and use my imagination. My English teachers at
school inspired me to be so creative and free.''
 &HT;    Driver's big break came with the charming English drama ``Circle
of Friends'' (1995), in which she played the overweight Benny
opposite a young, handsome Chris O'Donnell. Among her later credits
are ``Good Will Hunting'' (1997), ``Hard Rain'' (1998) and ``Grosse
Pointe Blank'' (1997). Her most recent outing was opposite David
Duchovny in ``Return to Me'' (1999).
 &HT;    She's usually cast as smart, intense women who defy convention _
which, according to those who work with her, is pretty much
typecasting.
 &HT;    ``If you need a dumb actress to play a dumb part, that's really,
really sad,'' Driver says. ``Just don't call me.''
 &HT;    On the set she's quick to offer her opinion, whether or not it's
been asked for.
 &HT;    ``That's definitely true,'' Driver says. ``I don't feel like
there is anything at all that can't be said on a set. I don't think
one needs to defend herself for making a movie better.
 &HT;    ``People should know what you think,'' the actress adds. ``I'm
not the type of person who allows herself to blow in the wind while
others wonder what I'm thinking. This way when I'm old, I will have
no regrets.''
 &HT;    That applies to her love life as well, which has featured
several of the most eligible young men in Hollywood, including Matt
Damon, John Cusack and, for the past two years, Josh Brolin. She's
been portrayed as unlucky in love, but she won't have any sympathy.
 &HT;    ``With love there are so many permutations of it,'' she muses.
``I don't think there is any equation out there that explains it.
It's varied and completely unpredictable. It's a force of nature.
 &HT;    ``I also believe in timing,'' she adds thoughtfully. ``I don't
believe in there being just one person out there who is perfect for
you. I think there might be many people, who you may have even been
with, but you simply were not ready. Or they were not ready to be
with you.
 &HT;    ``I think a lot of forces have to align for us to recognize love
and accept it into our lives.''
 &HT;    It's particularly hard if, as was the case with her breakup with
Damon, the whole country is watching it happen.
 &HT;    ``Fame is a big drag,'' Driver says with a sigh. ``It totally
goes with the territory. Every actor with a burgeoning career in
Hollywood should go read `Faust.' It's true. It's the most
brilliant parable _ there is a pact that is made. It's part of the
deal.
 &HT;    ``You can whine about it until you're blue in the face,'' she
says, ``but you keep showing up at the premieres and wearing the
nice dresses. The light bulbs pop in your face because you put
yourself in that position. At times you feel very lucky. At other
times the whole situations seems unfortunate, if all you want to do
is act and not deal with the hoopla.''
 &HT;    She may be candid in her opinions, but Driver makes clear that
she won't be sharing any details about her life with Brolin or
about her possible future mother-in-law, Barbra Streisand. Like
many of the actors she most admires, she wants to keep her private
life private.
 &HT;    ``How much do you really know about Harrison Ford? How much do
you know about Jodie Foster?'' she says. ``How much do you really
know about Meryl Streep or Robert De Niro? That gives me hope that
you can keep a tiny part of your life for yourself.
 &HT;    ``I know people are interested in my private life, which is
flattering,'' she says. ``But if I keep my mouth shut, five minutes
will go by and we will be on to the next thing.''
 &HT;    As to her future, Driver has some new areas of interest.
 &HT;    ``One day I would like to write a script,'' she says, ``or maybe
even direct. I just need to find the discipline I found in acting
with these forms.''
 &HT;    Until then, however, she plans to keep acting and try to keep a
level head _ if only to keep her fellow Brits satisfied.
 &HT;    ``Over there they accuse me of being lost to Hollywood,'' Driver
says, rolling her eyes. ``I recently did a talk show and people
realized, `Oh, she's the same old Minnie.'''

DR. DRE: THE DOCTOR IS (WAY) OUT

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of rapper Dr. Dre.) 
 By GARY GRAFF 
 c.2000 Gary Graff 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    He came. He saw. He conquered.
 &HT;    And, most important, Dr. Dre did not go ``Up in Smoke,'' as his
critics had warned he would, when he took his gangsta-rap tour of
that name on the road during the past summer.
 &HT;    In fact, Dre _ a gangsta-rap pioneer with the group N.W.A. and
the producer of multiplatinum artists such as Eminem and Snoop Dogg
_ found himself helming one of the year's box-office hits.
Ostensibly launched to promote Dre's second solo album, the
five-times-platinum ``Dr. Dre 2000,'' ``Up in Smoke'' played to
521,000 fans in racially mixed crowds and grossed more than $24
million during its 45-date run, making it one of the most
successful hip-hop tours ever.
 &HT;    There were also no major incidents of lawlessness or misconduct
at any of the shows, which also featured Eminem, Ice Cube and
Warren G, among others. Only a move by the Detroit city government
to ban the violent, sexually explicit videos used during Dre and
Snoop's sets _ a ban currently the subject of a civil-rights
lawsuit filed against the city by Dre _ marred the otherwise smooth
concert run.
 &HT;    And Dre doesn't mind basking in the satisfaction of having
proved the naysayers wrong while also providing a very in-your-face
reminder of hip-hop's appeal.
 &HT;    ``It's real simple _ the music is hot,'' says the 35-year-old
Dre, who was born Andre Young in Compton, Calif. ``And it's
interesting. The stuff we're doing right now is different than
anything anybody else is doing. And I think when it's good, no
matter who you are or where you're from or what color you are,
you're going to get into it.
 &HT;    ``Everybody enjoys this music, no matter what the critics are
saying or anything like that,'' he says. ``And it's getting bigger
and bigger every year. I think it's going to be even bigger than it
is right now _ I think, in the years to come, you're going to be
able to see hip-hop shows played in stadiums.''
 &HT;    The tour wasn't without its share of controversy, though the
concerts themselves weren't disrupted. Prior to the tour's mid-June
start, Eminem faced gun and assault charges in two separate
suburban Detroit municipalities. Free on bond, he's slated to go to
trial during the early fall. Meanwhile, his wife attempted suicide
while the tour was in Detroit, and the couple subsequently decided
to divorce.
 &HT;    As if that weren't enough, a member of Snoop Dogg's entourage
received a misdemeanor citation for possession of marijuana during
a routine border stop after the tour's first date in San Diego, and
Nate Dogg was arrested on charges of kidnapping, making terrorist
threats, domestic violence and arson. He's free on $1 million bail.
 &HT;    So the shadow of gangsta rap's violent reputation hung over the
tour like a cloud of the chronic smoke that's celebrated in many of
the performer's songs. But Dre says that the performances eclipsed
any side issues.
 &HT;    ``I wanted it to stay high-energy,'' he says. ``I wanted people
to not want to take their eyes off the stage because they might
miss something.''
 &HT;    Dre says the morale on the tour remained high, despite the
numerous distractions. Many of the acts record for his
Aftermath/Interscope label, he notes, and he's worked on all of
their albums, which made camaraderie easier to come by.
 &HT;    ``This was the perfect tour with the perfect people,'' he says,
``and everybody was family on this. Everybody was helping out with
each other's problems, even. It's just a lot of fun.''
 &HT;    Dre _ who has a criminal record of his own _ has also tried to
offer an offstage hand to Eminem, whose second album, ``The
Marshall Mathers LP,'' had a six-week run at No. 1 during the late
spring.
 &HT;    ``I've just told him about the things that I went through and
had to deal with,'' says Dre, who lives with his wife and six
children in California's San Fernando Valley. ``It's really not
worth it _ for the couple of minutes it took you to get in trouble,
you could spend the rest of your life trying to get out of it. It
took me years upon years to get out of the few incidents that I
had.
 &HT;    ``So I just tried to tell him, and he definitely understands,''
Dre says. ``I think he's on the right path now. We're in the
position right now where we can not only build for ourselves, but
build for generations to come. We're in a position to make a lot of
money and leave something here for our kids and their kids.
 &HT;    ``Why f--k it up over some nonsense?''
 &HT;    With ``Up in Smoke'' in the history books _ although a European
tour is possible, as is a live album or home video _ Dre is
focusing on making new music. He's working with a number of acts,
including younger rappers such as Xzibit and Hitman, as well as an
R&AMP;B singer dubbed Truth Hurts, all of whom are recording albums.
 &HT;    But the most exciting prospect, he says, is a reunion of N.W.A.,
the controversial rap group that broke up during the early 1990s
after three platinum albums. Most of the group got back together to
close the ``Up in Smoke'' shows, however, with Snoop Dogg standing
in for the late Eazy-E.
 &HT;    Dre says a new album is indeed in the offing. The group members
are working on new material on the road, and will bring in the
group's fifth member, DJ Yella, when the tour ends later this year.
And while past opponents may not be cheering N.W.A.'s return, Dre
figures that in a mainstream market that's embraced hip-hop as a
commercial force, it should be viewed as a major musical event.
 &HT;    ``There's a few things written,'' Dre says. ``We've all sat
around already and tried to draw up a few blueprints for songs. We
have some ideas _ I have a few ideas for tracks, Cube has a few
ideas for songs and we're just going to get in there and mix it up
and see what happens. We have an idea that we really want to work
with Rage Against the Machine on. We would love to tour with those
guys.
 &HT;    ``We're definitely going to keep our edge,'' Dre says. ``We're
definitely going to come out and say a few shocking things. We plan
to say a couple of things that'll make Eminem raise an eyebrow or
two. I think we can do it.''
 &HT;    The rapper/producer adds that the ``Up in Smoke'' tour has also
inspired him to make new music for himself. If all goes well, a
successor to ``Dr. Dre 2000'' ought to take less than the seven
years it took Dre to follow up his solo debut, ``The Chronic.''
 &HT;    ``Before I came out here on the road, I had in my mind I was
never going to do another solo album,'' he says. ``Now I'm thinking
about it. Being here has motivated me enough to make me want to go
back in the studio.''
 &HT;    But if he does come out with another Dre album, he promises it
will be markedly different than its predecessors.
 &HT;    ``I can't come back with `The Chronic 3' or something like
that,'' Dre says. ``It'll definitely be something totally
different. I have an idea what I want to do. It's going to be a
concept album _ I like to say the music will sound like a mixture
between Kraftwerk and George Clinton.
 &HT;    ``Now, that will be pretty wild.''

 By THE STAFF OF TV GUIDE CANADA 
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    Fall is upon us, and with it the arrival of the latest
television shows _ one or two, perhaps, destined for pop-cultural
immortality, another handful for a run of several years and the
rest for the dustheap of television history.
 &HT;    Here's our predictions, admittedly highly subjective, of which
might end up in which pile. 
 -0- 
 BETTE (CBS)  
 &HT;    Premise: The Divine Miss M takes her larger-than-life persona to
the small screen in a self-parodic orgy co-starring Kevin Dunn as
her husband Roy, Lindsay Lohan as their teen-age daughter and
Joanna Gleason as Midler's manager.
 &HT;    Assets: Midler herself, of course, and an outstanding supporting
cast.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Some worry that the diva act will get on some
viewers' nerves.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: An eagerly anticipated powerhouse that looks likely
to deliver on its promise. 
 -0- 
 BOSTON PUBLIC (Fox)  
 &HT;    Premise: At a suburban high school, teachers _ including Fyvush
Finkel of ``Picket Fences'' _ struggle to help shape the futures of
their pupils.
 &HT;    Assets: Producer David E. Kelley, who created ``Chicago Hope,''
``The Practice,'' ``Picket Fences'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' has an
impressive batting average.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Kelley also created last season's ``Snoops.''
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Kelley seems to be aiming for the earnest timber of
``The Practice'' instead of the kookiness of ``Ally'' or
``Snoops.'' Good choice. 
 -0- 
 DARK ANGEL (Fox)  
 &HT;    Premise: James Cameron's television original casts Jessica Alba
as a genetically enhanced fugitive in a dark, near-future America,
aided by idealistic journalist Logan Cale (Michael Weatherly) and
pursued by the mysterious Lydecker (John Savage).
 &HT;    Assets: Alba should become a major breakout star, along the
lines of Sarah Michelle Gellar and Katie Holmes. The show itself is
sharp and well-crafted.
 &HT;    Liabilities: ``Dark Angel'' is scheduled against ``Angel,''
which attracts the same audience, as well as ``Frasier,'' ``Dharma
&AMP; Greg'' and ``The Drew Carey Show.''
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Cameron knows science fiction _ he made ``Aliens''
(1986) and the ``Terminator'' movies _ but this is a dark, complex
story that may be a hard sell. 
 -0- 
 ED (NBC)  
 &HT;    Premise: Ed Stevens (Tom Cavanagh) loses his job and his wife on
the same day, and decides to move back to his hometown.
 &HT;    Assets: Ed has the small-town magic of ``Northern Exposure,''
while Cavanagh and Julie Bowen, as his high-school sweetheart, make
an engaging couple.
 &HT;    Liabilities: A lot is riding on the untested Cavanagh's
likability.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Viewers will take a while to discover ``Ed,'' as
they did with ``Providence.'' But, once they do, they'll fall for
its charms. 
 -0- 
 THE FUGITIVE (CBS)  
 &HT;    Premise: Dr. Richard Kimble (Tim Daly), the one-armed man, a
pursuing lawman (Mykelti Williamson) ... you know the drill.
 &HT;    Assets: A fantastic cast gives this remake a real edge.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Viewers may feel they've seen it all before.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Good television never goes out of style, and this
smart update will keep the premise fresh enough to win over
viewers. ``The Fugitive'' could be the crossover hit that CBS is
hoping for. 
 -0- 
 THE GEENA DAVIS SHOW (ABC)  
 &HT;    Premise: Teddie Cochran (Davis) is a single New Yorker who meets
the man of her dreams (Peter Horton) and ends up engaged and living
with him, his two kids and his stern housekeeper in _ gulp! _ the
suburbs.
 &HT;    Assets: Davis and Horton, still beloved by fans of
``thirtysomething,'' have great chemistry.
 &HT;    Liabilities: It's a little tough to embrace Davis in such a
sublimated role.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Similarities to ``Sex and the City'' don't work to
the show's advantage. The romance works, but laughs could be in
short supply. 
 -0- 
 GIDEON'S CROSSING (ABC)  
 &HT;    Premise: The saga of Ben Gideon (Andre Braugher), a doctor with
enormous talent, a massive ego and a knack for getting involved in
his patients' lives.
 &HT;    Assets: Braugher is the big draw here, and fans of ``Homicide''
are sure to tune in. A large, intelligently chosen ensemble cast is
another plus.
 &HT;    Liabilities: The brooding camerawork and quiet, slowly paced
dialogue may pall on clicker-happy viewers.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Dark, verbose and ultimately rather boring. Our
diagnosis? Lighten up... stat! 
 -0- 
 GROSSE POINTE (WB)  
 &HT;    Premise: A ``Larry Sanders''-esque backstage saga of the
production of a contrived teen show about privileged kids in a
snooty American town, from ``Beverly Hills 90210'' producer Darren
Star.
 &HT;    Assets: Lots of insider dirt on ''90210'' and ``Melrose Place,''
plus Star's willingness to exploit them.
 &HT;    Liabilities: The pilot allegedly angered Aaron Spelling, Tori
Spelling and Shannen Doherty so much that Spelling Sr. called Star
personally to demand changes. Star agreed _ and any caution could
doom ``Grosse Pointe.''
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Who better than Star to skewer the ridiculousness
of teen TV? But it may be hard to keep coming up with new angles. 
 -0- 
 MADIGAN MEN (ABC)  
 &HT;    Premise: Successful, newly divorced Ben Madigan (Gabriel Byrne)
struggles to raise his teen-age son (John Hensley) in New York.
Matters get complicated when his crusty Irish dad, Seamus (Roy
Dotrice), arrives looking for a place to stay.
 &HT;    Assets: The acting and writing are top notch, and Byrne is
highly likable in a low-key, Anthony Edwards kind of way.
 &HT;    Liabilities: The tone of the show is rather quiet, going for
amusing more than flat-out funny. That may change, however.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Critical reviews will be positive, but that rarely
jibes with viewer reaction. 
 -0- 
 THE MICHAEL RICHARDS SHOW (NBC)  
 &HT;    Premise: Bumbling private eye (Richards) tries to carve out a
career in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Assets: Richards is a genius when it comes to physical comedy.
 &HT;    Liabilities: While casting isn't yet complete, the lineup so far
_ including William Devane, Tim Meadows and Bill Cobbs _is
guy-heavy.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Seems like a good bet, if viewers will accept
Richards in a role other than Kramer. We're pretty sure that they
will. 
 -0- 
 NIGHT VISIONS (Fox)  
 &HT;    Premise: Like ``The Twilight Zone,'' this series will feature a
new, creepy story each week _ or, in this case, two per week _ with
marquee actors and directors. Among the stars scheduled to appear:
Gil Bellows, Brian Dennehy, Cary Elwes, Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman
and Aidan Quinn.
 &HT;    Assets: It's been a while since we've seen an original,
big-budget anthology show like this.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Anthology shows are by definition inconsistent.
Still, this one should have a good batting average.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Good, old-fashioned, shiver-inducing fun that
should score with viewers. 
 -0- 
 TITANS (NBC)  
 &HT;    Premise: Superwealthy, bitter divorcees (Perry King and Victoria
Principal) battle for the affections of their children, including
their prodigal son (Casper Van Dien). Then mix in a sexy tramp
(Yasmine Bleeth), who's engaged to dad but recently slept with
junior. In other words, soapy.
 &HT;    Assets: Bleeth and Principal are ideally suited to insanely
over-the-top proceedings.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Van Dien is wooden, and the story line is awfully
silly.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: Soap bubbles will soon be washed up. 
 -0- 
 WELCOME TO NEW YORK (CBS)  
 &HT;    Premise: An Indiana weatherman (Jim Gaffigan) joins a New York
morning show run by a hotshot producer (Christine Baranski), and
culture clashes ensue.
 &HT;    Assets: A great cast _ not only the likable Gaffigan and the
rapier-sharp Baranski, but also Sara Gilbert and Rocky Carroll.
 &HT;    Liabilities: Gaffigan is talented, but he's a no-name who won't
help CBS hype the show.
 &HT;    Bottom Line: With ``Spin City'' deprived of Michael J. Fox,
``Welcome To New York: could become the next workplace-comedy hit.

&HT;     STUDY SHOWS OLDER BUYERS PAY MORE FOR CARS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who pays the most for new cars?
</P>
<P>
   The general wisdom for years has said that women and minorities
end up paying more than the rest of the consumers when it comes to
dealing with auto dealers, but a new study by automotive marketing
specialists at Virginia Commonwealth University debunks that
notion.
</P>
<P>
   Older people, the study says, are the only group paying more
when it comes to car shopping. On average, people ages 70-89 paid
10.6 percent more for a new 2000-model-year car or truck than
buyers did in the base group, ages 20-29, said George E. Hoffer, of
the university's economics department, who has tracked auto
retailing trends for years.
</P>
<P>
   The survey looked at 4,004 new-car purchases on one day in
February involving 40 different models, using a J.D. Powers &AMP;
Associates dealer database. For a model to be included, there had
to be at least three sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a surprise to us,'' Hoffer said in an interview. ``We
went into this expecting to find that women were being
discriminated against at car dealerships, as liberal consumer
groups have long contended. But that just wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, women pay no more than men, and might even be smarter
shoppers than men because they choose vehicles that have more curb
appeal _ and therefore should cost more than the cars that men buy,
Hoffer said. (The study didn't look at how much minorities paid,
because the database did not include information on the race of the
purchasers, Hoffer said.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that on average, women paid $29 more per vehicle than
men did, but that's just 1.9 percent, and it is statistically
insignificant,'' he said. ``What is significant is that the women
tended to buy cars that had been on dealers' lots 11 days less than
the cars that men bought, which means that they have better taste,
and are buying cars that are more desirable. They actually should
wind up paying more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Average dealer gross profit was $1,497 in the study, which is
close to last year's national dealer average gross profit of $1,520
per new car sale as reported by the National Automobile Dealers
Association, Hoffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Profit ranges varied significantly by car model, depending on
how well the vehicle was selling, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac DeVille, which was totally redesigned for 2000,
showed the greatest profit range, Hoffer said _ which means it was
the car that was discounted the most. Dealers in the survey made
gross profits of $1,378 to $3,634 on DeVille sales, with an average
gross of $2,506.
</P>
<P>
   That was in stark contrast with the Acura 3.2TL, which had the
most narrow profit range: $2,706 to $3,030, with an average of
$2,868.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows that dealers are ready to deal more on the DeVille
than on an Acura because the DeVille isn't in as big a demand,''
Hoffer said. ``And it shows that buyers of the Acura 3.2TL were
more inclined to pay close to manufacturer's sticker price. Anybody
who even got one of those thought they were getting a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross profit isn't the dealer's final take on a deal; the costs
of selling the car are deduced from that _ including such overhead
as rent and utilities on the building and the salesman's
commission. Net profit often is as low as $100 per car after all of
those costs are subtracted, dealers say.
</P>
<P>
   One thing was clear from the study, Hoffer said: ``We found that
car dealers charge everybody a different price. But there doesn't
seem to be any real discrimination against a certain group. Dealers
just try to maximize profits wherever they can. The only group that
paid more was the elderly, and there are reasons to explain that.''
</P>
<P>
   The study did not look at fixed-price auto retailing, a growing
trend in the industry. Most Saturn dealers nationwide have fixed
prices on their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The older consumers generally pay cash for a vehicle, which
means that the dealer has no way to make extra money on the deal in
the finance office, where additional profit is made on three key
items: the financing, extended warranties and credit life and/or
disability insurance, Hoffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could tend to keep the purchase price of the car itself a
bit higher for older consumers.'' Hoffer and the study's co-author,
David W. Harless, found that none of the older buyers purchased
credit life insurance from the dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that older consumers are less likely to have
access to the Internet to research invoice prices and be better
prepared to shop, he said. Buyers in the 20-29 age group were the
ones who tended to do their homework the best before going to
dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Older consumers also might have a tendency to go back to dealers
that they have purchased from before, where they feel more
comfortable shopping, Hoffer said. ``They might not want to go all
over town to try to find a better deal, and therefore would end up
paying more than someone else might.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffer said the Virginia Commonwealth study should be more
credible than other methods that have been used to try to show
whether any particular groups are discriminated against in the
car-buying process because the figures were the ones that the
dealers reported to their state departments of motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they lie on this, they are in jail,'' he said. ``This is
the best data going.''
</P>
<P>
   Data were collected from dealers in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago,
Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver-Colorado Springs, South Florida, greater
New York, Northern California, Southern California and
Philadelphia, Hoffer said.

INDIAN SUITS OVER SCHOOLS SHAKE CHURCHES IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Although not a single case has yet made it to court,
a wave of litigation is threatening to bankrupt Canada's four
largest Christian denominations under the weight of thousands of
lawsuits brought by Indians demanding redress for ``cultural
abuse'' in church-run boarding schools.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits argue that the government-supported schools'
attempts to assimilate natives into the social mainstream,
requiring them to learn English and adopt the ways of white Canada,
constituted a sort of cultural violence.
</P>
<P>
   Its effects, they claim, were even more devastating than the
acknowledged sexual assaults and beatings that occurred in at least
some of the 125 Indian Residential Schools from the mid-19th
century until the 1970s. The schools were run by the Roman
Catholic, United, Anglican, and Presbyterian churches until the
system was finally abandoned in favor of community schools on every
Canadian reservation.
</P>
<P>
   At the worst institutions, the federal government and churches
acknowledge, Indian youngsters were victims of sexual attack and
other sadism by staff. And both the churches and Ottawa's
Department of Indian Affairs are committed to making amends for
clear cases of physical abuse, with hefty financial settlements
already paid in quiet out-of-court deals.
</P>
<P>
   But in the stunning new wave of litigation, Indians _ and their
white lawyers, working on contingency fees _ are demanding hundreds
of millions of dollars for loss of cultural identity, a claim so
far untested in any court.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, we didn't slaughter Indians like in the United
States,'' said Tony Merchant, a Saskatchewan lawyer whose firm
represents some 4,000 Indians claiming their lives were ruined by
the boarding schools. ``Our frontier was peaceful. Our policy was
to destroy Indian society, spirituality, and sense of self-worth
through forced assimilation.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Indians, all but invisible for most of the country's
history, are today riding perhaps the most aggressive aboriginal
rights movement in the world. From Nova Scotia to British Columbia,
natives are pursuing _ and, in a surprising number of cases,
winning _ colossal land claims, rights to harvest commercial
quantities of resources from lobster to redwood logs, and cash
payoffs for injustices dating back decades and even centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of school suits allege that the poverty,
alcoholism, crime, domestic violence, and other ills that are
wracking aboriginal communities are at least partly the result of
attempts to force natives to learn English, acquire job skills, and
adopt Christianity at the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools took us from our parents and taught us that the
ways of our people were shameful and wrong,'' said Deborah St.
John, 49, an Ontario Cree packed off to an Anglican-run school in
1957. She conceded she was never physically harmed _ aside from the
occasional rap across the knuckles for daydreaming in class _ but
insisted her life of heavy drinking and domestic disharmony is the
result of losing her native tongue and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I have no forgiveness for what they did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, more than 6,400 lawsuits by Indian
plaintiffs, plus four massive class action suits, have been brought
against the churches and government agencies responsible for the
boarding school system. New ones are being filed at the rate of 40
a month, threatening to swamp the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a level of litigation unprecedented in Canadian
history,'' said Rev. Brian Thorpe, senior adviser on school issues
for the United Church of Canada, which operated 14 schools and last
year paid out $2.3 million in legal fees to cope with the suits.
Various Catholic orders ran 70 Indian schools; the Anglicans
operated 37; the Presbyterians four.
</P>
<P>
   The churches are hemorrhaging millions of dollars simply to pay
lawyers to meet the legal onslaught. The Anglican Church _ Canada's
third largest Christian denomination _ is on the edge of bankruptcy
and may go under as early as next year unless the government
engineers a last-minute bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders agree uniformly that redress should be paid to
Indians who suffered physical abuse. But the idea that the very act
of teaching English or imparting Western values (such as hard work,
punctuality, and personal cleanliness) constituted ``cultural
genocide'' _ as Indians and their lawyers allege _ is too much for
some clergy to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole pile of upper middle class guilt here that's
running the show, and not much common sense,'' the Right Rev. John
Clarke, Anglican bishop of Athabasca, in northern Alberta, told the
church newspaper Anglican Journal.
</P>
<P>
   But Clarke's is a distinctly minority view as Canadian church
leaders trip over one another in a stampede to issue mea culpas.
Last week, for example, native drums pounded in a somber if bizarre
ceremony as clergy of several leading Christian denominations in
Newfoundland and Labrador offered formal apologies for the coming
of their forebears to the New World and subsequent failure to treat
natives with respect and kindness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are embarrassed and sorry for the suffering that aboriginal
people have endured since our ancestors arrived 500 years ago,''
declared Sister Emma Rooney, a Roman Catholic nun.
</P>
<P>
   Indians seemed mostly annoyed by the apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it, specifically, they are apologizing for?'' asked
Peter Penashue, a Labrador Innu. ``I have a problem when people
say, `Oops, sorry for the past five centuries.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The lines separating church and state in Canada are fuzzier than
in the United States, and they were even more blurred back in 1879,
when the government of the fledgling country contracted with
churches _ already running mission schools _ to establish
residential schools whose unequivocal aim would be to assimilate
Indians by teaching them English and providing training in such
skills as blacksmithing, sewing, and carpentry.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, these goals might seem laudable, given staggering
rates of native illiteracy and unemployment that top 80 percent on
some reserves. But the boarding schools also made it a policy to
sternly discourage their native charges from speaking their own
languages or following traditional customs. The unabashed goal: to
produce ``red-skinned white people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In historic hindsight, we see that churches and government
took a wrong-minded approach to education, with negative impact on
native culture,'' said Shawn Tupper, head of the residential
schools unit of the Ministry of Indian Affairs. ``But it's unclear
whether redress for `cultural abuse' is something that can be won
in a court of law.''

GAYS WHO TRIED STRAIGHT LIFE NOW SAY IT DIDN'T WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Pierpont had perfected his approach: He would stroll into a
Bible study class for gays and lesbians and proclaim that he was
one of them. Standing before the circle of strangers, he would tell
them that he too was gay and had been misunderstood by his
fundamentalist family.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he would tell them that he had found, in a combination of
religion and therapy, an escape from the shame he'd felt all his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell them they didn't need to be gay, that they needed to
change just like me,'' recalled Pierpont.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, his tactics became more subversive: He
spent large parts of the 1970s and 1980s walking into gay bars in
Seattle, Philadelphia, and Atlantic City with his team of
followers, always pointing to his own life story as proof that
homosexuality is a choice. Over time, he became one of the most
vocal spokesmen in the controversial ``gay conversion,'' or
``ex-gay,'' movement.
</P>
<P>
   Then Pierpont became a changed man once again.
</P>
<P>
   He now embraces the fact that he is gay: Eight years ago he
divorced his wife and, in 1998, he moved to Provincetown, Mass.,
where he lives with his partner, Nick Massoni. Every night, he
performs in a gay cabaret. Today, Pierpont has become an outspoken
voice in an emerging backlash against gay conversion therapy, a
backlash dubbed the ``ex-ex gay'' movement.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay
and lesbian political organization, released a 37-page report
outlining what it believed to be the dangers of homosexual
conversion therapy. Many gays, according to the report suffer
depression and anxiety after trying everything from exorcisms to
lipstick seminars to change. The report included 14 stories of
homosexuals _ pastors' sons, Jehovah's witnesses, and gay
conversion leaders _ who say trying to change one's sexual
orientation is painful and fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one knows just how many people proclaim to be ex-ex
gays, specialists say thousands of homosexuals who spent years
trying to overcome their sexual orientation are now openly saying
they never doused their desires for the same sex. In Washington and
California, ex-ex gays have created support groups and others have
taken their gripping testimonies to the Internet. Gay rights
specialists say ``ex-ex gays'' began ``coming out'' again after the
Christian right published ads in leading newspapers in 1998,
promoting gay conversion therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new phenomenon,'' said Wayne Besen, editor of the
report. ``Ex-ex gays feel more and more that it's their moral
obligation to tell their stories. They want to save people 10 and
20 years of pain and misery.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Alan Medinger, who founded a Christian ministry
in the Baltimore area that says it helps people overcome
homosexuality, argues that most people experience ``significant
change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said it was going to be easy. It's a long road. . . .
We are not saying that it works for everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gay conversion movement began around 1974 when a band of
religious figures came together in Anaheim, Calif. Many of them,
said Medinger, had overcome homosexuality and wanted to start an
international gay conversion ministry to help others.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, religious figures and medical experts
worried that the movement was a fraud and preyed on vulnerable
people: In 1979, Gary Cooper and Michael Bussee, who helped launch
Exodus International, the main umbrella organization for ex-gay
groups around the world, left their wives for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were examples of two who were not truthful. We lost a lot
of them but now we are much more careful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those setbacks, the gay conversion movement began to
grow, as men and women from deeply religious homes came seeking to
transform themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an overwhelming sense of guilt, like homosexuality was a
sin,'' Medinger said. ``I would just go to church and just cry and
cry and cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement, he said, gave him what nothing else had: hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I told people Christ had changed me, the more I
believed it would be true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pierpont married and had a son, he couldn't squelch the
romantic desires he had for other men. At one point in his life, he
was so full of rage, fear, and self-hatred that he began to tremble
and break out into a sweat. Finally after years of trying, he
realized there was nothing he could do to change.
</P>
<P>
   But Medinger questions if so-called ``ex-ex gays'' like Pierpont
overstated their conversion to heterosexuality from the start.
Medinger said that 10 years after marrying his wife and having two
daughters, he realized he hadn't dealt with his homosexual past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking terrible risks. I was vice president of a good
company, but toward the end I was openly going to gay bars and
parks,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Medinger said the conversion movement believes homosexuality is
rooted in childhood, sparked by an absent father, overbearing
mother, or gender-identity problems. He now believes he reverted to
his past homosexuality after years of not dealing with the fact
that his depressed father was never around for him.
</P>
<P>
   But Medinger, who has been married for more than 40 years and
has a 24-year-old son, said his dramatic religious conversion came
one night as he sat weeping during a prayer meeting. Only then,
said Medinger, did he get involved in the ex-gay movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a remarkable healing and became head over heels in love
with my wife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Medinger's belief that gay people can become straight
through Christian-based therapy goes against the recommendation of
mainstream experts. As the gay conversion movement was just
starting out, The American Psychiatric Association declared in 1974
that homosexuality was not a disease. Soon after, other
professional organizations like the American Psychological
Association declared that homosexuality could not, and should not,
be changed. Still the movement continued to grow. Two years ago,
conservative groups such as the Christian Coalition launched an ad
campaign promoting ex-gay therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Wulfensmith of Monrovia, Calif., said the lingering
stigma that comes with being homosexual is one reason some gays are
still joining conversion programs.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pierpont, she grew up in a strong fundamentalist family and
was also taught that homosexuality was sinful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, she entered into a reparative therapy program that
promised to change her sexual orientation. There, she lived in a
home with other people who were also desperately seeking to become
heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the program worried that this was my only
option,'' she said. ``But I was still depressed. I was even more
hopeless,'' said Wulfensmith, who after years of therapy accepted
her homosexuality. She now lives with her ``wife'' and two adopted
children.
</P>
<P>
   But Pierpont's acceptance of his sexual orientation came only
after he could no longer deny his romantic feelings for other men.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started to come to terms with my sexuality, my whole
marriage came under fire . . . I started telling friends and 100
percent of my friends stopped speaking to me,'' he said. ``I think
one reason the Christian friends didn't want to associate with me
is because I had been a leader in the movement, and all of a sudden
I pulled their foundation from under them.''

MCCAIN'S IMPACT ON GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Al Gore and Joe Lieberman are pulling off another
smart stunt this week _ reminding the country why they are indeed
New Democrats and illustrating what being on a roll looks like.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason to kick 'em while they're up _ for not doing
more of it and relying too much on progressive economics at the
expense of the values issues that matter to independent voters.
What Gore has not been doing enough of can be summed up in two
words _ John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   With excellent timing, the Democrats have taken advantage of a
devastating Federal Trade Commission report to hit the
entertainment business in its most vulnerable spot _ the flagrant
advertising of violence and smut to teenagers in ways every bit as
shameful as the cigarette racket's practices of recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   There is no censorship or intimidation issue of any kind here.
Instead, this is a classic case in which public officials can help
empower people (parents especially) who feel powerless in the face
of all-pervasive, mass culture. It is also a classic case of a
powerful industry caught doing what it explicitly pledged not to
do.
</P>
<P>
   And politically, the timing of a campaign issue on the release
day of a superbly documented report on entertainment marketing that
also happens to be the day Gore appears on Oprah is sheer
brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that Gore has been neglecting his New Democrat
duties while he was consolidating his now-strong intra-party
constituencies. It hasn't been generally noticed, but the
Democratic campaign, for all its August proficiency, is still
something short of scintillating among the people who are most
likely to decide this year's presidential election _ the broadly
defined middle-class and nonpartisan voters.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Gore's more important campaign officials recognize
this, as does a more than interested observer, President Clinton.
Fortunately for them, the Bush campaign is so fixated on its own
internal wars and on attacking Gore personally that it is missing a
big opportunity to do some real communicating.
</P>
<P>
   No way, however, that Gore was going to miss the opportunity
presented by the FTC investigation. Pouncing on it as he and
Lieberman did with credible threats of a policy response to what
amounts to fraudulent marketing put them smack in the middle of a
major national news story. The previously scheduled Oprah gig was
gravy, but the beat is only going to go on, thanks to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry behavior happens to be one of the Arizona
senator's crusades. As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee,
he will be conducting angry hearings starting Wednesday, featuring
among others his Senate partner in all this _ Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But this is only one of McCain's moves as Congress reconvenes.
He has also served notice on both parties that he will be an angry
fly in whatever pork-barrel ointments get concocted as part of a
Clinton-Congress budget deal. And he has scheduled several campaign
finance reform events in the coming weeks, including one later this
week, to highlight an unbreakable commitment to his signature
issue.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican can accuse McCain of disloyalty after his embrace
of George W. Bush and his performance in Philadelphia, and he
pointedly stayed out of the Bush campaign kibbitzing many
Republicans indulged in last week. But his mere presence in the
news underlines what a wild card he is.
</P>
<P>
   It also remains the case that Bush has not moved toward him on a
single issue since the primaries ended. It's not just McCain's war
to get soft money out of politics; it's also his opposition to
cutting the top income tax rates, his belief that Medicare needs a
major infusion of money, and his continuing hostility to the
tactics of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   A smarter Gore would be embracing McCain-ism more openly to
broaden his appeal. A mischievous Gore and Lieberman would be
selling themselves as Reformers with Results.

CHOOSING SIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all watched TV shows where a crime victim scrutinizes a
police lineup, hoping to pick out the perp among the motley crew.
But what do you call the window the accuser is looking through?
</P>
<P>
   As far as Barry Bragen was concerned, it was always a one-way
mirror: ``The observers are stationed on one side and watch the
observed through the glass, while the subjects see only their own
reflection.'' So he was surprised to find the same kind of barrier
described in last Sunday's Globe as a two-way mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my friend about it,'' he reports in an e-mail. ``She
is a clinical social worker, and knows about those things, and she
said that of course it was a two-way mirror! . . . I believe there
is general confusion on the subject,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there would be if anyone stopped to think about it. I
picked up the Sept. 4 New Yorker, and there were police watching a
suspect ``through a one-way mirror.'' A Nexis search quickly
confirmed that both terms have been used freely for more than three
decades, and neither has a clear lead in the citation sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror, either way, seems to have begun as one-way glass or
one-way window. The first Oxford English Dictionary quotation is
from Fitzgerald's ``The Last Tycoon,'' 1940: ``(My father's office
was) the first to have one-way glass in the big French windows.''
The mirror variations _ both one-way and two-way _ appear in the
mid-'60s, but the quote from 1967 suggests that the device is still
somewhat unfamiliar: ``They directed total concentration through
the sighting side of a two-way mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early '70s, they were everywhere: one-way mirrors to make
tollbooths appear empty, the better to snare scofflaws; two-way
mirrors, so employees said, to nab shoplifters in the Macy's and
Gimbel's dressing rooms. And nobody seems to have minded that
neither term, looked at closely, really makes sense. The mirrored
side of the glass is a one-way mirror on one side and a one-way
window on the other; only the glass itself is a two-way material.
If we had stuck with the early and accurate one-way window, we
wouldn't have to choose between competing terms today.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't that happen? My guess is that most people, introduced
to the notion of a mirror that's also a window, imagine themselves
as the watchees, not the watchers. Many of us have tried on clothes
at department stores, or worked out at gyms, but few have spied on
others doing it. It's that deceptive mirror, the mirror that isn't,
that plucks the strings of paranoia. And once you're speaking from
the mirrored side of the wall, one-way and two-way seem equally
plausible; you're trapped on the one-way side of a two-way window.
</P>
<P>
   Most reference books have ignored the question, but the
Webster's New World Dictionary of Media and Communications (1990)
says the glass through which you watch a focus group is a one-way
mirror. The brand-new fourth edition of the American Heritage
Dictionary also gives preference to one-way mirror, though it notes
that it is ``also called two-way mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   We the people may not agree; a rash of recent two-way mirrors in
connection with TV's ``Big Brother'' suggests that the show's
publicity machine may have chosen two-way to describe their
camera-permeable walls. That could tip the balance _ or not; we may
well go on using the terms interchangeably with as little fuss as
ever, each according to his or her taste. If Big Brother is
watching our language, he doesn't seem to care whether the glass is
one-way or two.
</P>
<P>

   So just how bad was it, the nasty word George W. Bush used to
describe a New York Times reporter last week? NBC, the Associated
Press, and the Times itself called it an obscenity _ from a word
that meant ``inauspicious, ill-omened'' in Latin, but later took a
turn for the worse. The following day, Times columnist Maureen Dowd
reported that the newspaper's style czar had downgraded the word to
a vulgarity, on the grounds that it ``has nothing to do with sex.''
That might not be everyone's reasoning, but vulgar does seem more
appropriate: It derives from vulgus, ``the common people,'' and it
can mean ``common'' in either the neutral or the pejorative sense.
Common the epithet is, and common it has long been. Credit George
with a sense of history: Unlike the congressman who called Bill
Clinton a scumbag, or the senator who called his opponent a
putzhead, Bush used a good old English word for his nemesis _
though in the year 1400, it was spelled arce-hoole.

DR. LAURA'S TV DEBUT TAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the most famous homophobe who's not a
blonde-haired rapper from Detroit, made her much-debated debut on
the television Monday morning, and she managed to get through the
whole hour without calling anyone a ``biological error'' or
referring to their lives as ``deviant.''
</P>
<P>
   For her first show, Schlessinger, who made her name doling out
bilious advice on her radio talk show, took on teens and drugs,
warning parents that their ``bubbly young teenager could turn into
a moody, hostile, brooding drug user right behind your very back.''
But she steered clear of her controversial opinions about lesbians
and gay men that made her the target of protests for much of the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that campaign has been galvanized at the stopdrlaura.com
web site, which bills itself as ``a coalition against hate,'' and
has organized ``National Days of Protest'' against Schlessinger's
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jimmy the Greek disparaged African Americans, he got
fired. When Dr. Laura Schlessinger calls gays and lesbians
`biological errors' and pedophiles, Paramount gives her a TV
show,'' it reads on the site's home page. ``While Ms. Schlessinger
is free to malign minorities, corporate America is not required
subsidize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fallout, several major advertisers, including AT&AMP;T,
Xerox and United Airlines, pulled their commercials from her show,
as did Proctor &AMP; Gamble, which stated, ``While she has every right
to assert her views on all subjects in the context of her show, we
have an equal right as an advertiser to place our commercials in
less polarizing environments.'' At least on her first show, the
usually outspoken Schlessinger never mentioned the lost advertisers
or anything else pertaining to the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Schlessinger's silence on the controversy should
surprise no one. Did anyone really expect her to leap out of the
box with a mouthful of anti-gay rhetoric on day one when she knew
everyone _ especially gay and lesbian activists _ would be watching
for exactly such a misstep? With a show that had some stations so
nervous they downplayed its premiere _ WCVB, Channel 5, in Boston
wouldn't even list ``Dr. Laura'' on its Web site, placing a
discreet ``TBD'' (to be determined) in listings for the show's 10
a.m. time slot _ Schlessinger surely wanted to calm the fears of
the suits at Paramount, which produces the show.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the rest of this week's shows seem fairly routine,
ranging from ``When is an affair an affair'' to ``Are you your
kid's parent?'' But make no mistake. This momentary curb of her
biased tongue should not be perceived as some dramatic epiphany
concerning the lesbian and gay community. Schlessinger, who takes
her ``Dr.'' title from a Columbia University doctorate in
physiology, hasn't softened her views one bit. Schlessinger is
offering any half-baked apologies to explain herself _ such as
Atlanta Braves meathead John Rocker attempted after he infamously
maligned most of humanity in a 1999 Sports Illustrated article _ or
claiming she will no longer condemn homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week on ``Larry King Live,'' Schlessinger, who
maintains her views on gays and lesbians are based on her
conservative Jewish beliefs, reiterated her stance and said that
any attempt to shut down her show is ``very un-American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of difference of opinion is now taken as some kind of
discriminatory hate-mongering. One is not allowed dissent; one will
be shut down,'' she told King. ``We had a McCarthy era, and it's
interesting that the same side which cried blood then, is sort of
standing by and clucking now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthyism indeed. What Schlessinger doesn't seem to get is
that then, as now, people were fighting against damaging labels
applied by those determined to force their version of the world
down everyone else's throats. She has painted herself as a victim
while ignoring how her inflammatory words could lead to the
victimization of lesbians and gay men.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as much as I despise Schlessinger's views, I've never
believed her show should be censored or kept off the air. Keeping
controversial views off the air sets too dangerous a precedent, one
that could double back on those trying to shut Schlessinger up.
Besides, I like knowing exactly who my enemies are, the better to
fight and oppose their bigotry and small-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   Given enough rope, bigots eventually hang themselves on their
own hatred. And despite the transparent kinder, gentler face
presented Monday morning, don't expect Dr. Laura to be any
different.

<P>
   In the beginning, there was the Husband/CFO. As Everyfamily's
chief financial officer, he earned the money, paid the bills, and
doled out spending money as he saw fit. His stay-at-home wife's
financial role was generally limited to buying groceries, clipping
coupons, and paying the PTA dues. Her job was to know the price of
milk and eggs, not stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   What's since changed is almost everything about American
families and money. In the past 40 years, the number of working
women has roughly tripled. The number of female wage earners in the
United States overtook the number of male wage earners two decades
ago. Although the median income of women is still some 45 percent
that of men, the gap is closing: between 1990 and 1998, women's
median income rose 48 percent, while men's grew only 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And so, meet the Wife/CFO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the case in the majority of marriages, but it's more
common than most people think,'' says Diane Rosen, a financial
planner. ``Roles have become more fuzzy. Husbands and wives today
each do what they do best, and they do what they like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For many wives this means being in charge of paying the family
bills, balancing the checkbook, investing the spare cash, and
planning the estate. In a 1996 survey by the National Opinion
Research Center, 28.2 percent of the married women polled said they
managed all their families' money except their husbands' personal
spending money, whereas the figure for husbands was only 8.6
percent. (The others had separate or pooled financial
arrangements.) Meanwhile, in a 1998-1999 survey by SRI Consulting,
40 percent of the families surveyed said that women handled the
finances. Small wonder that a gaggle of books advising such
``smart'' women are on the shelves (``Smart Women Finish Rich'')
and that brokerage houses such as American Express now market
specifically to them (``Smart Women. Smart Choices'').
</P>
<P>
   But Wife/CFOs are not all the same. They have different
backgrounds, different skills, different motives, and different
management styles. Consider. . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE VETERAN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big deal? Lila Hurwitz has been a Wife/CFO since
she got married 48 years ago. ``I glance at the bills occasionally,
but that's all I do,'' says her husband, Arthur Hurwitz, a
74-year-old retired paint filler from Winthrop, Mass. ``I can't
remember the last time I wrote a check. I'd be financially lost
without my wife. May she live a long life.''
</P>
<P>
   Already has. Now 72, Lila Hurwitz wanted to be a writer when she
was a teenager. Her father, who was in the drapery business, had
other notions. He wanted her to help with the books. So she did,
and eventually she became a bookkeeper for other businesses,
finally retiring two years ago. She also tended to her family's
financial business along the way, while she and her husband raised
two children. Yes, she consults with him about the purchase of,
say, a new washer or dryer, but she's clearly the one who writes
the checks and keeps track of the cash flow. ``I've never met the
bank statement I couldn't reconcile,'' she declares proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Lila Hurwitz is conservative, practical, and precise. Bills are
always paid on time, investments are considered carefully (the
couple didn't didn't buy their own home until they were well into
their 50s), and debt is eschewed. ``I guess it's because I grew up
during the Depression,'' she says. ``I have an absolute horror of
debt.''

The Midlife Learner &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Susan Silver, a 52-year-old speech therapist, did what she
thought she was supposed to do when she was in her 20s: She got
married, became a mother, and let her husband handle the money. Why
not? He was, after all, a financial professional. ``I had my own
checkbook for `fun money' and the kids' birthday presents and
things like that,'' Silver recalls. ``But I really didn't know
where or in what our money was.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed dramatically in 1990 when Silver divorced. Suddenly
she was responsible for managing the money for herself and her
three children, ages 9, 12, and 15. ``I jumped in with both feet,''
she remembers. ``What astounded me was how easy it was, and how
capable I was of getting everything paid on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarried eight years ago, the Sharon, Mass. woman now has a
his/hers financial arrangement with her second husband, Jim
Schwartz, a locksmith who has three children of his own. But, by
her own reckoning, she is responsible for paying about 75 percent
of their joint bills, and carefully manages her own money. ``He's
an incredibly wonderful person,'' she says of Schwartz, ``but very
laid back about money.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver is determined that her only daughter, Debbie Silver, not
be a late financial bloomer like herself. And the 19-year-old
Northeastern University sophomore, who faithfully deposits the
paycheck from her summer job in her own bank account almost as soon
as she receives it, agrees. ``It's important to know how much money
you have, and how much you can spend, at all times,'' she says. ``I
want to be in control.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Mother's Daughter &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With seven jobs and five homes since graduating from college a
dozen years ago, 33-year-old Susan Brown mirrors a generation
that's willing to make changes. But one thing has remained the same
in her life: She's almost always been the person in charge of her
own money. She started at age 11, when she got her first job, doing
prep work in the family's restaurant at Nantasket Beach, just
outside Boston. ``I wasn't promoted to a fry cook until I was 13,''
she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother had been independent, too. ``My father died when I
was 4,'' says Brown, of Waltham, Mass. ``He ran the restaurant, and
my mother pretty much took it over. She always talked to my older
sister and me about the importance of money. She wanted us to
understand that it didn't grow on trees, and that it was important
not to spend beyond our means.'' Later, Brown helped keep the
restaurant's books.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Brown is clearly a Wife/CFO. ``Right before we got
married, I noticed that my husband had all his savings in a savings
account,'' she says of her husband, James Brown, who works in the
executive protection field. ``I asked him what kind of interest he
was getting. He didn't even know.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Brown knows. She also knew, because she and her husband
are looking for a first house to buy, that she should move their
investments out of mutual finds and CDs and into more liquid money
market funds. ``Of course, I told Jim what I was doing,'' she says.
``He shrugged and said, `That's fine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Pro &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quite frankly, 49-year-old Lynda Schuepp's got better things to
do than be a Wife/CFO. After all, she's a professional investor who
also manages her own real estate holdings and writes for an online
financial newsletter. And she holds a master's degree in finanace.
Paying the family bills? ``I hate it,'' she declares darkly. But
she does it. Regularly if reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   She's seated at her desk at one end of her rambling Victorian
home in Milton, Mass., and she'd like to have a word with the folks
at AT&AMP;T. ``You see this?'' she asks loudly, waving a piece of paper
in her hand. ``It's a bill for $2.80. They've been billing me for a
toll-free number I never even had. I've sent them $2.80 three
times! But I can't get rid of the thing. It just keeps going on and
on.'' She glowers.
</P>
<P>
   Schuepp spends much of her professional life gloamed onto a
computer screen, so it's not surprising that she pays most bills _
telephone, property taxes, church donations, you name it _ online.
She also does online research before suggesting possible family
investments to her husband, Paul Schuepp, a vice-president of sales
at Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schuepp is clearly happy to remain on the sidelines while
his wife calls the financial signals. ``She knows numbers,'' he
says. ``I'm more of a technical person. I might glance at the bills
that look sort of interesting, but I don't really pay attention.
Why should I?''

   Linda Oshman was 13 years old when she opened her first checking
account. One of the first things she bought with her accumulating
funds was a pair of sweatpants. She still has them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I wasn't very good at math,'' says the 35-year-old
internal staff recruiter, who lives in Somerville, Mass. with her
husband, Kenny Laxague, and their two small children. ``But if you
put a dollar sign next to a number, it intrigued me.''
</P>
<P>
   Oshman loves being the family CFO. She loves paying bills, loves
setting up IRAs, loves buying bonds. She literally lies awake at
night thinking about family finanaces, prides herself in careful
investment research, and is still mortified that last year she
invested modestly in a mutual fund that went south.
</P>
<P>
   Laxague, a graduate student at UMass-Boston who is training to
be a teacher, concurs that family money is always on his wife's
mind, which is fine with him, because it's seldom on his. Oshman,
meanwhile, thinks there's a reason for her preoccupation. ``My dad
was a filmmaker who had a wildly fluctuating income,'' she
explains. ``It was feast or famine, and I don't want that for my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Oshman knows without looking, at any given moment, the exact
balances of the family's two checking and two savings accounts.
When Laxague returns home from grocery shopping, she immediately
asks how much he spent rather than what he bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how much we have in the bank,'' Laxague says.
``All I know is that I'm given $150 a week for grocery money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Oshman corrects him quickly, ``it's $130.''

<P>
   He's like a drop of milk on a chocolate bar. He's like a
gastroenterologist at a Christian Science convention. He's like a
vegetarian at a steak house. (That's enough foolishness _ Ed.) He's
the only male student at Wellesley College.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Ross Franklin, he's 20 years old, he hails from
Yonkers, N.Y., and he's the first resident male student at
Wellesley in the last five years. Franklin took advantage of a
12-college exchange program to leave Norton's Wheaton College to
spend the year at Wellesley, with much encouragement from his
mother and grandmother, both alumnae. ``It played a huge, positive
role in their lives,'' Franklin tells me. ``I'm really happy to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellesley is one of only a handful of all women's colleges left
in the country; Smith, Mount Holyoke, Spelman, Bryn Mawr, and
Barnard are others. There are some men around; about half the
faculty is male, and maybe 15 or 20 fellows from MIT, Brandeis, and
Babson cross-register into Wellesley classes. But as Franklin and I
chow down at Tower Court dining hall, I remark that we seem to be
the only men in the cavernous refectory. ``Oh, yeah,'' he says.
``It's always like this.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's it like being the only man around? ``I'm kind of a
celebrity here,'' reports Franklin, who has already been
interviewed by the college TV station and drafted into the fall
theatrical for a rare male role. He's also hoping to run for
student government. ``I need to represent my gender,'' he deadpans.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching in his major subjects, biology and psychology, is
superb, and he reports that the natives are quite friendly. His one
complaint concerns the weight room. ``It's like a dungeon,'' he
says. ``I was shocked at the shape it's in.'' I tried to convince
him that turning out Olympic weightlifters has never been a top
priority at Hillary Clinton's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Life in guy paradise is not without its complications. The
teachers generally use only female pronouns when referring to
students. Franklin will be allowed to join the basketball team, but
he can't play in any games. His hallmates just voted to make all
bathrooms on his floor co-ed, so that removed one problem. But he
still hasn't decided whether to attend the Dyke Ball, or Instead
House's annual Naked Ball, when women have to donate $1 to charity
for every article of clothing they wear through the door.
</P>
<P>
   With appropriate delicacy, I inquire about his social life. He's
straight, he's available, and yes, he has dated some Wellesley
women. But for the time being, he seems content to hang with his
pals from Wheaton. Truth be told, he seems a tad intimidated by the
intellectual candlepower of Wellesley women. ``They're awfully
intelligent,'' he concedes _ but his mother and grandmother could
have told him that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ON THE COUCH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do we want a president who's obsessive-compulsive, or one with
histrionic personality syndrome? Without apparent irony, Psychology
Today ran Al Gore's and George W. Bush's personality traits through
the American Psychiatric Society's ``Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders.'' John Berecz tells the magazine that
Gore, as an obsessive-compulsive, can ``compartmentalize things . .
. he might tell you with tears in his eyes about his sister dying
of lung cancer and then tell the tobacco growers, `I'm with you.'
'' He calls Bush's histrionic style ``emotionally alive,
emotionally available,'' like Ronald Reagan's. More useless
knowledge from Dacher Keltner, PhD: ``The asymmetrical upper lip
raise (Action Unit10; Levator labii superioris) or asymmetrical lip
corner tighten (Action Unit14; Buccinator) . . . typically
accompany Bush's smile, and account for the smirk.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MY MISTAKE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I erred in my Aug. 30 column, when I relegated Jim Jeffords of
Vermont to the US House of Representatives. He has been a US
Senator for 12 years. Vermont's only representative is the
crazy-like-a-fox socialist poseur, Bernie Sanders.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUDBURY, Mass. _ Maverick publisher that he is, Will Fitzhugh
has both fans and detractors of the radical work he does in his
little office above a consignment shop, down the road from the
historic Wayside Inn.
</P>
<P>
   There are the famous scholars who are agog over the journal he
prints, and then there are the universities who tell him to stay
far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps the countless notes of thanks from his authors,
attesting to all the ways he has enhanced their careers. He also
saves the letters from the 137 foundations who have rejected his
grant applications.
</P>
<P>
   All for something as dazzling, as upsetting _ or neither _ as
The Concord Review, a quarterly collection of history essays by
high school students judged by Fitzhugh to be exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   A junior from Nantucket explores the Panama Canal. A sophomore
from Minnesota delves into the G.I. Bill. A senior from Missouri
writes about the United States and Iran in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   One would expect the project to win wide, if not especially
passionate, support. It taps into old-fashioned American values
like respect for hard work. It provides teachers with an
alternative to stale text books.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzhugh envisions The Concord Review in classrooms and
libraries across the country, inspiring students to do original
work and to set their sights high.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with subscriptions at only 800 nationwide, The Concord
Review is clearly not popular with schools. It's doesn't earn even
a tenth of the money it would need to be self-supporting. It makes
some educators downright queasy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Stanford admissions office once wrote glowing
letters, a dean recently yanked the school's support. The director
of National History Day says The Concord Review is alienating to
the typical student.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Fitzhugh has found that his plain, uncomplicated idea to
recognize the best and the brightest is curiously out-of-step with
the times. Even as it attracts fervent admirers, it languishes just
on the brink of existence.
</P>
<P>
   After this former teacher, 64, has put 13 years of his life and
all of his own money into The Concord Review, he believes his
efforts may evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, he's tired, and wants to retire. He is also almost
entirely dependent on one private philanthropist. In a few years,
he worries, there may be no more Concord Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a failure, frankly,'' Fitzhugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the negative attention and the lack of attention, Fitzhugh
believes, can be blamed on anti-intellectualism among educators,
many of whom would rather reward mediocrity than insist upon top
work. In his opinion, they are dumbing down American education so
as not to offend or discourage anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents want good grades, kids don't want a lot of work, and
there's a tremendous pressure for teachers to be entertaining
rather than demanding,'' Fitzhugh said. ``I'm still puzzled by this
do-nothing-and-feel-good syndrome. It's like finding out that
hospitals are staffed by people who don't believe in health.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Gorn, executive director of National History Day, said she
doesn't see anything overtly bad or wrong with The Concord Review.
But it's not the way she would choose to build passion for
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reserved for students of upper-level abilities,'' Gorn
said. ``Other kids might feel a little bit turned off, or feel
uncomfortable, or like, `I can't do that.' It limits the kids and
the teachers who will participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzhugh's journey, his unexpected road to controversy, began in
1987, when he was teaching at Concord-Carlisle High School. He
dreamed up The Concord Review as a way to reward top work in the
social studies. It would also provide a model to teach and
encourage other young people.
</P>
<P>
   He quit his job to start the journal, which he published out of
his Sudbury home until this year. It is the only quarterly in the
world devoted to high school scholarship, Fitzhugh says.
</P>
<P>
   Finding worthy material turned out to be a breeze. Fitzhugh
publishes 44 essays a year, only about eight percent of the
submissions he receives, which come from students in private and
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting some important champions posed no trouble, either.
Supporters range from former Assistant Secretary of Education Diane
Ravitchto historian Arthur M. SchlesingerJr., who says there should
be a copy of The Concord Review in every high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more satisfying for kids at that age than to
see their stuff in print,'' said Schlesinger in a phone interview.
``It's also an incentive and a stimulus for excellence in other
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such lofty supporters, Fitzhugh says he's been charged
with elitism time and time again. It's a notion he finds odd and
disheartening. He is not rewarding students for innate
intelligence, but for intense effort, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this misleading idea that good work must come from
genetic smarts,'' Fitzhugh said. ``It gets kids off the hook. `I'm
not bright, I'm not going to worry about it.' Well, I'm trying to
tell these kids, `Look at the end notes, look at the bibliography.
(The authors) worked hard.'
</P>
<P>
   With all of the qualms, funding has been quite a battle. In
1991-1992, and again in 1995-1996, Fitzhugh suspended publication.
In recent years, he says, his survival has been almost entirely
dependent on John Abele, founder and chairman of the Boston
Scientific Corp. Abele, a convert to Fitzhugh's ideas, provides
$85,000 to $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a way to make The Concord Review more
self-sufficient, Fitzhugh launched the National Review Board. It's
a service, that, for a fee, aims to give high school students
informed, unbiased comments and ratings on their research papers _
comments they can then attach to their college applications.
</P>
<P>
   A number of schools have signed onto the idea, including
Harvard, Princeton and Yale. And last year, Robert M. Kinnally,
dean of admission and financial aid at Stanford, wrote an
enthusiastic letter endorsing both The Concord Review and the
National Writing Board.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this week, came a note from Kinnally, who is stepping down
from his position, withdrawing those endorsements and demanding
that Fitzhugh remove Stanford's name from any promotional
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnally offered no explanation. When a reporter sought comment
from Stanford, James M. Montoya, vice provost for student affairs,
provided a written reply: ``Given the high level of anxiety
associated with the college admission process, we felt such an
endorsement was not in the best interest of college applicants.''
</P>
<P>
   Other university officials have argued that the National Review
Board service, for which Fitzhugh charges $60, should be free.
Fitzhugh said he'd be happy to do that if he had any money; he
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's decision is another sign, Fitzhugh says, that his
efforts are misunderstood. His is cheered, though, by the students
who tell him how much help The Concord Review has been.
</P>
<P>
   James Egelhofer, 18, of Holyoke, said he was inspired by copies
of the journal he read in his school library. They motivated him to
choose an unusual topic, attitudes toward World War I at his own
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually everyone does an encyclopedia, famous person, `Why
George Washington is Great' kind of paper,'' said Egelhofer, who
graduated from the Williston Northampton School in Easthampton and
is going to Brown. ``The Concord Review was in the back of my mind
saying, `You don't have to do that. Use primary sources. Do
something no one has done before.' ''

<P>
   In the eyes of the Association of American Medical Colleges,
Grace Lopez is not a minority. Even though she is
Salvadoran-American and has the broad face and caramel-colored skin
of a Mayan, to most medical school administrators, she's
essentially white.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who grew up poor in Los Angeles, is one of thousands of
minority students who face a tougher time getting into medical
school because the association excludes them from affirmative
action programs that could boost their chances.
</P>
<P>
   Under the narrow, 25-year-old definition of ``under-represented
minority'' used by the group, students whose parents immigrated
from the Caribbean, Central and South America, or Africa don't
qualify for special aid, even though they often face social,
cultural and economic hurdles that are just as high as those faced
by more established minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel there is an injustice,'' said Lopez, 26, who says she
got into Harvard Medical School without the aid of an affirmative
action program. ``You might have a Mexican-American who grew up
middle class and had more access to enrichment, and then someone
like me who overcame more challenges, but because I'm Salvadoran,
I'm not counted.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a controversial policy that has angered Asians, Latinos,
and Africans, all of whom say the policy is unfair and doesn't
reflect changes in immigration patterns. On the other side, some
white students say ethnicity shouldn't be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   In all the years that students have clamored for change, the
association has reviewed its policy annually, and has decided to
restrict affirmative action to four groups: African-Americans,
Native Americans, Mexican-Americans, and Puerto Ricans from the
mainland United States. Changing the policy now might open a
hard-to-resolve debate over which groups are most deserving,
association officials argue. But even they don't feel completely
comfortable with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were creating the under-represented groups today, would
they be different? I think it would be safe to say that it would
be,'' said Bob Beran, vice president for student affairs and
education services at the association, which sets standards for
admissions to US medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   Most US medical schools abide by the organization's policy,
under which they can choose an ``under-represented'' minority
student over a white student if their grades are equal.
``Under-represented'' means that the minority group produces a
lower percentage of the nation's doctors than its share of the
general population.
</P>
<P>
   But ``under-represented'' depends on how ethnic groups are
divided up. For instance, Asians get lumped into one category that
includes Pakistanis and Indians _ whose ranks include many doctors
_ along with Cambodians, Vietnamese, and Filipinos who produce few
doctors. Taken together, Asians aren't considered
under-represented.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the association's affirmative action stance is not
only unfair, but it hinders medical schools' ability to promote
diversity at a time when the schools themselves say they aren't
attracting enough minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, just 15 percent of the students who graduated from
medical school were members of ``under-represented'' minority
groups, though they made up 25 percent of the US population,
according to an association study released this week. The report
estimates that black, Native American, and Latino graduates of US
medical schools represent about 6 percent of practicing physicians
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When the organization set its policy in the mid-1970s, there
weren't large numbers of Latinos entering the United States from
countries such as El Salvador and the Dominican Republic. Nor were
there large influxes from countries like Haiti and Jamaica, or
refugees coming in from Vietnam and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the association hasn't created special categories for
these relative newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about people in the US who have historically
been disadvantaged in academic settings, it shouldn't matter if
you're Dominican or Haitian or Mexican,'' said Raul Ruiz, a
fifth-year Harvard Medical School student, who is of Mexican
descent. ``We've all grown up with similar disadvantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Some medical schools strictly adhere to the guidelines; others
say they adjust their definition of ``minority'' by taking into
account changing demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School, which prides itself on its minority
recruitment efforts, doesn't have many minorities outside of the
``under-represented minority'' category as defined by the AAMC.
</P>
<P>
   According to a school spokesman, about 25 percent of this year's
freshman class of 167 students is drawn from under-represented
minorities, including 16 African-Americans, 18 Mexican-Americans,
two Puerto Ricans from the mainland, and seven Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But there are only four other Latinos from all of Latin America,
four non-American blacks, and two people who classify themselves as
``other.'' Pulling up the overall minority numbers are 33
Asian/Pacific Islanders, allowing Harvard to boast that overall, 52
percent of the new class is minority, compared with the national
medical school average of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alvin Poussaint, associate dean of Harvard Medical School,
said he understands the thinking that went into the association's
policy. The four groups considered minorities historically have
been victims of discrimination in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But, if oppression at the hands of the US government is the
criteria, what about people from El Salvador, ask critics of the
policy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the United States poured
millions in military aid to the government, fueling a war in which
100,000 people died and many more became refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't measure oppression,'' said Ruiz. ``Who is to say
that the post-traumatic stress disorder that a Salvadoran gets from
seeing his family massacred by the Salvadoran military, with
backing from the US, is any different than the Native American''
whose family has been relegated to a reservation?
</P>
<P>
   But, even among medical school administrators, the issue of
which minority has suffered most becomes personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they (Salvadorans) have suffered the way my
parents did, and their parents,'' said Dr. Roland T. Smoot,
assistant dean for student affairs at Johns Hopkins Medical School
in Baltimore. ``My foreparents were slaves. That didn't involve
them (Salvadorans). Although the US can never repay us, there
should be some advantages because of what went on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than get into such delicate issues, the association has
chosen to hold the line on its affirmative action policy, and some
schools such as Johns Hopkins say they are getting away from
admissions practices that take race into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Johns Hopkins offers scholarships based on financial need rather
than minority set-asides, and only selects a minority over a white
student if the two are otherwise equal candidates, Smoot said.
Finally, he added, Johns Hopkins makes little effort to learn
applicants' ethnic history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten blond-haired, blue-eyed candidates (who) check off
African-American,'' he said. ``We don't say a thing. We don't go
into what they check.''

NEW GLIMPSES OF BLACK LIFE IN THE OLD WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. _ The freshly paved parking lot behind the
Bucket of Blood Saloon is marked with footprints, literally and
figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the small lot is crowded with cars, circa 2000. But 125
years ago, it was packed with people looking to drink, to dine,
maybe even to dance. Back then, the recently excavated site was
home to a saloon that archeologists and historians hope will tell
them much about the life of blacks in the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Boston Saloon, the bar in the heart of Virginia
City's entertainment district was owned and run by a black man from
Massachusetts named William A. G. Brown. Searchers so far have
turned up little more information about the proprietor. But
together with a team of students and other volunteers, they have
dug up enough artifacts to reconstruct at least part of the world
that free blacks inhabited at the height of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we had hoped to find was a ghetto of sorts,
but neighborhoods were not segregated and were in fact fairly well
integrated,'' said Ron James, director of the Nevada State Historic
Preservation Office. ``Instead, we found this fellow William Brown
who realized a chance to exploit the opportunities in one of the
most international cities of its time, more so than Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the scores of boxes now stored in an archeology lab at the
University of Nevada, Reno, is an Old West tale waiting to be
interpreted, once the thousands of excavated items are cleaned and
categorized. Many are melted or misshapen _ victims, like the
saloon itself, of the Great Fire of 1875, started by a drunken
miner who kicked over a kerosene lamp in his home up the hill from
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes shards of glass and whole glass bottles,
some with the stamped labels still legible. ``Essence of Jamaica
Ginger,'' the Pepto Bismol of the 19th century, reads one. There
are red-clay tobacco pipes and a white-clay one with the bowl
elaborately carved in the image of a British queen. A detailed
ceramic container once held cherry toothpaste ``for beautifying and
preserving the teeth and gums.'' The dig even uncovered a full set
of porcelain dentures whose small size indicates they belonged to a
female patron of the Boston Saloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, we have found things you might expect from a
saloon in the Old West _ glass tumblers and shot glasses,'' said
Kelly Dixon, a doctoral candidate at the university who helped
oversee the excavation. ``But we also found delicate stemware:
champagne flutes, tiny cordial glasses, brandy snifters, the type
of glassware that makes me rethink my paradigm of the Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   With the asphalt on the parking lot barely dry, researchers have
just begun to piece together the past. They know about Brown from
historical records _ that he arrived in Virginia City in 1862;
worked as a boot black, or shoe polisher; saved his earnings; then
opened the Boston Saloon in 1864 and relocated it within two years.
They know that about 100 blacks lived on the mountain, which had
25,000 or so residents at its most populated time and is located
about 25 miles from Reno.
</P>
<P>
   But not until a few years ago did they learn for certain where
the saloon had stood for nine years, an almost unheard of time for
a business to last in the boom-and-bust West of the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular myth _ brought about by the decision to set
the 1960s TV show ``Bonanza'' in Virginia City _ it was no cow town
or even a cowboy town. Workers did not ride herd. Mostly, the white
residents worked in the segregated silver mines, coming to take
part and maybe make their riches on the Comstock Lode.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitan Virginia City was a place to be. Stars of the day
played the town, which is situated between Salt Lake City and San
Francisco. Mark Twain got his start, and his adopted byline, at the
local newspaper. Some blacks prospered, too, owning several hair
salons and a boarding house, Dixon said. A black doctor examined
patients. And the Boston Saloon, also patronized by at least some
whites, was open to serve them, one of more than 100 saloons in
operation in the city's heyday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a series of things that make the site remarkable and
maybe unprecedented in the West,'' James said. ``There's the amount
of time in one location. There's the fire, which devastated the
central core of the community and shortly after which he sold the
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life rarely gets better than this in archeology,'' he added.
``This is descending into the way-cool zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The dig zone itself was actually quite small; the parking lot at
the corner of D and Union streets holds perhaps a dozen cars.
Still, at the height of tourist season, James and Dixon said, it
drew attention. People who went to the historic district to gamble,
shop, or say ``Howdy'' to the characters in period dress dropped by
to watch and to help over the five weeks of excavation.
</P>
<P>
   James and Dixon said the fire that had swept through downtown
turned out to be helpful, as did the continuous family ownership of
the saloon since 1931.
</P>
<P>
   What didn't burn was often preserved below the ash layer and
charred floorboards, including a gold $2.50 piece the size of a
dime, pieces of a gas lighting fixture, pressed-tin ceiling
fragments, keg taps made of a copper alloy, even intact rodent
skeletons. Sheep bones, Dixon said, help tell what was on the menu,
as does a Lea &AMP; Perrins steak sauce bottle. Tiny unearthed beads
indicate the presence of women in the saloon, which was probably a
family gathering place.
</P>
<P>
   What the archeologists did not uncover, or have not cleaned the
piecesenough to know, were artifacts that specifically point to the
presence of black patrons at Boston Saloon. Instead, they said, the
evidence examined so far indicates that blacks lived much like
whites, at least in the West of those days.
</P>
<P>
   But that alone speaks to how blacks made their own way in
freedom and offers contrasts with enslaved blacks and perhaps
similarities with other free blacks in the East. The best pieces
from the dig, the results of one of four saloon digs in Virginia
City in recent years, will be sent on tour, Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still hoping that while we're cleaning this stuff up,
we'll realize, `Oh, this wasn't a wine bottle, it was
hair-straightening tonic,' '' she said as she pulled artifacts from
manila envelopes and plastic bags. ``Either way, we'll have a
clearer understanding of the American West if you were an
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with ethnic groups in the Old West,
sometimes documents are written with a racist slant,'' Dixon added.
``So archeology really represents the best medium to reconstruct
their everyday life. Whatever we end up with will be
illuminating.''

IN SEARCH OF DEEP THROAT 
The Greatest Political Mystery of Our Time 
By Leonard Garment 
Basic Books, 280 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a quarter-century after a furtive, chain-smoking
phantom whispered Watergate tips to a little-known Washington Post
reporter, many have tried but none has succeeded in unmasking
``Deep Throat,'' Bob Woodward's famous anonymous source.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the attention Leonard Garment's book has received,
Deep Throat's identity is probably still among the best-kept
secrets of the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Garment, who served in Richard Nixon's White House _ ultimately
as counsel to the president _ deduces that John Sears, a canny
political operative who would later manage Ronald Reagan's
campaigns, is the whistleblower who helped topple a president.
</P>
<P>
   His arguments are not convincing, however. As he checks off the
long list of usual and not-so-usual suspects, Garment actually
makes better or equally strong cases for several other candidates,
but discards them for one reason or another. In this way, he may be
covered somewhat when Deep Throat confesses, or when he dies and is
revealed by Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   A sometime suspect himself, Garment disqualifies himself by
saying he was constitutionally incapable of such stealth and
secretiveness. We must take him at his word on that.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Sears and Woodward have both denied Garment's
identification; so has Woodward's partner in reporting Watergate
for the Post, Carl Bernstein. Sears even offered to take a
polygraph test and threatened to sue over the allegation that he
was Deep Throat. The sobriquet, borrowed from the title of a
pornographic film of the day, was used to refer to the key source
in Woodward and Bernstein's 1974 bestseller, ``All the President's
Men.''
</P>
<P>
   End of story? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Garment, his flimsy, headline-grabbing hook is
almost a trifling aside amid the broader themes of this book. There
isn't an ounce of body fat in his often clever prose _ which makes
``In Search of Deep Throat'' one snappy read from start to finish,
Garment's shortcomings as a gumshoe notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   You needn't be a Nixon or Watergate junkie to appreciate his
penetrating analysis of this momentous chapter in American history
and the players involved, Garment included. Part morality play,
part self-deprecating memoir, part political science tutorial, ``In
Search of Deep Throat'' achieves the seemingly impossible: offering
fresh insight into an old, picked-over piece of history.
</P>
<P>
   Garment catalogs and assesses the legacy of Watergate: the
Office of the Independent Counsel, new financial-reporting
requirements for high-level officials, the Office of Government
Ethics, the growth in public-interest organizations,
campaign-finance reform, and whistleblower-protection laws, and
``the rise to a more adversarial culture in journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Garment also displays a remarkable grasp of journalism, its
mechanics and limitations, and the role of the press in American
political discourse. To those who contend that official
investigations, not journalists, rolled over the rocks to reveal
the scurrying felons behind the Watergate coverup, Garment offers a
significant rebuttal. ``What a government organization
investigates, how wide it casts its net, what others will think of
the often-inconclusive information it turns up _ all these things
are mightily influenced, in the United States, by the climate of
knowledge and opinion among both the population as a whole and
interested elites,'' he writes. ``This climate, in turn, is shaped
in significant part by the press.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the story of the Watergate break-in at the Democratic
Party headquarters, and of subsequent attempts to conceal it and
other acts of political sabotage, Deep Throat steered the
Washington Post reporters and altered the climate, Garment asserts.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz saxophonist-turned-lawyer, however, is at his best
analyzing Nixon, who still fascinates him. Of his one-time law
partner, Garment writes: ``You can dig endlessly and profitably
into the details of his history; they are indeed illuminating. But
in the end you cannot explain him with any certainty. In
particular, the details do not fully explain why he lived his life,
personal and political, by giving so little of himself in such
small, separate packets to different people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Garment all but confesses that his search for Deep
Throat was more a vehicle to solve ``the larger puzzle of Richard
Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the end justifies his means, flaws and all.

BARENAKED LADIES DRESS UP FAMILIAR RECIPE IN `MAROON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hip as it is for the musical cognescenti to scoff at Barenaked
Ladies's relentlessly congenial and geekily ironic folk-pop, for my
money they can stay.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to suggest that the Canadian outfit's fifth album,
``Maroon'' marks any sort of musical evolution for the band or even
adds anything of note to the pop canon, although there is a measure
of newfound maturity in both the songwriting and the lyrical themes
of some of the album's 12 tracks. But what's good about ``Maroon''
is what has stayed the same: Barenaked Ladies fill a near-bare
niche for clever, well-crafted pop songs for grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Barenaked Ladies' 1998 breakthrough album, ``Stunt,'' seamlessly
merged the band's relentless wise-guy humor with big production
values, and the result was a string of smash hit singles (``One
Week,'' ``It's All Been Done,'' ``Call and Answer'') and more than
4 million in sales. To enhance the odds of repeating that success,
the Ladies brought uber-producer Don Was (Rolling Stones, Bonnie
Raitt, Paul Westerberg, Iggy Pop) on board for ``Maroon,'' and the
result will no doubt be a string of smash hit singles and...you get
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the band dabbles in genres, from their trademark
jangly pop-rock (``Too Little Too Late,'' ``Never Do Anything,''
``Falling For the First Time'') and alt-country (``Go Home'') to
near-bossa nova (``Conventioneers'') and novelty ditty (``Tonight
Is the Night That I Fell Asleep At the Wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is a strangely affecting song sung from the
post-humous perspective of the victim. It's skewed and ironic as
ever, but also strikes a deeper chord, as do the loungey
``Conventioneers'' _ a thumbnail sketch of a business-trip affair _
and ``Sell Sell Sell,'' a Hollywood morality tale set to
glockenspiel and timpani drum.

   ``Pinch Me'' is the wisely-chosen first single, already all over
the radio. It's a jaunty, mid-tempo musing on sleepwalking through
life that questions the ultimate meaning of anything more complex
than running through the sprinklers. A big part of BNL's appeal is
their refusal to leave behind the goony, sensitive smart-aleck
within (approximate age: 17) that's convinced life _ heartbreak and
alienation and moral decay included _ is a joke. That proud
geekiness is still intact. But BNL's formerly rampant cultural
references have been replaced by _ egads _ a bit of heartfelt
revelation, and glibness is tempered by moments of wistfulness and
reflection.

   ``Maroon'' is fun-loving, yes, but deceptively so. This is ear
candy with a spine, a stronger one than one might expect from
Barenaked Ladies.

FREEWHEELING AND CAR HANDLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. There have been many articles recently about new car
technologies that will save fuel and reduce pollution, such as fuel
cells and freewheels. My question is: Will freewheels affect car
handling? Will it be more difficult to turn? &QL; 
J.C., Belmont, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I assume by ``freewheel'' you mean ``flywheel'' _ perhaps
it's an expression with which I'm unfamiliar (could this be?). A
flywheel is basically just a heavy wheel that can be used to
temporarily store energy in its rotation. The idea is a nice one
since very large amounts of energy can be stored in quite modest
flywheels. The tricky bit is that a flywheel doesn't just hold
energy, but it holds a more subtle quantity called ``angular
momentum'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   The angular momentum of a rotating object can be visualized as a
sort of resistance to having its axis of rotation changed. A
bicycle in motion tends not to fall over as this would mean
changing the axis about which the wheels turn. Rifles have spiral
grooves in the barrel to make the bullets spin as they fly _ it
makes them go straighter.
</P>
<P>
   The more angular momentum something has, the harder it is to
change its axis of rotation. For a flywheel, the angular momentum
is greater the faster it turns. This means that the more energy you
store in a flywheel, the more angular momentum it has, and the
harder it will get to turn.
</P>
<P>
   The catch with flywheels for cars then is that, when you've got
a lot of angular momentum stored up, you will find it hard to move
in ways that change the axis about which the flywheel rotates.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a flywheel, a car that's going fast may flip over
as it goes around a corner in order not to have the angular
momentum carried by its wheels change too quickly _ and that's for
wheels made of rubber and air. Concrete tires would never puncture
but they'd carry so much angular momentum that handling on curves
would be hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   Flywheels to store energy can be good ideas, but you have to be
careful with the application and think about how much angular
momentum you dump into them and how you want the vehicle that
carries them to behave on curves. For example, for trains that
pretty much go in straight lines, flywheels can be a great idea.

UP, UP AND AWAY IN NEW MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to compete with New Mexico's natural beauty. But the
Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta does just that. During the
annual event, to be held this year Oct. 7-15, the deep blue skies
of Albuquerque are dotted with hundreds of hot-air balloons in so
many colors and patterns and shapes that all spectators can do is
say, ``Ooooh.'' Or maybe ``Ahhhh.'' Here are some facts and
figures:
</P>
<P>
   --The event draws nearly 20 percent of the total number of known
balloons worldwide, with about 900 at the fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   --There are more than 1 million spectator visits during the
fiesta. And there are no barriers: Spectators can walk right up to
the balloons and chat with the crews.
</P>
<P>
   --More than 25 million still photos are taken each year, which
is why the fiesta calls itself the world's most photographed event.
Vendors stroll the grounds selling film (all of it Kodak, which
sponsors the event).
</P>
<P>
   --Special events include mass ascensions and ``night glow''
displays in which the balloons, fired by propane, glow
majestically.
</P>
<P>
   --Balloon Fiesta Park covers more than 350 acres. Both admission
and parking prices are low. Costumed characters stroll around, and
booths sell everything from balloon-shaped hats to Native American
crafts to green chile burritos to buffalo burgers. Not bad for an
event that began 28 years ago in a shopping mall parking lot with
13 balloons.
</P>
<P>
   (For more information on the fiesta, call 800-284-2282 or visit
www.balloonfiesta.com. For information on balloon rides during the
event, call 800-725-2477. &QL;

   Travel Trivia: Not only do this state and this province share a
border, their names begin with the same letter. What are they?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: The little town of Halfway, Ore., has changed its name
to Half.com for a year in connection with a promotion by the Web
site of the same name. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``The worst thing any tourist can do is to be ignorant of
the local customs, politics and geography. . . . Imagine if you
were talking to a visiting tourist (who) had no idea who Bill
Clinton was. . . . You must read up on the country you are
(planning on) visiting'' _ from CoolTravelMail.com, via faithful
contributor Mike Schuster of Foxborough, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ala-kazam: If you stayed at the old Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas
during its final days, as we did, you no doubt were less than
impressed. But that building has been imploded, and the only thing
the new Aladdin has in common with the old is the name. The new
building has 2,567 guest rooms, 130 shops, 21 restaurants, two
pools, and a European-style gaming club. It also has an appropriate
phone number: 877-333-WISH. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Restless on the road: Nearly half of all travelers suffer from
sleeplessness, says a survey by Hilton Hotels and the National
Sleep Foundation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Who's confused? Diamonds and pearls brought into the United States
are duty-free if they're loose but can be taxed if they're part of
rings or pendants. Cameras made in India are duty free but those
from Japan are not. The rules change often, writes Travel Holiday,
so it's a good idea to check the Customs Department Web site at
www.customs.treas.gov. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Scads of sand: Twenty-four percent of the earth's land is desert. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Minnesota and Manitoba. &QL;

<P>
   Responding to a Canadian reader's comment that the United States
should have a name for its citizens rather than ``Americans''
(perhaps ``Bob''), Alan Colosi of Boston writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese have a specific name for United States citizens:
`Beikokujin.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Beikoku' (equals) `The United States.' . . . (and) `jin'
(equals) `a person.' Therefore specific for a person of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other word. `Amerikajin' . . . means practically the same
thing. `America' as a designation for the United States is
relatively recent in the history of our country's power of
influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, someone does have a name for United States citizens
specifically. Call me `Beikokujin.' Or, call me `Bostonian.' Don't
call me `Bob.' That's a failed Microsoft operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the same subject, Neil F. Dunn of Danvers, Mass. writes,
``Mexicans call us `norteamericanos' (North Americans) even though
anyone from Canada down to and including Panama is a North
American, technically. Go figure.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fall is one of the best seasons in New England. There are still
lots of warm and sunny days, the crowds have left the popular
tourist areas, all attractions, restaurants, and resorts are open,
and, best of all, it's the most colorful season, not just from
foliage but also from festivals.
</P>
<P>
   If you have even a hint of Scottish blood, an event next weekend
is one not to miss. It's the 25th anniversary for the New Hampshire
Highland Games Friday through Sunday at Loon Mountain in New
Hampshire. The games have grown to become the largest Scottish
cultural festival in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more than just ``games'' at this festival. On
Saturday, 39 pipe bands will be performing at noon and 5:30 p.m.
And at 5 p.m. the first-ever Grade One Challenge of the top pipe
bands in the country _ the Los Angeles Scots and the City of
Washington band _ will be held. On Friday evening, Battlefield
Band, Scotland's favorite, will perform, and other musical events
will be held throughout the weekend. There also will be
whisky-tasting seminars, exhibits by more than 60 clans and
societies, dancing, dinners, 20 Scottish food outlets, tartan and
genealogical workshops, athletic events, a sheepdog competition, a
Highland dance championship, and lots of children's activities.
</P>
<P>
   For advance tickets, call 800-358-SCOT. For more information,
visit www.nhscot.org.
</P>
<P>
   Other New England events include:
</P>
<P>
   Harwich Cranberry Harvest Festival, now through Sunday, Harwich
on Cape Cod. Call 800-441-3199.

   One of America's most accessible national parks, Shenandoah,
just two hours from Washington, D.C., features some grand fall

   You'll want to take your time and look for white-tailed deer,
black bear and bobcats, wild turkey, owls, and more than 200 other

varieties of trees, 200 species of birds, and 1,100 flowering
plants. Foliage in the park usually peaks between Oct. 5 and 25 In
addition to its natural wonders, the park includes a presidential
retreat that can be visited. Camp Rapidan was built by President
Herbert Hoover as a retreat, for himself and future presidents.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt instead built Camp David, which has
been used by all presidents since. Hoover donated the camp to the
National Park Service, which is now restoring it to its original

A HOLY STAIRWAY THAT'S TOUGH ON THE KNEES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Amid a black cloud of habited nuns, all of us playing
kneesies with a rising series of walnut planks, I wonder if a
cluster of orthopedic surgeons will be at the top, offering a
Jubilee Year discount on arthroscopic carving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good for your soul,'' Brother Marcelo, a
Benedictine monk in Boston, had promised, hyping the spiritual joy
of climbing the Holy Stairway.
</P>
<P>
   But bad for the cartilages and ligaments, I am thinking about
this ascent on bended, creaking knees. I doubt that the sisters
surrounding me, four abreast on the stairs, are bothered by such
thoughts. Darkly clad, they must be powered by lightness and
purity.
</P>
<P>
   Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!
</P>
<P>
   Bone sounds against wood that now protects the marble staircase,
said to have belonged to Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem, and up which
Christ was dragged to receive the fatal judgment. Thunk! Thunk!
Thunk! Thunk!
</P>
<P>
   A constant staccato as the otherwise silent, prayerful
procession moves ahead slowly, like a lazy, backward waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows, doing this penance (for whatever literary sins
committed over the years against you, kind reader?) won't hurt me.
But if I give up and stand up, will a lightning bolt from heaven
strike me?
</P>
<P>
   Better not take a chance. Onward and upward, wishing I had the
relics of Thomas (Satch) Sanders: the knee pads he wore in college
on his way up to glory with the Celtics, before Red Auerbach told
him they weren't manly.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight steps is the route to the Papal Chapel, a solemn
journey of about five minutes in an elegant building that used to
be a papal palace. Just across the street from the basilica of St.
John Lateran.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims from Mozambique and various other civilians await their
turn in the movable flock as my partners in climb and I make it to
the landing, and can legitimately use our feet again. My friend,
Aurelio, says, ``We can walk down on the adjoining stairs. It's too
crowded to make the trip in reverse and further risk that dread
affliction, housemaid's knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallelujah.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Staircase, supposedly located in Pontius Pilate's
prefecture, was considered a prize find of an avid Holy Land relics
collector of the 4th century, Helena (eventually St. Helena),
mother of Constantine, the first Christian emperor of Rome. She
claimed that spots, glass encased, are drops of Christ's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Who could estimate the numbers that have knee-bumped-and-jerked
their way to the top of Pilate's peak? For centuries pilgrims have
gravitated to Rome and this ``stairway to heaven,'' as one of them
whispers to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``A religious theme park?'' suggests Desmond O'Grady in his
fascinating new book, ``Rome Reshaped (Jubilees 1300-2000).''
O'Grady writes, ``There have been pilgrims at least since the 2nd
century. One example is Hegesippus, a converted Jew, who came to
Rome in about 180 and wrote an account.''
</P>
<P>
   However, this is the year of years, not only a Jubilee _
celebrated every 25 years _ but the only one to coincide with a
millennium. So how can you be in Rome and not feel the pull of
pilgrimage, the heritage of Hegesippus? Moreover, it's considerably
easier than in his day. I mean, staying at the Cavallieri Hilton
with its superb spa has an edge on those bygone bathless inns where
your roommates were fleas in the mattress. If there was a mattress.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Grady, a pilgrim's grand slam (or ``spiritual
Olympics'') consists of visiting each of the town's seven
heaviest-duty churches, called basilicas: St. Peter, St. John
Lateran, St. Paul Outside the Walls, St. Mary Major, St. Sebastian
Outside the Walls, St. Laurence Outside the Walls, Holy Cross. Plus
the Holy Stairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we have to do then,'' Aurelio had said. ``On foot,
like the pilgrims of old.'' She showed me a map. ``They're very
far-flung. But it's only about 28 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   The map also indicates that each may be reached by public
transport, I pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that would be cheating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheating in a holy cause, though,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting out, we asked an Italian friend, Giovanni
Clerici, if he'd care to come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, so you are pellegrini?'' he said, smiling and shaking his
head negatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?'' Aurelio said. ``Didn't Pellegrini play third base for
the Red Sox when they won the '46 pennant? Eddie Pellegrini?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps,'' Clerici said, ``but it is also the Italian word for
pilgrims. But, tell me, do you have the proper dress for pilgrims?
Sackcloth and ashes, I believe. Quite important, as you will read
in the old journals.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Davidson at the Andover Shop in Cambridge, Mass., had
told me the same thing, although confessing that he was out of
sackcloth and ashes. ``But the latest papal encyclical says that
khaki and oxford cloth will do.'' A relief.
</P>
<P>
   Clerici bade us ``buon viaggio!'' and we embarked on a $25 taxi
ride to the most distant, St. Sebastian, well beyond the city, near
the cobbled Appian Way. While Rome is hardly a place of peace and
quiet, plain, understated St. Sebastian (San Sebastiano) and the
ancient chariot highway are loaded with it. St. Sebastian, the
well-known target of anti-Christian archers, appears as a wooden
carving, blending into the brightly-hued and coffered ceiling.
Golden-coiffed, a 10-footer covered only by a loincloth, he is a
hunk, seeming impervious to the two arrows protruding from his neck
and belly.
</P>
<P>
   The church was empty, as were our stomachs. But a good lunch in
the garden of the nearby Antica Hostaria l'Archeologia took care of
that, shaded by a 400-year-old wisteria, once a vine, now a
veritable redwood with a trunk 4 feet around.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll along the deserted Appian Way evoked the days of Roman
legions returning from triumphs, bearing treasure, and prodding
prisoners who would become slaves. The birds were real, numerous,
and melodic. Not the ones on the eternal tape in your brain,
playing Respighi's ``Pines of Rome'' as you walk the paving stones
that jolted charioteers' kidneys. Crumbling fortified towers line
the bucolic route, along with walled estates. Centuries-old faces
that hoped to be remembered stare at you in bas relief from
deteriorating tombs. The Way is a crowded housing development of
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Presently we reached an up-to-date road, bought luscious
cherries from a man who directed us to a bus stop. Two bus rides
later, St. Laurence (San Lorenzo) loomed on the spot where the
namesake was martyred, incinerated in 258. It seems to brood, dusty
and faded. But the crypt, containing the tomb of Pope Pius IX, is
lined with brilliant mosaics in red, aqua, and gold, and delicate
brick archways and marble columns open to the cloister garden.
</P>
<P>
   A huge cemetery in the rear goes on for blocks and up a
hillside, the residence of regiments of lively cats and, in
grandiose sepulchers, apparently, former prominent citizens. But
the one that caught my eye was the simple grave of husband and wife
Oscar and Luisa Cadlolo (she died last year). The photo on the
stone freezes them middle-aged on a happy day, up to their necks in
the sea, smiling joyfully and waving to someone on shore. It
remains the wave goodbye to their friends.
</P>
<P>
   The next day put us in the company of true early pilgrims, who
were often set upon by brigands. Whatever brigand pickpocketed me
on the subway, en route to St. Mary Major (Santa Maria Maggiore),
was slick, unnoticed, and $30 richer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they didn't get your wallet,'' consoled Aurelio.
``Don't you think it's a deductible expense?''
</P>
<P>
   It was an expensive deduction, I agreed. Maybe it could be
considered a roundabout donation to the church to which we were
traveling? Although the IRS might look at it differently. It would
take a lot of gall after walking through the Porta Santa, the holy
door. During a Jubilee, each of the Big Seven has such an entry. An
explanatory sign, in English: ``The door is Christ; pass from sin
to grace.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 ROME: ... sin to grace.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Mary Major is huge with lots of marble columns in sworls of
amber, sea green, ruby, black, and cream. Decorated with frescoes,
mosaics, paintings, and more gold than the Klondike, it's pretty
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   I like the legend of its origin, which also brings the chilly
Klondike to mind. On Aug. 3, 352, the Virgin Mary, showing up in a
dream of a wealthy Roman named Giovanni, directed him to build a
temple for her wherever he found snow. Snow in Rome is as likely as
such a dream. But snow in August? A capital-M miracle. Yet there it
was, like baked Alaska, on the Esquiline Hill. And there the church
stands behind a massive facade with five doors and topped by a
balustrade from which Mary and other saints peer.
</P>
<P>
   At rush hour the bus to St. Peter (San Pietro) was as cozy as
the Black Hole of Calcutta. Traffic was murder. You wonder how
riders on innumerable motorscooters stay alive, leaking through the
automotive morass like water through a screen.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's home dome has never looked spiffier, gleaming from
cleaning and rehab that kept it hidden by scaffolding in 1999.
Although too vast for my taste in churches, nevertheless it's so
tastefully done: ornate isn't piled on ornate as in so many. If the
pope ever comes up short he could hire out the hall for any number
of sporting events, including arena football.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking tradition, the pope opened Peter's Porta Santa last
Christmas Day with merely a push instead of breaking in.
Customarily, at the conclusion of a previous holy year, the door
had been shut tight and bricked in. The ritual of his predecessors
had been to hammer away like a safecracker for a while at the
doorway before workmen finished the job of clearing away the
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II felt a gentle rather than jarring touch was
called for this time, saying, ``Open to me, Gate of Justice; this
is the Gateway of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony hadn't been so benign in 1575 when Pope Gregory
XIII pounded a hole in the pre-loosened bricks, reports the author
O'Grady. A crowd estimated at 300,000 stormed the door, hoping to
be among the first through Porta Santa, and ``in the crazed
scrimmage six people had been killed.'' That was one way to meet
St. Peter.
</P>
<P>
   The tune ``I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls'' is inescapable as
you roam the airy expanses. A big toe of St. Peter's bronze statue
has been worn to the bone (do statues have bones?) by hordes of
touchy-feely types playing ``this little piggy'' in search of good
fortune. Well, why not? I grasped for an instant, thinking, ``This
little piggy will go to market for a replacement one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Past Peter's tomb, at the rear, is Bernini's dove as the holy
spirit. Winging through a golden sunburst window, surrounded by a
jam of angels, this bird holds you, and might even give an atheist
pause.
</P>
<P>
   One more day for these pilgrims. Taxiing again, way out west, we
found St. Paul (San Paolo) beside the Tiber a delight. ``Nobody
goes here,'' said the driver, Mario Floris. ``It's too far from the
center.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were people, savoring the parklike atmosphere of more
trees and greenery than decorate the other six basilicas. St. Paul
is a forest of marble columns, fronted by a colonnade that encloses
a courtyard garden distinguished by hedges and palms and a statue
of Paul. A triangular portico and a gold cross top the pillared
facade that blazes in gold mosaics and a figure of Christ that can
be seen for a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Four rows of columns march along the lofty, stunning nave and
into the transept, where the decor of malachite, lapis lazuli, and
marble is lavish-plus. Saints stare down gravely from near the
ceiling, maybe reminding you not to miss the frescoes of Paul's
life. More intimate is the barrel-vaulted chapel of St. Benedict,
with much gold leaf, and the rose garden in the cloister.
</P>
<P>
   Back in town, a trolley was the vehicle to Holy Cross (Santa
Croce in Gerusalemme). Smaller, less showy than its colleagues in
the basilican grand slam, Holy Cross is restful, dimly lighted,
squeezed between two nondescript buildings. But its trove of
treasures amassed by the indefatigable sacred-souvenir-hunting St.
Helena on her sweep through Jerusalem in 326, would impress
anybody, even a skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   Behind glass in St. Helena's Chapel are a piece of the cross to
which Christ's companion in crucifixion, a thief, was nailed. Also
fragments of Christ's cross, a nail that pierced him, two thorns
from his crown. And St. Thomas's thumb. The chapel, the story goes,
is built on dirt she brought back from Golgotha.
</P>
<P>
   Is any of it genuine? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   St. Helena is prominent in frescoes, a forerunner of today's
philanthropic donors getting their due. You can get a Christ
baseball cap, T-shirt, holy honey and soap, as well as memorabilia
in the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Close by, only a minor walk along the old city wall, is St. John
Lateran (San Giovanni Laterano), number seven in the pilgrimage.
Some old men were playing cards in the shade of a marble St.
Francis as we approached the elegant facade, a sparkling alabaster
edifice of five doorways, five second-story portals, balconies, and
a balustrade on high on which saints pose.
</P>
<P>
   I was basilica'd out. Within, all was a magnificent blur of
altars, tombs, statuary, paintings, archways, a reliquary bearing
splinters of Saints Peter and Paul's skulls. I had no more
adjectives left. Next door, in the domed baptistery, was a grand
tub. I would gladly have crawled in for a bath or a nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``One to go,'' enthused Aurelio. ``Across the street. Scala
Santa _ the Holy Stairs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not quite the battle of wounded knee, but we make it.
Pilgrim's progress of a sort.
</P>
<P>
   Friend Clerici greets us at the Cavallieri Hilton with, ``Ciao,
pellegrini! But why are you wearing shoes?''
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought you read O'Grady's book. Here . . ..'' He has it
opened to page 94, and intones: `` `Devout Pope Clement VIII walked
barefoot to the Jubilee churches each month during the Jubilee of
1600.' That is the real pilgrim's way.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we cheated. Please don't tell the pope.

BLUBBER AND BEYOND, A LEGACY LIVES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ It's not difficult to find the physical
heritage of this city's glory days as the whaling capital of the
world. The mid-19th-century grand Federal-style mansions where
shipowners and captains lived line several New Bedford streets. And
the New Bedford Whaling Museum on Johnny Cake Hill shows off the
artifacts of the era immortalized in Herman Melville's novel
``Moby-Dick,'' including a half-scale replica of a typical whaling
ship and the skeleton of a 33-foot-long humpback whale.
</P>
<P>
   But a New Bedford experience doesn't have to concentrate
completely on artifacts or on bricks and mortar. Along Coggeshall
St., Acushnet Ave., County St., and others in tightknit New Bedford
neighborhoods, a visitor can see, taste, savor, and smell the
varied aromas of another legacy of the whaling era: a powerful
Portuguese presence in the city. An estimated 65 percent of New
Bedford's 100,000 residents are of Portuguese birth or descent,
probably the highest of any community in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the local Portuguese community, who continue a
lively cultural history in restaurants, bakeries, social clubs, and
cafes, has links not to mainland Portugal, but to the Azores, where
whaling was once as central to local life as it was to New
Bedford's. An autonomous territory of Portugal, the Azores are a
group of islands in the Atlantic a little more than halfway between
North America and Europe; its inhabitants speak Portuguese. ``The
Azores were the first place that whaling ships would stop after
leaving New Bedford,'' says whaling museum librarian Judith Downey.
``They'd get fresh water and pick up any additional crew they
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Azorean families were split between their home islands and
New Bedford, keeping in touch through letters and by exchanging
photographs. Currently on display through the end of September in
the Coachman's House on the grounds of the Rotch-Jones-Duff House
and Garden Museum (508-997-1401) at 396 County Road is an
exhibition entitled ``Azorean Connections: Photographic Images of
the Brothers Goulart.''
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the 20th century, Manuel Goulart emigrated to New
Bedford from Fayal in the Azores and became a professional
photographer. His brother, Jose, remained at home, but also took up
photography. The exhibition consists mainly of photographs taken in
the Azores by both brothers over half a century, and vividly evokes
a vanished way of life. Also on view with the photos is a companion
exhibit of more than 200 pieces of traditional Azorean and mainland
Portuguese ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   Sited on a hilltop looking down on New Bedford harbor, the
Rotch-Jones-Duff House and its beautiful grounds, a popular spot
for weddings, occupies an entire city block. It's typical of the
homes owned by the wealthy merchants and shipowners ironically
described in ``Moby Dick.'' ``All these brave houses and flowery
gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans,''
Melville wrote. ``One and all, they were harpooned and dragged
hither from the bottom of the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Whaling was a traditional Azorean occupation and for centuries
the islanders hunted whales from shore in open boats. A sturdy but
graceful eight-man Azorean whaleboat is one of the permanent
exhibits in the New Bedford Whaling Museum
(508-997-0046/www.whalingmuseum.org). Expansion plans in progress
include adding a new gallery that will be devoted entirely to the
role of Azoreans in the city's whaling history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connection between the Azores and New Bedford's whaling
and fishing industries is direct, extensive, and continuing, ''
says Arthur Motta, the city's tourism director. ``Whaling ships
also stopped at the Azores on their way back from the whaling
grounds and some Azorean sailors were so homesick that they jumped
ship,'' says Motta. ``But if they wanted to get paid for a three-
or four-year voyage, they had to go on to New Bedford. Most did and
a lot stayed'' in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese seafaring tradition remains strong.``New Bedford
has a fishing fleet of more than 225 vessels,'' Motta notes. ``Many
of them are owned and worked by Portuguese families.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to the whaling museum, and probably the most visited place
in New Bedford, is the Seamen's Bethel, the nondenominational
chapel directly across from it. Described in ``Moby Dick,'' the
bethel is known for its distinctive pulpit shaped like the bow of a
sailing ship. Marble tablets line the walls, moving memorials to
men who died _ typically after falling from a ship's rigging, being
eaten by sharks, drowning when a whale capsized their boat, or
succumbing to fever _ on 19th-century voyages to the far corners of
the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Tablets continue to be added to the bethel. Nowadays, the
tablets tell of local fishermen lost at sea. In contrast to the
Anglo-Saxon names of whalemen memorialized in Melville's day, New
Bedford fishermen remembered in the bethel now often have
Portuguese surnames such as Madeiros, DaSilva, Cardoso, or
Lopes.``We lost a fishing boat and its crew just last year,''
recalls Motta. ``It's a fact of life here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy merchants lived on the heights, but Portuguese
immigrants settled largely around the waterfront in the north and
south ends of the city and in neighboring Fairhaven, still an
active fishing port. Although Portugese social clubs, football (as
in soccer) teams, newspapers, TV programs, and churches abound in
the area, a more tangible way to join in the culture is through
food. There are restaurants, bakeries, and shops selling Portuguese
wines, sausages, and other national specialties that evoke the
authentics tastes and aromas of Portugal and the Azores.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect fancy surroundings. ``Portuguese restaurants
here don't pay much attention to decor,'' acknowledges Motta, ``but
they really concentrate on the food. When you eat in one, you sit
down with local people, truck drivers and fishermen, and it's a
nice experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical dishes, found on just about every restaurant menu,
include kale soup, grilled sardines, seafood casserole (paella),
grilled meat, and of course, linguica, chourico, and other spicy
Portuguese sausage. Portions are invariably massive and accompanied
by a large basket of crusty bread. As a rule, there is a good
selection of imported Portuguese wines and beers in even the
smallest and simplest restaurant. Entrees are usually in the $8 to
$15 range.
</P>
<P>
   New Bedford's best-known and probably most accessible Portuguese
restaurant is Antonio's (508-999-3636) at 267 Coggeshall St. _ it's
right off Route 195 and has a large parking lot. Also popular and
well-regarded are Vasco Da Gama (508-993-4340) at 86 Dartmouth
Street, and Villa Verde (508-993-8483) at 362 Main St., Fairhaven.
</P>
<P>
   However, the largest concentration of Portuguese restaurants is
along Acushnet Ave. It's a long and rather shabby street, but it's
filled with intriguing aromas. Among the spots local people speak
highly of are Cafe Mimo (508-996-9443) at 1528 Acushnet Ave., Cafe
Portugal (508-992-8216) at 1280 Acushnet Ave., and Cafe Funchal
(508-990-1886) at 1708 Acushnet Ave.
</P>
<P>
   The avenue also has a number of bakeries producing sinfully
tasty breads and pastries. These include: Lydia's Bakery
(508-992-1711) at 1656 Acushnet Ave., offering a variety of
country-style breads, pastries, and malassadas (fried and sugared
dough), and Economy Bakery (508-992-9138) at 1685 Acushnet Ave.,
noted for ``pops'' _ small handrolled Portugese rolls that are
great for making sandwiches and having with dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Many of New Bedford's Portuguese restaurants essentially cater
to their immediate neighborhoods and can be hard to locate.
However, bakeries like the ones on Achushnet Ave. are easy to find
_ just follow your nose to the source of all those delicious smells
_ and be prepared to give in to temptation.

RESEARCHERS SAY INDUSTRIAL WASTE THREATENS LOONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The loons that grace northern New England's lakes and rivers are
cherished birds, the inspiration for everything from festivals in
their honor, to compact discs of their distinctive wail, to wood
carvings of their elegant black and white form.
</P>
<P>
   But toxic methylmercury is taking a toll on the loons,
undercutting their ability to reproduce and survive, according to
the findings of a team of private, government, industry, and
academic researchers. Many loons are producing only half their
normal number of offspring, they found, in part because their eggs
have become more fragile.
</P>
<P>
   The contaminant in their blood, a form of mercury, exists
naturally in the environment, but it is turning up in high levels
across New England, mostly because of air pollution, especially
from incinerators and coal-burning plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of evidence to suggest that New England's loons
are in trouble,'' said David Evers, director of the BioDiversity
Research Institute, a Maine nonprofit group on the team. After
seven years of research, the team has shown for the first time that
loons are being damaged by methylmercury.
</P>
<P>
   The most threatened loons are in Maine, where most of the
pollution sweeping into New England from the South and West ends
up. There, 27 percent of the loons contain so much methylmercury
that it is disrupting the formation of their eggs, as well as the
birds' behavior, development, immunity, and long-term survival.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is not much better in New Hampshire, where loons
soared to fame in ``On Golden Pond,'' the 1981 movie starring
Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda that was filmed on Squam Lake. In
that state, 15 percent of the loons are threatened by mercury. The
figure is the same in Vermont and 10 percent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   New England's loons have long been known to have the highest
methylmercury levels in the country, at least four times those of
the same birds in relatively pristine Alaska, which are considered
baseline. Methylmercury is so pervasive and severe that every state
in the region has advised anglers in recent years to avoid eating
much freshwater fish, the loons' top food source, because the fish
are laced with the contaminant.
</P>
<P>
   But loons are not the only creatures that consume fish, and the
researchers say it is now time to take a closer look at how
methylmercury may be harming wildlife such as bald eagles, great
blue herons, otters, and minks. All may be facing the same threat
as loons, an ``indicator species'' whose health reflects the
overall ecological health of the landscape on which it lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any of the wildlife that depends on fish for its diet will be
similarly affected,'' said Drew Major, a biologist at the US Fish
and Wildlife Service. It is also on the loon research team, along
with the US Environmental Protection Agency, state fish and game
and environmental agencies, private conservation groups, Tufts
University School of Veterinary Medicine, Canadian Wildlife
Service, and SPL Energy Maine Hydro.
</P>
<P>
   The team, known as the Northeast Loon Study Work Group, also
found that the loons at risk are behaving in ways that harm their
young: spending less time nest-sitting, foraging, resting, and
preening than healthy birds, while rustling about more for no
productive reasons, wasting needed energy.
</P>
<P>
   As their blood-mercury levels rise, the birds are producing
lighter eggs that are less likely to survive, and are growing
asymmetrical flight feathers, making it harder to fly, and thus
compete and survive. They are also producing more corticosterone, a
hormone associated with stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see a report like this, you realize that more has to
be done faster,'' said Kate Hartnett, senior biologist with the
Loon Preservation Committee, an arm of the Audubon Society of New
Hampshire and another team member. ``This should serve as a wake up
call to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are underway in the region to slash mercury emissions
from incinerators, power plants, manufacturing plants, and other
sources. The states are at various stages of meeting a 1998 pledge
by the New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers to halve
emissions by 2003. Some on Capitol Hill, including Sen. Patrick
Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, are pushing for stronger federal
controls following the release last year of a long overdue EPA
report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loons have been like coal mine canaries as we have studied the
environmental effects of mercury,'' Leahy said, commenting on the
report. ``They are among the first animals to show its poisonous
effects on organisms and ecosystems as it accumulates on its way up
the food chain. Mercury is the last major toxic without a control
strategy because the corporate polluters have prevented action by
arguing that we need more evidence.''

WHY THE COLORS CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do the fall colors occur?
</P>
<P>
   Don Smith, Connecticut's state forester, tells us that according
to Native American legend, ``Celestial hunters slew the Great Bear
autumn, and the spilled blood turned the leaves red. The yellow of
fall came from the fat splattering out of the kettle as the hunters
cooked their prize.''
</P>
<P>
   However, scientifically and simply put, trees do not begin
producing fall color, as many believe. Instead, according to the
Maine Forest Service, as the dominant summer green colors fade, the
fall colors that were there all along are unmasked, revealing the
autumn coloration of reds, oranges, and yellows.
</P>
<P>
   And for an even more scientific explanation, this is how Yankee
magazine describes the process: Leaves contain a green pigment
called chlorophyll, which uses the sun's energy to make sugars that
feed the plant. Chlorophyll breaks down in the process but is
continually replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In autumn, things slow down. The leaf is sealed off from the
moisture and nutrients, which eventually causes it to fall from the
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of moisture and nutrients causes chlorophyll to be
replaced more slowly, allowing brown, yellow, and orange pigments
called carotenoids, which have been in the leaf all along, to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Red and purple pigments called anthocyanins develop in the sap
in late summer. If the autumn weather is bright and cool, and the
nights chilly but not freezing, more anthocyanins are produced,
leading to more brilliant color.
</P>
<P>
   Smith offers this brief guide to leaf color: red only _ red oak,
white oak; yellow only _ quaking aspen, birch, hickory, Norway
maple, tulip tree; red or yellow _ cherry, red maple; brown or
yellow _ silver maple; bronze _ beech; bronze or red _ sugar maple
and scarlet oak; purple or red _ dogwood; purple, red, or yellow _
ash; purple, red, yellow, or orange _ sassafras and sumac.

   For more than 65 years, a great source of information on fall
foliage has been Yankee magazine, whose September and October

MAKE PLANS NOW TO SEE NEW ENGLAND'S DAZZLING DISPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the outlook for New England's most colorful season?
``Terrific!''
</P>
<P>
   And that's not the opinion of one person. We talked to a
``foliologist,'' Maine's Leaf Lady, and a couple of forestry
specialists _ and each said the season is going to be ``terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   The foliage season is beginning now and will continue into
November. It starts in the northern reaches of New England and
Canada and slowly moves south. Without fail, there is usually peak
color in most parts of New England during the Columbus Day weekend,
and the week before and after.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to panic, but for the best foliage viewing you
should do some planning. This is one of the most popular seasons to
hit the road, and that can mean lots of traffic, sold-out inns and
hotels, and waits at attractions and restaurants. So get out those
maps and pick a route or two. Best of all, choose a circular route
so you'll cover more territory and improve your chances of hitting
peak color somewhere along the way. Call ahead for accommodations.
The most popular foliage viewing routes will be crowded, so just
allow more time than usual and you'll have a great ride.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Benson, who has been named Leaf Lady by Maine's Governor
Angus King, is preparing her first report, to be released
Wednesday. It is a pattern other states will be following for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, the foliage season usually runs from the third week
in September through the second week in October, starting north and
moving south and starting at higher elevations and moving lower.
``There is almost always color somewhere in Vermont during that
period,'' says Brian Stone, chief of Forest Management in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Stone adds, ``Spring has been wet and cool, ideal conditions for
tree growth. Several sunny days in late June have brought the green
leaves to peak. Assuming the trend continues, the foliage should be
fully prepared to put on an outstanding show.'' However, Stone
points out that weather conditions from just prior to and until
leaf drop will be the most important factors in leaf color. Heavy
rainfall, high winds, and strong storms can affect the foliage.
Frost timing and cloudy days can also have an impact on the
strength of the colors.
</P>
<P>
   Maine Forest Service rangers also report ideal conditions in
Maine's 17 million acres of forestland. ``Adequate rainfall this
spring and summer is keeping the tree canopy healthy and fire
danger low,'' says Tom Doak, Maine state forester. ``If these
factors remain on course, we're looking at a great fall foliage
season.'' In addition, Clark Granger, a plant pathologist with the
Maine forest service, is seeing growth in the crowns of trees that
were damaged in the 1998 ice storm.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to color, ``New England is by far the leader. It's
the image people are looking for,'' says Scotty Johnson. He should
know: He's been following the changing of colors throughout the
country and Canada for some 41 years, making him the nation's only
``foliologist.'' He does this for Tauck World Discovery, a tour
company with a wide range of foliage trips.
</P>
<P>
   Twice weekly through foliage season, he issues reports on the
changing colors from the Ozarks east to New England and Canada
(yes, other areas do have foliage, maybe not as colorful as New
England, but still good) based on observations by Tauck tour
directors in the areas.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf peepers, though, want to know where to go and when. Stone
says most of Vermont's colors are provided by sugar and red maples.
Their reds, oranges, and yellows are always spectacular, and the
state is renowned for its foliage in part because of the landscape
setting in which it appears: mixed hardwood and softwood
interspersed with rustic farms and small villages, vistas of Lake
Champlain, or backdrops of the White, Green, and Adirondack
mountains. Even small amounts of color can create beautiful scenes
with these elements.
</P>
<P>
   The Leaf Lady salutes Maine for its mountains, lakes, oceanside,
and especially for Camden Hills State Park where the foliage views
from Mount Battie contrast with the blue of Penobscot Bay. ``It
doesn't get much better than that,'' she says, adding ``Where else
can you top off a day of foliage viewing with a lobster dinner by
the ocean?'' Another plus for Maine is its 17.5 million acres of
forests that hold some 50 species of trees, all of which knit a
beautiful mosaic of foliage color.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Connecticut. ``Connecticut's geography makes it
the perfect destination for lovers of fall foliage,'' says Don
Smith, Connecticut state forester. ``Just as northern New England's
fall foliage is winding down, Connecticut's colors are getting
ready for their big burst of color.'' He adds, ``Only a few regions
of the world have seasonal displays of color as spectacular as
Connecticut's.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth, though, is that no matter where you go in New England
you'll find some awe-inspiring scenes. New Hampshire's Kancamagus
Highway in the White Mountains is one of the most famous drives,
being one of the designated scenic byway loops in the country.
You'll travel some 33 miles through the White Mountain National
Forest, past waterfalls, mountain brooks, and hiking trails _ and
it's a great place to watch for moose. Another inspiring drive is
through the close-to-Boston Monadnock region with its classic New
England villages like Fitzwilliam and the most climbed mountain in
the nation, Mount Monadnock.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is famous for the Mohawk Trail, Route 2, from
Orange to Williamstown. While this is one of the busiest roads in
foliage season, it is also one of the easiest routes because it's a
straight shot from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Having driven for years from Orange to Boston, I can testify the
route is beautiful, even in the rain. It's also a road you don't
have to stick to; there is hidden beauty along many of the roads
that branch off it. And Bostonians don't even have to drive that
far. The Blue Hills, a 5,000-acre reservation just nine miles south
of the city, can be as colorful as any northern forest.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be heresy for a New Englander to say so, other
areas do have colorful autumns. There's now a greater awareness of
this than before. Johnson says when he started out in 1960 as a
bell captain at the Pines Hotel in Digby, Nova Scotia, the place
was all closed up by fall. Now Nova Scotia is promoting its fall
colors, and the hotel is open during foliage season.
</P>
<P>
   So if you can't make it to New England, check out Scotty's
forecast for other areas. Nova Scotia hits its peak in mid-October
because it is close to the Atlantic Ocean, which provides a
moderating influence on both temperature and color. Ontario,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado, and Wisconsin are other areas
inundating us with reasons to visit during their colorful season.

FORGET ABOUT LARRY KING; SEND IN OSCAR THE GROUCH

<P>
   (ITALICS)An emergency meeting of the Commission on Presidential
Debates is called to order ...(UNITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   Chairman: (banging gavel) Welcome. Let's recap where we are. Mr.
Bush has rejected a proposal to meet Mr. Gore for three prime-time
debates on all networks. Mr. Bush has suggested one prime-time
debate, plus joint appearances on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and
CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' And Mr. Gore has rejected that.
</P>
<P>
   So this morning, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Lieberman are here to try to
help us reach an agreement on where and when their running mates
will debate. Mr. Lieberman, I understand you have a proposal to
counter the counter-proposal?
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman: Al Gore _ the next president of the United States and
a man whom I am honored to call my friend! _ respectfully offers to
meet Mr. Bush anytime, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman: (clearing throat) I see. By ``anywhere,'' I take it
that you still do not mean ``Meet the Press'' or ``Larry King
Live''?
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman: No, sir, although we do have the utmost admiration
for Tim Russert and Larry King, as well as all other members of the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman: Uh-huh. Mr. Cheney?
</P>
<P>
   Cheney: George W. Bush _ the next president of the United States
and a man whom I am honored to call my friend! _ is of the opinion
that Mr. Russert is a major-league (bleep)hole.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman: I see. And that's your official position?
</P>
<P>
   Cheney: (nodding head) Yes, it is. Big time. And we're not so
very fond of Larry King, either.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman: (sighing) OK, let's see if we can't find some common
ground here.
</P>
<P>
   (ITALICS)Several hours pass.(UNITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   Cheney: George W. Bush, who believes it is time to put
plain-spoken Americans in the White House, will agree to one
prime-time debate, plus an appearance on World Wrestling
Federation's ``Smackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman: Al Gore vehemently objects to the gratuitous violence
of ``Smackdown.'' We also respectfully urge Mr. Bush to put up or
shut up!
</P>
<P>
   (ITALICS)Several more hours pass.(UNITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   Chairman: All right, then. We now have an agreement on one
prime-time network debate, which is pretty much where we began this
morning. Mr. Cheney, I think you're next.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney: George W. Bush, who believes it is time to elect people
who say what they mean, will meet Mr. Gore's bid of one prime-time
network debate and raise him one cameo on ``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman: Of course, we believe very strongly in the role of
faith in public life. We'll meet your angel and raise you one PBS
forum, moderated by Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman: Mr. Cheney?
</P>
<P>
   Cheney: George W. Bush, who also believes strongly in the role
of faith in public life, is of the opinion that Barney is a
major-league (bleep)hole. And Baby Bop's voice grates on our
nerves. Big time.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman: (sighing) OK, so that's no to PBS and Barney and no to
the WWF and Smackdown, but yes to ``Touched.'' Anything else, Mr.
Cheney?
</P>
<P>

&HT;     CONSUMERS ARE GREEN WITH ENVY OVER NEW TOYOTA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The world's first _ and so far most practical _
hybrid gasoline/electric vehicle has arrived at Toyota dealerships,
but don't count on taking one home anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Although dealerships across the nation have at least one of the
new Toyota Prius sedans each, they are for demonstration purposes
only, and would-be consumers must get on a waiting list to buy one,
dealers and Toyota officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got about 20 people who have put deposits down, and
we're looking at probably October before we deliver the first
one,'' said Roger Johnston, sales manager at Cavender Toyota in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   There is a huge amount of consumer interest, though, for this
all-new car that gets 52 miles per gallon in the city and 45 mpg on
the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cars with traditional gasoline engines, the Prius gets
better fuel economy in town because at speeds less than 30 mph, it
operates almost exclusively on its 44-horsepower electric motor. At
speeds above that, or when it needs to recharge its batteries, the
70-horsepower, 1.5-liter gasoline engine kicks in automatically.
</P>
<P>
   At highway speeds, the gasoline engine is used for cruising, but
for passing or whenever an extra burst of power is needed, the
electric motor kicks in along with the gas one. And it is at that
point that the driver realizes that the greenest sedan on the
market makes no excuses, and there are no tradeoffs: This car has
as much zip as any other compact sedan on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really are no compromises when you buy a Prius,''
Johnston said. ``It seats five people, has plenty of power and
costs no more than many other cars in this size class. When people
come by to test-drive our Prius, the acceleration and the roominess
really surprise them.''
</P>
<P>
   The price is $20,000, the same that Honda charges for its
two-seat Insight hybrid that made its U.S. debut in February. But
unlike the Insight, the Prius has room enough for a whole family;
it even has a trunk that, despite carrying the car's
nickel-metal-hydride battery pack, has plenty of room for luggage.
</P>
<P>
   And there are no options; everything comes with the vehicle at
the base price, including automatic air-conditioning,
AM/FM/cassette stereo, power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote
control, antilock brakes and an eight-year/100,000-mile warranty on
the battery pack and hybrid drive system.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing about the Prius is that even though it
has an electric motor, it never needs to be connected to an
external power source for recharging like traditional electric cars
do.
</P>
<P>
   The battery pack is recharged by the onboard gasoline engine
that runs both the drive wheels and a built-in generator. But there
is a second way the batteries are recharged: whenever the brakes
are applied, or the car is coasting, the drive wheels automatically
turn the electric motor, which goes into a reverse mode and becomes
a generator of electricity, rather than a consumer of it.
</P>
<P>
   That harnesses otherwise unused power, much the way that a
hydroelectric generating plant uses falling water to make
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Having an electric motor without having to use an external
recharger is what makes the Prius palatable to consumers. Electric
cars have never caught on with manufacturers or consumers because
of their limited range between charges.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Prius, air pollution is minimized in city driving _
where exhaust fumes are the worst _ because it reverts to
nonpolluting electric power in stop-and-go traffic. The Honda
hybrid doesn't do that _ it uses its gasoline engine all the time,
with the electric motor on hand for power boosting only.
</P>
<P>
   Styling is quite nice, too _ very similar to that of the Toyota
Echo and Ford Focus sedans.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius, which looks like a subcompact on the outside, has
more than 100 cubic feet of interior space and is almost as roomy
as the nation's best-selling car, the midsize Toyota Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota began selling the Prius in Japan in December 1997, and
has delivered more than 35,000 of them in that country so far.
</P>
<P>
   The car just went on sale this summer in the United States,
although the first deliveries aren't due until later this year.
There are a few leased vehicles out with consumers already,
however, in a special program that Toyota promoted on the Prius Web
site at www.toyota.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest in these cars is unbelievable,'' Toyota spokesman
Clyde Hopkins said from Dallas. ``Demand has far outstripped
supply, and we're looking at about a three-month wait from order to
delivery right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Prius was designed for the roads there, and has a
58 horsepower, 1.0-liter engine. For the U.S. market, where highway
traffic runs at higher speeds, Toyota increased the power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Prius was introduced in Japan, consumer response has
been phenomenal,'' said Steve Sturm, Toyota's U.S. vice president
for marketing. ``We hope to generate this same level of interest
and excitement in America. Our goal is to sell or lease an initial
volume of 1,000 a month. We anticipate that the highest sales
volumes will primarily be in congested urban areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The smoothness of the hybrid drive system is a big selling
point, Johnston said. ``It's very quiet, and the shift between
electric and gasoline power is automatic and not even noticeable.
The biggest thing to get used to is not hearing the engine when you
start up.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ignition key was turned to ``Start,'' a video screen on
the dash showed ``Ready,'' but there usually was no noise of an
engine starting because the gasoline engine doesn't come on right
away.
</P>
<P>
   Driving away from a parking space or a traffic signal, the
vehicle felt like an electric golf cart, although much more
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions were when the gasoline engine was needed right away
because battery power was low, or the air-conditioner was running
full blast.
</P>
<P>
   Air-conditioning can pull the battery charge down very fast, so
the car automatically starts the gasoline engine to get the
electric generator operating.
</P>
<P>
   Americans who buy the Prius may qualify for a tax deduction of
up to $2,000 for purchasing a ``qualified clean-fuel vehicle,''
Toyota says.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance will be minimal, Toyota says. The all-aluminum
gasoline engine is limited to a maximum of 4,500 rpm, which will
give it a super long life (most engines reach the so-called red
line at 6,000-7,000 rpm).
</P>
<P>
   The electric motor is a permanent-magnet type with internal
components that do not wear out. It creates a whopping 258
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   The body and interior of the Prius were styled at Toyota's Calty
Design Research studio in Southern California, and combine short
front and rear overhangs with a large, upright, and tall cabin for
exceptional roominess. It even accommodates very tall people
because of the high roof.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, the nation's oldest and largest environmental
organization, has honored the Prius with its ``excellence in
environmental engineering'' award for 2000, the first year that the
group has given out the award recognizing new products that make a
substantial contribution to improving the environment.

WHEN PLASTIC SURGEONS SHOULD JUST SAY `NO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who watched singer Michael Jackson's nose change from
dark-skinned and normal-sized to pale and pointy _ not to say
otherworldly _ may have pondered the question:
</P>
<P>
   When should a plastic surgeon say no to a client?
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons themselves argue about it all the time. A favorite
subject for debate is New York socialite Jocelyne Wildenstein, who
has posed proudly for magazine spreads to show off the look she
achieved through multiple surgeries, a look that critics have
described as somewhere between cat and Klingon.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Americans turn to tummy tucks, chemical peels and other
cosmetic surgeries in record numbers, the debate has become much
more than a parlor game. Now, as 230,000 people a year undergo
liposuction alone, the courts may soon weigh in on when enough is
enough.
</P>
<P>
   This summer a New York judge ruled that a 53-year-old New York
woman, identified in court papers only as Mrs. Lynn G., could sue
her surgeon, contending he should have known she had a psychiatric
condition that gave her a distorted image of her own body. As a
result, she claims, she was incapable of giving informed consent to
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   By her own count, Lynn G. has had liposuction on her chin,
stomach, knees and thighs; several eyelid lifts; eyebrow tattoos,
injections of fat to remove wrinkles; a tummy tuck; a nose job; and
other surgeries over 29 years. For the last seven, the man behind
the scalpel was Norman Hugo, a former chief of plastic surgery at
Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City and past president
of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, whom she sued over
scarring from the procedures.
</P>
<P>
   While most surgeons scoffed at the lawsuit, it got their
attention _ especially after it ran in The New York Observer, which
chronicles the antics of wealthy Manhattanites. It spurred much
wringing of hands over whether plastic surgeons would someday be
forced to get a psychiatrist's clearance for every patient.
</P>
<P>
   But some called it a much-needed wakeup call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused physicians to take a second look,'' said Dr. Paula
Moynahan, who practices on Fifth Avenue and in Waterbury, Conn. She
went so far as to fire off a press release calling on her
colleagues to be more scrupulous about turning clients away if they
ask for surgery that seems wrong for them or if they seem to want
it for the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some doctors believe that up to 25 percent of the
patients who come to them requesting plastic surgery should be
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Gorney, a Napa, California, plastic surgeon who has
recently become medical director for a medical malpractice insurer,
said he rejected ``one in five, maybe one in four'' of the would-be
patients who came for consultations at his practice. Moynahan said
she
</P>
<P>
   turns away 15 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gorney refused to talk about Lynn G.'s doctor, Hugo, whom he
called a good friend, but he said that certain patients should
prompt ``an automatic refusal.''
</P>
<P>
   For example?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he said, ``if she looks like she's taking three G's while
sitting still'' because her skin is pulled back so tightly from
multiple facelifts. Or if her earlobes are pulled low from having
loose jowl skin sutured to them one too many times. Or if she has
``that stare-y look, the look of eternal surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Another red flag, he said, is sheer quantity of previous
surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's had a rhinoplasty (nose job), a face lift, Botox,
lipo, a boob job _ forget it. This patient is a plastoholic!''
</P>
<P>
   That's an overreaction, said Dr. Daniel C. Morello, president of
the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, another
professional group. Plastic surgery thrives on ``repeat business,''
he said, and it's impossible to make a blanket statement about how
much is too much.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who claims to turn away one in five patients, he said, is
exaggerating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking maybe 10 patients a year'' who should be
rejected for plastic surgery, he said. ``You have to be very alert
to pick out those 10. Do we miss one sometimes? Yes, we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Morello, who practices in New York's Westchester County, and
uses the online handle ``nipntuck,'' declined to comment on
Moynahan's press release chiding plastic surgeons. However, he
remarked, ``Anyone who puts out a press release is probably looking
for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morello said, concerns about unnecessary surgery or
inappropriate surgery are very real, and recent events have
prompted a talk on the matter to be scheduled for the society's
annual conference in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of drawing the line on excessive plastic surgery is
exacerbated by two trends:
</P>
<P>
   The patient-empowerment movement, which includes both bonafide
education of the public about their choices and increasing
advertisement for cosmetic procedures, has spawned a population of
cosmetic surgery consumers with increasingly specific _ and
sometimes odd _ demands.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost-cutting and paperwork of managed care may have
spawned a population of doctors willing to comply with any demand
as long as the customer pays in cash. Cosmetic surgery, with its
up-front payments, soaring popularity and no insurance-company
involvement, is increasingly attractive to frustrated doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result, the number of cosmetic procedures have
skyrocketed over the last decade. Breast augmentation operations
alone have increased by 413 percent since 1992, according to the
American Society of Plastic Surgeons, while liposution is up 389
percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgeons' also worry that dermatologists and others they
view as less qualified are crowding onto their lucrative turf: In a
recent advertising campaign, they urged consumers to choose
board-certified plastic surgeons only. But they also worry that
their field may draw surgeons with questionable ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plastic surgery has now become the last refuge of the
freebooter or the pirate,'' said Gorney, the California plastic
surgeon who is now medical director of The Doctors Company.
</P>
<P>
   But a more subtle problem is that the very idea of cosmetic
surgery makes it difficult for doctors to deny their patients'
wishes. In fact, many patients are surprised to learn that surgeons
can turn them away.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic surgery markets itself in the language of
self-actualization: A woman who enlarges her breasts or
liposuctions her thighs isn't pandering to society's notions of
beauty; she's taking charge, getting what she wants and enhancing
her self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   After tallying up data that showed 26 percent more women had
liposuction, breast augmentation and eyelid lifts in 1998 than in
1999, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons issued this upbeat
message:
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking as good as you feel is a continuing trend among
women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We enhance people's self esteem by changing their body
image,'' explained Moynahan, who also has a skin care spa and
salon.
</P>
<P>
   However, Moynahan, Morello and Gorney all said that many
patients come in with life problems that surgery can't change.
Those are the ones to watch out for: the woman who wants larger
breasts because her husband is cheating on her. Or someone who
seems unable to realistically assess how they look and may be
suffering from a condition called body dysmorphic disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Moynahan said she referred one would-be client to an ocular
plastic surgeon for reconstructive surgery because she'd had too
many eyelid lifts. The woman refused and wanted still more cosmetic
surgery, telling Moynahan, ``I have maintentnace and fine tuning
done every couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   But where to draw the line, when the profession constantly touts
statistics about how better-looking people get better jobs, higher
salaries and more personal happiness?
</P>
<P>
   Gorney said an example of surgery for the right reasons is a
woman who meets a nice man, but is embarrassed to get intimate
because of her small breasts. But others might suggest different
solutions, like psychological counseling, or, say, a heart-to-heart
talk with her would-be lover.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors cited problems with patients who want to look like
a celebrity. Dr. William Adams said young men have come to his
Boston office asking to look like Ringo Starr, Lee Majors and even
Cher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do an operation that I don't feel aesthetically
comfortable with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons' code of ethics
forbids surgery ``that is not calculated to improve or benefit the
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, though, it's still a matter of taste. The woman
dubbed ``the Bride of Wildenstein'' by the New York Post says she
is pleased with the surgery that has made her nearly
unrecognizable. Her doctor, Richard Coburn, does not do interviews,
but his peers are reluctant to condemn him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's happy, and Dr. Coburn is happy, then mazel tov,''
Moynahan said. ``I don't think she has a good result.''

EVIDENCE MOUNTS THAT LIFE MAY HAVE BEGUN IN A SCALDING SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For humans, it's about as hellish an environment as the
imagination could ever conjure: Bone-crushing pressure, water hot
enough to melt a lead pipe, and fire (red-hot molten rock) and
brimstone (the ancient name for sulfur) spewing up constantly from
below.
</P>
<P>
   But these violent and unearthly places, known as hydrothermal
vents, may have a surprisingly nurturing side: New evidence,
including a recent report in the journal Science, is lending
support to a controversial theory that these vents at the bottom of
the world's oceans may have been the cradle in which life began.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems more likely than ever that the spark of life was
first lit in the vicinity of such an inferno in the ocean's abyss
around 3.5 billion years ago, and it was from there that the first
cells began their long evolutionary trek toward the phenomenal
variety of living creatures we see today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions are just right for the formation of organic
compounds, for (heat-loving) microorganisms to develop, and for a
food-chain web to emerge.'' said Everett Shock, a planetary
scientist at Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   That's a dramatic shift from the original idea of life's
beginning espoused by Charles Darwin in 1871 _ and long supported
by the majority of scientists studying life's origins. Darwin
argued that the likeliest place for the beginning of life was in
some ``warm little pond,'' at the boundary between land and ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when oceanographer John B. Corliss first proposed the
thermal vents idea two decades ago, the idea was considered so
outlandish that he couldn't even get his papers published in the
scientific journals. But, he said last week, ``I have always known
that it was just a matter of time until the evidence would be as
overwhelming to others as it was to me 15 or 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the warm little pond seems a more credible place
for the incubator of life than a place with conditions so extreme
that it would instantly parboil the life out of the vast majority
of the world's living things. But the story is more complicated
than that description suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long been puzzled by the earliest stages of
life's evolution, in which raw chemicals served up by the cooling,
newly-formed Earth somehow combined and contorted to become the
exquisitely complex collection of molecules and membranes that made
up the first living cells. The probabilities involved, some have
said, seem as unlikely as throwing a bunch of metal fragments into
the air and having them assemble themselves into a 747 jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments in the laboratory have shown that some of the basic
chemical building blocks of life could, in fact, be created under
the conditions that might have existed in a warm little pond in the
planet's earliest days. But it is still a long way from those
building blocks to the complexity of even the simplest amoeba.
</P>
<P>
   Even if some of the basic chemicals of life could form in such a
pond, said George Cody of the Carnegie Institution in Washington,
lead author of the recent Science paper, ``it seems like you would
have just this dead soup. How would you get it going, how would you
prime it'' to produce living, evolving organisms?
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, at the seemingly hostile hydrothermal vents, it
turned out, the conditions might be much more favorable for the
creation of life's complexity. Such vents are actually very
energetic chemical reactors, as Corliss first deduced. Some of
these reactions would take place in the superheated water coming
from the vents, he figured, but most would take place in the cooler
water seeping out nearby, already partly cooled by contact with
seawater.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, several others, including Washington University's
Shock, biochemist Harold Morowitz of George Mason University and
German scientist Gunter Wachtershauser, have published numerous
papers describing the life-giving potential of the vents in
ever-greater detail.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to blame Darwin for overlooking
hydrothermal vents. They weren't even discovered until a 1977
expedition to the seafloor off the Galapagos islands, led by
Corliss and using the Alvin submersible from the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution. Corliss had deduced the existence of
these sea floor vents from indirect evidence.
</P>
<P>
   At some hydrothermal vents seawater that seeped down into the
seafloor and came into contact with red-hot molten rock comes
spewing back out, heated to temperatures as high as 660 degrees
Fahrenheit and loaded with dissolved minerals that precipitate out
immediately on contact with the cold surrounding water, producing
the visible plumes called ``black smokers''. At the Galapagos vent
that was first discovered, though, the water was cooled below the
surface and came out at a modest 68 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   But what was completely unexpected was the rich variety of life
that surrounded and was sustained by the vents. This life, it
turned out, was sustained by the energy contained in chemical
compounds in the rich, hot water. It was the first time any form of
life had been discovered that was not ultimately supported by the
energy of sunlight. Because such environments are likely to be
found on many other planets, some scientists think the discovery
instantly raised the odds that life could have emerged on other
worlds as well.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the astonishing discovery of a whole ecosystem of
living things _ including strange varieties of crabs and clams and
exotic blood-red tube worms _ Corliss began thinking about the
possibility that this environment could have been the site of
life's origin. His first public talk about the new theory was given
in 1981, but the idea remained far outside the scientific
mainstream for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``People laughed at Corliss when he first mentioned it,'' said
Morowitz, a biochemist at George Mason University in Virginia.
``I'm the first to have taken him seriously . . . Now it's coming
into the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   In those early years, Corliss struggled even to get his
unorthodox suggestion into print; a major paper detailing the
concept was rejected by the the editor of the journal Nature in
1988, apparently without even the normal formality of a peer
review. But soon after that, papers by other authors began to take
up the theory and carry it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Morowitz advanced the idea by making detailed calculations about
the chemical chain of events needed to make life possible. That
work, and Morowitz's realization of the crucial role that may have
been played by organic chemical reactions taking place at high
temperatures and pressures, led to the laboratory research at
Carnegie Institution by Cody and a team of researchers, detailed in
the recent Science paper.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry of such reactions under conditions present in
hydrothermal vents turns out to be an area that has been little
studied, partly because it requires unusually difficult and
expensive laboratory procedures and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But in the experiment at Carnegie, an important fact emerged:
every key chemical reaction upon which the basic biochemistry of
life depends can indeed be produced in the conditions of the
deep-sea vents. The last such reaction that had not been
demonstrated under these conditions, the synthesis of an iron
compound called pyruvate that is crucial to many biological
reactions, was demonstrated in their experiment.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't prove that life began in the vents, but it
certainly helps to show that it is possible. By contrast, very few
of these crucial chemical products are known to be produced under
the relatively benign conditions of the ocean surface or of
Darwin's warm little pond.
</P>
<P>
   As Morowitz describes it, the competing theories were based on
where the energy came from to spark life on Earth: Did it come from
the heat and light coming down from the sun _ from the heavens _ or
from chemical energy percolating up from the hot depths of the
Earth _ from hell? ``Everyone heavily favored the `heaven'
concept'' at first, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But German scientist Wachtershauser started to turn the
intellectual tide with a series of papers in the 1980s describing
the biochemical steps that could have led to the origins of life
under hydrothermal vent conditions. Others have argued that the
asteroids that pummeled the Earth during its first few hundred
million years would have made the depths a much safer place for
life to arise.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the biggest reasons for the turnaround in thinking
came from the work of Carl Woese, a University of Illinois
microbiologist who has analyzed in detail the family tree of life,
using the latest techniques of genetic analysis. His work has shown
convincingly that microorganisms that are adapted to extreme high
temperatures, called hyperthermophiles, are the most ancient forms
of life on this planet, and thus likely to resemble the earliest
ancestors of all life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first step in turning around this fairly dogmatic
attitude that life began at `room temperature','' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lovley, chairman of the microbiology department at the
University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produced yet another line of
evidence in support of the idea. He has published results of
laboratory experiments showing that microbes found deep underground
today all seem to use a chemical process involving iron to
metabolize their food, as would be expected under the deep-ocean
origins theory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lovley said, the idea that started out as heresy 20 years
ago has become ``very well accepted. . . You'll see it in the
textbooks now.''

IMMIGRANTS SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iowa hopes to bolster its declining workforce by enticing
immigrants to the land of tall corn and nervous pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily an agricultural state, Iowa is 96 percent white and
the average farmer is 58 years old. Iowa ranks third in the nation
in the percentage of seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Iowa retains every single one of its graduating high-school
students between now and 2005, we'll have a decrease of 3 percent
of the available work force,'' said Indianola mayor Jerry Kelley,
one of many civic leaders who favors immigrant recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Iowa is an unusual one for immigrants, who are
more used to being shunned by communities than welcomed. It also
raises the possibility that other states suffering from declining
population will seek them out, creating a competition for their
services.
</P>
<P>
   As immigrants find themselves more in demand, they will have to
be more discriminating, if that is the word, as to where they
settle down. While Iowa may seem like a nice place to live, with
its green fields of corn and white farmhouses, a closer inspection
of the state may make one think twice about relocating there.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Iowa is the No. 1 beef and pork producing state in
America, which puts it at the top of the hit list for PETA and
other organizations that believe the human diet should consist
entirely of organically grown celery. It is hard to enjoy a
medium-rare cheeseburger while some animal-rights nut is whacking
you over the head with a placard.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is also the No. 1 producer of corn, the No. 1 producer of
soybeans, the No. 1 producer of grain and the home of Quaker Oats,
the world's largest cereal company. Clearly, Iowa is overly fixated
on this ``No. 1'' thing and most likely has some issues related to
sharing that can only be worked out over years of counseling, most
likely at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is the birthplace of Grant Wood, the artist responsible for
``American Gothic.'' Look at the painting and ask yourself: Are
those the kind of people I want as neighbors? And what's the deal
with the pitchfork?
</P>
<P>
   According to Ripley's Believe It Or Not, Burlington's Snake
Alley is the most crooked street in America. This is not something
Burlington or any other city should be proud of. If they had any
sense, they'd dig it up, straighten it out and maybe line it with a
couple of Wal-Marts or maybe a Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   John Wayne was born in Winterset. Only his name wasn't John
Wayne, it was Marion Robert Morrison. Any state where they name
their male children ``Marion'' is a state that I would have to
think twice about moving to.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of celebrities, guess who owned a farm in Eldon, Iowa,
before their marriage broke up? Tom and Roseanne Arnold. I'll take
the ``American Gothic'' couple as neighbors, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   Winnebagos are made in Winnebago County, Iowa. I don't bring
this up for any special reason; I just thought it might be
something you'd like to know.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is the only state name that begins with two vowels. This is
a pathetic observation and is just another example of how the
people of Iowa have way too much time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the movie ``Field of Dreams'' was filmed in Dyersville.
It was a corny movie (literally), but it did have a good line that
immigrants may want to consider before relocating:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's Iowa.''

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The wealth generated by technology company
stocks has a direct connection to rising home prices here, the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said.
</P>
<P>
   While this is not exactly news to real estate agents and many
home buyers in the region, ``it has given us confirmation of what
we were hearing,'' said John Krainer, an economist at the Fed and
author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a factor in real estate for more than a year
now,'' said Alain Pinel, regional vice president for Coldwell
Banker Residential Real Estate. ``Venture capital for these new
high-tech companies is generating the money through stock options,
up-front bonuses used to hire employees and IPOs.'' IPOs are
initial public offerings of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Pinel said housing prices jumped 40 to 45 percent in the past
year in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. San Francisco and
neighboring areas boast some of the nation's highest real estate
prices.

PROTESTS HINDER MELBOURNE MEETINGS ON GLOBAL ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ It was supposed to be a stimulating group
chat about the global economy, held here a few days before the
opening of the Olympics to allow the corporate executives, central
bankers and other notables to hop over to Sydney for some
world-class sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   But in a scene reminiscent of the violent protests at the World
Trade Organization summit meeting in Seattle last November,
thousands of protesters have tried to sabotage the meeting here of
the World Economic Forum, clashing with riot police and blocking
the site of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting has gone ahead more or less as planned, though on
Monday, about a quarter of the 900 delegates could not get into the
hotel where it was being held because the demonstrators had formed
a human chain across every entrance. On Tuesday morning, riot
police, some on horses, swung truncheons at the protesters to clear
a path for buses carrying the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the protests _ a polyglot group of
environmentalists and anti-free-trade activists _ said that 50
people had been injured in the melee and that 11 were hospitalized.
After seeming daunted by the crowd on Monday, the police on Tuesday
used markedly stronger measures to disperse people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have had over the past few days is not peaceful
protest but something verging on riot, where we have had ball
bearings, marbles, screws, glass and urine thrown at police
officers,'' said Andre Haermeyer, the police minister of the
Victoria state government.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's prime minister, John Howard, condemned the protests
as ``hooliganism.'' Howard was forced to arrive at the Crown Hotel
and Casino by boat because the police could not clear a path for
his motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   For the Australian government, the protests in Melbourne have
been an ugly scene-setter for the Olympics, which start on Friday,
competing for the attention of the international news media with
the torch relay and other festive preparations in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said they would rally at the games as well,
though it was difficult to imagine how an Olympic athlete could
provoke as much outrage as a software billionaire like Bill Gates.
Gates was the big name among speakers at this Asia-Pacific meeting
of the World Economic Forum, a private foundation whose last
meeting, in Davos, Switzerland, was also disrupted by protests.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As in Seattle and Davos, the protests eventually drew a response
from the conference participants. Asked during a panel discussion
what he thought about the protests, Gates said, ``World trade, if
you block it, the big losers will be the poor people of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Loh, a pro-democracy leader from Hong Kong who was
turned back by the barricades, said: ``I think it inconvenienced a
lot of people, which is what the protesters wanted to do. They've
managed to make people more aware of the issues. I think it has
been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Other participants said the protesters were ignorant of the
benefits of global free trade.
</P>
<P>
   One protester, John Gwynne, said, ``There's nothing wrong with
free trade as long as there is a fairer distribution of
resources.'' Gwynne, 27, who grows organic vegetables, said the
wealthy countries should forgive the debts of Third World nations.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Grodecki, 19, an environmental science student from
Brisbane, said the goal of the protests was not to shut down the
meeting, but to discourage future ones. ``We have been successful
because these meetings are becoming too expensive, from a security
point of view,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the delegates filed into buses at the end of the session
Tuesday, the cost of the blockade became more evident. Riot police
again cleared a path for the motorcade, which inched on to the
street under a shower of epithets and plastic bottles. A police
helicopter with a searchlight hovered overhead. Afterward,
ambulances lined up to treat a handful of injured demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Gates was forced to cancel two events _ both demonstrations of a
new Microsoft product _ when the police warned him not to cross the
street to a nearby office building.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Greetings from Australia, where pubs are
``hotels,'' enthusiastic drinkers are ``tossers,'' the home team's
basketball men are ``boomers'' and its field hockey women are
``hockeyroos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Land Down Under is awash in euphemisms, quaint expressions
and messages that are downright inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please remove boot and bonnet'' exhorted one sign in the
Homebush Bay section of Sydney, where many of the Olympic venues
are located.
</P>
<P>
   Take off your shoes and hat? In America, no shoes, no shirt
means no service.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pyrmont Bridge Hotel, which is to say a pub, a sign
informed patrons ``Whilst the hotel is open 24 hours, alcohol is
not served between 7 and 9 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Go home, sleep it off and come back, it seems to be suggesting.

   For those not cut out to be parents, a photo studio downtown
might be the solution. It offered ``Kids shot here _ $25.'' That's
about U.S. $14. Heck of a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hotels full of tossers, Australia has a major
jones for gambling. City streets are chock full of ``pokie
parlors,'' the term for slot machines. Off-track betting on horse
racing is also prevalent. But in New South Wales, where Sydney is
located, gambling on the Olympic Games is not permitted. Just in
case you were thinking about putting down a few quid on the modern
pentathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of gambling, I went for a little gambol upon arriving in
Sydney, through Oxford Street. Victoria Bitter is the early leader
in the clubhouse for best draft beer in Oz.
</P>
<P>
   The adult bookstores on Oxford, of which there are many, are
either located upstairs or downstairs, never street level. There's
symbolism there, I'm sure.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers buzzing around town in clean little white sedans
all appear to be wearing their seat belts. Cab drivers do not,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Darling Harbour, indeed a darling harbor, is a gathering place
for visitors and locals alike as they stroll the waterside
promenade.
</P>
<P>
   While I was draining a Victoria Bitter, or VB for brevity's
sake, two sheilas (Australia's enduring term for young women)
joined me at my table and reported that Friday's rehearsal for the
Opening Ceremonies had not gone well.
</P>
<P>
   The word they used rhymed with spit. I'm sure there's a
euphemism for that, too. I'll find it. It's early.

&HT;     TEACHER PAY HIKES FORCE SCHOOLS TO CUT BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco's public school system is
considering cutting its budget by $23 million over the next two
years to pay for higher teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education proposal calls for cutting its
administrative staff, deferring maintenance of buildings and
reducing overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of money, but it's for the right reasons and it
moves us in the direction of spending money efficiently,''
Superintendent Arlene Ackerman said Monday. ``These are hard
decisions. But we have made a statement that it's important to pay
our teachers and staff competitive salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   In late August, the San Francisco Unified School District
announced raises of 5 percent to 20 percent for nearly 6,000
teachers and classroom aides. The salary increases will cost the
district $39.5 million this year and $44 million the next school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the district will receive more money this school year
from the state, deep cuts are necessary to make up for the salary
increases, Ackerman said. The administration wants to reduce
spending by $9 million this year and $14 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Unified, with 65,000 students, is California's
fifth-largest district. Audits have criticized the school district
for poor accounting records, a lack of oversight and personnel
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman, who quit as superintendent in Washington, D.C., to
take over the San Francisco system this summer, has reshuffled the
administration here, removing the district's chief financial and
reassigning 25 teachers and principals who worked in the
administrative office to schools.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore is not ingratiating
himself to the nation's pharmaceutical companies with his repeated
attacks against the industry and complaints about the high cost of
prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
   But long before Gore escalated his campaign rhetoric against the
pharmaceutical industry, the big drug makers had cast their lot
financially with Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush and
the members of his party in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry has heavily favored Republicans
since 1994, according to a new study by the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonpartisan public interest group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans really have adopted the pharmaceutical
industry's line and they are receiving a lot of money because of
that,'' said Holly Bailey of the center. ``They don't want to
hinder the industry's business practices, and that's a tune the
industry likes.''
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that of the more than $10 million individuals
and political action committees associated with the industry have
contributed for this year's elections, the Republicans received
nearly $3 for every $1 that went to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The clear shift to the GOP, according to the center, began with
President Clinton's 1994 push for universal health care. It raised
the specter of prescription drug price controls _ an anathema to
the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance was enhanced by the Republican takeover of Congress
in November that year, and has been magnified during the current
election campaign. This is due in large part to the Democratic plan
to offer seniors a Medicare prescription drug benefit. The industry
fears the plan, which Gore embraced, will restrict prices they can
charge consumers, reduce their profits and stifle research on new
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, seeking to compete with Gore on the politically popular
issue, last week proposed his own prescription drug benefit. But
the Bush plan, like one introduced earlier by House Republicans,
would offer the drug benefit through private sector insurance
policies _ an approach the pharmaceutical industry prefers to the
Democratic plan that would have the government run the program.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 presidential race, the study said that so far Bush
has received $237,765 from individuals and political action
committees associated with the pharmaceutical industry compared
with just $52,850 for Gore. These donations came mostly during the
primary season _ a time when the industry also gave $93,880 to
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley during his challenge for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   These sums to the presidential candidates, however, pale in
comparison with the $10.2 million in total political contributions
the industry has given through June for the 2000 election,
including the money to individual House and Senate candidates and
to the political party committees. The figures are the latest
available. The next finance reports are not due until the end of
this month, but they are not expected to show any change in the
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The center's study shows that 74 percent of the total, or $7.53
million went to Republicans, while just 26 percent or $2,66
million, was contributed to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the industry gave $4.8 million in contributions at the
federal level, spreading it almost equally with 52 percent going to
the GOP and 48 percent to the Democrats. By 1994, the companies
were giving 60 percent of their contributions to the GOP and 40
percent to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the contribution disparities
underscore that the approach Gore and the Democrats have taken
regarding a prescription drug benefit ``represents the interests of
America's families, while Bush represents the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan said various groups contribute to
candidates for their own reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush makes his decision on what he thinks is best for
America, not on campaign finance support,'' said Sullivan. ``He has
put forth a realistic plan to get prescription drugs into the hands
of senior citizens who need them. The Gore campaign does a good job
of demonizing sectors of the economy and trying to scare people.''
</P>
<P>
   Political contributions fall into two major categories _ those
given to the candidates and those given to the parties. Individuals
are allowed to give $1,000 to a candidate for each election while a
political action committee can give up to $5,000. Corporations and
unions cannot give money directly to a candidate. There are no
limits, however, on the amount an individual, union or corporation
can give to a political party or one of its campaign committees.
Those unlimited contributions are called soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The largest pharmaceutical contributor so far in the 2000
election is Pfizer Inc., the New York company that recently
purchased Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has donated $1.3 million through June 30, including
$931,000 in unregulated soft money contributions to political party
committees. The center's report said that of the soft money
donations, 83 percent _ $771,821 _ went to GOP groups like the
Republican National Committee while $160,000 _ 17 percent _ was
given to the Democratic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer spokesman Andy McCormick explained that his company
``makes contributions to groups who are responsive to us as a
pharmaceutical company and to fostering a favorable business
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Denise Foy, a spokeswoman for Schering-Plough Corp., said the
same is true of her company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schering-Plough Corp. supports candidates who support a free
market system and who best support Schering-Plough's point of view
on the issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals and a political action committee connected to
Schering-Plough have donated $691,114 to candidates and political
party committees for the 2000 election. The study said $408,500 of
that total came in the form of soft money donations to the party
committees, with 76 percent going to the Republicans and 24 percent
to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products has given $287,805 during the current
campaign. That total includes $189,575 in contributions to the
political party committees, with 73 percent of that going to
Republicans and 27 percent to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the disparity, Lowell Weiner, a company spokesman,
said, ``American Home Products, as always, has tried to be
bipartisan. We support the two-party system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, of course, have been supportive of the
pharmaceutical industry and have been beneficiaries of their
largesse, including Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate for re-election to the Senate this year,
Lieberman had collected $68,450 from individuals and political
action committees connected to the drug industry. This was the
highest total of any Democratic member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Gore campaign rhetoric that has lashed out at big
oil, HMOs, insurers and pharmaceutical companies, Lieberman has
often backed the agenda of many of these business interests,
including the drug makers. He has frequently described himself as
``pro-business, pro-trade and pro-economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said Lieberman is fully supportive of
the Medicare prescription drug benefit plan outlined by the
Democratic nominee that is so vehemently opposed by the
pharmaceutical industry. He also said ``the positions of the
Gore-Lieberman ticket are the views that Gore has articulated.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The second leading Democratic recipient of money from the drug
companies during this election cycle is Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., who has received $55,800, and as chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee has collected thousands of dollars
more for his party.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, who is not up for re-election, has been an unabashed
supporter of the drug industry, a major employer in New Jersey. He
is the sponsor of a bill on behalf of Schering-Plough aimed at
extending the patent life of Claritin, the company's most
profitable drug.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the prescription drug benefit for the elderly and
the issue of price controls, pharmaceutical companies have in
recent years focused on legislation to extend patents for their
products, lobbied for tax breaks for research and development and
sought limitations on federal regulation of their business.

   ``The Republicans really have adopted the pharmaceutical
industry's line and they are receiving a lot of money because of
that,'' said Holly Bailey of the center. ``They don't want to
hinder the industry's business practices, and that's a tune the
industry likes.''
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that of the more than $10 million individuals
and political action committees associated with the industry have
contributed for this year's elections, the Republicans received
nearly $3 for every $1 that went to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The clear shift to the GOP, according to the center, began with
President Clinton's 1994 push for universal health care. It raised
the specter of prescription drug price controls _ an anathema to
the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance was enhanced by the Republican takeover of Congress
in November that year, and has been magnified during the current
election campaign. This is due in large part to the Democratic plan
to offer seniors a Medicare prescription drug benefit. The industry
fears the plan, which Gore embraced, will restrict prices they can
charge consumers, reduce their profits and stifle research on new
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, seeking to compete with Gore on the politically popular
issue, last week proposed his own prescription drug benefit. But
the Bush plan, like one introduced earlier by House Republicans,
would offer the drug benefit through private sector insurance
policies _ an approach the pharmaceutical industry prefers to the
Democratic plan that would have the government run the program.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 presidential race, the study said that so far Bush
has received $237,765 from individuals and political action
committees associated with the pharmaceutical industry compared
with just $52,850 for Gore. These donations came mostly during the
primary season _ a time when the industry also gave $93,880 to
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley during his challenge for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   These sums to the presidential candidates, however, pale in
comparison with the $10.2 million in total political contributions
the industry has given through June for the 2000 election,
including the money to individual House and Senate candidates and
to the political party committees. The figures are the latest
available. The next finance reports are not due until the end of
this month, but they are not expected to show any change in the
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The center's study shows that 74 percent of the total, or $7.53
million went to Republicans, while just 26 percent or $2,66
million, was contributed to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the industry gave $4.8 million in contributions at the
federal level, spreading it almost equally with 52 percent going to
the GOP and 48 percent to the Democrats. By 1994, the companies
were giving 60 percent of their contributions to the GOP and 40
percent to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the contribution disparities
underscore that the approach Gore and the Democrats have taken
regarding a prescription drug benefit ``represents the interests of
America's families, while Bush represents the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan said various groups contribute to
candidates for their own reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush makes his decision on what he thinks is best for
America, not on campaign finance support,'' said Sullivan. ``He has
put forth a realistic plan to get prescription drugs into the hands
of senior citizens who need them. The Gore campaign does a good job
of demonizing sectors of the economy and trying to scare people.''
</P>
<P>
   Political contributions fall into two major categories _ those
given to the candidates and those given to the parties. Individuals
are allowed to give $1,000 to a candidate for each election while a
political action committee can give up to $5,000. Corporations and
unions cannot give money directly to a candidate. There are no
limits, however, on the amount an individual, union or corporation
can give to a political party or one of its campaign committees.
Those unlimited contributions are called soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The largest pharmaceutical contributor so far in the 2000
election is Pfizer Inc., the New York company that recently
purchased Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has donated $1.3 million through June 30, including
$931,000 in unregulated soft money contributions to political party
committees. The center's report said that of the soft money
donations, 83 percent _ $771,821 _ went to GOP groups like the
Republican National Committee while $160,000 _ 17 percent _ was
given to the Democratic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer spokesman Andy McCormick explained that his company
``makes contributions to groups who are responsive to us as a
pharmaceutical company and to fostering a favorable business
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Denise Foy, a spokeswoman for Schering-Plough Corp., said the
same is true of her company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schering-Plough Corp. supports candidates who support a free
market system and who best support Schering-Plough's point of view
on the issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals and a political action committee connected to
Schering-Plough have donated $691,114 to candidates and political
party committees for the 2000 election. The study said $408,500 of
that total came in the form of soft money donations to the party
committees, with 76 percent going to the Republicans and 24 percent
to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products has given $287,805 during the current
campaign. That total includes $189,575 in contributions to the
political party committees, with 73 percent of that going to
Republicans and 27 percent to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the disparity, Lowell Weiner, a company spokesman,
said, ``American Home Products, as always, has tried to be
bipartisan. We support the two-party system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, of course, have been supportive of the
pharmaceutical industry and have been beneficiaries of their
largesse, including Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate for re-election to the Senate this year,
Lieberman had collected $68,450 from individuals and political
action committees connected to the drug industry. This was the
highest total of any Democratic member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Gore campaign rhetoric that has lashed out at big
oil, HMOs, insurers and pharmaceutical companies, Lieberman has
often backed the agenda of many of these business interests,
including the drug makers. He has frequently described himself as
``pro-business, pro-trade and pro-economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said Lieberman is fully supportive of
the Medicare prescription drug benefit plan outlined by the
Democratic nominee that is so vehemently opposed by the
pharmaceutical industry. He also said ``the positions of the
Gore-Lieberman ticket are the views that Gore has articulated.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The second leading Democratic recipient of money from the drug
companies during this election cycle is Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., who has received $55,800, and as chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee has collected thousands of dollars
more for his party.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, who is not up for re-election, has been an unabashed
supporter of the drug industry, a major employer in New Jersey. He
is the sponsor of a bill on behalf of Schering-Plough aimed at
extending the patent life of Claritin, the company's most
profitable drug.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the prescription drug benefit for the elderly and
the issue of price controls, pharmaceutical companies have in
recent years focused on legislation to extend patents for their
products, lobbied for tax breaks for research and development and
sought limitations on federal regulation of their business.

 (One B&AMP;W image of the symbol for the Sydney Olympics is
available.) 
 By DAVID EWING DUNCAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    If U.S. athletes bring home gold from the Sydney Olympics, a lot
of the credit may be owed to the accelerating presence of high
technology, which is radically remaking the Games that just a few
years ago were proudly amateur and lacking in the gee-whiz science
that can shave seconds off event times.
 &HT;    ``Technology is reshaping most sports,'' says Lance Williams,
program administrator at the United States Olympic Committee's $2.2
million, state-of-the-art sports science division.
 &HT;    Employing more than 25 people to assist 45 U.S. teams, the
division's biomechanists, physiologists, engineers and
psychologists are augmented by dozens of tech-smart specialists on
individual teams and at such equipment makers as Nike, Adidas, and
GT Bicycles.
 &HT;    Critics contend that technology's cutting edge is fast
overtaking the human edge in creating stellar performances. But
coaches, officials and sports scientists insist that old-fashioned
talent and grit remain the most important ingredients.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SLIP SLIDING AWAY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When U.S. breaststroker Ed Moses flings himself into the
cornflower-blue water of the Sydney International Aquatic Center,
the only skin showing will be on his face and below his elbows and
knees.
 &HT;    Looking like a sleek Teletubby in his Teflon-coated, formfitting
bodysuit, Moses will glide through water with greater efficiency
and more speed than did former Olympians clad in skimpier suits.
 &HT;    His Adidas-made supersuit is designed to put pressure on
appropriate spots on the body to maintain proper technique. The
tight-fitting fabric around his biceps and thighs reduces muscle
vibration, and hence fatigue.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    IT'S IN THE BAG
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Olympian boxer David Jackson's punch power is measured using an
instrumented heavy bag, exclusive to the U.S. team, which looks
like a normal punching bag. Except engineers at the USOC workshop
in Colorado Springs have embedded a PVC pipe inside running the
length of the bag.
 &HT;    It houses a device called an accelerometer, a three-inch wafer
of circuitry and wires that translates the pounding of a jab or a
hook into schematics displayed on a computer screen.
 &HT;    Videotape shot while the boxer bashes the souped-up bag is run
on the same screen in tandem with numbers and graphics, a
juxtaposition that allows coach and athlete to critique the
athlete's punch effectiveness _ his stance, arm motion and
attitude.
 &HT;    ``I think the boxers are getting stronger and better because of
this bag,'' says David Lubs, director of programs for the U.S.
boxing team.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PIERCING THE WIND
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Come September in the down-under world of Sydney, the air blows
with ferocity, averaging 24 miles per hour. At nearby Homebush Bay,
where archers will compete, winds frequently gust up to 50 mph.
Such force can play havoc with a slender shaft zipping along at
more than 130 mph toward a target 230 feet away.
 &HT;    ``Oh, baby, the wind was impressive,'' says Don Rabska, a former
archer and the coach of movie-star archer Geena Davis, who competed
in an Olympic test tournament in Sydney a year ago.
 &HT;    ``On one of the practice days, when I was standing with Geena, I
was literally blown off the line. It was howling!''
 &HT;    To help the arrows fly true, U.S. archers will be using weeny
one-fifth-inch diameter shafts weighted in the front with
heavier-than-steel tungsten points.
 &HT;    Manufactured by Easton Archery of Salt Lake City, Utah, the X-10
arrows are made from the latest aluminum-carbon hybrid, with
slippery carbon-graphite coatings that help reduce drag.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    STRAIGHT SHOT
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Last January Olympic shooter Bob Foth was off his usual mark
while firing his .22 caliber rifle in the prone position. To find
out why, he visited engineer Tim Conrad at the U.S. Olympics Center
in Colorado Springs. Conrad clipped a tiny 120-gram diode laser to
the bottom of Foth's weapon.
 &HT;    As Conrad demonstrates, when the weapon is fired, a laser beams
along the exact trajectory of the bullet as it zings at 750 miles
per hour to the target, situated 50 meters (165 feet) away. The
beam is concentrated to strike at the bullet's exact point of
impact.
 &HT;    The laser is used concurrently with videotape to check shooters'
aim before and during a shot and how much they sway while pulling
the trigger. Heart monitors strapped to the gunners' chests also
measure the impact of pulse rates on accuracy.
 &HT;    For optimal results, shooters must remain as still as a stone
while firing; one minute of arc can make the crucial difference
between a gold medal and no medal at all.
 &HT;    For Foth, a three-time Olympian, the lasers revealed that his
stance, pulse rate and gun harness were fine. The trouble was that
his ammunition was firing slightly off: ``Using good ammo, he
improved,'' Conrad says.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I'M GONNA LEARN HOW TO FLY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For the pole vault, biomechanists are testing the bend and
verticality of poles in an effort to further thwart gravity. They
videotape vaulters and use the tape to build computer models that
analyze the bend and motion of poles and the style and placement of
the athletes in order to help heave humans ever higher.
 &HT;    The garb worn by track-and-field athletes has undergone some
radical remodeling to enhance performance. When Florence Griffith
Joyner broke the world record for the 100-meter dash, her body was
moving at close to 22 miles per hour. But her legs whipped back and
forth at up to 50 mph.
 &HT;    ``The legs are in a different airflow environment, so we are
focusing on making the legs more aerodynamic,'' says USOC
biomechanist Jeff Broker.
 &HT;    This year in Sydney some runners and jumpers will be wearing
special bodysuits by Nike that will cut down on the wind resistance
of skin against air, with the possibility of improving times by
valuable fractions of seconds, depending on the competition.
 &HT;    To cut times in sprint and hurdle events, athletes' shoes have
been pared away so that they now amount to lightweight ``socks with
spikes attached,'' according to triple-jump coach Dick Booth.
 &HT;    At Sydney, his jumpers plan to use another innovation:
ultralight spikes made of ceramics rather than metal that help
launch athletes off the rubber tracks more easily and efficiently.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN
 &HT;    
 &HT;    At the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, cyclists with teardrop-shaped
helmets and ultratight bodysuits rode machines only vaguely
resembling anything hitherto called a bicycle.
 &HT;    As if tiny front wheels, ultralight Kevlar frames, and almost
paper-thin chain casings and tubes were not enough, engineers of
the SuperBike also placed the handlebars so radically far forward
that cyclists crouched with buttocks high in the air, thus reducing
wind resistance and cutting some times by several seconds.
 &HT;    The SuperBike stirred an uproar _ few teams could afford its
high price _ and the Union Cycliste Internationale, the sport's
governing body, banned it from competition.
 &HT;    In Sydney, the old bicycle or something very close to it is
back. According to the UCI's regulations, cycles must have a
diamond-shaped frame, equal-sized wheels, and handlebars closer to
the oldfangled, upright position.
 &HT;    Many U.S. Olympians will be riding GT's new SuperBike III (the
1996 SuperBike was actually number two in the series), a machine
that pushes the UCI regulations to the max. Although it looks like
the older ``bike,'' it has a more aerodynamic frame and silk tires
pumped to 250 pounds pressure per square inch.
 &HT;    U.S. cyclists also will be wearing improved suits with the seams
sewn out of the airflow to reduce friction. The
slipperier-than-skin suits may cut times by as much as one to three
seconds.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    STICKING TO YOUR OARS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    To train Olympic eight-person rowing crews, scientists mounted a
plastic box the size of a paperback book and weighing just 1.4
pounds right behind the coxswain's seat.
 &HT;    As muscles strain and water spews in a spray from the ends of
the oars, the box pings a signal that relays sensor-collected data
through a small antenna to a fancy laptop on the coach's boat.
 &HT;    Attached to the oars and their mechanisms, the sensors help
create a biomechanical profile of each crew member's contribution
to the boat's speed and acceleration.
 &HT;    ``We are looking for force, power, curve and synchronicity,''
says USOC biomechanist Jeff Broker.
 &HT;    The sensors assess each oar's force and angle, producing charts
that reveal who is pulling more than the others.

slipperier-than-skin suits may cut times by as much as one to three
seconds.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    STICKING TO YOUR OARS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    To train Olympic eight-person rowing crews, scientists mounted a
plastic box the size of a paperback book and weighing just 1.4
pounds right behind the coxswain's seat.
 &HT;    As muscles strain and water spews in a spray from the ends of
the oars, the box pings a signal that relays sensor-collected data
through a small antenna to a fancy laptop on the coach's boat.
 &HT;    Attached to the oars and their mechanisms, the sensors help
create a biomechanical profile of each crew member's contribution
to the boat's speed and acceleration.
 &HT;    ``We are looking for force, power, curve and synchronicity,''
says USOC biomechanist Jeff Broker.
 &HT;    The sensors assess each oar's force and angle, producing charts
that reveal who is pulling more than the others.
 &HT;

Harper's and Smithsonian.)

ALL ABOUT EVE 2
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After dodging a nasty mitochondrial infection in her first
adventure, stylish detective Aya Brea is back for more mayhem and
menace in Parasite Eve 2, a gorgeously wrought PlayStation
adventure videogame hitting store shelves this week.
</P>
<P>
   The original Parasite Eve was much lauded for its cinematic look
and noirlike sensibilities as players tried to stop the spread of a
horrific killer creature that infected people's cells.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Brea has left the NYPD and come to Los Angeles as part of a
special FBI task force fighting the Neo Mitochondrion Creatures (if
you skipped biology that week in high school, mitochondria are the
little energy factories in every cell; scientists have theorized
they once were separate creatures that merged in symbiotic
relationship with human ancestors).
</P>
<P>
   The only knock on the original Parasite Eve was that the fun
ended too quickly, after about only 30 hours of gameplay.
SquareSoft, best known for its Final Fantasy role-playing games,
seems to have taken care of that concern with a two-disc sequel big
enough for all of the gamemaker's great cinematic cut scenes, along
with a nifty new battle system that's more realistic. You might say
this game has an infectious quality to it.

CHAOS IN BRITAIN AS PROTESTS AGAINST FUEL PRICES CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain was gripped by chaos Tuesday as more than 6,000
gas stations ran out of fuel following mass blockades of oil
refineries and depots across the country.
</P>
<P>
   As panicked motorists lined up before dawn to buy gasoline or
were turned away from station after station, services around
Britain began curtailing their operations. Many hospitals canceled
all but essential procedures. Some train operators canceled trains.
In London, a group that represents motorists warned that there
would be no gasoline left in the city by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a journey isn't essential, then try to avoid it at all
costs, because the current crisis means it's very uncertain,'' said
Jonathan Simpson, a spokesman for the group, the Royal Automobile
Club. ``This is by far the worst crisis we've had in 25 years. The
government has to step in immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing its gravest domestic crisis in its two-and-half years in
power, the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair held an
emergency Cabinet meeting in an effort to find a way to end the
mass protests by truck drivers, farm workers and others over high
gasoline prices, which have paralyzed the country for the past two
days. But the government reiterated Tuesday that under no
circumstances would it bow to the demonstrators' demands to lower
gasoline taxes from the current rate of 76 percent, the highest
rate in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the government capitulated last week after days of
crippling strikes, agreeing to lower its gasoline tax by about 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But John Prescott, Britain's transport minister, said the
country would not follow suit and make ``rash decisions'' over fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have in this country is a proper forum to negotiate
these matters _ it's called the political process _ and indeed we
are not prepared to succumb to the kind of French situation we have
seen in the past few weeks,'' said Prescott, speaking outside
Downing Street Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government said that it was up to the oil companies, whose
refineries and depots have been brought to a virtual standstill by
protests in the last several days, to ensure that fuel supplies
were distributed around the country. And he warned that the
government was prepared to ensure that they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot and will not accept the chaos which seems to be
developing across the country, where emergency services are being
denied to the people,'' Prescott said. ``We are looking at all
possible contingencies in this matter to see that normal services
are resumed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear what contingencies he meant.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Queen Elizabeth and her advisory body, the Privy
Council, approved the use of emergency powers by the government to
ensure that fuel be delivered to essential users like hospitals,
schools and railroad companies.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters have promised that they will continue their
disruptions until the government gives in to their demands.
</P>
<P>
   Brynle Williams, who has emerged as a spokesman for the
protesters, laid the blame squarely on the prime minister's
shoulders and said he could have put an end to the problems with
the stroke of a pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Blair has made a gross mistake and has grossly
underestimated the will of the country,'' he said. ``Will we back
down? Never.''

A CURRY NOT FOUND IN POWDER FORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDIA-BOOK-REVIEW) 
 By AMANDA HESSER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the dishes of other countries become part of
American cooking vernacular, so do the ingredients that define
them. Curry leaves, which are used in Indian, Sri Lankan and
Malaysian cooking, are beginning to appear in mainstream cookbooks
just as Mexican cilantro and Southeast Asian kaffir lime leaves did
a while ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Indian cooking, mustard seeds and dried red chilies are
familiar enough, but curry leaves have no familiar reference; they
are not related to curry powder. Once tasted, you realize they have
no substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Curry leaves are sold on their thin stems. The leaves look like
bay, the fronds like ferns. Small, soft and waxy, the curry leaf
has a powerful toasty aroma, layered with green pepper and citrus.
It is not a fleeting aroma but one that is deep and heady, and
pronounced in every dish it touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are absolutely one of the best things,'' said Madhur
Jaffrey, author of ``Madhur Jaffrey's World Vegetarian'' (Clarkson
Potter, $40). ``I keep hoping it will be the next lemon grass of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   She gives curry leaves to chefs, and when she has guests, she
said, ``I put it on their napkin, a whole spray of it, so they can
crush it and smell it and see just how wonderful its aroma can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffrey uses them not just in Indian dishes but western ones,
too. For pasta, she seasons a tomato sauce with mustard seeds, red
chili and curry leaves. When stir-frying shrimp, she adds curry
leaves to the oil.
</P>
<P>
   This is an easy herb to incorporate, potent but not too
assertive. I inserted them in slices in fingerling potatoes, as I
would bay leaves, before tossing the potatoes in peanut oil and
braising them with a few cloves of garlic. For soup, I combined
curry leaves with a few slow-roasted tomatoes and onions, a little
water and a pinch of cumin.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves, which offer a touch of bitterness once cooked,
helped balance the tomatoes' sweetness. They were also delicious
sprinkled on roasted eggplant, which was soft and caramely and
needed a powerful herb (which is why eggplant is so often paired
with rosemary or thyme).
</P>
<P>
   With dishes that have a sauce or a broth, the leaves should be
added whole to allow their flavor to seep out slowly. When
sauteing, they are best added to the oil as it heats so that the
flavor is infused in it and then the whole dish.
</P>
<P>
   Curry leaves are usually sold in plastic packages and will keep
in the refrigerator for a week. In tropical regions of India, the
curry plant is grown in backyards and in pots inside homes so, like
the laurel tree in many French homes, it is always at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Though dried curry leaves are easier to find than fresh, as
Jaffrey said, they ``give so little aroma that it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh curry leaves are available at Indian markets. A package of
four to five stems is $1.49 at Kalustyan's, 123 Lexington Avenue
(28th Street); (212) 685-3451. Curry plants for growing indoors
start at $6 plus shipping from P.C. Link Corp., (212) 221-7040;

YOUNG CHARMS THE GREEK
</HEADLINE>

Our rating: 3 1/2 stars

<P>
   Neil Young brought his A game but his B list of material to the
Greek Theatre Monday night, romping through an agreeable set of
what could be called his minor classics. Casual fans might have
left scratching their heads, but the faithful _ who seemed on hand
in strong numbers _ were pleased to revisit this segment of Young's
staggeringly rich catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the '70s composition ``Winterlong,'' he described it
as ``not quite a hit, it sounds like something else, but you just
gotta like it.'' That was the night in a nutshell. Figuring that
fans had heard ``Down by the River,'' ``After the Gold Rush,''
``Cinnamon Girl'' and similar chestnuts quite enough thank you at
this point, Young played lesser celebrated but nevertheless strong
tunes like ``Motorcycle Mama,'' ``Everybody Knows This Is
Nowhere,'' ``Walk On'' and the unreleased ``Bad Fog of
Loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Young fronted a solid ensemble of pro session musicians like
drummer Jim Keltner and bassist ``Duck'' Dunn. That his wife, Pegi,
and sister Astrid contributed backup vocals helped give the show a
more modest, homey feel in the Greek's spacious environs. The
singer and guitarist wasn't going for an electric, intense
performance as he has in recent years; this show was more
reflective and found Young in a jovial, nostalgic mood: He joked
about remembering how scared he was when he first played the Greek
a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   He mixed his vast repertoire from the '70s with numbers from two
more recent albums _ 1992's gentle, country-tinged ``Harvest Moon''
and this year's folky ``Silver and Gold'' (itself a collection of
tunes Young had written in years past). Nothing from his wilderness
years of the '80s made its way into the set, nor did any songs from
his harder-rocking comeback disks of the '90s, but the blend of
selected songs resulted in a pretty seamless vibe throughout the
course of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Guitar solos were kept to manageable lengths _ except, of
course, for ``Cowgirl in the Sand,'' which, along with
``Powderfinger,'' was one of the rare inclusions of his best- known
material. Young also drew the faithful to their feet with inspired
versions of ``Words (Between the Lines)'' (the evening's most
impassioned performance) and ``Tonight's the Night,'' a song about
the toll of drug addiction that's still eerie after all these
years: Moaning and wailing through the song, Young still seems to
be communing with long-departed friend Bill Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Hynde and the Pretenders opened the evening with a
solid, professional set that tacitly acknowledged that the band
peaked with 1983's ``Learning to Crawl,'' a depressing but
realistic assessment. Hynde closed her show with another Young drug
song, ``Needle and the Damage Done'' _ sample lyric: ``I hit the
city and I lost my band/I watched the needle take another band'' _
a sad, sobering tribute to her own group's a rocky, tragic
history. &QL;

SWEET AND SPICY PEPPER STEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the fifth column of a series by Eberhard Mueller, the
executive chef and an owner of Lutece. They are being written with
Jack Bishop.) 
 By EBERHARD MUELLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like most chefs, I've spent countless hours charring
peppers over an open flame, steaming them in a covered bowl, then
scraping off their skins and pulling out every last seed. Although
tedious, this process is magical. Roasting transforms crunchy,
crisp peppers into soft, smooth vegetables that melt in your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But I've found that stewing sliced peppers in lots of olive oil
creates a similar texture with just a fraction of the work. This
cooking method also captures the peppers' flavorful juices, which
are lost when they are roasted. With a combination of orange,
yellow and red bell peppers, the juices and the oil emulsify to
create a brilliant bright orange sauce, and it has a great taste.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce moistens the peppers if you want to serve them as a
side dish. But there is also enough sauce to spoon over grilled
striped bass or bluefish, or roasted or grilled chicken. Fresh
peppers exude plenty of juice, and you need all the oil in this
recipe to thicken it to a sauce consistency.
</P>
<P>
   To balance the sweetness of the peppers, I also use Hungarian
wax peppers, which have pure pepper flavor with minimal sweetness
or heat, and a red jalapeno, which adds heat. The Hungarian peppers
are long, thin and yellowish-green and are sold at farmers'
markets. The red jalapeno tastes fruitier than chilies picked
green.
</P>
<P>
   This dish starts with garlic and cipolline onions (or any
freshly dug onions without papery skins). But instead of sauteing
these aromatics, I sweat them in a covered pot so they don't
overpower the peppers.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, locally grown peppers are as sweet as
candy and far superior to the insipid hothouse Holland peppers
available anytime. Don't buy green ones, though. They have an
unpleasant, bitter flavor. And don't bother with purple peppers;
their color is only skin deep, and their green flesh is bitter.
</P>
<P>
   The best peppers should feel perfectly firm, with no give at
all. To clean peppers, I cut each one in half through the stem end
and pull out the stem, seeds and fleshy white ribs. I then flip the
peppers skin side up and slice them crosswise into thin strips.
</P>
<P>
   Four pounds of peppers may seem like a lot here, but they cook
down quite a bit. Save leftovers for lunch the next day and spoon
them onto slices of grilled bread. Stewed peppers are also great
with eggs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SWEET AND SPICY PEPPER STEW  &LR;   &UR; Time: 45 minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   12 small fresh cipolline onions, stalks and roots trimmed, bulbs
sliced thin (1 generous cup)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 medium garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds orange, yellow and red bell peppers, halved, stemmed,
seeded and sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   2 Hungarian wax peppers, halved, stemmed, seeded and sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   1 red jalapeno, halved, stemmed, seeded, and sliced thin.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the oil and onions in a large braising pan or
casserole. Turn heat to medium, season the onions generously with
salt and pepper to taste, cover, and cook until softened, 4
minutes. Stir in the garlic, cover, and cook until the garlic is
softened, about 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the bell peppers (they will mound high in pan) and 2
tablespoons water, cover, and cook, stirring once or twice, until
peppers begin to release their liquid, about 6 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stir in the wax peppers and the jalapeno, cover, and continue
cooking, stirring several times, until the peppers are tender but
not mushy, about 10 minutes. Adjust the seasonings. Serve hot, warm
or at room temperature.

   Yield: 8 side-dish servings.

EXPLORING CUISINE FROM INDIA'S SPICE COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMANDA HESSER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first taste of the coriander chicken on coconut
pancakes from Maya Kaimal's new book, ``Savoring the Spice Coast of
India'' (Harper Collins, $27.50), evokes a number of responses.
</P>
<P>
   Is this Thai? Could it really be Indian? Certainly, it is like
no Indian food found in restaurants here.
</P>
<P>
   It is proof of how little most Americans still know about Indian
cooking. Most of the restaurant food and cookbook recipes in
America come from northern India and Bangladesh, where the cuisine
is marked by lots of meats, tandoori cooking, flatbreads and mild
spices. But such a large country, with widely varied climates and a
diverse culture, has many regional variations in its cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Kaimal's recipes seem exotic. There are egg dishes
and crisp pancakes, leavened with yeast; coconut chutneys, cucumber
salads and brothy curries. Mustard seeds, green chilies, tamarind
and curry leaves are used in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   Kaimal's spice coast is the shoreline along southern and western
India, a region called Kerala. It is warm and humid; as in many
tropical cuisines, fish and seafood prevail, as do chilies and
spices.
</P>
<P>
   Hindus, Muslims and Christians coexist in the region, and each
group has its own style of cooking, all represented in this book.
</P>
<P>
   Hindus there, including Kaimal's family, rely on vegetable
curries, rice and legumes. The Syrian Christians are known for
appam, or yeast pancakes, steamed fish, fried meats and meat stews.
The Muslims' cuisine is more closely tied to the north, with meat
curries scented with garam masala and rice casseroles,
incorporating local foods like coconut, tamarind, fish and bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Kaimal, who is American and a cookbook author, began by
exploring the cooking of her relatives, then spent time with both
Syrian Christian and Muslim cooks.
</P>
<P>
   For coconut pancakes, a Syrian Christian recipe, you begin by
softening yeast in water, cooking rice flour in a pan and stirring
these together with cream of rice, shredded coconut and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, coconut milk and salt are added, and the
delicate batter is fried. A hot nonstick pan, a very thin spatula
and patience are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Alone, the pancakes are fairly bland but, as Kaimal points out,
they are lovely with other dishes. I served them as a base for
coriander chicken, a braised dish seasoned with coriander seed,
curry leaves, spices, coconut milk and fresh cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   The fragrant juices from the chicken soaked into the pancakes,
making their nutty flavor come alive and providing a spongy, yeasty
bed, much like the Ethiopian bread injera, but with crisp edges.
</P>
<P>
   Two warm cucumber salads, both Hindu, were interesting. One,
with tomatoes, cumin, green chilies, yogurt and mustard seeds, was
tangy and richly spiced. Another, with black-eyed peas, coconut
milk and green chilies, was less vibrant, but memorable for its
novel, gentle flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the dishes, they had daunting ingredient lists, yet
took little time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   A pudding made with almond paste, milk, sugar and cardamom, and
thickened with cream of wheat struck the perfect balance between
childhood pleasure and adult indulgence. It was delicious.
</P>
<P>
   As a guest served this food noted, each dish did what all good
Indian food does: It keeps you wanting a little bit more. And a
little bit more we all took.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the book, Kaimal judiciously lays out how to
plan a southern Indian meal. Most include rice, bread, a legume,
two vegetable dishes and a meat dish. Altogether, these would feed
six. If you make fewer dishes, you won't have enough. I made a
pancake, a meat dish and two vegetable dishes for five and it was
just right.
</P>
<P>
   Kaimal has a strong voice, but it is subdued by a lack of space.
This is a slim, tightly edited book _ generally a good thing. As
with her food, however, I wanted a little more.

WILLIAM W. QUINN, GENERAL AND FORMER INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, DIES AT
92 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Calif. Ariz., France, Germany)   By   JOHN FILES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lt. Gen. William W. Quinn, an intelligence officer
during World War II and an infantry commander in the Korean
conflict, died here Monday at Walter Reed Army Hospital. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 30 years in the military, Quinn's career included a
variety of senior posts.
</P>
<P>
   As an intelligence officer in World War II, he gathered
information and helped coordinate the allied invasion of Southern
France in August 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, during the Battle of the Bulge, Quinn
anticipated a German attack on the 7th Infantry in Northern France.
On New Year's Eve, the offensive materialized. For more than 20
days, the Germans pounded the Americans, but they held firm.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his
intelligence assessment that provided a crucial warning of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he was named chief of operations of the
organization that became the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``His preparations,'' George J. Tenet, the director of central
intelligence, said on Tuesday, ``ensured that the country
maintained some vital intelligence resources when chilled relations
with the Soviet Union expanded into a Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   As commanding officer of the 17th Infantry, 7th Infantry
Division in Korea in 1951, Quinn led his regiment _ known as the
Buffaloes _ against the communist forces, serving as a spearhead of
the 7th Infantry. The name became popular with his troops, and it
stuck.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as chief of information for the Department of the
Army from 1959 to 1961, before joining the Defense Intelligence
Agency, where he rose to deputy director. In 1964, he became the
commanding general of the Seventy Infantry in Germany. He retired
from the Army in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The general graduated from the National War College, the
Infantry School and the Command and General Staff College. In
addition to the Distinguished Service Medal, he received the Silver
Star, the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit and a Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   William Wilson Quinn was born in Crisfield, Md., on Nov. 1,
1907. He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in
1933.
</P>
<P>
   The general is survived by his wife, the former Bette Williams
of Arlington, Va., whom he married in 1939; two daughters, the
writer Sally Quinn, of Washington, and Donna Quinn Robbins of
Oakland, Calif.; a son, William W. Jr., of Phoenix; and four
grandchildren.

 &HT;    GETTING WRIGHT FLYER OFF THE GROUND STILL HARD 100 YEARS LATER
 &HT;    750&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By TIMOTHY R. GAFFNEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A good measure of what the Wright brothers
accomplished with the world's first powered flight is how difficult
it's proving to duplicate their feat a century later.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of aviation organizations and government agencies
will spend more than a million dollars, use NASA research
facilities, and tap the talents of historians and engineers in an
effort to build and fly a replica of the Wright Flyer on Dec. 17,
2003, the 100th anniversary of powered flight.
</P>
<P>
   The project will be led by Ken Hyde of Warrenton, Va., a retired
airline pilot and aircraft mechanic who for the past several years
has been studying and trying to duplicate the Wright brothers'
kites, gliders, and powered airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde was selected for the project by the Oshkosh, Wis.-based
Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), which has an agreement
with the National Park Service to plan the first flight centennial
celebration at the Wright Brothers National Memorial at Kitty Hawk,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   EAA President Tom Poberezny and Hyde detailed the group's
``Countdown to Kitty Hawk'' plans Tuesday morning at a news
conference at the National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The event included representatives of the National Park Service;
Inventing Flight, the organization planning Dayton, Ohio's flight
centennial celebrations; the First Flight Centennial Foundation, a
North Carolina group that has financed flight centennial projects,
and the air and space museum, which plans to open a new facility in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   The event was staged directly under the original Wright Flyer,
which hangs on display in the museum's main gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the airplane that started it all,'' Poberezny said,
gesturing at the historic airplanes, rockets and space capsules
that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Doll, park service superintendent of the memorial, said the
flight will be the ``pinnacle event'' of the 2003 celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Park Service feels that the EAA's recreation of
the first flight is a perfect way to bring this moment of history
alive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The EAA was founded in 1953 to support people who build and
restore aircraft at home. It claims 170,000 members and has several
chapters in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   Poberezny said EAA members share the same passion for flight
that inspired the Wrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wright brothers were truly the first aircraft
home-builders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The EAA plans call for finishing the flyer in early 2003 and
taking it on a tour before the flight. Stops planned to date
include EAA's Sun and Fun air show in Lakeland, Fla., in April;
Dayton's air show and main flight centennial celebration in July,
and EAA's fly-in convention and air show in Oshkosh at the end of
July .
</P>
<P>
   Poberezny said plans also include recreating the Wright
brothers' camp at Kitty Hawk, and filming a series of documentaries
to tell the story of how they invented the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Poberezny said the EAA picked Hyde to build the flyer because of
his passion for authenticity. Hyde, who is also an aircraft
restorer, co-founded the Wright Experience in 1998 in an attempt to
learn how Orville and Wilbur Wright, and their machinist Charles
Taylor, designed and built their flying machines.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how they did it has been somewhat of an aviation mystery
because Wilbur Wright died suddenly of typhoid fever in 1912,
before he and Orville documented their work. Orville was unable to
finish the task without his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Working with several universities and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, Hyde's group has pored over the Wrights'
letters and notes and attempted to ``reverse engineer'' some
artifacts, such as parts of the engines that Taylor made in the
Wrights' Dayton bicycle shops.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the experience has been ``very humbling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read that they built the (1903) engine in three months,
it just blows me away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's goal is to make 1903 flyer as authentic as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It's a daunting challenge. Besides leaving incomplete records,
the Wrights employed tools, methods and materials that have long
since fallen out of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest challenge is the fabric,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrights used a tightly woven form of muslin, called ``Pride
of the West,'' that was used to make ladies' undergarments at the
turn of the century. Hyde said the fabric apparently is no longer
made, and he may have to appeal to the textile industry for help.
</P>
<P>
   Poberezny said the EAA expects to spend $1.5 million just
getting the flyer built and planning ``the core'' of the flight
centennial activities.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Equally challenging will be figuring out how the Wrights were
able, even briefly, to control the primitive, unstable flyer in the
air. The Wrights made hundreds of flights on a glider in 1902
before building their powered flyer.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who plans to fly the machine himself, said he hopes to
test it in a huge wind tunnel at NASA's Langley Research Center to
learn how it handles, possibly even flying it inside the tunnel for
training.
</P>
<P>
   Another Wright Flyer researcher said the original flyer's
instability and poor controls make a successful flight doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, our wind tunnel tests have shown that it is
an extremely unstable device,'' Jack Cherne, chairman of the
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics' Wright Flyer
Project, said from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The AIAA's Los Angeles section has spent years testing Wright
Flyer models in wind tunnels and analyzing the data to learn just
how the flyer flew. The project drew international attention last
year when it tested a full-scale model in a cavernous wind tunnel
at NASA's Ames Research Center in California.
</P>
<P>
   Cherne said his group has used the data to make a flight
simulator program that runs on a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our people began to get a feel for how to fly it after
about 20 tries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the project was to modify the original Wright design
just enough to make it safe to fly, then build a second aircraft
and fly it at the flight centennial event.
</P>
<P>
   Cherne, however, said the park service had told his group that
it would not permit any re-enactment flights at the memorial on the
anniversary date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached the National Park Service and they said they
would not allow any flyer on that day because they did not want an
accident to mar the event,'' Cherne said.
</P>
<P>
   Doll said the AIAA never formally asked to make the flight, and
she said worries about an accident weren't a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision (to approve the EAA's plan) was based on
historical accuracy,'' she said.

GALVESTON CAN FINALLY TALK ABOUT STORM THAT ALTERED ITS FATE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last weekend, Galveston officially acknowledged the storm of
1900 that wrecked the community and killed more than 6,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   There were wreaths, statues and marching bands. People
remembered; some cried.
</P>
<P>
   For a hundred years, the most famous island city of Texas has
been quiet about the storm. People knew of it, but the city never
really memorialized it _ made it a visible part of the past.
</P>
<P>
   As one local historian said, ``It's hard to promote a city as a
resort when people know they could be blown away at a moment's
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to it. Some say the people in Galveston were
simply too busy restoring the city to ever commemorate the storm.
They were on their knees bailing water or preoccupied carrying off
the dead. In the end, they just didn't want to talk about it. The
pain was too deep, too personal.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there are those who believe that the most persistent
pain Galveston endured was constantly looking across the bay at the
incessant growth and prosperity of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While Galveston was rebuilding, it was watching its reputation
as the ``Queen City of Texas'' wash slowly away.
</P>
<P>
   Before the storm, Galveston was the state's darling city.
Fourteen direct steamship lines to Europe steamed out of Galveston.
Another three went to Cuba, one to Mexico and two served Japan and
the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston's port was ranked second in the United States in
cotton exports, third in wheat, sixth in cattle, seventh in corn
and 13th in flour. It had one of the largest flour mills in the
state and the only cotton bagging mill south of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   That was the business side.
</P>
<P>
   On the seedier side, the end of town where all the sailors and
stevedores took their pleasures, there were more saloons (489) than
any city of comparable size and more than in any other Gulf port,
including New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The city had 50 houses of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston was an eclectic city. The population was primarily of
European extraction, with 40 percent linked to England, Germany,
Ireland or France.
</P>
<P>
   But 20 percent were African-American, and they had an active
middle class with strong representation among the professional and
skilled labor forces.
</P>
<P>
   Italians, Eastern Europeans and a small number of Hispanics made
up the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston had electric streetcars, electric lights, local and
long-distance telephone service, two domestic telegraph companies.
The city had three big concert halls and 20 hotels with 200
ocean-facing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The city was second in the nation in millionaires per capita.
</P>
<P>
   The storm took all that away.
</P>
<P>
   But Galveston suffered its largest commercial setback when
Spindletop blew open the Texas oil business near Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Houston became the petroleum center of the country.
Gulf, Texaco and Humble set up their offices there.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years later, the Houston Ship Channel was dredged,
and Galveston no longer had the busiest deep-water port in the
state. Railroads were carrying goods throughout the nation, and
Houston had become a rail center. The railroad, as much as the
storm, shoved Galveston out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galveston never was destined to be a huge city _ storm or
not,'' Elizabeth Turner told the Houston Chronicle. Turner, an
author of a Galveston history and associate professor of history at
the University of Houston-Downtown, said Galveston faced physical
limitations from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is just a sandbar,'' she said. ``For a city to grow,
it needs space. Galveston just didn't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 100 years later, Galveston can sit in the sunshine and
watch Houston highways become steaming parking lots. It can watch
an ugly haze cover the city almost daily. It can read about the
big-city crime rate and the rising cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston can be happy with itself again. It can speak of the
storm.

RATS IN GOP AD? AUTHOR OF 1973'S `SUBLIMINAL SEDUCTION' ISN'T
SURPRISED

   (UNDATED) The Democrats call it ``disappointing.'' To the
Republicans it's ``bizarre.'' The advertising firm insists it's a
coincidence. But it is there, in bright, capital letters, the word
``RATS'' in a GOP television spot attacking Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilson Bryan Key is sitting at his ranch outside Reno, Nev.,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's delightful,'' Key says of the ad. ``I'm just
surprised it's so crude. Obviously, an amateur did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1973, Key, then a communications professor at University
of Western Ontario, brought a sinister phrase to the forefront of
the lexicon: ``Subliminal Seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the title of the book in which he claimed that
advertisers were using ``embedded images,'' such as sexual figures
and suggestive words, to affect viewers on an unconscious level.
</P>
<P>
   The public was terrified yet fascinated that advertisers could
reach into unknowing minds. Key hit the lecture circuit in 1975 and
has yet to retire _ although he has slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did 97 lectures one year,'' says Key, now 75. ``I almost
died of jet lag.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he wrote four more books: ``Media
Sexploitation,'' ``The Age of Manipulation,'' ``Subliminal
Adventures in Erotic Art'' and ``The Clam Plate Orgy.''
</P>
<P>
   The books have sold more than 8.5 million copies in six
languages, Key says, adding that ``Media Sexploitation'' is
currently being reissued for the third time in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, Key has noticed plenty of subliminal messages in
advertising. ``Absolutely. It's pretty insidious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   As for this RATS spot, ``It should be quite effective,'' he
says. ``If you were Republican, pairing up `rats' with
`bureaucrats' fits into your cultural background.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Key has had his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Greenwald, a psychology professor at University of
Washington-Seattle, says his research shows that ``briefly flashed
visual images'' have an effect on the viewer, but only for ``a
second or so'' after shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be an effect of the kind that could influence
voting, or I wouldn't expect it to,'' Greenwald says, adding that
Key ``hasn't done any scientific research that establishes any
proof'' that subliminal persuasion exists.
</P>
<P>
   A paper published in the September 1999 Journal of Advertising
is inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In it, three marketing professors studied 56 college students
who each viewed two ads with embedded images and two without. The
conclusion: Subliminal perception ``may influence feelings,'' and
the researchers ``encourage further discussion of that idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Key isn't swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous amount of data'' backing up his premise,
he says, ``way over 500 published academic research pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the problem remains that people can't bring
themselves to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly upsetting, the intensity and power that media
has over our lives,'' Key says. ``People don't want to deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But they should, he adds, especially because digital technology
is making manipulation of images ``so simple to do. It's unlikely
they'll ever be caught. In the old days, it was done by artists by
hand and not at all hard to detect.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he is fascinated that the word RATS was spotted in
the Republican ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the Democrats planted it there,'' he quips. ``The whole
thing is a house of mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Key just finished work on a one-hour program for the British
Broadcasting Corp., one of a 13-part series on conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife also keep up with their five grown daughters,
``scattered all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's writing another book _ a novel, his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a love story,'' he says. ``I got bored with subliminal
seduction.''

   (UNDATED) The Democrats call it ``disappointing.'' To the
Republicans it's ``bizarre.'' The advertising firm insists it's a
coincidence. But it is there, in bright, capital letters, the word
``RATS'' in a GOP television spot attacking Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilson Bryan Key is sitting at his ranch outside Reno, Nev.,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's delightful,'' Key says of the ad. ``I'm just
surprised it's so crude. Obviously, an amateur did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1973, Key, then a communications professor at University
of Western Ontario, brought a sinister phrase to the forefront of
the lexicon: ``Subliminal Seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the title of the book in which he claimed that
advertisers were using ``embedded images,'' such as sexual figures
and suggestive words, to affect viewers on an unconscious level.
</P>
<P>
   The public was terrified yet fascinated that advertisers could
reach into unknowing minds. Key hit the lecture circuit in 1975 and
has yet to retire _ although he has slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did 97 lectures one year,'' says Key, now 75. ``I almost
died of jet lag.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he wrote four more books: ``Media
Sexploitation,'' ``The Age of Manipulation,'' ``Subliminal
Adventures in Erotic Art'' and ``The Clam Plate Orgy.''
</P>
<P>
   The books have sold more than 8.5 million copies in six
languages, Key says, adding that ``Media Sexploitation'' is
currently being reissued for the third time in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, Key has noticed plenty of subliminal messages in
advertising. ``Absolutely. It's pretty insidious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   As for this RATS spot, ``It should be quite effective,'' he
says. ``If you were Republican, pairing up `rats' with
`bureaucrats' fits into your cultural background.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Key has had his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Greenwald, a psychology professor at University of
Washington-Seattle, says his research shows that ``briefly flashed
visual images'' have an effect on the viewer, but only for ``a
second or so'' after shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be an effect of the kind that could influence
voting, or I wouldn't expect it to,'' Greenwald says, adding that
Key ``hasn't done any scientific research that establishes any
proof'' that subliminal persuasion exists.
</P>
<P>
   A paper published in the September 1999 Journal of Advertising
is inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In it, three marketing professors studied 56 college students
who each viewed two ads with embedded images and two without. The
conclusion: Subliminal perception ``may influence feelings,'' and
the researchers ``encourage further discussion of that idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Key isn't swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous amount of data'' backing up his premise,
he says, ``way over 500 published academic research pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the problem remains that people can't bring
themselves to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly upsetting, the intensity and power that media
has over our lives,'' Key says. ``People don't want to deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But they should, he adds, especially because digital technology
is making manipulation of images ``so simple to do. It's unlikely
they'll ever be caught. In the old days, it was done by artists by
hand and not at all hard to detect.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he is fascinated that the word RATS was spotted in
the Republican ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the Democrats planted it there,'' he quips. ``The whole
thing is a house of mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Key just finished work on a one-hour program for the British
Broadcasting Corp., one of a 13-part series on conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife also keep up with their five grown daughters,
``scattered all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's writing another book _ a novel, his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a love story,'' he says. ``I got bored with subliminal
seduction.''

FRIED VEGGIES? SOMETHING'S IN THE OVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The all-fat-is-bad theory of eating has gone the way
of the grapefruit diet, but the calories-do-count theory is still
with us. And that leaves fried foods where they have always been,
generally out of reach for those who would prefer not to gain
weight. Still, the results of perfect deep frying are hard to
resist: Most people prefer a plateful of French fries to boiled
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some time ago, I figured out how to get that irresistible flavor
of French fries without actually frying potatoes. Roasting them at
a high temperature in a light coating of oil provides much of the
same crispness and crunch with far less grease. Not to mention far
less mess.
</P>
<P>
   This summer I decided to put other vegetables to the
``oven-fried'' test: Zucchini, green tomatoes and eggplants.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike potatoes, those vegetables are filled with water, so
roasting them at high heat simply softens them. They need a coating
to provide crispness, something that will actually toast and turn
brown.
</P>
<P>
   Flour, bread crumbs, egg whites all work wonders in oven-frying
vegetables. Just as they do in deep frying, the bread and flour
have properties that can be toasted and browned. The egg whites,
like whole eggs, help the coating stick to the food.
</P>
<P>
   For sliced eggplant, egg whites and bread crumbs were all that
were needed to provide a crunchy coating. But I enhanced the flavor
with thin slices of melted Parmigiano-Reggiano.
</P>
<P>
   Green tomatoes, the juiciest of the vegetables, needed a
relatively thick coating to seal in the liquid and allow the
coating to brown. Adding a little garlic and cayenne to the batter
makes them even better. I also tried laying a leaf of basil on each
slice of tomato before cooking them, and it was a delicious touch,
although I doubt any Southerner would ever entertain such a radical
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Zucchini can be oven-fried in the same kind of batter.
</P>
<P>
   All these ``fried'' vegetables taste great just as they are, hot
out of the oven. But the zucchini and tomatoes are excellent with a
yogurt sauce, curried or dill, while the eggplant could be put
between good Italian bread to make a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Oven-frying beets and sweet potatoes is easiest of all, using
the same technique as with white potatoes because all three do not
have much moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the beets and sweet potatoes and cut into slices less than
an eighth of an inch thick. Season them with salt. Spray a nonstick
pan with cooking spray, arrange the slices on the pan and spray
them with pan spray. Roast on the top shelf of a preheated
450-degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once. They will be
crisp but tender, and you will want to eat them like potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   So go right ahead.
</P>
<P>

NO REST FOR AN OUTLAW IN NAME ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Johnny Santiago, an actor and an owner of Torch, a
restaurant on the Lower East Side, has been a wanted man for most
of his adult life. His outlaw career began in January 1994, just
before his 24th birthday, when he made the mistake of taking a
vacation in Italy and returning to Kennedy Airport with a passport
bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   As he recalls it, he and his luggage were soon surrounded by
eight Customs Service officers and two dogs. ``They took me to a
detention room,'' he said. ``I kept asking why I was there, and all
they'd say was, `Something's come up.' I asked to make a phone
call, and they said no.'' They searched his bags and his shoes.
Finally, after an hour and a half, an agent from the Customs
Service told him that there was a warrant for his arrest dating
from 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I was really confused,'' Santiago said. ``What happened in
1990? I was in college then. Did I get drunk one night and do
something? I couldn't think of anything except some unpaid parking
tickets. Was this part of the Giuliani crackdown? I told them about
the tickets, but they said that wasn't it. Finally an agent told me
the warrant was for robbery and possession of stolen goods.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that he knew he hadn't committed those crimes.
The bad news was that someone from the New York Police Department
was coming to the airport to take him to Rikers Island. ``I
couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``I sat there thinking, `What a way
to end the vacation.'''
</P>
<P>
   But then, as his third hour in detention was beginning, Santiago
got a mysterious reprieve. ``The Customs detective came back and
told me the warrant had been rescinded,'' he said. Still confused
but in no mood to linger, he went home and forgot about it, until
the next overseas trip, later that year, which ended once again
with an interrogation at Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   This time he was handcuffed. ``I tried telling them the warrant
had been rescinded, but it was still there in the computer,'' he
said. ``The agent looked it up and said to me, `Apparently you've
been busy lately.''' There were now additional charges: assault,
resisting arrest and jumping bail.
</P>
<P>
   After questioning him further and taking his fingerprints, the
Customs agents finally recognized his true crime: having the same
name and birthday as another man who was wanted for crimes in the
Bronx. You might think a computer would be capable of
distinguishing the two men, especially since they have different
birthplaces (Puerto Rico for the Bronx fugitive, Brooklyn for the
Manhattan restaurateur).
</P>
<P>
   But the problem seems beyond the scope of modern computer
technology; or, more precisely, the bureaucrats who program those
computers. While the wanted man apparently wanders free, the other
John Santiago has been detained half a dozen times at local
airports, most recently in July. ``The Customs Service now has a
special file in their computer on me,'' he said, ``but it still
takes an hour or two for me to explain everything and get the
agents to look up the file.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest fear is being stopped outside the airport. ``I'm
afraid to take a long car trip,'' he said. ``I've already had some
close calls in New York. I was stopped for speeding once, but the
cop gave me a warning and didn't run the license through the
computer. Another time they ran the computer check and saw the
warrant, but I managed to persuade the cop I wasn't the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another close call occurred several years ago, shortly after he
got a driver's license with a new address in the Village. ``An NYPD
detective knocked on the door of my apartment at 11:30 at night,''
Santiago said. ``He showed me a picture of a guy named John
Santiago and a warrant for him listing my address. The computer
must have attached it because of my license. I was petrified. I was
standing there in my underwear figuring that I'd be arrested if I
told him my name. I just said I'd never seen the guy in the
picture, and the detective went away.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago tried to clear things up at the source of the warrant,
state Supreme Court in the Bronx. ``They ran a fingerprint check on
me and gave me a printout saying I wasn't the guy they wanted,'' he
said. ``But the document looks like something I could have made up
at home. I asked for a letter with a court seal on it, but the
judge refused. I said to him, `Look, if I get pulled over for
speeding some Friday afternoon, I could spend a weekend in jail.'
His response was, `Well, you shouldn't be speeding.'''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: New restaurant escalates Lufkin
controversy
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ We have a new restaurant _ this in a town that
uses the term loosely. McDonald's, for instance, is considered a
drive-in restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But Marbles, the new place, is a fine dining, uptown-style
establishment that just happens to be located in a downtown
basement.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the best basement Lufkin has to offer _ in the old
Perry Building, our would-be high-rise that never completely got
off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Perry Building is all of four stories plus a penthouse of
executive offices, which is pretty much our skyline hereabouts,
along with the water tower.
</P>
<P>
   The building's foundation had been constructed to support a
structure of some 10 stories. The idea was that it would be added
onto and ``grow with Lufkin.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a direct quote from the special edition of the Lufkin
Daily News, August of 1950, celebrating the grand opening.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that Lufkin hasn't grown _ but it grew out, not up.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown business went south, to the new malls that were
developed beginning in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Perry Building was headquarters for the chain of Perry Bros.
five and dime stores, which started here in my little hometown and
in latter times was second in number of stores only to Woolworth.
</P>
<P>
   Woolworth and Perry's had this much in common as well _ they
both shut down about the same time in the late '90s, commercial
casualties of the giant discount chains.
</P>
<P>
   Fair's fair. They in their day had put the mom-and-pop shops out
of business. What goes around comes around, and somebody goes bust.
</P>
<P>
   The basement of the Perry Building had housed Perry's Cafeteria,
as fancy as any East Texas eating place you could imagine, and
still well remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a local controversy. Some remember that the Perry
Building had an escalator to and from the cafeteria, the only
escalator in Lufkin's history. Others remember no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   The subject has been much debated of late in the local
newspaper. As you can see, we're hard up for controversies. Hard to
imagine an adventure series, ``Indiana Jones and the Lost Escalator
of Lufkin.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm of the escalator persuasion, though I have to
admit that on visiting Marbles I could find no evidence that such
ever existed.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, any number of partitions have been added in various
stages of remodeling. Best, perhaps, that we leave it to future
archaeologists to decide the issue.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be the first to tell you that Marbles is a wonderful place
to eat. But I also have to tell you I'm a bit prejudiced.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Cates and Lesley Cross are the owners and chefs. Dean is
Roy Cates' son. I've known Roy since way back when he was called
Dinky Cates. To this day we're in the same Sunday school class.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, according to Dinky's boy Dean, the name Marbles
comes from the marble architecture throughout much of the building,
and also that Perry's five and dime was where Dean bought his first
sack of marbles as a kid. His daddy had bought his first sack of
marbles there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``And also maybe I've lost my marbles opening such a place,''
Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. No reason to think Lufkin can't support a fine
restaurant, even if it doesn't have a drive-through window.

&HT;     ASIAN-AMERICANS UPSET OVER LEE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Asian-American scientists in the nation's
weapons labs expressed anger over what they perceive as government
mishandling of the case involving accused spy Wen Ho Lee, who on
Tuesday was awaiting a plea agreement that could set him free.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was worked out nine months after Lee was arrested. Lee
has professed his innocence and he has been characterized by
colleagues and Asian-American organizations as a scapegoat for
security and management shortcomings at the nation's weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the American justice system works, but unfortunately
it only worked after enough people complained about it,'' said Joel
Wong, an engineer and 16-year employee of the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, a lot of mainstream Americans don't think we
(Asian-Americans) belong to this country. They think our loyalty
will always (be) to the old country, which is bunk,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Hong Kong, Wong is now an American citizen and assistant
head of the hazards control department at Lawrence Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, a former employee of the Los Alamos National Laboratory
in New Mexico, remained in confinement as lawyers and federal
prosecutors worked out details of a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese-born scientist was fired from Los Alamos in 1999
and later was charged with downloading nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the plea deal, Lee would agree to plead
guilty to the crime of downloading restricted material to an
unsecured computer, one of 59 counts he had faced, and be sentenced
to the nine months he has already served in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   The case has made Asian-Americans working in the laboratories
``extra careful of what we're doing and made us extra careful to
ensure our rights have not been infringed,'' said Manvendra Dubey,
an atmospheric scientist and chemist who heads the Los Alamos
laboratory's Asian-American Diversity Working Group.
</P>
<P>
   Dubey expressed concern about ``questionable'' investigative
tactics the FBI used in the Lee case. Dubey, however, acknowledged
that Lee would admit some guilt in the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's accepted his responsibility and we should move on,''
Dubey added. ``America is a melting pot of diverse individuals, and
let's all work together to make it a successful melting pot.''
</P>
<P>
   At Livermore, spokeswoman Susan Houghton said: ``We're not
really commenting on this (case) to anyone because it really
doesn't involve our lab.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Houghton said, Livermore has tried to help its
employees learn from its sister lab's experience: ``We spent a
morning training managers and employees to be sensitive to cultural
differences, (to) what is appropriate and what isn't appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor L. Ling-chi Wang, director of the Asian-American
Studies program at the University of California at Berkeley, said
the Lee case is ``a very important milestone in the annals of the
Chinese-American struggle for civil rights in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could point to several previous cases where
Chinese-Americans were treated so badly, and there was very little
resistance coming out of the Chinese-American community.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Wang said, Chinese-Americans used the Internet to
spread word about the Lee case, prompting ``tremendous support
across the country, from coast to coast.''

   NEW YORK _ Charles Grodin was once notorious as the talk show
guest who zinged the host; the guy with the ironic sidelong look
who would say anything. But as the man whose own cable talk show
got canceled and received some of the most vicious reviews in
television, he's got a thin skin.
</P>
<P>
   He'll joke that he knew the end was near on MSNBC, which
canceled his show last November, when they took away his dressing
room and he found himself changing in the makeup room. He'll say
that he couldn't have been too bad or he wouldn't have the new gig
on ``60 Minutes II,'' as the end-of-show commentator.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to what the critics had to say about Grodin as
a pundit when he tackled such issues as capital punishment, the
homeless and the rights of welfare mothers, ``I don't want to hear
it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This will make discussion difficult.
</P>
<P>
   People say you rant, Mr. Grodin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, I do rant,'' Grodin says. ``But I don't plan how
I'm gonna come off. If I start getting angry it's not neat and
clean and possibly plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Addendum: ``It's not like the airways are filled with people
trying to get people out of prison. If that was all there was all
over the place, you wouldn't need somebody like me to be on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything more disappointing than a comic actor who
decides to get serious? It's like hoping for a chocolate souffle
and getting spinach. Not that there's anything wrong with spinach,
but Grodin, 65, had been a man with a dark, original, funny
presence. He made his name with ``The Heartbreak Kid'' and then
played the beleaguered dad in the ``Beethoven'' movies, as co-star
to a St. Bernard.
</P>
<P>
   Grodin, these days, is very serious.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving for a chat at The New York Times, the first thing he
wants to know is where the editorial writers are _ he wants to talk
to them about reforming the stiff penalties of the Rockefeller drug
law. He's still enough of a ham to do riffs in a crowded elevator
and when pressed, he'll talk about the movies, a life he insists he
is done with. Talking movies, he's funny. Asked about the making of
the film ``Ishtar,'' he recalls walking a back street in Marrakesh
with Dustin Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I imagining this, or are a lot more people recognizing you
than are recognizing me?'' Hoffman asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a lot of community theater here,'' Grodin says.
</P>
<P>
   Grodin was also, it turns out, not a guy to underrate himself.
Offered the starring and star-making role in ``The Graduate'' as a
young actor, he turned up his nose at the $500 weekly salary and
lost the role. He had done Broadway by then, and the salary seemed
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think something is unfair, I won't do it, even if that
might not be in my interests,'' Grodin says.
</P>
<P>
   What Grodin wants to talk about these days, however, is social
reform; the special he did for Court TV from the Bedford Hills
Maximum Security Prison, which resulted in Christmas pardons last
year for three female prisoners who had been serving long sentences
under the Rockefeller drug law.
</P>
<P>
   How did a comic actor morph into social commentator?
</P>
<P>
   He had always been interested, Grodin says. Growing up in
Pittsburgh, he was the argumentative kid who got thrown out of
class for talking too much, he had considered a career in
journalism. In 1969, he produced a show with friends Paul Simon and
Art Garfunkel which involved the Vietnam War and segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, five years ago, Grodin, who is married and has a young
son, decided he no longer wanted to make movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't leave acting to get involved socially and
politically,'' Grodin says. ``I was not sitting on the set with a
St. Bernard saying, `I've got to get all those people out of
prison.' I left because my son was entering the first grade and I
no longer wanted to travel. Even then, I wasn't hired to do a talk
show on social issues. I was supposed to be dessert, after Geraldo.
Then the O.J. Simpson trial came along and all of a sudden I
shifted back to where I started in 1969.''
</P>
<P>
   If the ratings were not great for his later shows, no matter. No
one could have done well in his last time slot on MSNBC, Grodin
insists: When they put you on at 7 Friday night, they just don't
want you. Anyway, it should not be about ratings.
</P>
<P>
   You want to know what matters, let him tell you about those
three women who were pardoned after he interviewed them and their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the Camus book `The Stranger,' where a guy runs to
help an old lady across the street because of the feeling he gets
when he does it?'' Grodin says. ``That's what this is all about. I
went to a reception in the Village when these people were let out.
A reporter asked, `How do you feel?' I couldn't even answer, it was
so powerful. These were women I'd only seen in prison, now they
were sitting there with their children. It was the most significant
thing I've done in my life.''

HOW WELL DO I KNOW MY KIDS?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CATHERINE NEWTON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a typical Tuesday night. I was working at the computer
and a 10-year-old child stepped into the room with a pair of white
Hanes underpants on his head. They were puffed up to look like a
beret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doood,'' said the young man with an accent so atrocious that I
felt sure his name must be Gunther or Franc. ``It's a nightcap.''
</P>
<P>
   He went away.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes later, I got up to check the laundry. As I
passed by the half-open bathroom door, I saw the light on and I
peeked in. Same child. This time, his fist was in his mouth and
just as I entered the room, he gave a Venus Williams-style grunt
and yanked out a midsized tooth, spewing a viscous stream of blood
onto the tile floor.
</P>
<P>
   I live with this person. He is my son, Jack. But who the heck is
he?
</P>
<P>
   Like most parents, I think I know my children. We talk a lot
(especially Hadley, who's 6). We read together (two Redwall books
and one Nancy Drew last month) and compete in family games
(favorite: Pretty, Pretty Princess). We all study spelling at one
table every Thursday night, we take naps en masse, and this summer
the three of us crowded on the love seat every Wednesday to root
for our favorite Survivor. We are close. Bonded.
</P>
<P>
   But still, they surprise me.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week alone, without trying, I discovered that:
</P>
<P>
   Despite my efforts to the contrary, not only is Hadley aware of
Britney Spears, but my daughter knows every word to ``Oops! ... I
Did It Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack spends his time at school looking at things like
Turtledance.com. ``And there's fishdance.com and hamsterdance.com
and raccoondance.com and pikachudance.com.,'' he informed me.
``Basically, every animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Hadley aware of The Facts of Life, she has a
favorite character: Natalie.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley can eat a quart of strawberries in one sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley can memorize 15 spelling words and still not be able to
read any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Jack thinks Firestone should pay for the tire recall and not
Ford. ``How did you know about this?'' I asked him. ``Mom,'' he
said. ``Don't you read the paper?''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about all this, I began to doubt that I really knew my
children well. I decided it was time for a test. I pulled out the
``How Well Do You Know Your Child?'' quiz from Sal Severe's book
How to Behave So Your Children Will, Too! I answered each of the 20
questions (My favorite song is ...; Other kids think I am ...; What
I like best about my mother is ..., etc.) the way I thought each of
my children would. And then they answered the questions. And we
compared notes.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the results, in brief.
</P>
<P>
   I know Hadley less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I know she likes grilled cheese. I know she likes pink and the
``Powerpuff Girls.'' I know she thinks her bedtime should be
midnight. I know she wants to write books and illustrate them when
she grows up. I know she likes ``The Parent Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know she feeds her cats at her dad's house. I didn't
know she wishes she could read better. I thought what she would
like best about me is that I am nice, but she says I'm lovable. I
had no idea that she feels like not everyone likes her. Or that she
knew Spanish. ``They like me asi asi,'' she said. ``Do you know
what that means?''
</P>
<P>
   I know Jack less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I know he likes oatmeal. I know he likes blue and ``Gundam
Wing.'' I know he doesn't have a favorite song or video game. I
know that if he had lots of money he would: a) ``give some to my
mom'' (and believe me, I'm a little concerned that we got that
right word for word) and b) help animals. I know he likes ``The
Parent Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know that he thinks other kids think he's cool, his
best subject is math, he likes to chat in his free time, and he
would like to be smarter. I thought what he would write he liked
best about me is that I am nice, but he said, ``She's like a best
friend to me, but better.'' I thought he felt that way; I just
never thought he'd write it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good exercise. And a good surprise. We all ended up
laughing and teary-eyed. And we decided to watch TV. Together.
</P>
<P>
   We put on ``The Parent Trap'' video (my favorite, too). And I
discovered something else: Hadley knows every single word of the
script. Completely, not asi asi.
</P>
<P>
   And I reconfirmed what I already knew: Hadley's exuberant verbal
skills work Jack's last nerve.
</P>
<P>
   He went away.
</P>
<P>
   To do what?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows.

ON THE EVE OF THE OLYMPICS, THE IOC STRUGGLES WITH ITS IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ In the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery
scandal and growing fears that the use of performance-enhancing
drugs is pervasive, the International Olympic Committee has faced a
barrage of new embarrassments this week that raise questions about
its ability and resolve to change significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, which has been struggling to turn attention to the
Summer Games that open on Friday, is trying to convince the world
that it is no longer the autocratic organization that it has been
during the two decades Juan Antonio Samaranch has served as
president.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indonesian government criticized Samaranch Tuesday for
lobbying for the release from jail of an IOC delegate named Mohamad
``Bob'' Hasan so he could attend the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   This followed the Australian government's refusal, on grounds of
national security, to allow entry in recent days to two Olympic
officials: Gafur Rakhimov of Uzbekistan, who is a member of the
international boxing federation, and Carl Ching of China, a member
of the international basketball federation. Each man has been
accused of links to organized crime in published reports, and each
has denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's immigration department also said it was monitoring
the activities of between 20 and 40 Olympic officials for security
reasons during the Games, which run from Friday through Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the IOC's problems, many academics, scientists,
athletes and coaches have criticized as insufficient and
ineffective a new test for the endurance drug known as EPO, which
is believed to be widely used in sports like swimming, distance
running and rowing.
</P>
<P>
   These matters have been reported incessantly by the fiercely
competitive Australian media, sometimes in a mocking tone, each
story magnified by the fact that the 2000 Summer Games are
considered among the most important events in the country's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some IOC members said the skeptical coverage
indicated that an overhaul of Olympic rules and procedures enacted
after the Salt Lake City scandal might not earn broad public trust
until Samaranch steps down as president next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably hard for genuine reform to take place
within the existing structure and with the existing president,''
said Richard Cashman, director of the Center for Olympic Studies at
the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis in the Australian media on unsavory characters,
drugs, transportation problems, windy weather and shivering nights
in the athletes' village has clearly exasperated some IOC
delegates, who would prefer that the focus be on performances, new
stadiums and public enthusiasm in a sports-mad country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't we done anything right?'' said Phil Coles, an
Australian IOC delegate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday, some livid IOC officials even considered suing the
Salt Lake City committee organizing the 2002 Winter Games over a
disputed document that contains the word geld _ German for money _
next to the names of some current delegates. The delegates thought
their reputations had been besmirched by the suggestion they were
bribed for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we should see if we can do something legally to attack
those who continue to call our dignity into question,'' said
Francois Carrard, the IOC's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The idea seemed to fade quickly, given that American courts
might not be sympathetic and that it might look unseemly to pick a
fight with the city that the IOC has chosen to host the next Winter
Games in 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   The latest controversy occurred Tuesday when the Indonesian
government criticized Samaranch for a letter he wrote last April
seeking the release of Hasan, the IOC delegate, from jail. A
powerful Asian track and field official, Hasan was also an
associate of the deposed Indonesian president, Suharto. Hasan faces
trial next week on charges of embezzling $87 million in state
money. He has said he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the letter written by Samaranch to Abdurrahman
Wahid, the Indonesian president, was first reported by the Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazed me that they asked for this,'' the Indonesian
attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, said of the IOC to the
Associated Press in Jakarta. ``The ethics involved are quite odd.
It contravenes the spirit of the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, a vice president of the IOC from Montreal, said it
was the IOC's obligation to defend members who have not been
convicted of a crime. ``When you pick an IOC member in a country,
you don't always get it right,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates are chosen for their commitment to sport and their
ability to influence governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, he was such a person,'' Pound said of Hasan.
``Whether he is now remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some IOC officials questioned Samaranch's sense of public
relations for pressing the Australian government to allow Rakhimov
and Ching into the country after it became clear they would not be
granted visas. Pound said the IOC simply wanted to know why the two
men were not allowed in, to determine whether it was for a reason
other than politics, race or religion.
</P>
<P>
   But other Olympic officials saw it as the IOC meddling in the
internal affairs of a sovereign government. ``We looked stupid,''
said an IOC official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``We
should have dropped it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time at the Sydney Games, the IOC will use blood
testing to identify athletes who use performance-enhancing drugs,
which are prohibited. As many as 40 athletes have been removed from
various national Olympic teams for failing blood tests before
leaving home. However, the Olympic committee has said that it was
having trouble locating athletes in Australian locations other than
Sydney to administer the EPO tests.
</P>
<P>
   The test is also flawed, IOC officials admit. Only athletes who
fail both a blood test that detects EPO use over the previous three
weeks and a urine test that detects use over the previous three
days will face punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were going to catch athletes using EPO, they had to
have a test that would catch them weeks after their last dose,''
Peter Larkins, a member of the medical team of the Sydney Olympic
organizing committee, said on Australian television.
</P>
<P>
   Some members have remained defiant in the face of the
unremitting criticism. ``We are like ducks; the rain falls but does
not touch us,'' said Prince Alexandre de Merode, an IOC delegate
from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerhard Heiberg, a member from Norway, said the criticism
was necessary and welcome. Ed Hula, the editor of an Olympic
newsletter called Around the Rings, said the critical coverage
reflected a heightened level of distrust of the IOC in the media
since the Salt Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Sydney Games represent an important crossroads,
said Cashman of the Center of Olympic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Games work out well, the IOC will recover a bit of
ground and Samaranch would go out on a positive note,'' Cashman
said. ``The Olympic movement is fragile now in terms of
credibility. If the Games don't go well, it could be immensely
damaging.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The sudden specter of an energy crisis underscores
the world's reliance on Middle East oil, raises the likelihood that
sharp price increases will spike the American economic expansion,
and revives consumers' nightmares of sky-high winter heating bills,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about a recession here, but we are talking
about a significant shaving of the growth,'' said Donald Ratajczak,
professor emeritus at Georgia State University and author of the
school's economic forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by strong global economic growth and some
supply-and-demand gamesmanship by Middle East producers and Western
middlemen, the price of oil has topped $35 a barrel, up from less
than $15 in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the price of bringing natural gas out of the ground
is projected to hit an all-time high of $3.50 per thousand cubic
feet. And inventories of both heating oil and natural gas are well
below expected winter demand.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to fierce international political pressure, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries this week boosted
production quotas by 800,000 barrels a day. But spot prices for oil
actually increased in the wake of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Massoud Samii, a former OPEC economist who is now a professor of
international business strategy at New Hampshire College in
Manchester, said the market's contrarian reaction illuminates two
points:
</P>
<P>
   _ The announced quota increase is small _ roughly one percent of
daily world demand. And there is skepticism that it is more than
official endorsement of ``cheating'' _ a reference to the roughly
700,000 barrels a day that OPEC oil producers already pumped above
the previous quota.
</P>
<P>
   _ OPEC is bumping the ceiling of its production capacity,
meaning that the world can't count on the Middle East simply to
open up the crude-oil tap.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, when the Iran-Iraq War drove oil to $40 a barrel, OPEC
ministers wanted to increase production to push prices to a more
economically healthy level, but they lacked the capacity to do so,
Samii said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much at the maximum of what they can produce,''
he said. ``If we have a very cold winter, it's not clear they can
produce much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if OPEC can pump out more crude, American refineries may
not have the additional capacity to produce enough heating oil to
offset low inventories and meet expected winter demand, said John
Felmy, director of policy analysis at the American Petroleum
Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although existing facilities have been modernized, there hasn't
been a new refinery built in America in 25 years, Felmy said _ and
there's been a two-million-barrel-a-day drop in domestic refining
capacity in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the bottleneck is a winter transportation problem.
Most fuel oil is shipped to the Northeast by barge, and ``rivers
freeze when it gets cold,'' Felmy said.
</P>
<P>
   A third factor is at play in the supply of both domestic heating
oil and natural gas: A decade or more of relatively cheap energy
prices has lessened the incentive for domestic oil and gas
exploration and production and increased dependence on cheap
imported crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1999, the number of domestic drilling rigs fell
to an all-time low _ about 500 _ in reaction to worldwide oil glut
that followed the Asian economic crisis of 1997 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the number has risen to around 1,000 as prices
have climbed, said Allen Mesch, director of the Maguire Energy
Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. But it is
still low considering the current price of oil: It matches the
number of domestic drilling rigs at work when the price was about
$22 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you've got almost twice as much price and you still have
the same number of rigs out there,'' Mesch said. ``That tells me
people just aren't believing these high prices. They're cautious
because they got clobbered in '98. If you're just an oil and gas
explorer and producer, when prices go down, you're really hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, this caution reflects a major shift in the domestic
energy game, said Mesch. Throughout the 1990s, major oil companies
sold off much of their domestic property, leaving exploration in
places like the Permian Basin of West Texas to small independents
who lack the financial heft to weather price fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   There's a mirror image of this caution among the OPEC oil
ministers. While they're anxious to keep global economic growth
humming, they want to avoid an oil glut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to kill themselves,'' said Mesch. ``They don't
want $15 oil. They do want to sell more oil at a more modest price.
I think this is the way to go _ bring a little more production on,
a little more production on and see what it takes to bring the
price down.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with prices as high as they are right now, domestic
oil companies and energy wholesalers want to keep inventories as
low as possible in order to maintain a healthy bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But Mesch said that means a severe shortage of heating oil and
natural gas stock going into the peak demand season, setting the
stage for even more volatile price spikes than last winter's.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas stocks are 15 percent lower than last year, and the
federal government's Energy Information Agency predicts a 27
percent increase in the residential cost of gas this winter _ to
more than $8 per thousand cubic feet. Heating oil stocks are 25
percent lower than last year. That is likely to drive up the cost
to about $1.30 a gallon, up roughly 30 cents from last year.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the high price of natural gas is the changing
nature of natural gas demand.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, cheap natural gas prices and tougher
environmental restrictions on coal and nuclear fuel have encouraged
utilities to build natural gas power plants, resulting in
year-round demand for this fuel. Gone is the roller-coaster demand
that characterized past natural gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although dire warnings of an energy crisis seem shocking, Mesch
said there has been a steady climb in energy prices over the past
few years, a climb marked by the summer's sharp spike in gasoline
prices.
</P>
<P>
   And the key difference between now and the Arab oil embargo of
1973 is this: Gasoline prices are high, but supplies are still
plentiful, meaning there has been no replay of the long lines at
the pump of almost 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   To date, America's rapidly rising productivity gains and raw
economic growth have more than offset the higher price of energy.
The domestic economy is also more energy efficient and less
dependent on energy as a factor of overall growth.
</P>
<P>
   But warning signs of slowdown are already flashing in the form
of higher prices for airline tickets, trucking rates and the
double-digit increases in electric utility rates imposed on
industrial users in the West and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you have a surcharge on your airline ticket or
utility bill because of fuel, you look for alternatives, you're
more cautious about purchases and that has a ripple effect
throughout the economy,'' said Mesch.
</P>
<P>
   Ratacjzak and other economists say that a longer regime of high
energy prices may trim as much as a third of the growth rate from
the American economy early next year, compounding the cooling
effect of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. They say the
more energy-dependent Asian economies are already feeling the
pinch.
</P>
<P>
   Higher energy prices will rejuvenate interest in alternative
sources, from wind and solar to more exotic variations, the experts
say. But the current scare also serves as a reminder of the failure
to stockpile oil and gas reserves and develop alternative energy
sources when crude oil was cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoyed the low prices, but we may pay for it now,'' said
Samii. ``We got complacent in the individual and policy sense,
driving our SUVs, not doing exploration, not conserving oil.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The sudden specter of an energy crisis underscores
the world's reliance on Middle East oil, raises the likelihood that
sharp price increases will spike the American economic expansion,
and revives consumers' nightmares of sky-high winter heating bills,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about a recession here, but we are talking
about a significant shaving of the growth,'' said Donald Ratajczak,
professor emeritus at Georgia State University and author of the
school's economic forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by strong global economic growth and some
supply-and-demand gamesmanship by Middle East producers and Western
middlemen, the price of oil has topped $35 a barrel, up from less
than $15 in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the price of bringing natural gas out of the ground
is projected to hit an all-time high of $3.50 per thousand cubic
feet. And inventories of both heating oil and natural gas are well
below expected winter demand.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to fierce international political pressure, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries this week boosted
production quotas by 800,000 barrels a day. But spot prices for oil
actually increased in the wake of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Massoud Samii, a former OPEC economist who is now a professor of
international business strategy at New Hampshire College in
Manchester, said the market's contrarian reaction illuminates two
points:
</P>
<P>
   _ The announced quota increase is small _ roughly one percent of
daily world demand. And there is skepticism that it is more than
official endorsement of ``cheating'' _ a reference to the roughly
700,000 barrels a day that OPEC oil producers already pumped above
the previous quota.
</P>
<P>
   _ OPEC is bumping the ceiling of its production capacity,
meaning that the world can't count on the Middle East simply to
open up the crude-oil tap.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, when the Iran-Iraq War drove oil to $40 a barrel, OPEC
ministers wanted to increase production to push prices to a more
economically healthy level, but they lacked the capacity to do so,
Samii said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much at the maximum of what they can produce,''
he said. ``If we have a very cold winter, it's not clear they can
produce much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if OPEC can pump out more crude, American refineries may
not have the additional capacity to produce enough heating oil to
offset low inventories and meet expected winter demand, said John
Felmy, director of policy analysis at the American Petroleum
Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although existing facilities have been modernized, there hasn't
been a new refinery built in America in 25 years, Felmy said _ and
there's been a two-million-barrel-a-day drop in domestic refining
capacity in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the bottleneck is a winter transportation problem.
Most fuel oil is shipped to the Northeast by barge, and ``rivers
freeze when it gets cold,'' Felmy said.
</P>
<P>
   A third factor is at play in the supply of both domestic heating
oil and natural gas: A decade or more of relatively cheap energy
prices has lessened the incentive for domestic oil and gas
exploration and production and increased dependence on cheap
imported crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1999, the number of domestic drilling rigs fell
to an all-time low _ about 500 _ in reaction to worldwide oil glut
that followed the Asian economic crisis of 1997 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the number has risen to around 1,000 as prices
have climbed, said Allen Mesch, director of the Maguire Energy
Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. But it is
still low considering the current price of oil: It matches the
number of domestic drilling rigs at work when the price was about
$22 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you've got almost twice as much price and you still have
the same number of rigs out there,'' Mesch said. ``That tells me
people just aren't believing these high prices. They're cautious
because they got clobbered in '98. If you're just an oil and gas
explorer and producer, when prices go down, you're really hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, this caution reflects a major shift in the domestic
energy game, said Mesch. Throughout the 1990s, major oil companies
sold off much of their domestic property, leaving exploration in
places like the Permian Basin of West Texas to small independents
who lack the financial heft to weather price fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   There's a mirror image of this caution among the OPEC oil
ministers. While they're anxious to keep global economic growth
humming, they want to avoid an oil glut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to kill themselves,'' said Mesch. ``They don't
want $15 oil. They do want to sell more oil at a more modest price.
I think this is the way to go _ bring a little more production on,
a little more production on and see what it takes to bring the
price down.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with prices as high as they are right now, domestic
oil companies and energy wholesalers want to keep inventories as
low as possible in order to maintain a healthy bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But Mesch said that means a severe shortage of heating oil and
natural gas stock going into the peak demand season, setting the
stage for even more volatile price spikes than last winter's.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas stocks are 15 percent lower than last year, and the
federal government's Energy Information Agency predicts a 27
percent increase in the residential cost of gas this winter _ to
more than $8 per thousand cubic feet. Heating oil stocks are 25
percent lower than last year. That is likely to drive up the cost
to about $1.30 a gallon, up roughly 30 cents from last year.
</P>
<P>

ON SEVENTH AVENUE, THE BUZZ, THE ROPES AND THE SEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CATHY HORYN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If every Seventh Avenue building is a hive of
activity before Fashion Week, then 550 Seventh Ave. is certainly
the home of the queen bees. Michael Kors has his studio there. So
do Donna Karan and Oscar de la Renta. But just because everyone is
working in close proximity doesn't mean that anyone knows the buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Paris, you find out much more what other designers are
doing,'' said de la Renta, who also designs for Balmain. ``You find
out because everyone is using the same embroidery and leather
people, and they are constantly going around to the houses.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta was up in his studio late last week with John
Nickleson, his chief assistant of many years, and Laura Montalban,
who used to be with Bill Blass, and they were scrutinizing a
red-striped gown for de la Renta's women's wear show on Sept. 19 at
11 a.m. Just then, Michael Barber, whose company does leatherwork
and embroidery, popped in with a sample of white lace-cut leather,
which caused everyone to swoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Paris, there are 50 Michaels, but he's the only one here,''
de la Renta said. But this also puts Barber in a tricky spot. As de
la Renta said, ``When I saw last year that Ralph Lauren was doing
the exact same skirt that I was, I said, `Michael, how could you do
this to me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Barber laughed. Everybody laughed. And then Barber, who said he
was not Lauren's source, added for good measure, ``I hold de la
Renta at the top of my client list.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rope is sexy, really sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bartlett swiveled around in his chair in his studio on West
15th Street and faced the inspiration board for his spring
collection, a collage of images that ranged from Marlene Dietrich
in mannish pants to fetishistic displays of knot work. Bartlett was
in Japan this year, and that is where he got the idea of rope _ as
a print, as a rustic corset and, of course, as a taboo object.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is not all that far afield for him, but this time it seems
a particularly private head trip. After ending his financial
relationship with the Italian company that makes Byblos, which he
also designed, Bartlett is on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three years just about took it out of me, creatively,''
he said. And he was unable to close a deal with the Pegasus Apparel
Group, a new backer of small and medium-size American labels,
saying that for him the issue was control. So for now, Bartlett is
in that place called Exploring My Options. And it's interesting,
said Bartlett, who will show his spring collection on Sept. 21 at 7
p.m., ``I've been able to get back in touch with my gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Back up on Seventh Avenue, just north of 550, Ralph Rucci was in
his workroom going over details with a seamstress. It is no joke to
say that Rucci makes the kind of clothes that could be worn inside
out. He is a fanatic about perfect seams, and seams in general.
Daniel Storto, a Toronto glove maker who does for hands what Manolo
Blahnik does for feet, said by fax (he was on his way to Antwerp to
bring gloves to Dries van Noten) that Rucci would have made a good
surgeon. The white leather gloves Storto designed for Rucci's show
(Sept. 22 at 12 p.m.) feature a curving seam from midarm to palm.
</P>
<P>
   Such details, clearly, keep Rucci up at night. One of the
fabrics he is using for spring is a quadruple-weight cotton gazar
made in the 1950s for Balenciaga. How does a person know about such
a thing? Rucci laughed wearily. ``Are you kidding?'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   One could say that the flat on West 81st Street where Josh
Patner and Bryan Bradley of Tuleh work is a little like the one in
``The Apartment,'' the 1960 movie that starred Shirley MacLaine and
Jack Lemmon. People are constantly coming and going, and while
Patner does not whip up spaghetti with a tennis racket, he
certainly has some of Lemmon's charm. ``Would you like some?'' he
asked, offering an open box of Oreo cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, they were casting their show (Sept. 22 at 9 a.m.),
and as a model wearing one of their lavender print dresses took a
few paces, Patner said: ``You're adorable. I wish that there were
25 of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Not missing a beat, she said, ``I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Patner laughed and reached for the cereal. This has been a big
year for the designers, who passed the $1 million sales mark with
the fall season. They describe their spring collection as ``amusing
but not silly,'' and seem to have acquired, along with a belief in
the superiority of American dressmaking, a distinctly grown-up view
of growth. ``Money is essential, obviously,'' Patner said. ``But
there's a growth rate that's appropriate for the situation. We
don't need to be a name-brand business in the first five minutes of
life.''

<P>
   Having pets has had a profound impact on how I manage. I expect
a lot of out an animal in terms of love and affection, and I give a
lot of love and affection in return. It involves effort but is also
effortless.
</P>
<P>
   Successfully managing a company involves a lot of the same
expectations and feelings.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Laurie, and I had an 8-year-old Doberman named Otis.
Otis was big, about 130 pounds, and brought so much joy into our
lives. What I really loved doing was getting him on the ground and
wrestling. He was a brute, indestructible, but ultimately we both
had an inner sense about when our playing became too rough. We knew
how to keep our play fun and challenging without it being damaging.
My wife, on the other hand, could get him to purr like an overgrown
house cat.
</P>
<P>
   He developed such a wonderful personality, almost as if he knew
how important he was in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   The way people treat pets really tells you a lot about the way
they approach life, whether they're passive or active. Maybe as
important, I've always believed that the way people treat pets when
they're sick tells you a lot about people, too. Otis battled
lymphoma for two years _ the doctors only gave him six months _
before finally passing. We had high expectations of Otis, and he
did his part: he endured debilitating chemotherapy, doctors' visits
and constant poking and prodding. We had high expectations of
ourselves. We made sure he had the best care, the best diet, and
the most love and affection that was humanly possible.
</P>
<P>
   Now, employees aren't pets (though some bite harder than Otis!).
But creating a loving, affectionate home for pets is similar to
fostering an active environment where employees feel important and
influential. Building such a culture for employees is not just
critical to the personality of an organization, but absolutely key
to its livelihood. Pardon the pun, but you have to let employees
sink their teeth into something that they care about, and you have
to have an environment that supports this.
</P>
<P>
   A new employee came into my office some months ago and proposed
that we move into a different area in the e-printing space. He was
almost defiant in his request, somehow anticipating an Otis-style
wrestling match. I told him, ``OK, let's do it _ you bring in the
order, and you've got the support.'' Our average order at the time
was $60, and he pulled in a $70,000 job.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautiful to watch this new area of business grow into
something significant all because an individual, then individuals,
then the whole company believed in it, wanted it to happen. The
environment we have created made this happen.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like ours that are lumped in with the dot-coms of the
world are going through a lot of pain right now, and justifiably.
There are a lot of bad, young businesses out there that aren't, if
you will, housebroken. Like wild animals, a lot of online companies
are full of enthusiasm but lack a sustainable, supportable
environment. Good companies have both, and some even let you bring
your dog into work with you. &QL;

JULES SCHULMAN, 84, VIOLINIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Julius Schulman, a widely traveled violinist who
played in several major American orchestras, including the
Philadelphia Orchestra, the Boston Symphony and the Metropolitan
Opera Orchestra, died on Saturday at Brotman Hospital in Culver
City, Calif. He was 84 and lived in Culver City.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman was born in New York and began studying the violin at
the Malkin Conservatory in Manhattan when he was 5. He continued
his studies at the Juilliard School and later at the Curtis
Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where his teacher was the
violinist Efrem Zimbalist.
</P>
<P>
   While a student at Curtis, Schulman toured South America with
the All-American Youth Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski.
After his graduation in 1937, he joined Stokowski's Philadelphia
Orchestra. In 1944, he became assistant concertmaster of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, under Fritz Reiner. He performed
regularly as a soloist, and gave several concerts at Town Hall in
New York in the 1940s. But on several occasions he turned down
opportunities to tour as a recitalist in favor of the security of
an orchestra job.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman returned to New York in 1947 to become the
concertmaster of the WOR Mutual Network Symphony Orchestra, and was
frequently heard as a soloist on the orchestra's national
broadcasts. When the orchestra was disbanded after a strike in
1954, Schulman spent a year as a freelancer in Broadway orchestras
and for Muzak, the company that provides recorded background music.
</P>
<P>
   He spent two seasons as concertmaster of the New Orleans
Symphony Orchestra before moving back to New York when he was
appointed concertmaster of the Little Orchestra Society.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, after a tour of Europe, the Middle East and the Soviet
Union with the New York Philharmonic, Schulman joined the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, where he remained until 1970, except for a
sabbatical spent with the Philadelphia Orchestra on a tour of
Japan. When he left the Boston Symphony, Schulman joined the
Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, where he was associate concertmaster
from 1970 to 1975. From 1975 until he retired in 1990, he was
concertmaster of the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman is survived by his wife, Betty; a son, J. Neil Schulman
of Culver City; a daughter, Margaret Garron, of Colorado Springs;
two brothers, Bernard Schulman, of Del Rey Beach, Fla., and
Lanesboro, Mass., and Samuel Schulman, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; and two
sisters, Geri Vladimir and Beatrice Meltzer, both of Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla.

DSL: A CHRONICLE OF UNEASY ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA BELKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last six months, I have been stalled on the entrance
ramp to the information superhighway. Back in February, I signed up
for my very own digital subscriber line, or DSL, an Internet
connection so fast that it leaves last century's must have, the 56K
modem, in the dust. At least that's what the ads say. When and if I
ever get DSL, I hope it's faster than the companies that supply it.
</P>
<P>
   The arc of all technology is from indulgent to indispensable. In
between there is an interminable moment when everyone must have
``it'' but not everyone can get ``it,'' when the potential becomes
bogged down by the infrastructure. That's why we all listened to
endless busy signals on AOL several years ago.. And now that we've
all become more computer savvy _ spoiled by ISDN lines and T-1
lines at the office and impatient to bring that speed home _ many
of us have war stories to tell about the wait for DSL
</P>
<P>
   When I first sent my deposit to Flashcom, my DSL provider, they
told me that because of high demand, my installation would be
scheduled in six to eight weeks. The visit would not be from
Flashcom, but Northpoint, because, in this complicated DSL world,
it takes three separate companies to install any one line. So I
waited two months, only to learn that the wires to my house were
not up to grade.
</P>
<P>
   It seems this happens a lot. On average, 40 percent of would-be
customers, whose computers are within proper range of a
DSL-equipped central telephone office, run into wiring
complications. I learned this from a very nice executive way up the
management ladder at Flashcom who prefers I don't use his name
because the company is _ natch _ in the midst of going public. (He
also directed me to a Web site, www.DSLreports.com, one of a number
of sites that have sprung up for trading gripes about DSL providers
across the country. It made me feel much less alone.)
</P>
<P>
   But I'm getting ahead of my story. Flashcom sent a ``trouble
ticket'' to what, way back then, was still Bell Atlantic. They are
the third company in this dance, because they own the actual wires.
Although I never saw any evidence that Bell Atlantic had been by, I
received an e-mail message weeks later saying that the problem had
been fixed and that I was scheduled for a two-hour appointment _
with Northpoint again _ to install a lot of hardware through my
walls and onto my computer. When the very nice technician was
finished, my desk was decorated with a pretty DSL modem.
Unfortunately, the lights on the modem, which were supposed to turn
green, stayed red and orange instead.
</P>
<P>
   The problem _ surprise! _ was still the outside wires. Another
``trouble ticket'' was sent, and then Flashcom and I spent several
months exchanging e-mail messages. Theirs were upbeat and peppy,
saying that my outside wiring was now complete and it was time for
my inside wiring. Mine were less than upbeat, saying that no, the
inside wiring had already been installed, but the outside wiring
was still a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic became Verizon, went on strike, settled
and bought a 55 percent stake in Northpoint. The only thing they
didn't do was fix my wires. I, on the other hand, decided to give
up, get back my deposit and remain in the Stone Age. But I wouldn't
go out quietly. So I called Verizon and Flashcom and asked them to
comment, for this column, on why it takes more than six months to
get DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies agreed they were having growing pains. The entire
industry is only two years old, explained the Flashcom executive
(who does not have DSL at his own house because he doesn't want to
go to the trouble of getting his sub-par inside wiring replaced.)
Joan Rasmussen of the public relations department at Verizon
compared this to the early days of electricity, when homeowners
kept their gas lamps installed because the newfangled wiring failed
so often.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been coincidence, but within 24 hours of my call
there was a very nice Verizon technician on the pole outside my
house. (A technician, by the way, who had given up on getting DSL
for his own house after waiting three months.) By the end of the
day the lights on my modem had turned green, and it was left to me
to make a few small adjustments to my computer. These didn't make
my DSL work, but it did disable my existing dial-up modem, leaving
me with no Internet connection at all.
</P>
<P>
   As I write this, there is an exceedingly nice technician from
Northpoint in my office, where he has been the last two hours. My
DSL modem works when connected to his laptop, he says, which means
the problem is now my computer, and he suggests I go out and buy a
new Ethernet card. While I'm out, I think I might pick up a gas
lantern, just in case. &QL;

NEW OPERATING SYSTEM DID `WIN ME' OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   A few months ago, I installed a
beta version of Microsoft's new operating system for home users,
Windows Millennium Edition, on my computer. Microsoft calls it
``Windows Me'' for short.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Struggling with the installation, I called it ``Windows Woe is
Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The operative word in the first sentence of this column is
``beta,'' software industry lingo for work-in-progress.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, the beta version on my computer was replaced
by the final shipping version of Windows Me _ the one that will go
on sale in stores Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Woe begone. This one installed without a hitch, and unlike the
beta version, which froze on startup unless a second computer
connected to the Win Me computer was disconnected from it, the
final version had no problems with the network connection.
</P>
<P>
   Win Me promises faster start-up times, and that, too, has been
the case. Windows 98 used to take almost three minutes to load on
my jam-packed Nimbus 2001. Win Me has cut that loading time to 45
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The new operating system is being offered for $59.95 to users
upgrading from Windows 98 or Windows 98 Second Edition; the
introductory price is good through the middle of January.
</P>
<P>
   To recap some of the other features in Win Me:
</P>
<P>
   New shut-down options offer a sleep mode that powers down a
desktop computer but allows a quick resumption of work. A
hibernation mode saves work in progress to the hard drive, then
drops the system to its lowest power state.
</P>
<P>
   Easier networking. Many homes have two computers. Windows Me
makes the task of linking the two simpler. Both computers need not
be running Windows Me.
</P>
<P>
   Win Me's Movie Maker makes working with video clips much easier.
It can speed the process of creating videos to e-mail to friends
and family. It's also easier to work with digital cameras and
photographs than older Windows versions.
</P>
<P>
   Win Me's Media Player has been revamped, transforming music into
colorful dancing bars and circles. It also provides the useful
feature of creating and indexing high qualilty audio files.
</P>
<P>
   System Restore has been added, allowing users to turn back the
clock and reset the system and its files to a previous point in
time _ usually to a point to before when something stopped working
or a file was accidently erased. The restore program automatically
takes ``snapshots'' of the computer's hard drive and saves them, or
allows users to make them manually. Then, if a virus finds its way
into the machine, the user can back up a day or two before the
virus appeared and get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNET, the Internet arm of computer-magazine publisher Ziff
Davis, predicted in May that Windows Me ``will be a compelling
upgrade for most users.''
</P>
<P>
   It apparently won't have people standing in lines before the
doors open as the release of Windows 98 did. But the first time a
computer starts misbehaving, the System Restore function of Windows
Me may begin to have a magnetic appeal.

 &HT;    Vietnam sergeant was victim of Agent Orange
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Ind. _ When he was 18, Harold Johnson served his
country proudly in Vietnam as an infantry sergeant, only to be
exposed by his own government to a toxic chemical, Agent Orange,
that would kill him some 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Days before his death from lung cancer last week, Johnson, 51,
said he was no longer angry about what had happened to him in
Vietnam, when military personnel sprayed the potent herbicide
around his tent ``like it was Kool-Aid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm bitter, but I don't want to die hating anyone,'' he
said in a whisper. The ballooning tumor in his chest had all but
blocked his air passage. ``Probably I would have felt differently
if my religious beliefs hadn't grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was grateful that the Dayton VA had provided all
his care, free of charge, because his illness was 100 percent
service-connected.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton VA provides a full range of end-of-life services to
eligible veterans, at reduced or no cost, depending on their
eligibility. Its new patient tower includes a homey 36-bed unit for
both hospice and palliative care. Hospice care is for terminally
ill patients with a life expectancy of less than six months, while
palliative care is for patients expected to live more than six
months but less than five years.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before his death, Johnson was free of pain. He was
receiving regular doses of morphine and taking Tylenol laced with
codeine to help him sleep. But like many terminal patients, he was
so weak he couldn't walk or feed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take away the weakness completely, of course. What we
do is encourage patients to eat to the extent they can, and we try
to help them cope with it psychologically,'' said Dr. Geetika
Kumar, medical director of the VA hospice and palliative care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his lung cancer was diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago, one of
Johnson's lungs was removed, and he was treated with chemotherapy
and radiation, but it was too late, he said. More recently, the VA
arranged to send him to Cincinnati for a special laser treatment to
try to burn away the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten good medical care'' from the VA, Johnson said.
``Ninety percent of the people over there are really dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Each room in the VA hospice unit is equipped with a sofa bed for
family members who want to stay overnight. A family lounge includes
a TV room and kitchen stocked with food items requested by
patients. In addition, there is a hospitality house on the VA
grounds where family members can stay for $5 per night.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday afternoon, the unit throws a ``quality of life''
party for patients and their families in the lounge, which is
decorated for holidays and other themed events.
</P>
<P>
   Dying veterans who prefer to return home can receive community
hospice services, coordinated by the Dayton VA program. The VA also
will supply medical equipment to families, including a motorized
scooter for patients to get around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way they can spend their energy doing the things they
want to do'' rather than trying to walk, said Kathy Hayes,
coordinator of the VA hospice and palliative care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had spent eight weeks in the VA hospice unit before
returning home late last month. His two grown daughters, Christina
and Merrily, cared for him in his cozy frame cottage on the
outskirts of town. Behind the home is Johnson's beloved garden,
teeming with corn, squash, tomatoes, beans and pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   A community hospice agency in Richmond provided his nursing care
under Kumar's supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson died last week at his home, surrounded by his two grown
daughters and son. ``He died in his sleep. It was very peaceful,''
Hayes said..
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had counted on returning to the VA unit when his
condition worsened. ``I'm really glad there is a hospice unit. I
can go there if I really get bad,'' he said. ``I think they can
probably make me more comfortable there.''
</P>
<P>
   But by early Friday morning, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had said he was not afraid of dying. He just wanted to
go in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually looking forward to meeting the Lord,'' he said.

TOUGH MESSAGE FROM ANNAN OPENS U.N. ASSEMBLY DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Buoyed by support from world leaders last week
for policies that would take the United Nations in new directions,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan delivered a tough message Tuesday to
the opening session of this year's General Assembly debating
season.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly, with its delegations shaped by years of
evasive and sometimes obstructionist diplomacy, is more often than
not the wall where innovative ideas crash at the United Nations.
Annan made that clear in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Annan wants action on reorganizing and strengthening
the peacekeeping department and enlarging the Security Council to
give it more diversity and a stronger voice for the developing
nations. He wants the United Nations' limited money spent more
effectively and a staff chosen for their skills and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consensus is highly desirable, but it need not mean waiting
for absolute unanimity on every sub-clause among 189 member
states,'' he said. ``The minority, often a very small minority,
should not withhold its consent unreasonably. Whatever we think of
the veto in the Security Council, it surely has no place in this
assembly. We can no longer afford to operate always at the level of
the lowest, and slowest, common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's assembly session included a moment of welcome and a
speech of farewell. After years of anarchy, Somalia sent a
president, Abdikassim Salad Hassan. Djibouti's leader, President
Ismael Omar Guelleh, who organized talks that led to his election,
asked him to stand, and said, ``What a joy to see Somalia regain
its rightful place in the community of nations!''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had served as
ambassador to the United Nations for four years before her present
appointment, spoke in support of the organization and backed its
plans for stronger peacekeeping. Then, saying that this was
probably her last official speech here, she concluded with a
promise ``to serve the cause of international progress and
individual liberty not only for as long as I am in office but for
as long as I am alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Annan defended his growing links with
international business and a wide range of independent
organizations and agencies that are often considered gadflies by
governments. He said that neither governments nor the United
Nations can meet their goals alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the 20th century taught us anything,'' he said, it is that
large-scale, centralized government does not work. It does not work
at the national level, and it is less likely to work at the global
level.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Behind the scenes at least week's summit meeting of nearly 150
heads of government, and in separate sessions of Security Council
members, Annan picked up considerable backing for his efforts to
change the United Nations. He wants the lumbering organization to
be in step with a globalizing economy and quicker to react to
large-scale violations of human rights, even if it means
intervening in a nation's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He got public support on Tuesday from the European Union, in a
speech by Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France, which holds
the European Union presidency until the end of the year. Vedrine
catalogued the 60,000 troops and 5,000 police officers Europe hoped
to have ready by 2003 to send into international crises.
</P>
<P>
   At the International Peace Academy in New York, an independent
research organization that studies the United Nations, David
Malone, a Canadian diplomat and the academy president, said that
Annan had emerged from the summit meeting strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provides him with some momentum to overcome apathy and
parochial disputes among delegates, and inertia and misallocated
resources in the secretariat,'' he said. ``In a way he is
levitating above the whole organization, in the sense that he
manages the secretariat but he's doing much more than that. He's
successfully providing guidance to the organization that world
leaders have now endorsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone added: ``In theory, delegates should follow. In practice,
that's not a foregone conclusion. What he's been able to do is
develop a view of what the organization must do in years to come to
salvage and rebuild its credibility that is politically attractive
to leaders, but it requires compromises that diplomats will hate
and some in the secretariat will resist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The General Assembly is profoundly resistant to change,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's term of office has two years to run. Diplomats are
nearly unanimous in praising his steady hand over the last year _
in opening the United Nations to strong criticism of past
peacekeeping operations for the sake of salvaging its credibility,
in moving the organization into new activities to defend human
rights and in working in tandem with a global economic and
technological revolution.
</P>
<P>
   And many diplomats say that his leadership on these issues
already has assured him a second term if he wants one.

 &HT;    Hospice eases burdens for those who fall through government's
support network
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Although she had complained of pain in her
shoulders and back for half a year, Sandi Hughes wasn't diagnosed
with lung cancer until the disease had reached her brain and
paralyzed her legs.
</P>
<P>
   At age 43, and with two adolescent daughters in her sole care,
Hughes suddenly had no job and no family support system at a time
when she was facing a terminal disease.
</P>
<P>
   She called on her unemployed husband, from whom she had been
separated for six years. In May, he moved her from Alabama to his
home in Fairborn, where family members, especially Hughes'
15-year-old daughter, Jennifer, cared for her in a tiny, ramshackle
house.
</P>
<P>
   For hours at a time, Jennifer and her 12-year-old half-sister,
Stephanie, were alone in caring for their mother and, at times, had
no food in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Many poorer families can fall through the cracks of the
government's support network when a loved one is dying. While
Medicare or Medicaid will pay for most end-of-life services, a
physician must first certify that the terminally ill patient is
expected to live less than six months.
</P>
<P>
   Terminally ill patients under the age of 65 with a longer
prognosis must wait two years from the time they become disabled to
qualify for a Medicare card to pay their medical bills. And while
there is no waiting period for coverage through Medicaid _ the
state-federal program that pays the medical bills of the poor _
families who apply for disability coverage can wait weeks and even
months for their benefits to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it can be a race between the patient's declining
health and the speed of paperwork. In the case of Sandi Hughes,
Medicaid didn't begin paying her bills from Alabama until a day
after she had died.
</P>
<P>
   Doug McGarry, head of the Area Agency on Aging, an advocacy
group for the elderly, said the hardest hit patients are those
younger than 65 who have just enough assets to disqualify them for
Medicaid but who must somehow make ends meet during the two-year
wait for Medicare disability coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a terminal diagnosis,'' he said, ``do you have enough
time to spend down your assets'' to qualify for Medicaid?
</P>
<P>
   Without any home health coverage for her mother, Jennifer became
her primary caregiver for nearly a month this spring. She got her
mother up in the mornings, fed her, got her to the bathroom and
into bed again at night. When her mother would ask for a cigarette
in the middle of the night, Jennifer made sure she didn't burn
herself up in bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She kept saying how sorry she was that she had taken my
childhood away,'' Jennifer said. ``She was just really hard on
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can refer a family to hospice, but only a doctor can
approve their care in the program. In mid-June, Hughes finally was
seen by her husband's physician, who in turn certified her
admission to Hospice of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Hospice programs neither hasten nor postpone death. Their
mission is to keep patients free of pain and their quality of life
as high as possible, without hooking them to machines or isolating
them in hospitals. Hospice services include patient and family
counseling, specialized nursing and home health care and drugs and
supplies for pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   Hospice of Dayton not only took over Hughes' care but the care
of her family as well, making sure there were enough medical
supplies and food in the house. On her first visit, a hospice nurse
took Jennifer and Stephanie out for a rare treat _ a visit to
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nurse told us it was a reward for helping her out, but we
knew what it was all about,'' Jennifer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Baughman, a Hospice of Dayton social worker, referred the
family to the Emergency Food Bank and gave them a gift certificate
donated by Meijer supermarket. She even found a new home for the
family's dog, which they could no longer afford to take care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing I can say that is good enough'' for the
Hospice of Dayton staff, said Dee Harmeling, Sandi's mother and a
Bellbrook resident. ``They helped us out with anything, everything
we asked, no matter how small it was.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, Hughes was moved to the Hospice of Dayton inpatient
facility, where she could be made more comfortable in her final
days.
</P>
<P>
   Hospice of Dayton did not charge the family a penny, but it must
rely on community donations to extend its help. In 1999, the agency
provided $3 million in uncompensated care. Donations from local
businesses and individuals covered those costs. Almost all of the
2,600 patients and their families in the care of Hospice of Dayton
last year received some form of financial aid, since Medicare,
Medicaid and private insurers rarely pay the full cost of services.
</P>
<P>
   Worry over family finances and the fate of those left behind can
keep many dying people from letting go, Baughman said. Amazingly,
with cancer eating away at her brain, Hughes had remained lucid
until the last 10 days of her life. Within hours of her admission
to the hospice inpatient facility, her speech began to fail and
words escaped her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a marked change,'' said Pat Selter, a family member
who helped with Sandi's care. ``It was like she had held herself
together for all those months. I think she just needed to get
things settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer remembers the night her mother decided to let go. ``I
was just kind of sitting there watching TV in her room when I heard
her say something. At first she sort of rattled off something _ I
don't know what _ and then she just said, 'Goodbye.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the last lucid things she said,'' Harmeling
said.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Hughes was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman called her ``a fighter who wanted to take care of her
kids. And once she was able to do that, she was able to move on.''

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: News, notes from wrestling industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love is in the air all around professional wrestling circles.
</P>
<P>
   World Wrestling Federation commentator Jim Ross reports in his
weekly ``Ross Report'' that ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin will marry
Debra McMichael and
</P>
<P>
   Jerry ``The King'' Lawler will marry long-time girlfriend and
WWF valet The Kat this month.
</P>
<P>
   While real wedding bells are ring in the WWF, World Championship
Wrestling has its own wedding gone bad. On Monday ``Nitro,'' David
Flair was set to take Miss Hancock as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who are dating in real life, were set to tie an
imaginary knot when Flair's father Ric, who was making his first
appearance on television since May, was carted off by police for
violating a restraining order. The wedding started again and was
interrupted by Miss Hancock's disclosure that the baby she was
carrying was not David Flair's.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought Triple H and Stephanie had problems.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like Flair's saga will continue after this Sunday's
pay-per-view ``Fall Brawl'' and don't be surprised if Ric Flair is
the father.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last week's second straight pre-empted ``Raw is War'' show
allowed ``Nitro'' to get his highest ratings of the year. Despite
that ``Raw,'' which aired from
</P>
<P>
   11 p.m.-1 a.m. instead of its usual 9-11 p.m. slot because of
the U.S. Open tennis matches, still had a better rating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extreme Championship Wrestling announced that will be hold its
Dec. 3rd pay-per-view ``Massacre on 34th Street'' at the
Hammerstein Ballroom in New
</P>
<P>
   York City. Tickets will be available on Monday, Sept. 18 from
Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   _ Call it a case of reverse discrimination. While some women are
still battling for equal treatment, the men of the WCW Power Plant
are crying foul because of the special treatment the women seem to
be getting. WCW has sent most of its women valets and dancers to
the Power Plant to learn wrestling moves and get more involved in
storylines. So after a month at the Power Plant they are making
debuts on ``Nitro'' and ``Thunder.'' Meanwhile, some male wrestlers
will never make television even after years at the WCW training
facility.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just when you didn't think characters could get any lower
comes this. Mideon, who has been looking for a gimmick, may turn up
as ``Naked Man'' soon. Seems
</P>
<P>
   Perry Saturn suggested the gimmick after a backstage competition
between Mideon and Kurt Angle to see who could stay naked the
longest. Mideon won.
</P>
<P>
   _ For those looking for Raven to make his WWF debut, the wait
may end October. Ideas for his debut have been discussed, but no
decision has been made. One interesting move may be to bring him
back with injured Billy Gunn and reunite DX with XPac and Road
Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   _ The war between Paul Heyman of ECW and Rob Black of XFW
continues to escalate. In the October 2000 issue of World of
Wrestling magazine, there is a
</P>
<P>
   paid advertisement ``open letter'' by Black to Heyman addressing
the events at ``Heatwave 2000.'' Here's some of the highlights: ``I
really enjoyed Heatwave
</P>
<P>
   2000 on July 16. I humbly apologize for the events that
transpired. I'm also extremely sorry for using the name XTREME In
reference to our wrestling company. And then there is the apology
due for using Sabu and our allowing him a make a living in the
sport he helped revolutionize. I'm also sorry for all the
mean-spirited epithets hurled in your direction. Finally, if you're
willing to buy all that I've just said, you're more gullible than
everyone at XPW thought you were.''

CHASE MANHATTAN SAID TO BEIN TALKS TO ACQUIRE J.P. MORGAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated.) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan is in serious talks to acquire J.P Morgan, an
executive close to the deal said Tuesday. The deal, expected to be
worth at least $40 billion, would unite two of the oldest and most
powerful forces in New York finance.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the negotiations were not immediately available,
although the executive said an announcement could come as early as
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction would end the independence of J.P. Morgan, the
most famous name in the history of American finance. For Chase,
which has historically made smaller acquisitions, like its buyout
of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and Robert Fleming Holdings, the deal would
catapult the bank into the top echelon with Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Chase and J.P. Morgan declined to comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is part of a recent wave of consolidation in investment
banking, where size and diversity _ both in business lines and in
geography _ are becoming more and more necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The deal follows other large transactions like the Credit Suisse
Group acquisition last month to pay $13.4 billion in cash and stock
for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In July, UBS AG agreed to pay $16
billion for the Paine Webber Group.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan shares were trading $5-3/8 higher Tuesday at
$174-3/8, a 52-week high. The shares climbed to as high as $176
after opening at $169. J.P. Morgan had held talks with Deutsche
Bank, but those talks were abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Peter Hancock, J.P. Morgan's chief financial officer,
resigned abruptly, fueling merger speculation.

States, with an estimated population of around 31 million. Whether
this ridiculously overblown estimate is part of a calculated
misinformation campaign or merely the result of ignorance on the
part of demographers is beside the point _ because it is utterly
and completely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When the enlightened folks at the Census Bureau decided that it
was their right to label (or, more accurately, mislabel) people
according to racial heritage, they instituted a practice that many
in the Indigenous (''Native American'') community refer to as
demographic genocide. This is the act of erasing entire racial
groups by simply defining them out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Sound a little farfetched? Consider this: With a mere stroke of
the pen, government bureaucrats have managed to demographically
eliminate more Indigenous people than even the conquistadors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tactics employed by the Census Bureau certainly
differ from those of the Spaniards, the end result remains the
same. And if you happen to be of Native blood, there is something
truly sinister about a government agency telling you that your race
no longer exists by redefining you as white. (''Hispanic''
describes white Europeans who trace their roots to Spain.)
</P>
<P>
   If we take the supposed ``31 million Hispanics'' and bother to
classify these individuals in regards to their true racial
ancestry, heritage and culture, we find that it is the Indigenous
community _ not ``Hispanics'' _ that carries the greater numbers.
</P>
<P>
   A little simple mathematics will bear this out:
Chicano-Mexicanos make up 65 percent of the alleged 31 million
Hispanics, yet the ethnic background and cultural heritage of
Chicano-Mexicanos is overwhelmingly Indigenous and most definitely
not ``Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Our people are the Mexika, Maya, Chontal, Mixteka, Otomi,
Raramuri, Totonak, Yaqui, Apache, etc., and we deserve to be
recognized and respected for who we are.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 85 percent to 90 percent of the Mexican population is
of Native blood (the word ``Mexican'' itself is Indigenous _ not
Spanish). If we account for this, the Hispanic population drops
considerably, while the Indigenous population rises by around 17
million people.
</P>
<P>
   If we add to this number the 2.4 million ``American Indians''
already identified as living within the United States, the
Indigenous population soars to nearly 20 million people. Now that
is a powerful population base _ and a reality that the Census
Bureau would rather ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that this isn't even taking into account the
countless Central and South Americans who have been unjustly
mislabeled as Hispanics. Nor is it considering the many blacks and
Asians who are being misrepresented by the Hispanic label as well.
If we take all of these factors into consideration, I would venture
to guess that the actual Hispanic population in the United States
is far less than 5 million people _ if even that.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to counter the destructive practice of demographic
genocide, Indigenous scholar and University of California-Davis
professor Jack D. Forbes has recently called upon Chicano-Mexicanos
and Central Americans to identify themselves as Native people on
all future government documents _ including the recent 2000 Census.
By doing so, Native people can reclaim the right of
self-identification and proclaim to the world that our people are
still very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   If Chicano-Mexicanos and Central Americans wish to be involved
in a struggle that truly reflects our cultural heritage and values,
we should unite ourselves with other Indigenous nations rather than
seek acceptance through the assimilation-oriented ``Hispanic''
cause with its hollow goals and promises.
</P>
<P>
   By remaining silent and allowing a group of pencil-pushing
bureaucrats to wipe us out by redefining our very existence _ in
effect accomplishing what the Spaniards couldn't do in more than
300 years of slavery, rape and genocide _ we dishonor our ancestors
who bravely resisted European imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Ancestors such as Kuauhtemok, Pop, Tupak Amaru, Koatlawak,
Zapata and the many other warriors fought and died so that our
people would never have to submit _ so that we would never have to
call ourselves ``Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when violence against Chicano-Mexicanos is running
rampant, with law enforcement agencies and private citizens taking
turns hunting our people down like animals along the border, we
need to remember who we are and where we come from.
</P>
<P>
   So stand up and say it loud: I'm brown and I'm proud!

SAL SEVERE, PH.D., HAS A REMEDY FOR FAMILIES WITH DISCIPLINE
PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CATHERINE NEWTON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For someone whose chief claim to fame is being a discipline
expert, Sal Severe, Ph.D., has a fairly radical philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kids,'' says Severe. ``The thing that I learned by
working with parents is that they don't see things from a kid's
point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   This kids-just-wanna-be-good-and-understood concept is just half
of the platform on which Severe builds his discipline program. The
other half focuses on parents and their behavior. It's not about
what your kids are doing wrong, he says, but about what parents
should be doing right.
</P>
<P>
   Severe developed his theories working with kids for 25 years as
a school psychologist, most recently as clinical director at an
alternative school (read: major behavior problems) in Phoenix,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about relationships,'' says Severe. ``Having good
relationships is the most important thing in life. It's about
enjoying your kids _ how to enjoy being a parent. Love is not
enough. Common sense is not enough. It's a different world today,
and parents need techniques to manage their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Severe _ a parent himself _ has assembled these techniques into
a book. ``How to Behave So Your Children Will, Too'' was originally
self-published, then picked up by Viking editors in 1997, who asked
him to add chapters on violence and children. The book has been
re-released this year, and Severe is on a nationwide tour promoting
it.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas in the book are certainly compelling. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Establish a pleasant family climate where children learn your
values and goals, and children are motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Humor can redirect the family climate.
</P>
<P>
   If you want self-disciplined children, you need to be
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Guilt, anger, stress, fear and anxiety are self-defeating and
interfere with successful parenting; you can control these emotions
and how you feel.
</P>
<P>
   Anger and punishment do not mix.
</P>
<P>
   Specific topics include everything from spanking (he argues that
it does more harm than good) and timeout (OK, he says, if only a
small part of a total plan to improve your child's behavior) to
sibling squabbling (above all, stay calm and do not make threats),
homework hassles (he offers an incentive system for motivation) and
the distress of divorce (the greater the harmony between parents,
the better the adjustment for the child). This is just the
beginning. The book offers in-depth parenting strategies, including
charts, checklists and sample dialogues.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, on paper _ and in the audiotapes and videotapes
that form a part of Severe's multimedia offerings _ it all sounds
good.
</P>
<P>
   But can parenting be so darn refreshingly enjoyable in the real
world? I, a parent, had an hour with the good doctor while he was
in Fort Worth _ and I, not surprisingly, had some questions.
</P>
<P>
   Like this one: Let's say you have a son. He's almost 6. He's an
only child and lately he's been saying he's bored. And he's whiny.
Very whiny. Do you feel guilty and find something for him to do?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not, says Severe. ``You don't want to bend over
backward too far for your child. And you shouldn't feel guilty.
Don't think, `I have to be the one to make him happy.' Instead,
turn the situation around and tell your child, `It's up to you to
pick an activity. If you are bored, it's your problem, not mine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whining, not surprisingly, is a continuing theme in Severe's
book. Ignore it, he writes. ``When you ignore consistently, you
will teach your child that these misbehaviors are not paid off with
attention. Do not forget to redirect. Teach children appropriate
ways to get attention. Say `My ears do not listen to whining.
Please ask in a soft voice.'''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it unkind to ignore your child, I ask Severe,
picturing this mother turning her back on the little boy.
</P>
<P>
   No. Not in this case, Severe says. You'll teach him to have his
own power to solve his problems.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean we shouldn't drop what we're doing to entertain
our kids, I ask, glad to have the personal reprieve from the
Mommy-come-play-with-me syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not so easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting your kids first means spending time with them,''
Severe says. ``You have to make that extra effort to sit down and
play, to do something with your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   What about all the time we spend shuttling them back and forth
between their soccer and baseball games and afterschool activities?
Doesn't that show we're making them a priority?
</P>
<P>
   That's OK, says Severe. But playing catch with them is good,
too. Better.
</P>
<P>
   On to real-world dilemma No. 2: Kids who fight. An older boy who
is constantly attacking his little sister, making her cry. This is
making the mom crazy, and it's worse because she knows it only
happens when she's around. Her friends tell her that her son is
actually quite kind to his sister at school. They see him walking
her to her class, carrying her backpack.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   What does she do?
</P>
<P>
   Talk to her son, says Severe. ``I'm a real believer in private
meetings, one-on-one with your child. Tell him, `You don't do this
when I'm not around. You're older. I expect more from you. You can
do better than that. Then, any time he shows a smidgen of better
behavior, praise him.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, he says, it's about teaching your child about his own
power. Power to make decisions, control his life, pick up his toys
and put his laundry in the hamper.
</P>
<P>
   There's a difference between compliance and cooperation, Severe
says. Compliance means your children have to do what you say or
you're gonna punish them. Cooperation means they behave because
it's the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a loftier goal. A question of conscience. They learn to
take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, he reminds me, it's about relationships. About what he
calls a positive family climate.
</P>
<P>
   We go through several more examples, and pretty soon, I can't
stand it. Severe is so reasonable, so understanding, so sure that
he's right that I tell him about my lowest moment of parenting _
one that two years later still makes me feel like I'm drowning in
guilt. We were on a class field trip in Austin and my picky
vegetarian third-grader refused to eat either of the sandwiches in
the box lunches provided. There was jelly touching the peanut
butter. The turkey had touched the cheese and covered it in meat
juice. Every other child was happily munching. Mine was silently,
stubbornly protesting. I felt like a complete parental loser in
front of all my friends. And I took it out on my son _ and called
him a freak.
</P>
<P>
   Severe looks sympathetic. And he's got an answer. If it happens
again: Offer both sandwiches and explain that it's my son's choice.
Tell him that if he doesn't eat something, he'll be hungry later
on. And if he still doesn't take a sandwich, don't worry about it.
He'll have learned something.
</P>
<P>
   One of Severe's children is a picky eater, too. He says the key
is to get the child to take responsibility for his choices. If he's
a vegetarian, respect his point of view _ but tell him he'll have
to take care of himself. If he goes on a field trip, he should pack
his own special lunch. Have him make a list of what he wants when
you go grocery shopping every week, Severe says. Have him help fix
any special dinners he wants if the rest of the family is eating
meat.
</P>
<P>
   My son doesn't have to change who he is, says Severe. But he
does need to empower himself. And you, Severe tells me, you need to
give up feeling guilty _ and learn to judge yourself on your
intentions. It's the perfect apple story, says Severe, referring to
an anecdote from his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children are a measure of our success and worthiness. We
compare ourselves to other parents and compare our children to
other children.'' Just as we buy apples by holding them up to the
light, squeezing each one, looking for perfection, we as parents
want perfect apples: ``We want successful children, happy and well
adjusted. We want them to feel good about themselves. We want
children who are loving and respectful of others, well-behaved and
self-motivated. ... All parents have the same goals and
aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofty goals, indeed. Who doesn't want a happy, well-behaved
child?
</P>
<P>
   And Severe, radical though it may seem, has a loving _ and
reasonable _ plan for getting there.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Power vs. authority
</P>
<P>
   Sal Severe notes that a pleasant family climate depends on
parents exercising authority _ not power. What's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Authority
</P>
<P>
   Emphasize cooperation,
</P>
<P>
   Stay rational,
</P>
<P>
   Keep your self-control;
</P>
<P>
   Stop and think;
</P>
<P>
   Be proactive,
</P>
<P>
   Relate consequences to behavior and choices;
</P>
<P>
   Remain child-centered,
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Power
</P>
<P>
   not control.
</P>
<P>
   not emotional.
</P>
<P>
   do not get angry.
</P>
<P>
   do not act impulsively.
</P>
<P>
   not reactive.
</P>
<P>
   do not give ultimatums.
</P>
<P>
   not self-centered.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   How well do you know your child?
</P>
<P>
   One of the key tenets of Severe's philosophy is that parents
need to see things from their child's point of view. This includes
knowing what your child is thinking about and what his or her
interests are. Severe suggests answering each of the questions
below the way you think your child would answer them. When you are
finished, have your child answer the questions. Compare answers.

PUTTING THAT KICK BACK INTO SALSA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For decades in this country, the most beloved
condiment was ketchup, bottled ketchup. But the American palate
woke up, and a great national craving for a spicy Mexican sauce
took hold, and ultimately it supplanted ketchup in many homes.
</P>
<P>
   It was salsa. But lately it, too, has come perilously close to
the commonplace _ bottled and consistent and without much variety.
The fact is, though, that even if you limit yourself to Mexico for
inspiration _ and ignore Spain or even Sicily _ the salsas from
Mexico's regions are too numerous to count, bursting with invention
and surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs across the country have continued to take salsa to new
levels, and their ideas are easy to adapt to the home kitchen. By
preparing just a few of these widely different salsas (the Spanish
word simply means sauce), you can get a sense of the breathtaking
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   There's the familiar tomato salsa, with tomato, onion, chile and
cilantro. Less familiar is the salsa verde, with its tomatillo
base. But a great salsa doesn't have to have tomatoes in it, or
even chilies. Some are cooked, some aren't. Some reach for
combinations that you've probably never experienced before, like
black beans and peaches or toasted almonds and fresh herbs. One
thing all salsas have is bite, and they have the remarkable
capacity to breathe life into the simplest grilled fish or meat
dish.
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing: For the most part, they are much easier to
prepare than they seem. To me, salsas are especially appealing when
they are made from uncooked ingredients. The basis of most raw
salsas is a chopped, pounded or nearly pureed vegetable, herb or
fruit, made superflavorful by the addition of some combination of
onion, garlic, lime or lemon juice. Many also incorporate more than
one herb, shallots, spices and, of course, chilies. The best
combinations are quite moist _ so if tomato or a juicy fruit is not
one of the basic ingredients, a great deal of citrus juice usually
makes up for it. Salsas are thin-textured and informal, but they
are fresh, colorful and beautiful on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs understand these things, and are always experimenting:
There are only so many ways you can grill a piece of fish, meat or
chicken, but the salsas you can serve them with are unlimited. In
some ways, asking a chef which salsa to serve with which dish is an
exercise in futility, not unlike asking the short-order cook which
dish to serve with ketchup. (The short answer: Almost anything.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, chefs do tend to serve salsas and other strong sauces
with grilled food, and that's a good guideline: When even a mild
meat or fish is well browned, it gains enough backbone to support a
spicy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Raw salsas retain the strong, bold flavors of their basic
components, especially garlic and chilies. And because these
flavors can sometimes be overpowering, many chefs make salsas with
roasted chilies. ``I hardly do any salsas that are completely
uncooked,'' said Rick Bayless, the chef and owner of Frontera Grill
in Chicago. Roasting tames the heat of many chilies, and brings out
more subtle flavors. But Bayless has his no-cook salsa, too: A
tomato-fruit version that features uncooked habaneros, the fiery,
complex little pepper also known as Scotch bonnet.
</P>
<P>
   Chipotles (smoked jalapenos) also need no roasting, since
they've already been mellowed by smoke. ``And,'' said Mark Miller,
the chef and owner of Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., ``if you buy
canned chipotles in adobo, you already have the added flavors of
tomato and vinegar, so you're halfway to making a great-tasting
salsa already.'' Miller combines a puree of chipotle in adobo with
fresh fruit to make a salsa for grilled or roasted pork or
dark-fleshed fish.
</P>
<P>
   Zarela Martinez, the chef and owner of Zarela's in Manhattan,
reminded me that one of the most basic and important salsas, chile
pastor _ a thin sauce that is not unlike a coarse pesto _ is an
uncooked blend of chilies, lime, onions and herbs. Her green sauce
with avocado combines jalapeno, tomatillos and avocado for a kind
of light, spicy guacamole that is a good dip or sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh, raw salsa can, of course, be made with no chilies at all.
A good example of this is one created by Susanne Goin at Lucques in
West Hollywood, Calif. ``I start with a basic chopped salsa
verde,'' she said, ``and add either almonds, which makes it perfect
for grilled fish, or shards of feta, which I like to serve with
chunks of skewered and grilled lamb. You can also add hard-cooked
egg to the sauce and use it for salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing about salsa. Once you get started, there's
almost no limit to what you can put together with no cooking at
all.

DONALD WHYTE, 68, VIOLINIST WITH NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Ohio, Pa., Canada)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donald Whyte, a violinist in the New York
Philharmonic, died on Sunday at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in
Manhattan. He was 68 and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications after surgery, said Eric Latzky, a
spokesman for the Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte was born in Rivers, Manitoba, in 1942, and began his
violin studies with his father, Alexander Whyte. He continued his
studies at the University of Saskatchewan and later as a student of
Josef Gingold at Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte was a member of the Cincinnati Symphony, the Montreal
Symphony and the Pittsburgh Symphony before joining the New York
Philharmonic in 1972. As a member of the orchestra, he was a
representative at the International Conference of Symphony and
Opera Musicians, an organization that monitors everything from
compensation to performance conditions at the major orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a board member of the Music Assistance Fund, which
provides support for young minority musicians. He was chairman of
the Philharmonic's artistic committee, which is involved in the
search for a new music director for the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work with the Philharmonic, Whyte played
recitals with his wife, Noriko Kitamura, a pianist, and played
chamber music with several ensembles, including the Gofriller
Quartet and the Soho Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife &UR; , &LR;  and a daughter, Lianne McKenzie,
of Calgary, Alberta.

BETSEY JOHNSON PUTS   BUNNIES ON THE CATWALK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CATHY HORYN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I just wanted sexy, girlish, voluptuous, Marilyn
Monroe and Brigitte Bardot, but with a sense of what's happening
now,'' Betsey Johnson said, her eyes popping open. ``And I thought:
playmates.''
</P>
<P>
   There is hardly a more legitimate hook for an American fashion
show than 30 Playboy bunnies. After all, what is a bunny if not the
girl next door (or at least the fantasy version of her)?
</P>
<P>
   How many people, in or out of the fashion world, can possibly
hope to identify with a 6-foot supermodel who looks as if she rises
every morning from the flatbed of a shirt press and starts walking?
</P>
<P>
   They can't, and that's where Suzanne Stokes of Everglades City,
Fla., comes in. Ms. Stokes speaks as if she were raised among
kittens. She is blond and adorable, and for specifics one can turn
to the February 2000 issue of Playboy, where Ms. Stokes was the
playmate of the month.
</P>
<P>
   How she got her job is not complicated. ``You just take off your
clothes, and they take pictures of you,'' she said. But Stokes and
her sister bunnies, seven of whom gathered last week in Johnson's
studio at 498 Seventh Avenue for fittings, know that it takes more
than decolletage to be a bunny, although it helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be friendly,'' Stokes purred.
</P>
<P>
   As Stokes ambled off to try on something pretty, Ava Fabian, the
August 1986 playmate, took a few turns in her dress, a strapless,
full-skirted number in a cotton print, which Fabian said reminded
her of the flirty styles one used to see on ``Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Johnson's new spring looks, which will be shown Sept. 19
at 7 p.m. in Bryant Park, have a nostalgic ring. But, then, what
are Playboy bunnies for if not to push a few buttons?

SEEKING THE RIGHT CHILD CARE FORMULA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In October, Marriott International will fire its second salvo in
the nation's work-family conflict, opening a $2.5 million,
120-place day care center in a refitted historic building in
downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The company's first assault on employee child care problems _ a
24-hour day care center in Atlanta _ promised much when it opened
in 1997 but delivered disappointing results. Now Marriott, having
analyzed what went wrong, is prepared to try again, offering not
just a refined version of company-sponsored child care but also
insights for the many Americans who have wondered why, in one of
the world's richest countries, it is so hard for companies to offer
decent, affordable places for employees to put their children.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 10 percent of American businesses offer some form of
child care assistance to employees, said Faith Wohl, president of
the Child Care Action Campaign, and the assistance is usually
limited to discounts and referral services. Nationwide, parents
currently pay 60 cents of every dollar of child care, she added,
while governments at all levels pay 39 cents, and the private
sector _ both companies and tax-exempt philanthropies _ pays just a
penny.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott, one of the few companies to experiment with child care
on site, began monitoring the work-family travails of its staff
early on. Almost 85 percent of its employees are wage earners who
push room-service carts, haul luggage or answer phones deep into
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Years before the current labor shortage made child care a
hot-button workplace issue, Marriott discovered that these hourly
employees were so overwhelmed with family chores that supervisors
were essentially spending 25 to 50 percent of their time on social
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were doing everything from finding subsidized child care
to driving people to doctors' appointments,'' said Donna Klein,
Marriott's vice president for diversity and workplace
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott was not dying to be in the day care business, she
added, but its managers knew that if they ignored staff problems,
they could badly tarnish the chain's reputation for customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Marriott sought a solution on the supply side:
if working parents could not find day care, the thinking went, it
must be because there were not enough places. So Marriott would
build its own center, employees would put an end to jury-rigged
dealings with aunties and grannies and women down the street, and
productivity would surge.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Marriott's two downtown hotels, the Marriott Marquis
and the Marriott Suites Midtown, formed a nonprofit partnership
with two other hotels in the neighborhood and floated bonds to
finance construction of a day care center.
</P>
<P>
   And not just any day care center. The Inn for Children, as the
center was named, was to offer not only around-the-clock child care
and early-learning programs, but a full range of social services as
well: nutrition counseling, family-crisis referrals, dental
screenings, a pediatric infirmary, credit counseling and even
mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   On opening day, Atlanta's mayor cut a chain of paper dolls, and
the local news media pronounced an end to the lodging industry's
child care crisis. And then, to everyone's dismay, the children did
not come.
</P>
<P>
   The cost was a big reason. To cover the interest on its
construction bonds, the hotel partnership charged $110 to $135 for
a 50-hour week of child care, depending on the child's age. That
may have been on a par with other licensed centers in Atlanta, but
it was out of the question for the wage-earning families the hotels
wanted to assist. ``If you're making $25,000 a year, that's 25
percent of your income,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   The hotels had expected the workers to make use of scholarships
and state financial assistance to reduce their costs to as little
as $25 a week. What they did not realize was that the wage earners'
hectic lives left them little time to line up the aid.
</P>
<P>
   Employees working day shifts could not go across town to submit
applications during business hours. Some did not have cars. Recent
immigrants lacked required documents and could not read forms
printed in English. And some employees had an aversion to going
near any government office.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with running this gantlet, most employees stuck with the
woman down the street.
</P>
<P>
   With slots going empty and debts to pay, the hotel partners
opened the center to the children of nonemployees. Today, of the
250 mostly low-income children finger-painting and eating peanut
butter sandwiches at the Inn for Children, only 25 are children of
Marriott employees.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in all this? The day care problem is not one of
supply, but affordability, Klein said. If a company charges fees
high enough to cover the cost, many employees will not be able to
afford the service.
</P>
<P>
   So Marriott is using a different model for its Washington
center. Instead of linking with peers from the private sector, it
joined forces with the General Services Administration, which has
operated day care centers since 1985, and the city of Washington.
Instead of floating bonds, Marriott and the GSA split $1.3 million
in capital costs 50-50, and Washington granted $1 million to pay
rent for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The partners also lined up grants and scholarships from
foundations and local businesses, so low-income families would not
have to maneuver the state-aid bureaucracy. Community groups and
Washington law firms offered pro bono legal work and managerial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, no one is saying the center will put an end to
all employee child care woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could get, maybe, 30 Marriott children out of 120
places, we'd definitely look at it as a success,'' Klein said,
noting that the chain has three hotels within a four-block radius
of the center, with about 800 hourly workers. Government employees'
children are expected to fill most of the other openings.
</P>
<P>
   But if the project succeeds, she said, it will be duplicated in
other cities where Marriott has hotels, the federal government has
employees and municipal financing is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, we thought, `Oh, we can make a huge
difference,''' Klein said. ``But now, we realize that this is a
systemic issue, which has to be solved, certainly, with business as
a key player, but with public-policy involvement as well.''

COMMENTARY: BETTER A RATTY CAMPAIGN THAN A MOUSY ONE

<P>
   (UNDATED) Every time this dull campaign threatens to get fun, it
gets boring again. Latest outrage: An ad produced for the George
Bush campaign appears to flash the word ``RATS'' when discussing
how bureaucrats would flourish under the Al Gore-Joe Lieberman
health care plan. How ... diabolical. They associate bureaucrats
with RATS, thereby dispelling the warm feeling of love most
Americans have for government functionaries.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably an editing mistake, a stray frame. Too bad. It
should have been intentional. We need crueler ads to liven up the
race. Enough of these earnest, warm-voiced dispatches from the
Blandlands -- this campaign needs a series of ads that open wounds
and dump on the salt. It wouldn't change anyone's mind; it might
not move the polls a jot. But it's part of the modern automated
campaign:
</P>
<P>
   1. Candidates pledge to take the high road. Translation:
puppies-and-flags commercials until Labor Day, and then we accuse
the other guy of decapitating nuns and using their skulls in a
white-power skeet-shooting competition.
</P>
<P>
   2. Half the pundit corps tut-tuts when someone goes negative,
but only if the spots land body blows on their man. Witness the
reaction to Bush's first unspeakably negative ad. The spot plays
Gore's I-begat-the-Internet quote, points out the ethical brouhaha
over the Buddhist Temple fund-raiser, and suggests that you just
can't trust Al. From the reaction of the press, you'd think Bush
had accused Gore of doing and saying WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HE DID AND
SAID. Has he no shame?
</P>
<P>
   3. The rest of the punditry -- the older, saturnine half that's
seen it all and just hangs on for the expense-account suppers --
will point out that campaigns used to be much, much worse. Why, in
1804, Lucius Zachary Throckstrochen called his Senate race opponent
``a trebly-curs'd Masonic whoretaster,'' prompting his opponent to
reply that Lucius had ``the morals of an vaporous ibex and the low
cunning of a popish rooster. Also, he's gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they could really sling the dirt in those days. No one knew
what they were talking about, but they got the general idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bush needs to vault over the heads of the press; he needs to
learn to spin small truths into big lies, Democrat-style. He needs
some cruel ads that take a two-by-four to Gore's brainpan. A
suggested spot:
</P>
<P>
   Black-and-white footage of a civil rights march. Sonorous, sad
voiceover:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long struggle for equality. But it's not over yet
-- not as long as Al Gore opposes innovation in education. He
doesn't want black children to use vouchers so they can attend the
same schools as his children. He doesn't want Social Security
reform -- and since black men die earlier than whites, this means
most of their contributions stay with the government instead of
going to their children. That's right: Al Gore would take money
from dead black dads and use it to subsidize cotton-farm owners in
the Deep South. But what else would you expect from a man whose own
father voted against civil rights for blacks? Al Gore: Smart guy.
Too bad he wants to keep black people down.''
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine the shouts of outrage. But if the shoe fits in
your opponent's buttocks, start kicking. Gore is the candidate of
the teachers' unions, not the students. He's the candidate of the
government unions -- and when you're more concerned about the
people who hand out the welfare, you're less concerned with the
welfare of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Ad No. 2: The environment. Film of gas lines. Voiceover:
``Remember the days of energy shortages? Cheap, flimsy cars? A
collapse of national strength and will? Al Gore does. And he wants
them back again. Due to his environmental beliefs'' (Cut to film of
naked hippies dancing around a tree) ``we've stopped drilling for
oil in America. Gore wants you out of your safe SUVs and into small
tin cars, because he worships dirt instead of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous, of course. Unspeakably wrong. But why can the Dems
associate GOP votes with a vote for church-burning -- or, as Gore
has said, equate their water policies with DEATH? This is war; this
is a fight to the end. But of course the soccer-mom demographic
hates it when the two parties fight, so we'll never see good
negative ads. Rats.
</P>
<P>
   Or, rather, medium-level government officials.

VOLUNTEERS IN WHITE COLLARS WITH POLITICAL STRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ore., Conn., Texas)   By JOBERT E. ABUEVA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every Thursday evening, Marilyn Robinson, executive director of
the Nashville Minority Business Center, drives from her office to
the Gore-Lieberman campaign headquarters and works the phones for
three hours, canvassing voters throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what I do at work is persuading others to fund and
support our various programs. It's no different with potential
voters,'' said Robinson, who also puts in a Saturday morning shift
at Gore headquarters. ``I like that I bring what I do best, selling
and speaking, into the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   And those aren't the only management skills she taps into. She
also enlists help from her network of friends and business
associates, including members of 100 Black Women, a local social
group.
</P>
<P>
   For all the frenzied fund-raising by Democrats and Republicans
this year, candidates for offices from the the White House to the
local school board know one thing is even more important than
money: volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   And while these unpaid armies are made up mostly of students and
retired people, it is business professionals who exhibit the
qualities that political candidates value most: nuts-and-bolts
organizational skills, management savvy and address books crammed
with contacts.
</P>
<P>
   To campaign managers, these executives are golden because they
can get things done. Consider Jose Forquet, a 34-year-old vice
president at Goldman, Sachs in New York, and Joe Bogosian, a
35-year-old lawyer at McGuire Woods Consulting in Washington. A
couple of years ago, Forquet, an independent, and Bogosian, a
Republican, each had a plan to promote George W. Bush for president
by creating advocacy groups _ of Hispanic executives in Forquet's
case, and of young professionals in Bogosian's.
</P>
<P>
   But then the men were introduced to each other in late 1998 by a
mutual friend who knew of their political activism, and before long
they had developed a more ambitious project. Working with a Bush
campaign official, they drafted a proposal for creating an e-mail
database to recruit corporate managers, lawyers and other young
professionals to take part in fund-raisers and other activities for
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, they traveled at their own expense to Bush's
campaign headquarters in Austin, Texas, to seek its official
endorsement. ``The exact same skills required of selling a start-up
firm to venture capitalists applied'' in winning over the Bush camp
to the idea, Bogosian said.
</P>
<P>
   They got the green light, and YP4W.com _ or Young Professionals
for George W. Bush _ was born, along with a national networking
organization of the same name with chapters in 30 cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from our research that there were many people out
there like us,'' Forquet said. ``A market clearly existed.''
</P>
<P>
   The site was so successful, in fact, that the Bush campaign took
it over and now runs it out of Austin as part of a coalition of Web
sites and voter groups. Forquet and Bogosian continue to head the
New York and Washington chapters of the networking organization.
</P>
<P>
   While few managers can boast of such influence on a national
scale, most can have a big impact on the state or local level.
Laura Dambier, a senior strategist for Lincoln Financial Group in
Hartford, Conn., for example, has no doubts that she is making a
difference in the re-election effort of state Rep. Jessie Stratton,
a Democrat. Dambier spent the greater part of Labor Day assigning
volunteers to task forces and revising calendars for the final
stretch of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely draw from a wide repertoire of skills,'' Dambier
said. She has been active in numerous political races in the past,
she said, and the two biggest tasks in almost every case were the
same ones that corporate managers face every day: setting
priorities and motivating people.
</P>
<P>
   `As you enter the final, crucial weeks, volunteers may begin to
lose interest and therefore need to be refocused on the mission of
our campaign beyond simply garnering votes,'' she said. ``In some
cases, you might reassign duties.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing presence of business professionals is not lost on
campaign managers and indeed presents them with something of a
challenge. ``Working volunteers come into a campaign motivated but
are extremely busy people themselves. They want their investment in
time and effort to pay off,'' said Catherine Shaw, the Democratic
mayor of Ashland, Ore., and the author of a how-to book on
conducting local campaigns. ``Campaign managers need to know what
competencies and connections they bring to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate her point, Shaw described how a volunteer, a
manager in the hospitality industry, recently pulled disparate
databases and segmented voters for follow-up direct-marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even political neophytes have high expectations of themselves if
they have a business background. Rochelle Pachtman, founder of the
public relations firm Pachtman Communications in Manhattan, says
she jumped into the fray just a few weeks ago to lend a hand to the
Gore campaign because the race was so tight and she thought she
might actually make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for my marching orders,'' Pachtman said. When she
gets them, she says, she believes she will be able to leverage her
communications skills as well as tap into her expertise in the

 &HT;    D-RATS! SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE RAISES RUCKUS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A GOP TV ad that subtly flashes the word ```RATS'' across the
screen is coming off the air amid allegations the Republicans were
trying to send a subliminal message about Al Gore. George W. Bush
called the notion ``bizarre and weird,'' and his campaign made
light of it all. The Republican admaker, Alex Castellanos, said he
was just trying to make the spot visually interesting. But Gore's
campaign and experts in political advertising said the choice of
words _ as an announcer was denouncing Gore's Medicare plan _ could
hardly have been an accident. ``I've never seen anything like it,''
Gore said Tuesday in Middletown, Ohio. Bush noted that the word
appears only fleetingly _ for a tiny fraction of a second. Played
at full speed, it's barely noticeable, particularly if the viewer
isn't looking for the word.

   FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL IN FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, campaigning in Florida _ no longer a sure-win
state for him _ was trying to reassure seniors Tuesday that his
health proposals would expand the choices under Medicare. With his
new, more personal campaign style on display, Bush greeted the
breakfast crowd at a diner in West Palm Beach, telling patrons his
plan would ``leave the Medicare system in place . . . but offer
additional choices for seniors beyond the current system,
additional choices just like federal employees get.'' Later, at
Florida Hospital in Orlando, Bush said Medicare has failed to
sufficiently cover new treatments and to give doctors the options
they need to care for cancer patients. And he promised a cancer
patient that he will expand Medicare coverage for her and millions
of other older Americans suffering from budget-busting illnesses.

<P>
   BUCHANAN GETS MONEY NOD FROM FEC
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission decided that the Reform Party's
disputed $12.6 million in federal campaign money belongs to Pat
Buchanan. The FEC's 5-1 ruling said Buchanan is the rightful
recipient of the money as the party's nominee. But Buchanan, who is
counting on the money to revive his presidential campaign, can't
get the money yet. The commissioners are expected to give their
final approval within days, theoretically freeing the U.S. Treasury
to give Buchanan a check. However, John Hagelin, who contends that
he, not Buchanan, is the party's legitimate nominee, intends to
appeal to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   BUSING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
</P>
<P>
   Apparently worried that George W. Bush may be making inroads on
the education issue, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman rumbled across
southern Ohio in separate yellow school buses Tuesday, letting
their limos trail behind, to promote the $170 billion they would
pour into education. They conceded there are ``some similarities''
between their education proposals and Bush's, but promoted their
ideas as far more sweeping. ``What we're proposing is a
comprehensive approach that focuses on the classroom,'' Gore told
middle school students in Miamisburg. ``The difference is we start
with accountability; we don't end with accountability.'' Gore and
Lieberman then headed to a Middletown high school.
</P>
<P>
   WELL, THEY LIKED HIM SIX YEARS AGO, DIDN'T THEY?
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware News Journal and Gov. Tom Carper both want Sen.
William Roth (R-Del.) to pull a TV ad featuring an endorsement of
Roth by the newspaper. Roth spokeswoman Jo Anne Barnhart called the
complaints ``ridiculous,'' saying it's common practice to use
articles and editorials in political ads. The only problem is that
campaigns usually use recent endorsements. This one was from 1994,
when Roth was running against state Attorney General Charles
Oberly. This time, Roth is running against Carper, and the
newspaper has made no endorsement.

<P>
   CLINTON THE NEW YORKER VOTES FOR WIFE
</P>
<P>
   Putting their political role reversal in high relief, President
Clinton cast his first vote as a New Yorker Tuesday, pronouncing it
``a thrill'' to vote for his wife. Hillary Clinton was facing the
little-known Dr. Mark McMahon in the New York Democratic primary.
``After all these years of her helping me, it was a thrill,''
Clinton said after early morning balloting at an elementary school
in Chappaqua, his newly adopted hometown. The Clintons bought a
home there last year when the first lady began her Senate campaign
in earnest. Her Senate opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, did not face a
primary challenge.
</P>
<P>
   CONTROVERSIAL JEWISH HONOR TO HILLARY CLINTON
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of her first primary election, Hillary Clinton
collected a controversial award from the World Jewish Congress for
setting up a meeting between her husband and Edgar Bronfman, the
head of the organization, and for work on restitution for Holocaust
victims. Some critics have questioned whether the award is
appropriate, given that Bronfman is an adviser to her campaign and
Jews make up a crucial voting bloc in the Senate race. The campaign
of Clinton's opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, has pointed out that he,
too, played a role in restitution efforts by introducing a bill
that extended the life of a presidential commission investigating
what happened to Holocaust victims' assets that came into American
hands.
</P>
<P>
   GIULIANI CRITICIZES LAZIO ON ARAFAT
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani says it was a mistake for Rick
Lazio to have enthusiastically shaken the hand of Yasser Arafat
during an official visit to the Middle East nearly two years ago.
``I'm a little confounded by it,'' said Giuliani. ``I don't
particularly like to shake hands with murderers.'' But the mayor
also said that Lazio's handshake was ``not a big deal'' and that
maybe he ``doesn't have the background and understanding of Arafat
that I do.'' Giuliani's remarks about his fellow Republican, who
replaced him in the Senate race against Hillary Clinton, were not
well received by Lazio's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   LAMBEAU FIELD VOTE AT GOAL LINE
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay's long love affair with the Packers was being tested
in Wisconsin, with tens of thousands of voters going to the polls
to decide whether to increase the county sales tax to help pay to
expand and remodel Lambeau Field. On the eve of the referendum, the
vote was regarded as too close to call _ with backers of the
proposal engaged in what amounted to a football two-minute drill
and opponents playing rugged defense. Voters were deciding whether
to raise the Brown County sales tax a half-percent to repay $160
million in construction loans, the cornerstone of a $295 million
project to renovate Lambeau Field, the city-owned home of the
Packers.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-CONTROLLED ESTATE INVOLVED IN LAWSUIT
</P>
<P>
   A $48 million estate controlled by Joe Lieberman evicted a woman
from one of its buildings, then reversed course when she sued him
and alleged she lost her job because she was injured when falling
on the property. Monica E. Beach, 58, continues to live rent free
in the building in Stamford, Conn., until the legal dispute is
settled. A trial is slated for February. Beach was evicted by court
order in April 1997 for not paying rent in a multifamily building
owned by the estate of Lieberman's uncle, Bernard Manger, who died
in May 1995. Beach filed a personal injury lawsuit in April 1997
against Lieberman and his co-executor, Harold Bernstein. Instead of
forcing Beach from her apartment, the estate and its insurance
company responded by letting her stay and agreeing to take rent she
owes out of any eventual settlement.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS: FOR NOW, A TOSS-UP
</P>
<P>
   Four new national polls _ those for Time, Fox News, CNN/USA
Today and NBC/Wall Street Journal _ showed little change in the
presidential race since Al Gore closed the gap with George W. Bush
after the Democratic convention. None of the polls has Gore ahead
by more than three points, about the same spread that many surveys
released a week earlier showed. So with about eight weeks until
Election Day, the race appears to be a toss-up _ at least for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   CONTINUING ROLE FOR GREENS
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader says that he and his Green Party backers will remain
a presence in American politics, no matter what his showing in
November, and he warned Democrats they'll continue to be challenged
from the left ``unless they shape up.'' In an interview with the
Washington Post, Nader warned, ``This party is not going to go
away.'' Nader conceded that Democrats are closer to his views than
Republicans on issues such as taxes and tobacco, but said he
believed neither party was prepared to address the ``real issues of
power'' in this country, largely because both are dependent on
wealthy individuals and corporations for campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN DENIES BOTH REFORM HOPEFULS
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled against allowing either of
the two Reform Party presidential hopefuls to appear on the state's
Nov. 7 ballot. The court ruled 2-1 that Secretary of State Candice
Miller followed the law when she denied both Pat Buchanan and Iowa
physicist John Hagelin ballot slots. Miller said she was unable to
determine the official Reform Party chairman in Michigan. The state
party _ like the national _ has split into two factions, each with
its own chairman. Hagelin supporters said he will appear on the
ballot as the Natural Law Party candidate if he cannot appear under
the Reform Party banner.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH DENIES SUGGESTIONS OF DYSLEXIA
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush denied suggestions in a Vanity Fair article that
he has dyslexia. ``No, I'm not dyslexic,'' Bush said on ABC's
``Good Morning America'' today. ``That's all I can tell you.'' Bush
said he hadn't read the article and referred to his spokeswoman
Karen Hughes' characterization: ``In the case of this story,
fiction is stranger than truth,'' she said. The article in the
October issue quotes language experts who say Bush's tendency to
mix up words while speaking is consistent with dyslexia, a
neurological disorder impairing the ability to read and write. The
Bush campaign said the author, Gail Sheehy, may have confused the
candidate with his brother, Neil, who is dyslexic.
</P>
<P>
   HOW FAR REMOVED FROM LIFE-DEATH DECISIONS?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush gets criticized for his hands-off approach to
state executions, but state law leaves little room for governors to
act in these life-and-death decisions. Supporters say Bush allows
the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to do its job
freely by maintaining an arm's-length relationship. ``The governor
leaves it up to each parole board member to make their own
decisions after they review the case. They're an independent
body,'' said Bush spokesman Mike Jones. Others contend that Bush
does direct the board _ through his public statements on executions
and his power to appoint members to their six-year, $80,000-a-year
jobs. Since Bush became governor in 1995, the state has executed
143 people, including 32 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ON SECOND THOUGHT, HE'D LIKE SOME ORANGE JUICE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush tried to woo senior citizens in Florida, but
almost alienated another huge Sunshine State voting bloc: the
orange juice lobby. Joined by his brother, Jeb, the Florida
governor, Bush was promoting his plan for a Medicare prescription
drug benefit in Clearwater when he was offered a glass of orange
juice. Seemingly oblivious to the political ramifications of
refusing the beverage in this state, he declined. Brother Jeb
quickly stepped in. ``You don't want any FLORIDA orange juice?'''
Jeb Bush asked, setting off his brother's political warning lights.
Bush then replied: ``I am orange-juiced out. But if I had orange
juice it would be FLORIDA orange juice.''

&HT;     AIR FORCE GENERAL SAYS READINESS IS ON THE MEND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (FILED in the ``w'' and ``p'' categories) ,
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Weighing in on a hot-button campaign issue, a
frontline Air Force general said Tuesday that the military
readiness of his crews and equipment is on the mend after several
years of decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are turning the corner,'' said Gen. Gregory Martin,
commander of U.S. Air Force units based in Europe, adding that
readiness in the Air Force hit its nadir in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Martin leads 26,000 active-duty airmen and women at 14 overseas
bases, many of which are the first to be called on in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His picture of military readiness is considerably less bleak
than that of Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush and
Dick Cheney, his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney have accused President Clinton of eroding
military readiness by sending the armed forces abroad too often on
questionable missions and by not replacing older weaponry. As a
result, the GOP candidates argue, the military has low moral,
insufficient training and outdated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Bush has called the armed forces ``a military in
decline'' and has charged that they have been ``undermined by
back-to-back deployments, poor pay, shortages of spare parts and
equipment, and rapidly declining readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration and Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic
opponent, have conceded that the military needs improvement,
particularly in pay and benefits, but that readiness is not
faltering. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart has said the Army,
Marines and Air Force are more ready for battle today than in 1993,
when Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said Tuesday that in four key measures of military
readiness _ weaponry, training, availability of spare parts and
morale of troops _ the Air Force has shown improvement, especially
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. weaponry is ``excellent,'' he said, adding that his forces
are well trained although the service is ``a little thin'' because
it lacks sufficient numbers of supervisors to help train the crews.
Morale is rising in part because the Air Force is ensuring that its
service members and their families have adequate housing, he said.
Lack of decent housing has been a longtime gripe of many military
families and has been a factor in the inability of the armed forces
to retain personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the availability of spare parts is one area that
needs more improvement. Although the Air Force has ``arrested the
decline'' in such parts, Martin said, ``we're not ahead of the
game.'' Some units have enough and others do not. In battle, some
units likely would have to borrow spare parts from others, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the Air Force would like to have 80 percent to 85
percent of its fighter aircraft available for operations at any
given time. However, because of parts shortages and other factors,
75 percent to 80 percent of the aircraft are currently available,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force also would like to have 70 percent to 75 percent
of its airlifter planes available for duty at any given time, but
only 60 percent to 65 percent of planes are currently available, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Military operations _ such as last year's NATO air war against
Serbia in which the U.S. Air Force shouldered most of the duty and
current missions over Iraq _ have eaten into the U.S. parts
inventory, Martin said.

 &HT;    Actresss usrges students to watch their world
 &HT;    By Richard O. Jones
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ohio _ Ruby Dee says, ``Pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran actress spent a day in Oxford Monday as Miami
University's Cromer/Flory Performing Artist-In-Residence to share
her vast experience with both students and the university
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get older, there's a great temptation to give
advice,'' said the 75-year-old actress to the Hall Auditorium crowd
Monday night, but some of her best advice came earlier in the day
when Dee conducted a master class for acting students.
</P>
<P>
   As an award-winning actress, Dee appeared in films, on Broadway,
and in television productions, including ``Decoration Day,'' for
which she received an Emmy, and ``Roots: The Next Generation.'' She
starred in the original Broadway production and the film version of
Lorraine Hansberry's ``A Raisin in the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   On the dimly lit stage of Studio 88, the black box theater in
the basement of the Center for Performing Arts, Dee told the
assembled students that their greatest tool is their own powers of
observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I stand before you about to speak, I have to first see
you,'' she said, and pointed at various students and pointed out
something about them: Brown sweater, blue scarf, gold earrings. ``I
pay attention to these details and then you will remain in some
region of my consciousness for the rest of my life,'' she said.
``You might have to bring it out under hypnosis, but we are a part
of each other forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something comfortable in that. As actors, you have to
have an affinity for people in the first place. If you pay
attention to the details, you'll always have something to put in
your bag. As an actor, I'll never know when I'll need you.''
</P>
<P>
   During the nearly two-hour session, three students presented
monologues for Dee to critique. She impressed upon them the
purposefulness of action on stage, that characters are coming from
somewhere and have reached the stage because they want something.
Sometimes, an actor can convey more with her body than with the
words she speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important parts of a scene is what you don't
say,'' she said. ``What you think can be seen and you must have the
courage to think it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dee considers herself a ``word monger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won a box of jelly beans for a short story I wrote when I
was six years old,'' she said during her public performance Monday
evening. ``It took many years for me to get my thoughts together
enough to write again.''
</P>
<P>
   Her writings for the stage include ``Zora Is My Name,'' a
production based on the works of Harlem Renaissance author Zora
Neale Hurston and the musical revue ``Two Hah Hahs and a Homeboy,''
a collaboration with her husband Ossie Davis and son Guy Davis. She
also adapted for the stage works of other authors for her ``Books
With Legs'' series, which began with ``The Disappearance'' by Rosa
Guy.
</P>
<P>
   With Ossie Davis, she co-wrote ``In This Life Together,'' a
biography of their marriage. Monday night, she read from her other
book, ``My One Good Nerve,'' a compilation of short stories, humor
and poetry, including a selection of poems in which she updated the
Mother Goose nursery rhymes for a modern age.
</P>
<P>
   In her reconception, ``The Old Lady Who Lived in a Shoe'' became
a three-part treatise on birth control and homelessness, ``Jack and
Jill'' an exploration of racism and minority issues, and ``Peter
Peter Pumpkin Eater'' a look at spousal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer period with the audience, she
discussed her appearances in two Spike Lee films and told how she
knew him as a child and how he raised money with $10 and $20
donations to make his first film, ``She's Gotta Have It,'' and how
her son Guy was amazed when Lee paid him back.
</P>
<P>
   Before she left the stage, someone asked her for her best piece
of advice for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing keeps coming to my mind every day,'' she said, ``and
that's to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay attention to both sounds and silence. Pay attention to the
stories behind the headlines. Pay attention to the divine. We're a
concoction of divine material and were here for something, and we
have to pay attention to what that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay attention that we don't get bought, that the highest
bidder doesn't rake us in. Pay attention that we don't let our
things drown us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay attention to our wants, because I know that it's not what
we can buy.''

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: News, notes from wrestling industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love is in the air all around professional wrestling circles.
</P>
<P>
   World Wrestling Federation commentator Jim Ross reports in his
weekly ``Ross Report'' that ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin will marry
Debra McMichael and
</P>
<P>
   Jerry ``The King'' Lawler will marry long-time girlfriend and
WWF valet The Kat this month.
</P>
<P>
   While real wedding bells are ring in the WWF, World Championship
Wrestling has its own wedding gone bad. On Monday ``Nitro,'' David
Flair was set to take Miss Hancock as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who are dating in real life, were set to tie an
imaginary knot when Flair's father Ric, who was making his first
appearance on television since May, was carted off by police for
violating a restraining order. The wedding started again and was
interrupted by Miss Hancock's disclosure that the baby she was
carrying was not David Flair's.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought Triple H and Stephanie had problems.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like Flair's saga will continue after this Sunday's
pay-per-view ``Fall Brawl'' and don't be surprised if Ric Flair is
the father.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last week's second straight pre-empted ``Raw is War'' show
allowed ``Nitro'' to get his highest ratings of the year. Despite
that ``Raw,'' which aired from
</P>
<P>
   11 p.m.-1 a.m. instead of its usual 9-11 p.m. slot because of
the U.S. Open tennis matches, still had a better rating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extreme Championship Wrestling announced that will be hold its
Dec. 3rd pay-per-view ``Massacre on 34th Street'' at the
Hammerstein Ballroom in New
</P>
<P>
   York City. Tickets will be available on Monday, Sept. 18 from
Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   _ Call it a case of reverse discrimination. While some women are
still battling for equal treatment, the men of the WCW Power Plant
are crying foul because of the special treatment the women seem to
be getting. WCW has sent most of its women valets and dancers to
the Power Plant to learn wrestling moves and get more involved in
storylines. So after a month at the Power Plant they are making
debuts on ``Nitro'' and ``Thunder.'' Meanwhile, some male wrestlers
will never make television even after years at the WCW training
facility.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just when you didn't think characters could get any lower
comes this. Mideon, who has been looking for a gimmick, may turn up
as ``Naked Man'' soon. Seems
</P>
<P>
   Perry Saturn suggested the gimmick after a backstage competition
between Mideon and Kurt Angle to see who could stay naked the
longest. Mideon won.
</P>
<P>
   _ For those looking for Raven to make his WWF debut, the wait
may end October. Ideas for his debut have been discussed, but no
decision has been made. One interesting move may be to bring him
back with injured Billy Gunn and reunite DX with XPac and Road
Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   _ The war between Paul Heyman of ECW and Rob Black of XFW
continues to escalate. In the October 2000 issue of World of
Wrestling magazine, there is a
</P>
<P>
   paid advertisement ``open letter'' by Black to Heyman addressing
the events at ``Heatwave 2000.'' Here's some of the highlights: ``I
really enjoyed Heatwave
</P>
<P>
   2000 on July 16. I humbly apologize for the events that
transpired. I'm also extremely sorry for using the name XTREME In
reference to our wrestling company. And then there is the apology
due for using Sabu and our allowing him a make a living in the

NOMURA WITHDRAWS BID TO TAKE OVER LONDON'S TROUBLED MILLENNIUM
DOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As Britain approached the Year 2000, the centerpiece of
its efforts to draw the eyes of the world to a cool Britannia was
the Millennium Dome _ a huge tent beside the Thames River shaped
like an inverted wok and packed with exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Cool is hardly the term for it now.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months since the dome opened at Greenwich in east
London, it has become a sore embarrassment for Prime Minister Tony
Blair's government, depicted less often as a dome than as a
sinkhole for seemingly endless subsidies from the National Lottery
that have pushed its cost to the public beyond $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the cruelest cut came Tuesday when a British
division of Nomura Securities Co. of Japan pulled the plug on a
$157 million bid to take over the ailing edifice at the end of this
year, when New Millennium Experience Co.'s one-year contract to
operate the dome expires.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, primarily, was that despite the hoopla surrounding
its opening at New Year's, Britons and other potential visitors
stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, New Millennium Experience Co., a government-led
agency that runs the Dome, forecast it would be a financial
success, with 12 million visitors in the space of a year.
</P>
<P>
   That forecast was cut to 7 million but, by the end of the summer
vacation season, no more than 4.7 million people had passed its
portals, according to a spokeswoman for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Even those figures are questionable. By some estimates, the
final tally for the whole year will be no more than 4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Nomura-led consortium called Dome Europe had promised a $1.2
billion investment to turn the dome and its surrounding land into a
leisure and entertainment park.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, it was not low attendance but the dome's
ramshackle finances that caused the problem. Only weeks after the
newest, $74 million injection of lottery money _ the fifth in a
year _ Nomura on Tuesday called into question the dome's financial
management, saying there was ``substantial uncertainty'' about the
assets controlled by New Millennium Experience Co.
</P>
<P>
   But, Nomura said, it had been denied access to full financial
information about its acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very difficult decision to make but in the
circumstances we had no alternative,'' said Guy Hands, Nomura's
financing chief in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura won a bidding competition for the Dome last July, beating
out a rival, Legacy PLC, a consortium that had promised a major
investment to turn the dome into a center for high technology
business start-ups. Legacy said today it was still interested in
buying the dome and government officials said Legacy's bid might be
revived.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For all that, the dome has become an emblem of financial
ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Many Britons complained that Blair's government was more
interested in salvaging hurt pride than spending public money for
the public good. But the government minister responsible for it,
Lord Falconer, has rejected what have become routine calls for his
resignation, saying it is his duty to remain to the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   After the latest injection of lottery money, David James, a new
chairman with a reputation for fixing troubled companies, was
appointed to sort out the dome's financial problems and keep it
open until it could be handed over to Nomura. Shortly after his
appointment, James said he had been shocked to discover that the
dome's operators had not even compiled a register of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier audit by PriceWaterhouseCoopers revealed what Hands
called ``new information about the costs and future liabilities of
the Dome,'' suggesting that its finances had been run in a
haphazard way. The ownership of some of its assets was also
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The dome's operators said Tuesday that the exhibit would remain
open until the end of the year under the same management. Between
2,000 and 3,000 jobs in the depressed area around the dome will be
in jeopardy if it is closed down.

ECLECTIC YOUNG CHARMS THE GREEK
</HEADLINE>

Our rating: 3 1/2 stars

<P>
   Neil Young brought his A game but his B list of material to the
Greek Theatre Monday night, romping through an agreeable set of
what could be called his minor classics. Casual fans might have
left scratching their heads, but the faithful _ who seemed on hand
in strong numbers _ were pleased to revisit this segment of Young's
staggeringly rich catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the '70s composition ``Winterlong,'' he described it
as ``not quite a hit, it sounds like something else, but you just
gotta like it.'' That was the night in a nutshell. Figuring that
fans had heard ``Down by the River,'' ``After the Gold Rush,''
``Cinnamon Girl'' and similar chestnuts quite enough thank you at
this point, Young played lesser celebrated but nevertheless strong
tunes like ``Motorcycle Mama,'' ``Everybody Knows This Is
Nowhere,'' ``Walk On'' and the unreleased ``Bad Fog of
Loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Young fronted a solid ensemble of pro session musicians like
drummer Jim Keltner and bassist ``Duck'' Dunn, that his wife, Pegi,
and sister Astrid contributed backing vocals helped give the show a
more modest, homey feel in the Greek's spacious environs. The
singer and guitarist wasn't going for an electric, intense
performance as he has in recent years; this show was more
reflective and found Young in a jovial, nostalgic mood: He joked
about remembering how scared he was when he first played the Greek
a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   He mixed his vast repertoire from the '70s with numbers from two
more recent albums _ 1992's gentle, country-tinged ``Harvest Moon''
and this year's folky ``Silver and Gold'' (itself a collection of
tunes Young had written in years past). Nothing from his wilderness
years of the '80s made its way into the set, nor did any songs from
his harder-rocking comeback disks of the '90s, but the blend of
selected songs resulted in a pretty seamless vibe throughout the
course of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Guitar solos were kept to manageable lengths _ except, of
course, for ``Cowgirl in the Sand,'' which, along with
``Powderfinger,'' was one of the rare inclusions of his best-known
material. Young also drew the faithful to their feet with inspired
versions of ``Words (Between the Lines)'' (the evening's most
impassioned performance) and ``Tonight's the Night,'' a song about
the toll of drug addiction that's still eerie after all these
years: Moaning and wailing through the song, Young still seems to
be communing with long-departed friend Bill Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Hynde and the Pretenders opened the evening with a
solid, professional set that tacitly acknowledged that the band
peaked with 1983's ``Learning to Crawl,'' a depressing but
realistic assessment. Hynde closed her show with another Young drug
song, ``Needle and the Damage Done'' _ sample lyric: ``I hit the
city and I lost my band/I watched the needle take another band'' _
a sad, sobering tribute to her own group's a rocky, tragic
history. &QL;

`SOLE' SHORT ON THRILLS

<P>
   ``Dean Koontz's Sole Survivor'' could've been sheared down to
two or, at most, three hours. Virtually nothing happens in
tonight's installment, while way too much goes on in Part 2, as the
characters we've been following to that point turn out to be almost
irrelevant to the real story.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Zane stars as Joe Carpenter, former crack journalist, and
boy oh boy, does this movie go to lengths to establish that he's
tormented by the deaths of his wife and daughter in an airline
tragedy. (Watching video footage of a past birthday party has
become Hollywood's cliched way of evoking soulful suffering.) Said
information takes up the whole of the film's first five minutes (an
adept filmmaker could manage it in two shots) and is revisited with
numbing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course there was more to that flight than meets the
eye, or none of us would be here. Visiting his family's grave site
late one night, Joe encounters a cryptic woman named Rose (Gloria
Reuben), who tells him they need to talk _ but not now (since
clearing everything up in the movie's first 15 minutes doesn't make
for interesting thrillers).
</P>
<P>
   Soon, she _ and he _ are pursued by a bunch of mysterious
official types, led by a breathtakingly ruthless and sardonic guy
named Victor (John C. McGinley). (Who knows if that's his real
name, since at various points in the movie he claims to be from the
CIA, the FBI and the Department of Agriculture.) There's some
nugget of info Vic and his sadistic gang of misfits doesn't want
getting out, and Joe, investigative genius that he is, at numerous
points in the story tries to delay or prevent people from divulging
crucial information to him, information that might keep him alive.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big secret that Victor wants concealed? That
doesn't come out till halfway through Part 2, when Rose returns,
only to dump a ton of exposition on Joe that makes you realize
they've gone about this story completely backward. Turns out the
story's actually about a bunch of other people who only get a few
minutes of screen time apiece. This bit of misdirection might've
seemed cool had we not had to watch so darn much of Zane brooding,
brooding, brooding.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, the big secret _ the one that has Victor chopping digits
off victims and in general doing a Bill-Murray-as-psycho-killer
impersonation to keep quiet _ is that some evil megaconglomerate is
sponsoring a big battle between youthful incarnations of good and
evil. And, that death is not the end of life. Oh.
</P>
<P>
   You know, people don't ask for a lot out of their thrillers, but
they do kind of like it when filmmakers stay on message and don't
go mucking up the place with a bunch of inane New Age mumbo-jumbo.
(The scene in which scientists suggest straight-facedly that the
good, pure child is too dangerous for this world and must be
destroyed is the miniseries' most risibly silly.) But that's what
happens here, as our stars are shunted to the side for some soaring
music and low-rent special effects and shots of imperiled children
looking particularly angelic or martyred.
</P>
<P>
   At least McGinley's on hand, mugging with great abandon as an
unhinged operative who enjoys his job a bit too much, to make this
more entertaining than it otherwise might be. He's this project's
sole survivor. &QL;

 &HT;    Controversial nutritional adviser assisting U.S. women's swim
team
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Glen Luepnitz remembers the moment when, out of
the blue, he received a call from Richard Quick, head coach for the
U.S. women's swim team. Quick, the former coach of the University
of Texas women's swim team, had heard about Luepnitz's work with
athletes while visiting a daughter in Austin. He asked Luepnitz if
he would consider working with some of Quick's swimmers and provide
advice on nutrition and supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just finished firing a couple of my patients,'' Luepnitz
recalled. ``I had great suspicion they were cheating. So, I kind of
read him the riot act. I told him if I found athletes who were
cheating, I would turn them in. And I said if he knew they were
cheating, I'd turn him in.''
</P>
<P>
   When the response was silence, Luepnitz figured the
conversation, and the opportunity, were over.
</P>
<P>
   Quick finally said, ``Twenty-five years I have been trying to
find someone who would say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began an unlikely partnership that has been extremely
productive, even as it has become somewhat controversial. Recently,
the Houston Chronicle ran a story charging that Luepnitz had
obtained his doctorate at a diploma mill. Quick and star swimmer
Jenny Thompson came to his defense when later questioned by
reporters in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brilliant man, and I trust his judgment,'' Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt about his qualifications or his advice to our
team,'' Quick added.
</P>
<P>
   After enjoying stunning success with two of Quick's swimmers,
Thompson and Dara Torres, Luepnitz now is serving as an adviser to
the U.S. swim team. It's not a paid position, far from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My out-of-pocket expenses will be $68,000,'' Luepnitz said,
pointing out that employees at Lone Star Oncology would still have
to be paid while he was in Australia footing his own bills. ``But
once I said yes, there was no backing out.''
</P>
<P>
   While no pay comes with the position, there are perils, some of
which still lie ahead. Luepnitz runs a risk that a U.S. swimmer
might break his rules and end up testing positive at the Olympics
for a banned substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That petrifies me, to get a black eye,'' Luepnitz said. ``It
could really hurt me. Whatever control I have, I try to utilize.''
</P>
<P>
   Luepnitz, 41, specializes in nutrition and the use of
supplements and how they can relate to the prevention of and
recovery from cancer. But, he's also been pulled into a tangential
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports performance enhancement is new and legal. There are a
lot of people out there who don't want to cheat,'' Luepnitz said.
``My interest in athletes and nutrition started with the moms and
dads in the Austin area who had children participating in the
semi-elite level. They were referred from local physicians. Some of
these athletes went on to distinguished athletic careers in
college. My name spread by word of mouth. Before I knew it, I was
having elite athletes come and see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick, a longtime and outspoken opponent of illegal drug use,
was looking for ways to enhance performance without cheating or
doing anything unhealthy for the athletes. In May, Luepnitz began
providing advice on nutrition and supplements for Thompson and
Torres, both of whom trained with Quick at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started doing some counseling by phone, and then I sent him
some blood samples to work with,'' a pleased Quick said after the
U.S. swimming trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Torres are about as different as swimmers can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The have different body types and hormone profiles,'' Luepnitz
said. The powerfully built Thompson, 27, was trying to stay at the
top of her game, while the taller, thinner Torres, 33, was
attempting the near impossible, trying to make the Olympic team
after seven years away from the water.
</P>
<P>
   When Thompson went on to swim some of her best times, that was
impressive. When Torres swam faster than she had in in her prime,
making the Olympic team in three individual events, it was
downright incredible. After the tour de force at the trials, other
coaches were eager to have Luepnitz work with their athletes.
</P>
<P>
   After the trials, Quick explained, ``One of the reasons I have
Dr. Glen Luepnitz working with our athletes is that I want those
supplements that the athletes are taking to be No. 1, safe, No. 2,
healthy and No. 3, legal. In today's society where one of the
heroes of the world of sport, a fellow who hit quite a few home
runs, was using a performance enhancing drug that was banned by the
USOC, you could see athletes flocking into your local health food
store or supplement store and just buying stuff randomly without
supervision, without understanding if it's safe, if it's completely
legal or not, then, going by the salesman's idea of how much they
ought to take and when they ought to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I've been on a search for somebody who had experience
working with elite-level athletes in a safe, healthy manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Quick named Luepnitz to work with the U.S. team,
however, Luepnitz's credentials were questioned in a story in the
Houston Chronicle. Luepnitz received his doctorate at LaSalle
University in Mandeville, La., which grants degrees by mail.
Luepnitz defended his degree to the Chronicle and said that in
addition to course work, he'd written a thesis that exceeded 300
typewritten pages with another 150 pages worth of charts.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, Quick defended Luepnitz, saying it was difficult
to get a degree in that kind of field and that Luepnitz had taken
courses from schools all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   In athletics, however, courses and degrees don't guarantee
results. Athletes are interested in results, even if they don't
always grasp the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average athlete has no idea of how the body utilizes
food,'' Luepnitz said. Luepnitz and his elite athletes are a little
secretive about his methods, lest the competition catch on. But he
talked about the basics, which begin with the never-ending fight to
keep the body from storing fuel as fat rather than burning it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your body believes every meal is the last thing you're going
to eat. Survival rules,'' Luepnitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Luepnitz's regimen, Thompson and Torres were taking almost
two-dozen supplements a day including amino acids, minerals,
protein powders and some controversial, but legal, creatine. But
Luepnitz said such measures are only the top of a pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The base of the pyramid is extremely good nutrition,''
Luepnitz said. ``You have to eliminate the toxic junk that even
athletes eat. When you're processing the chemicals from your own
food, you're not processing energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cokes, tea and coffee predictably are on his hit list. But so is
too much juice, even if it's fresh squeezed orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juice is sugar water,'' Luepnitz said. Another surprise is the
athletic power drinks, which Luepnitz said are OK during competing
but a lot of empty calories afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common fallacy is the carbohydrates,'' Luepnitz said.
``Athletes eat too many carbohydrates. That creates spikes in the
blood sugar and insulin. The other fallacy is that they believe
they can't eat meat. Beef can be very lean. The average athlete is
protein malnourished. An athlete might need 17 ounces of meat a
day. And I'm asking them to eat six times a day. Fueling the elite
athlete is a huge problem. They almost can't eat enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``The next step in the pyramid is proper rest.
Most Americans are sleep deprived.''
</P>
<P>
   He said aspiring young athletes, ``need eight to 10 hours of
sleep. I tell them they should be in bed around nine. They have to
get into the concept that athletics is a lifestyle, a 100 percent
life-style commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next above sleep is the type of exercise. I don't step into
that area. Above that are supplements. I consider them to be an
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   He's big on glutamine _ an amino acid _ and protein supplements
and also uses antioxidants and minerals.
</P>

<P>
   Ah, those heady days when rock 'n' roll mattered _ or was all
that mattered. The euphoria. The drugs. The groupies! Most of all,
the exhilarating feeling that spontaneous thrills could combust at
any second, any hour of the night or day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous,'' Cameron Crowe's fictionalized memoir of
becoming a Rolling Stone music reporter at the tender age of 15,
captures all of those qualities with wit and verve and a lot of
affection. All except, perhaps, that sense of edgy spontaneity; the
film is both too overdetermined and willfully naive to cut through
to the dangerous, sloppy and often nasty heart of early '70s rock.
</P>
<P>
   But as a cleverly scripted entertainment, it's right up there
with Crowe's last writing-directing effort, ``Jerry Maguire.''
Observant and insightful _ at least so far as it's willing to go _
the piece is another likable tale of an easily corruptible guy's
wayward journey to the parameters of his personal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe stand-in William Miller (versatile newcomer Patrick
Fugit), this film's ethical Ulysses, is just an overbright kid who
makes the odyssey immensely charming. Then again, the lessons
William learns are the growing up, not growing deep, kind: People
use people, love and friendship are maddeningly tricky matters,
talent is one thing and professionalism quite another, et cetera.
It's all smart stuff, as teen movies go, but it's basic
coming-of-age business nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock stars have kidnapped my son!'' Professor Elaine Miller
(Frances McDormand, humanizing the overprotective mom archetype
like few before her have managed) wails to a class of unsympathetic
collegians. She's only slightly overdramatizing; young William has
not been snatched, but he has been hopelessly seduced into riding
along on an extended, cross-country tour with the
just-peaking-at-midrange band Stillwater. It's 1973, and the San
Diego adolescent is on his first assignment for the Rolling Stone,
the legendary pop culture magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But while achieving his goal is proving problematic _ the
musicians aren't just joking when they refer to the journalist as
the Enemy, and every scheduled sit-down interview with the group's
charismatic lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) is either
interrupted or blown off for reasons of instant gratification _
William is having the time of his life.
</P>
<P>
   This despite the handicap of being the most emotionally mature
individual on the bus. And due, in large part, to a cadre of young
female fans who call themselves The Band Aids (``We're not
groupies!'') and who are accompanying the tour. William falls
head-over-heels for late-blooming flower child Penny Lane (Kate
Hudson), and although she's a truly affectionate friend, she only
has eyes for Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Which is understandable, since the guy really knows how to
attract. Russell decides, somewhere in Kansas, to win William over,
mostly in the hopes of receiving positive coverage for the band.
Whether he'll succeed in eradicating the youth's already shaky
objectivity provides most of the film's dramatic tension. The other
notable tensions are intra-band; at regular intervals, lead singer
Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) shows his resentment of Russell's talent and
popularity as he explodes hilariously in tantrums that are
amusingly pitched between incoherent rage and embarrassment that he
even possesses such an ego.
</P>
<P>
   It's all supposed to be about the music, after all, not such
crass establishment concerns as fame and money. The joke, of
course, is that Stillwater really isn't very good. And by 1973,
rock had passed whatever art-dominated stage it might ever have
gone through and was already firmly in the grasp of marketing
machinery (a stereotypical new manager, brought in mid-tour,
represents the reality with crude obviousness).
</P>
<P>
   The movie could have done much more with this theme, but the
only other real references to it come from a real-life figure, the
late rock critic Lester Bangs (a brilliant-as-always Philip Seymour
Hoffman), William's ever-subversive rock writer mentor. It also
might have been a little more tough-minded about the darker aspects
of band life. Sure, hearts are callously broken, colleagues
betrayed and stomachs pumped in the movie, but it still leaves you
with the impression that Crowe never met a musician who wasn't,
deep down, a good guy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``Almost Famous'' is also a story told from a
worshipful young fan's point of view and done so consistently well.
If its vision is as magenta-tinged as the sunglasses on the movie's
poster, it's the rare kind of piece that works sharp dialogue,
incisive humor and smart, unique performances (add Fairuza Balk's
quick turn as the most unconsciously perceptive Band Aid to the
litany of shrewd characterizations) into a framework of slick,
studied guilelessness. &QL;

CHASE MANHATTAN SAID TO BE IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE J.P. MORGAN

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chase Manhattan is in serious talks to acquire J.P
Morgan, an executive close to the deal said Tuesday. The deal,
expected to be worth at least $40 billion, would unite two of the
oldest and most powerful forces in New York finance.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the negotiations were not immediately available,
although the executive said an announcement could come as early as
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction would end the independence of J.P. Morgan, the
most famous name in the history of American finance and the
nation's fifth-largest investment bank. For Chase, which has
historically made smaller acquisitions, like its buyout of
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and Robert Fleming Holdings, the deal would
catapult the bank into the top echelon with Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Chase and J.P. Morgan declined to comment Tuesday.
Chase's stock closed down 4 5/8 Tuesday, to 52 7/8. J.P. Morgan
shares soared 14 11/16 points, to close at 184, a 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is part of a recent wave of consolidation in investment
banking, where size and diversity _ both in business lines and in
geography _ are becoming more and more necessary. The trend has
some investment banking officials thinking that as few as six to 10
global giants could come to dominate the industry in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal follows other large transactions like the Credit Suisse
Group acquisition last month to pay $13.4 billion in cash and stock
for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In July, UBS AG agreed to pay $16
billion for the Paine Webber Group.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan had held talks with Deutsche Bank, but those talks
were abandoned, and takeover rumors have boosted J.P. Morgan's
share price by 50 percent since early July.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Peter Hancock, J.P. Morgan's chief financial officer,
resigned abruptly, fueling merger speculation.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan is seen as a particularly attractive takeover target
because of the steady fees generated by its strong money-management
business. Chase, the nation's No. 3 bank, reported
better-than-expected second quarter earnings in July, earning 95
cents a share excluding one-time charges. Overall, Chase's earnings
fell 22 percent, to $1.09 billion, or 85 cents a diluted share,
from $1.39 billion, or $1.06 a diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   The decline, Chase officials said at the time, was a result of
the falling value of its private equity investments.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been concerned that the bank's expenses are
rising faster than revenues, thanks to new hiring and an effort to
beef up its investment banking business, analysts have said.
</P>
<P>
   Chase had private equity gains of just $298 million, down from
$513 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest wave of deals, the structure of Wall Street
bears little resemblance to just a few years ago, when Merrill
Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the leading
triumvirate. Since then, Morgan Stanley has merged with the Dean
Witter brokerage firm; Salomon Brothers merged with Smith Barney
and then become part of the Citigroup financial conglomerate; and
Goldman Sachs went public, raising capital to fuel growth. Along
with those changes, foreign powers like Credit Suisse and UBS made
their presences felt.

`LOST': EVIL AND FRAILTY IN A CORSICAN MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Publication notes at end of review)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corsica is the setting for ``Lost,'' a taut and atmospheric
first novel by Lucy Wadham in which the kidnapping of a child gives
a strange and transient meaning to the lives of several island
inhabitants. No kidnapping ever took place on Corsica, the talented
Wadham assures us in an author's note. This book is refreshingly
not ``based on a true story.'' And maybe for that very reason
Wadham seems to have made her imaginary Corsica believable.
</P>
<P>
   It is an austerely beautiful, politically afflicted place, where
officials live in a state of exile from the French center and where
a kind of human driftwood, gangsters and nongangsters alike, has
collected to live out lives of isolated desperation.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it won't take long for devotees of exotic
adventure to fall under Wadham's spell. Described succinctly on the
dust jacket as a freelance journalist who lives in Paris, Wadham
writes with stylish precision. She makes you think of Graham Greene
in one of his lighter moods as she teases out the emotional
responses to a situation of extreme distress, managing grimness,
terror and suspense like an artist mixing paint, getting the right
tint, the proper degree of shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Why ``Lost''? Almost everybody seems to have some quality to
justify Wadham's evocatively monosyllabic title. The central
character is Alice Aron, a rich young widow, beautiful of course,
whom we first see arriving at the airport with her two young sons
to visit her dead husband's ancestral home. Watching her, waiting
for her, is a small-time hoodlum named Mickey da Cruz, whose
presence, along with a pair of brothers named Scatti waiting in a
car, gives Wadham's story an ominous tone from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   One of Alice's sons, 7-year-old Samuel, the kind of normally
inquisitive boy who asks his mother which runs faster, a scorpion
or a snake, is going to be taken away from her. But not before
Wadham has introduced us to the other dramatis personae.
</P>
<P>
   First there is Antoine Stuart, the disillusioned and unhappy
police commissioner whose career is in such a sad state that he
spends whole days at the beach. He has a lurking intelligence, a
moral incorruptibility that makes him almost outlandish in a place
like Wadham's Corsica. He drives an old brown Datsun because ``the
car cult on the island had always sickened him and so he kept his
own in protest.'' He is not a widower but a man abandoned by the
wife he still longs for, and he knows he has faded into
insignificance on Corsica because the unofficial chief of the
island, the leader of the criminal underworld, doesn't even bother
to keep watch on him any more.
</P>
<P>
   The capo is Coco Santini, who lives with his mistress in a large
villa designed by a Scandinavian architect. He mistreats his wife
and has people he doesn't like killed, including Stuart's most
valuable informant. Santini confidently maneuvers though the
island's Byzantine politics to control the National Liberation
Front, which started out as an independence movement but has become
an entrepreneurial mafia. When young Sam is hustled into a car one
morning by Mickey da Cruz and the Scatti brothers, we are not sure
whether Santini is ultimately behind the kidnapping or not. But we
do know that he is dangerous to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes people sick about you is that you pretend to be a
good man when what you are is a coward,'' Santini tells Stuart as
Wadham's climactic scenes approach and the characters of the two
rivals have been stripped bare. ``There aren't any good men on this
island. They don't survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart replies, ``They don't survive because you kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadham constructs a complicated intrigue after the kidnapping of
Sam, one with lots of the unpredictable motion that occurs when
human volition comes into play. The original kidnappers are
replaced by a second, radical political gang that Santini is using
to keep the liberation front under his control. Sam, whom we
glimpse from time to time in various states of captivity, is slowly
reduced to a mute, curled up ball divorced from the sensory reality
outside himself. But at the moral heart of the story is the rivalry
between the good but, in Alice's eyes, ineffectual Stuart and the
evil but charismatic Santini.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry includes the seduction of Alice, which adds another
savory element of suspense to Wadham's story. Which of the two will
she trust to regain her son? The reader knows whom she should
choose, but one of Wadham's skills is to imagine realistically the
densely clouded mind of a young mother in which the senses of loss,
guilt and desperation are mixed. Danger hovers over Wadham story
like a mist, and the danger comes not only from the evil figures in
her book but from normal human frailty as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost'' in this sense remains true to Wadham's grasp of gritty,
confusing reality right to the end as the chess-like conflict
between Stuart and Santini reaches its conclusion. At one point,
Stuart ruminates on the vanity to which police investigators are
prone, that they will be able to sift the evidence, figure out the
game and win it with guile and intelligence. ``But his job was to
sit still as a lizard in the sun and wait for the fallible
mechanism to spring and perhaps make a catch, perhaps not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadham's appreciation of the fallible mechanism gives this
darkly entertaining novel its special aura of suspense and of
something more satisfying than suspense: the melancholy feeling
that people being what they are, these events _ based on nothing
but imagination _ could happen exactly the way she describes them.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers will douse portions of the Northeast Seaboard
early Wednesday as a cold front pushes eastward off the coast.
Behind the front, drier breezes from the northwest will direct
cooler and less humid air into the Great Lakes and interior
Northeast. Sunshine will return to coastal sections of the
Northeast and Middle Atlantic States by the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered thunderstorms will surround a cool front advancing
through the Southeast. Farther south, humid air will fuel isolated
afternoon thunderstorms in Florida, though most places will stay
dry with ample sun.
</P>
<P>
   The searing heat of recent days will end over South Texas as
clouds and numerous showers cover the region. A few of the showers
will be heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be sunny and very warm. An exception will
be across central California, where a disturbance will bring clouds
and spotty showers to the Sierra.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TYPHOON CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
   Typhoon Saomai, which lashed the islands south of Japan on
Tuesday, is a hemisphere away, but the storm may incite a change in
the weather over North America. Weather systems around the
hemisphere are connected by a serpentine high-level wind pattern
called the jet stream. When a strong typhoon leaves the tropics, it
infuses the jet stream in the northern Pacific with abundant
energy. Typically, several days after the typhoon's effects reach
the middle latitudes, eastern North America turns much cooler. &QL;

THE WINE WORLD GROWS SMALLER 
</HEADLINE>
   By   FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUTHERFORD, Calif. _ Francis Ford Coppola marked his 25th
anniversary in the wine business on Sept. 9 with a daylong party at
his Niebaum-Coppola Winery here. The festivities included a dinner
with vintages of his prestigious Rubicon red wine dating back to
1978, served in magnums, followed by a screening of his film ``One
From the Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   For me and a group of other guests, the highlight of the day was
a tasting comparing California and Bordeaux cabernet sauvignon
blends from the 1985 and 1995 vintages. Led by Niebaum-Coppola's
winemaker, Scott McLeod, we tasted 1985 Bordeaux from Chateaux
Lynch-Bages, Pichon-Lalande, Leoville-Las Cases, Haut Brion,
Margaux and Lafite-Rothschild. From the Napa Valley, the '85s were
Heitz Cellars Martha's Vineyard, Neibaum-Coppola Estate Winery's
Rubicon, Joseph Phelps' Insignia, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23,
Chateau Montelena Cabernet Sauvignon and Robert Mondavi Reserve
Cabernet Sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 wines were the same except for the Heitz. Like most
Napa Valley wineries, the Heitz Cellars vineyards were seriously
damaged by phylloxera in the late 1980s and replanted in 1992.
Another Heitz estate wine, Trailside Vineyard, took its place.
</P>
<P>
   The first flight of wines in the tasting on Saturday morning
consisted of the 12 1985s, all identified, with the six California
wines in one row and the Bordeaux wines in another. In the second
flight, the wines were served blind and mixed together.
</P>
<P>
   To me the remarkable feature of the tasting was the change in
style among the French wines. The 1985s offered no surprises. There
were some excellent wines, all true to form. They were elegant and
restrained; the California wines were full-bodied and lush. The
French were more angular and austere; the Californians more rounded
and mellow.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, all that had changed. The French wines had
become more Californian. McLeod asked the group _ winemakers, a
couple of restaurant people, a few journalists and one prominent
filmmaker _ to guess which 1995s were Californian and which were
French. Only one person got them all correct. I got 5 wrong out of
12, but then I've always considered humiliation an important
component of wine judging.
</P>
<P>
   My favorites among the 1985s were Lynch-Bages, Margaux and the
Cask 23. Among the the 1995s I liked the Chateau Montelena, the
Phelps Insignia and the Leoville-Las Cases.
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner, I especially enjoyed the 1978, 1981 and 1984
Rubicons.
</P>
<P>
   Both 1985 and 1995 were fine vintages in Bordeaux and
California. The 1985 Bordeaux were early maturing and lacked
something of the power and concentration of 1989 and 1990. Yet they
seemed, last Saturday anyway, harder and less generous than the
Napa wines.
</P>
<P>
   In California, 1985 is thought to have been the best year of the
decade. Both the Bordeaux and California wines matured fairly
early. As for the 1995s, most critics rated the Bordeaux just below
the more tannic 1996s and the California wines just below the 1994s
but above the 1996s, all three being excellent years.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeaux and the Napa Valley, and particularly Niebaum-Coppola,
are inextricably intertwined. Bordeaux has always been the
inspiration for Napa cabernets, and both regions use the same
grapes. Gustave Niebaum, who founded the estate in the late 1800s,
used Bordeaux cuttings to start his vineyard and, as Coppola noted
before the tasting, ``We still plant the Niebaum clone of cabernet
sauvignon today.''
</P>
<P>
   Niebaum-Coppola's Rubicon was one of the first ultrapremium
California wines to be made from a blend of Bordeaux varieties.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier generation of Napa Valley vintners boasted that their
best wines were 100 percent cabernet. Now most winemakers agree
that the best wines in California, as in Bordeaux, are blends.
Among the 1985s, the Rubicon is 61 percent cabernet sauvignon, 26
percent cabernet franc and 13 percent merlot; the Phelps Insignia
is 60 percent cabernet sauvignon, 15 percent cabernet franc and 25
percent merlot. There are traditionalists. The Heitz Martha's
Vineyard 1985, like all previous Martha's Vineyards, is 100 percent
cabernet sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   The Bordeaux winemakers have always blended and have never
bothered to explain their blends. Among the wines in Saturday's
tasting, Lafite-Rothschild usually has 70 percent cabernet
sauvignon, 25 percent merlot and small amounts of cabernet franc
and petit verdot. Lynch-Bages and Margaux are similar.
</P>
<P>
   After the tasting someone observed that when experts identify
Bordeaux wines as Californian and Californian wines as Bordeaux,
the days of comparing one region with another may be ending; that
the convergence of styles, so evident in the tasting, may mark the
beginning of a time when we will compare California estates with
Bordeaux chateaux _ with no regional bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is a smaller place,'' McLeod said, making no doubt
that he feels California will occupy the premier position. ``We are
entering a golden age here. The first decade of the new millennium
may well belong to the Napa Valley.''

 &HT;    FUEL PROTESTS BRING BRITAIN TO THE BRINK OF GRIDLOCK
 &HT;    460&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain slipped toward national gridlock Tuesday as
truckers and others protesting high fuel prices blocked shipments
from refineries across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair said he would not to bend to the
protests and assured Britons that his government would move quickly
to restore order. Shortly afterward,
</P>
<P>
   trucks reportedly began departing some fuel depots.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, similar blockades and protests were staged by
truckers, taxi drivers, farmers and others pinched by rising oil
prices and high national fuel taxes. But the crisis here was being
described as the greatest domestic challenge since Blair's
government was elected in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott warned that ``chaos ...
seems to be developing across the country, where emergency services
are being denied to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals canceled ambulance service and non-emergency
procedures. Grocery stores and supermarkets reported a run on
essential items.
</P>
<P>
   Service stations were expected to run out of unleaded gasoline
Wednesday, and the fuel shortage began spreading to other forms of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Some diesel-fueled commuter trains were canceled, and Glasgow's
airport reported late Tuesday that it had only hours worth of fuel
left. Taxis, which have become very popular with people trying to
conserve their own supplies, were on the verge of running out of
gas.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Automobile Club said the fuel crisis was the worst
since the mid-'70s. ``The government has to step in immediately,''
it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after an emergency cabinet meeting, Blair
said, ``I believe that whatever the right or wrongs the arguments
over fuel (taxes), we cannot accept as a government or as a nation
that policy should be dictated by illegal blockades, pickets or
direct action. There can be no excuse whatever for this type of
action, which is hurting our people businesses and emergency
services severely.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth and her senior advisers gave Blair the go-ahead
to use force if necessary to provide fuel for essential services.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair, seemingly wary of the political effect of moving
against the economically distressed protesters, told oil companies
that it was up to them to ensure fuel supplies. Oil companies have
refused to send out tankers, claiming they do not want to put
drivers at risk.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of the price of a gallon of gasoline in Britain
is taxes, about twice the rate paid by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Blair conceded that fuel taxes have increased at a faster rate
than inflation for two years. He said this was necessary to
generate the money his government has needed to help fuel the
country's economic recovery. He said the proper way to address high
prices was to pressure the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries into producing more oil.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The already dreadful traffic in and around London was even more
challenging Tuesday as motorists had to contend with lines of cars
waiting in hopes of finding fuel at service stations.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Effingham about 20 miles south of London, a line of
cars stretched Tuesday morning from the Rust Service Station for a
quarter-mile down the busy Guildford Road. Nick Gower said he
arrived at 6:45 a.m. to find a line had already formed to buy
gasoline, selling at the equivalent of about $5 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there would be a queue for petrol, so I drove from
Ashtead (about eight miles) to see if I couldn't find some petrol
out here,'' Gower said after filling the tank of his Ford. ``I
don't like queues, but I also understand why these lads are acting
up. Can anyone explain why we in the UK have to pay more tax on our
fuel than anyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are doing it to save their livelihoods,'' said Mike
Salmon of the British Road Haulage Association, which represents
many of the drivers taking part in the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany
vowed Tuesday to increase their demonstrations against high fuel
prices and short supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In the western German city of Saarbrucken near the French
border, more than 200 trucks, buses and taxis drove, honking their
horns through the center of town. Rallying in front of the state
parliament building, the protesters demanded that an energy tax
imposed by the Social Democratic-led government be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters want their governments to follow France's lead in
granting concessions. The French government, faced with similar
protests, reduced its fuel tax by about 15 percent last week.

 &HT;    HUD INCREASES RENTAL SUBSIDIES IN ATLANTA AREA
 &HT;    By MEGAN K. DOYLE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew
Cuomo announced a boost in subsidies for low-income renters in 39
metropolitan areas Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The boost, which takes effect next month, is part of a $100
million-a-year plan to increase the share of rental housing
available for federal subsidies from 40 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the booming economy is creating a ``housing crisis''
leaving 5.4 million low-income families paying more than half of
their income for housing. Rental rates have risen at one and a half
times the rate of inflation in the past three years, according to
HUD's State of the Cities 2000 report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat counter-intuitive, but it is the successful
economy that is actually creating this problem for us,'' Cuomo
said. ``We have more people in need of affordable housing than ever
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal assistance vouchers allow most recipients to pay no
more than 30 percent of their income towards their rent, with the
government providing the rest, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, which Cuomo said can be initiated using money
currently available, would add 1.4 million additional units
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   However, any housing agency nationwide that can demonstrate
difficulties obtaining rental units through vouchers could be
eligible for the increased subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the department's proposed budget for fiscal 2001,
which is scheduled to be reviewed by the Senate Appropriations
Committee on Wednesday, calls for 120,000 new vouchers and a new
$50 million Housing Voucher Success Fund to help families search
for available housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What promise can we make today that is better than a place to
house your family?'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., a member
of the Appropriations Committee. ``We'll do whatever we can to see
the funds are there.''
</P>
<P>
   The voucher expansion comes almost simultaneously with the
announcement Monday of a new program devised by HUD through which
rental assistance vouchers can be used to purchase homes.
</P>
<P>
   The program, effective in October, allows first-time home buyers
with household incomes of at least $10,300 who are eligible for the
current rental assistance voucher program, to use the same amount
provided in rental vouchers towards payment of a home mortgage.

FINDING DEFECT WAS COMPLEX,   FIRESTONE EXECUTIVE TESTIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: This early version will be updated.) 
 By DAVID STOUT  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An official from the Bridgestone/Firestone Co. told
a Senate committee Tuesday that discovering the pattern of tire
failures that has been linked to 88 deaths nationwide took longer
than the company would have wished because of the complexity of the
problem and the fact that, statistically, only a tiny number of
tires failed.
</P>
<P>
   John Lampe, a vice president of Bridgestone/Firestone, told the
Senate Commerce Committee that the company wished it could have
discerned the potentially fatal problem sooner. But Lampe said
after the company identified the problem _ that the treads of
underinflated tires could separate at high temperatures _ it moved
as fast as it could to get the defective tires off the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize and we recognize there is a problem, a very
complex problem that must be solved because lives are at stake,''
Lampe said. ``And for too long, we didn't see the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampe said the company has appointed an independent outside
investigator to monitor the company's recall of defective tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make great tire products on which millions of Americans
have driven for billions of safe miles,'' Lampe told the panel,
headed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deaths linked to Firestone tires have involved Ford
Explorers, and the safety problem has frayed one of the
longest-standing corporate partnerships in America. Tuesday,
officials from the Ford Motor Co. and Firestone each tried to shift
some of the blame for the accidents and deaths on to the other
company.
</P>
<P>
   Lampe's call for more attention to ``the interaction between the
tire and the vehicle'' strongly suggested that the tire company has
not abandoned its stand that part of the safety problems was caused
by what Firestone has said is Ford Explorers' tendency to roll
over.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford has a much different perspective, as its chief
executive, Jacques Nasser, made clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford did not know that there was a defect with the tires until
we virtually pried the claims data from Firestone's hands in late
July, early August, and analyzed it ourselves,'' Nasser said.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks made it unmistakable that the Firestone-Ford
relationship has hit a big bump. ``Firestone failed to share
critical claims data with Ford that might have prompted the recall
of these bad tires sooner,'' Nasser said. ``This is not the candid
and frank dialogue that Ford expects in its business
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with next year's Ford Explorers, Nasser said, Ford
will offer buyers a choice of tires.
</P>
<P>
   While senators of both parties on McCain's committee expressed
anger that Ford had ordered tire recalls overseas many months
before the problems became known in the United States, McCain
promised at the outset that the hearing would not be a forum for
attaching blame to business or government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, we all share blame equally when the system
fails,'' McCain said in opening remarks. But he added: ``Serious
questions remain about what Ford and Firestone knew of this problem
and when they knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mounting evidence is making it increasingly difficult to
credibly believe that neither of these companies knew anything of
this problem before this summer,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., called the problem ``a sordid
chapter in the history of two companies that for more than a
century have become household names for the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, dozens of deaths have been linked to traffic
accidents in which Firestone tires were a factor. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said 88 deaths in the United
States might be linked to the tires. More than 6 million tires have
been recalled, and the NHTSA says another 1.4 million might be
dangerous _ a finding that Firestone has not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Firestone also face scrutiny in the House. Rep. Billy
Tauzin, R-La., who heads the House Commerce subcommittee on
telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, said Tuesday he
might subpoena documents from both companies relating to tire tests
if he does not get them by week's end.

ADVERTISING: BURGER KING ACCOUNT IN REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, Burger King has sought to stimulate flagging sales
of its fast fare with a seductive appeal carrying the theme ``Got
the urge?'' Tuesday, it was Burger King that had the urge _ the
same old urge the company has had so often, to place the creative
duties for its general market advertising account in review.
</P>
<P>
   The review, denied by the top Burger King marketing executive as
recently as a month ago, involves assignments with billings
estimated at $400 million. It began with an unusually frank
dismissal of the recent work produced by the incumbent agency, the
New York office of Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners Worldwide. Lowe Lintas
and two predecessors have created campaigns for Burger King since
1994 carrying themes like ``Get your burger's worth'' and ``It just
tastes better'' as well as ``Got the urge?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed with the impact our advertising has had in
driving sales,'' said Mikel Durham, the new North American
president for Burger King Corp. in Miami, part of Diageo PLC, ``and
moving the indicators we track on the relationship of the consumer
with the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lowe Lintas is being invited to participate in the review,
she added, the agency would be expected to offer a drastically new
approach to the account.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-food category of the restaurant market ``is intensely
competitive,'' Durham said, adding that it ``becomes harder and
harder to stake out a point of differentiation and a `share of
throat,' if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   The review came as sales at Burger King stores in the United
States open at least a year declined 0.4 percent for the 12 months
ending June 30. That's worrisome to Durham, brought in a month ago
from a sibling, Guinness in London, to help Diageo dress up Burger
King for a planned stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Her perspective on the industry is underscored by recent steps
taken by other chains that compete against Burger King, the world's
second-largest fast feeder. Taco Bell, a unit of Tricon Global
Restaurants, dismissed its agency, the Playa del Rey, Calif.,
office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the
Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies for two other fast-food advertisers _ KFC, also
part of Tricon, and McDonald's _ have made substantial changes in
the creative content of their campaigns. At the KFC agency, Young &AMP;
Rubicam Advertising in New York, the creative team was changed,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, comments like those made by Durham mean that the
incumbent stands a slim chance of retaining an account. That is
particularly true for a restless marketer like Burger King, which
has had four creative agencies since 1987 _ six if you count the
two predecessor shops of Lowe Lintas that created ads from 1994 to
1999, Ammirati &AMP; Puris and Ammirati Puris Lintas. Still, Lowe
Lintas intends to take part in the review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the history, we've got the experience and we've
certainly got the creative firepower to help them turn their
business around,'' said Rob Quish, president at the New York office
of Lowe Lintas, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic Group of
Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe Lintas has not been having a good week. On Monday, another
client, Sun Microsystems, left the agency, citing a conflict with
the account of a second high-technology marketer, Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, during the MTV Video Music Awards, the
performer Kid Rock mocked Burger King commercials created by Lowe
Lintas for a promotion featuring the Backstreet Boys by unfavorably
comparing them with a similar promotion pairing a rival boy band,
'N Sync, with McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Asked her opinion of Kid Rock's humorous remarks, Durham was all
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Durham declined to identify the other agencies that are being
asked to take part in the review; speculation has already started
that TBWA/Chiat/Day may be one of them. She also declined to
discuss whether an agency in San Francisco that has worked for two
months on a project for Burger King, Odiorne Wilde Narraway &AMP;
Partners, would be considered.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Odiorne Wilde was a strong signal that Burger King
was getting ready to flame-broil Lowe Lintas in addition to its
hamburgers. While the company had been pleased with a campaign that
ran from March 1996 to August 1999, which paired familiar rock and
pop tunes with appetizing footage of Burger King menu items,
subsequent work was less well received.
</P>
<P>
   Durham said that she hoped to complete the review by the end of
the year and have a new campaign soon after. That fast-track
timetable might favor Lowe Lintas because it may prove difficult
for an agency of the size needed by Burger King to handle such a
big assignment to mobilize so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the nature of Burger King's business and the challenges
it is facing as a corporation,'' said Lee Garfinkel, chairman,
chief executive and chief creative officer for the U.S. operations
of Lowe Lintas, ``we understand new management's obligation to
entertain new points of view relative to its advertising and
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We embrace this opportunity to look at the account from a
fresh perspective,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Three other agencies will continue handling other tasks for
Burger King: MediaVest in New York, part of the Starcom MediaVest
unit of the B Com3 &UR;  &LR;  Group, for media services; Uniworld in New
York, 49 percent owned by the WPP Group, for campaigns aimed at
black consumers; and Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates in San Antonio,
Texas, also part of B Com3, for ads aimed at Spanish-speaking
consumers.

ANDERSON'S THE NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By   ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Compared with some of California's better-known wine
regions, the Anderson Valley doesn't get much attention, except
when it's mistaken for the Alexander Valley. The Alexander, in
northern Sonoma County, is home to many big wineries like Clos du
Bois and Jordan. Anderson Valley, in Mendocino County, is roughly
the same size as the Alexander but with far fewer grapes planted,
and it is home mostly to small, little-known wineries that deserve
a higher profile.
</P>
<P>
   Pinot noir in particular grows successfully in the Anderson's
cool climate, but the valley may also be California's best area for
Germanic grapes like gewueztraminer and riesling. Chardonnay and
zinfandel also do well.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to work to find Anderson Valley wines. Navarro
Vineyards, perhaps the area's leading winery, doesn't sell its
wines retail. You can often find the wines on good restaurant
lists, though, and you can buy directly from the winery through
www.navarrowine.com, state laws permitting. Navarro makes superb
rieslings and gewuerztraminers, both dry and sweet, and a fine
chardonnay, though I found its 1997 pinot noir to be too lean.
</P>
<P>
   Handley Cellars is a little easier to find in stores than
Navarro. It, too, makes a fine gewuerztraminer, along with a juicy
pinot noir. Edmeades Vineyards, a winery owned by Kendall-Jackson,
makes small lots of wine, including a terrific pinot noir.
</P>
<P>
   Several wineries outside the area buy Anderson Valley grapes to
make excellent wines. Au Bon Climat in Santa Barbara County makes a
fine though pricey pinot noir under its Ici/La-Bas label, while
Littorai, a small winery in Napa Valley, makes several Anderson
Valley wines.
</P>
<P>
   The one giant among the Anderson elves is Roederer Estate, the
California arm of the French Champagne house, which produces one of
America's best sparkling wines. If you get frustrated looking for
the other wines, you can find Roederer Estate at almost any wine
shop. One glass of its brut offers fine solace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EDMEADES, PINOT NOIR 1997 $20.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, fruity aroma; smooth and medium-bodied with herbal and
chocolate flavors.
</P>
<P>
   HANDLEY, PINOT NOIR, ESTATE RESERVE 1995 $31.
</P>
<P>
   Big and mouth-filling, with berry, mint and leather flavors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ICI/LA-BAS, PINOT NOIR, LES REVELES, ELKE VINEYARD 1997 $58.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   LITTORAI, PINOT NOIR, SAVOY VINEYARD 1997 $35. &QL; 
Sweet, complex and voluptuous. &QL;

&HT;     BUSH, GORE BATTLE OVER GOP AD CRITIQUING GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore tangled Tuesday
over a two-week-old Republican Party television ad that flashed the
word ``rats'' during a 30-second critique of the role that
``bureaucrats'' allegedly would play under Gore's plan to cover
prescription drugs under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee withdrew the ad that had
appeared an estimated 4,400 times in 33 television markets
nationwide at a cost of $2.6 million. It was the second time in
three weeks that a Republican party ad on behalf of the GOP nominee
had stirred controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the ad eclipsed efforts by Bush to win support in
Missouri and Florida for his health care proposals for catastrophic
coverage and Gore's bid to win support in Ohio for his proposal to
strengthen public education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed criticism of the latest GOP advertisement, but
said the GOP was withdrawing it. Bush said that subliminal
advertising that flashed a word or image on the screen was ``not
acceptable.'' He said, however, that he was ``convinced'' that the
appearance of the word ``rats'' in large capital letters on one of
900 frames in the ad was ``not intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-term governor of Texas added: ``We don't need to play
games; what we need is a debate on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush communications director Karen Hughes said the ad was being
withdrawn as scheduled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican chairman Jim Nicholson defended the advertisement,
saying that a frame-by-frame review in slow motion and discussions
with the producer, Alex Castellanos, made it ``clear that there was
no attempt to deliberately manipulate anyone here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, joined by running mate Joseph Lieberman aboard separate
school buses in southern Ohio to spotlight their education
initiatives, called the GOP ad a ``disappointing development.''
Gore _ the veteran of 24 years in national politics _ insisted that
he had ``never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a former Connecticut attorney general who has
represented his state in the Senate for 12 years, called the ad
``very disappointing and strange,'' adding: ``I'm sure the public
will be puzzled by it as we are and want an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   William Schneider, a public opinion specialist at the American
Enterprise Institute, said the ad triggered such a furor because
``it's a deception and voters don't like to be fooled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission adopted a policy in 1974
that declared subliminal advertising contrary to the public
interest. Officials said the FCC would investigate broadcasters
that aired the ad, if complaints were received.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second ad voiced support for Bush's plan to expand
Medicare to cover part of the cost of prescription drugs and
contended that senior citizens could exercise greater control over
their health care under Bush's 10-year, $158 billion proposal.
</P>
<P>
   As an announcer declared that under ``the Gore prescription
plan, bureaucrats decide,'' segments of same words flashed across
the screen. At one point, the word ``RATS'' in large white capital
letters flashed on a black background as the announcer said that
under the Gore plan, ``bureaucrats decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ad came to light after the Gore campaign gave a
slow-motion copy of the ad to the New York Times late Monday that
resulted in a story in Tuesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Television journalist Brit Hume mentioned the embedded message
in a report on Fox News on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, the GOP chairman, called the use of flashing words
``a visual drumbeat to capture viewers' attention.'' Nicholson said
three frames in the ad displayed the entire phrase ``bureaucrats
decide'' alternating with three frames that displayed ``fragments
of the phrase in large type.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Holt, spokesman for the GOP's advertising campaign, said
the spot was ``about health care not about rodents,'' adding: ``The
word bureaucrats ends with `rats' just like the word `Democrat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said the use of the word was
intentional. ``Ad graphics don't pop up out of thin air,'' Hattaway
said. ``Someone sits down at a computer and creates them.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert said voters would have to
decide whether the ad was ``an accident or a dirty trick.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest controversy over an ad recalled an earlier
embarrassment for the Bush campaign caused by his party. Bush and
his Austin-based advisers vetoed a Republican National Committee
attack ad on Gore in late August that drew upon videotaped material
that he said was taken out of context from an earlier television
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The newest controversy erupted as Bush told senior citizens in
Orlando, Fla., that his overhaul of Medicare would ``offer
additional choices for seniors'' including coverage for
catastrophic illness after the first $6,000 in expenses. Bush said
Gore's proposed overhaul of Medicare would force senior citizens to
join ``a government HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore promises to spend $253 billion over 10 years to revamp
Medicare to add prescription drug coverage for senior citizens who
spend more than $4,000 for prescription drugs. Gore's plan does not
include expanded coverage for catastrophic illness.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wrapped up a two-day barnstorming effort in Florida, where
his younger brother Jeb is governor. He later headed to Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman devoted their campaign efforts to persuading
voters in the swing state of Ohio that their proposed $170 billion
education overhaul would encourage both students and teachers to
become more accountable for results.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal calls for local authorities to identify and
implement recovery plans for ``failing schools'' with ``rigorous
peer evaluation of every teacher'' and ``performance report cards''
to help parents select a school for their child. Gore also calls
for performance reviews of teachers and bonuses for performance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told an audience in a middle school in Miamisburg that the
Democrats' ``comprehensive approach'' to requiring accountability
from teachers and students is superior to Bush's plan which he said
would only hold authorities accountable for school performance
following statewide tests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett derided the proposal touted
by the Gore-Lieberman campaign. ``If Al Gore's school bus is
anything like his education proposal, it will have four flat
tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, vowing to ``close the achievement gap, set high standards,
promote character education and ensure school safety,'' proposes
that local jurisdictions set performance standards. If schools
cannot meet the standards within three years, according to the Bush
plan, federal education money for that district would be
distributed as vouchers to parents to enable them to send their
children to other public or private schools.

LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE ABANDONS PLANS TO MERGE WITH FRANKFURT'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The London Stock Exchange on Tuesday scrapped its
proposal to merge with the Frankfurt stock exchange, abandoning at
least for now a grand vision of creating the first pan-European
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the London exchange threw the future of stock
trading in Europe into disarray and reflected the frustrations of
melding financial markets with differing regulations, practices and
monetary systems.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffes and misunderstandings about how the two exchanges would
combine have plagued the merger plan since it was announced less
than five months ago. Doubts about whether the merger would proceed
as envisioned intensified after OM Gruppen, the company that runs
Sweden's stock market, began a hostile takeover bid for the London
exchange in August. The doubts grew further Monday, when the
Deutsche Borse, parent of the Frankfurt exchange, canceled a
shareholder vote meant to ratify the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The London exchange explained its decision to terminate the
merger by saying it would allow exchange officials to concentrate
on thwarting the hostile bid by OM Gruppen.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed London-Frankfurt exchange, which was to have been
known as iX, had never gathered much support from professional
traders. The announcement Tuesday that London had pulled out was
greeted with approval by some of the plan's most ardent critics.
Many had been threatening to vote the London exchange's top
executives out of office at a shareholders meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty happy about this,'' said Brian Winterflood,
founder of Winterflood Securities, a retail broker. ``If they
hadn't done this, we're quite sure they would've been voted out of
office.''
</P>
<P>
   A London-Frankfurt partnership has not been ruled out at a later
date, said people close to the situation, although they added that
the iX plan would not necessarily be revived in its current form
should the London exchange succeed in fending off Swedish interest.
More likely, a revised plan that more closely addresses shareholder
concerns could be crafted, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the London exchange said the decision to
abandon iX was motivated by timing. Under the terms of the
proposal, iX must be completed by Dec. 31, a deadline the
spokeswoman said was unreasonable given the time required to fight
OM's hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is possible that relations between London and Frankfurt
have worn too thin to be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   From its inception, iX has faced a series of strategic,
political and public relations blunders.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of iX has been particularly sensitive.
Constituents in London and Frankfurt felt shortchanged by the 50-50
merger and members of each argued that their exchange was worth
more. Meanwhile, the decision to split the market between blue
chips in London and high growth stocks in Frankfurt was equally
grating. Porsche, the German automobile company, refused to list in
London, while many British technology companies said they were
uncomfortable listing in Frankfurt and being subject to German
regulations, which differ from British guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey conducted by Granville Baird, an investment banking
group in London, only 17 percent of technology firms supported the
iX proposal, while only 5 percent of institutional investors said
they were in favor of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal was first announced last May, both sides agreed
that all stocks listed on the combined exchange, even those traded
in London, would be denominated in euros. That angered British
traders who thought there was a hidden motive to force Britain into
adopting the single European currency, a sensitive political issue
here.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest blunder came in the form of an internal
memo meant for London Stock Exchange press officers that was
inadvertently leaked last May. It contained instructions on how to
field questions from reporters in the event that iX collapsed.
</P>

   EUROPE-FUEL _ LONDON _ Protests over high fuel prices
intensified across Europe on Tuesday as demonstrations snarled
traffic and cut services. The protests were especially fierce in
Britain, where Prime Minister Tony Blair was standing firm against
tax cuts during the biggest political crisis of his tenure.

   SUBLIMINAL-AD _ A look at the subliminal advertising claims and
counterclaims over the years: how they work, do they work and what
do the political experts (pro and con) in the field say about them.
The ads have come a long way since Kevin Nealon's old skit on
Saturday Night Live. George W. Bush on Tuesday dismissed as
``bizarre and weird'' an allegation that a Republican Party ad
criticizing his opponent's Medicare plan contained the hidden word
``rat'' as a subliminal message. ``They'll read everything into
anything,'' Bush said of his Democratic opponents during a stop in
West Palm Beach, Fla. (Scott, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25

Doc had so quickly diagnosed the secondary problem. After all, he'd
done just fine with the first. Biddy was suffering from a urinary
tract irritation. Antibiotics and a change of diet cleared that up.
My ailment, on the other hand, is much more complicated. In fact, I
suspect the medication has not yet been discovered that will

million. The company expects the declining orders to reduce third
quarter earnings by 5 cents to 7 cents a share. In addition,
Caraustar said lower orders will force it to immediately close its

million. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

during Heritage Weekend, Sept. 15-17 at the Folk Art Center of the
Southern Highland Craft Guild in Asheville, N.C. This 20th annual
contest, pure whimsy for the whole family, is based on skill in
operating a handmade mountain toy of two sticks of whittled
rhododendron and a propeller. The object is to slide one stick

   DDN-DEATHMAIN _ DAYTON, Ohio - Although she had complained of
pain in her shoulders and back for half a year, Sandi Hughes wasn't
diagnosed with lung cancer until the disease had reached her brain
and paralyzed her legs. At age 43, and with two adolescent
daughters in her sole care, Hughes suddenly had no job and no
family support system at a time when she was facing a terminal
disease. She called on her unemployed husband, from whom she had
been separated for six years. In May, he moved her from Alabama to
his home in Fairborn, where family members, especially Hughes'
15-year-old daughter, Jennifer, cared for her in a tiny, ramshackle
house. For hours at a time, Jennifer and her 12-year-old
half-sister, Stephanie, were alone in sharing for their mother and,
at times, had no food in the house. (Dayton Daily News). MOVED.

   DDN-VETS _ When he was just 18, Harold Johnson served his
country proudly in Vietnam as an infantry sergeant, only to be
exposed by his own government to a toxic chemical, Agent Orange,
that would kill him some 30 years later. Days before his death from
lung cancer last week, Johnson, 51, said he was no longer angry
about what had happened to him in Vietnam. The Dayton VA provides a
full range of end-of-life services to eligible veterans, at reduced
or no cost, depending on their eligibility. (Dayton Daily News).

various stages of undress all over the newsstands. Others grin and
bare it on calendars that generate charitable contributions along

   OLY-LUEPNITZ _ Glen Luepnitz remembers the moment when, out of
the blue, he received a call from Richar Quick, head coach for the
U.S. women's swim team. Quick, the former coach of the University
of Texas women's swim team, had heard about Luepnitz's work with
athletes while visiting a daughter in Austin. He asked Luepnitz if
he would consider working with some of Quick's swimmers and provide
advice on nutrition and supplements. ``I had just finished firing a
couple of my patients,'' Luepnitz recalled. ``I had great suspicion
they were cheating. So, I kind of read him the riot act. I told him
if I found athletes who were cheating, I would turn them in. And I
said if he knew they were cheating, I'd turn him in.'' When the
response was silence, Luepnitz figured the conversation, and the
opportunity, were &QR;  over. Quick finally said, ``Twenty-five years I
have been trying to find someone who would say that.'' Thus began
an unlikely partnership that has been extremely productive, even as
it has become somewhat controversial. A week ago, the Houston
Chronicle ran a story charging that Luepnitz had obtained his
doctorate at a diploma mill. (Maher, Austin American-Statesman)

   FBN-FALCONS-DEFENSE _ The Falcons defensive strategy in the
first two games focused on applying pressure to the quarterback
with several blitz packages. But the strategy eventually backfired.
The Falcons allowed an average of 35 points in the two games and
needed 36 points in the opener to defeat San Francisco. Defensive
coordinator Rich Brooks admitted that the team will try a different
strategy Sunday against Carolina with less blitzing and more
traditional play. But will that be enough for the struggling unit?

   MADONNA-MUSIC (Undated) _ The notion of an objective, natural
reality, separate from human intervention, was damaged beyond
repair in the 20th century. It was besieged on all sides by art,
philosophy and technology: by Cubism and post-modernism, by film
and sound recording, by television and synthesizers, by video games
and plastic surgery, by all the gizmos of the computer era. Any
separation between natural and artificial has grown fuzzy and, in
practice, irrelevant. Now, everyone lives on the cusp of the
physical and the virtual. That's the running joke, though some
might call it a subtext, on Madonna's new album, ``Music,'' her
latest foray into electronica. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   MEHTA-MUSIC (New York) _ Zarin Mehta took over as the
orchestra's executive director just after Labor Day, replacing
Deborah Borda, who decamped last December for a similar position
with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And with the kinds of
difficulties American orchestras face today, Mehta may well prove
the more important catch. At 61, he is considered a star in the
small world of classical-music management. By Peter Oestreich.

   FILM-EXORCIST (Undated) _ ``The Exorcist'' is back in a new,

22. When William Friedkin's ``Exorcist,'' based on William Peter
Blatty's best-selling theological-horror novel, opened, on Dec. 26,
1973, it was not only the movie event of that Christmas season, but
it also became the dominant pop-culture phenomenon of the final
days of Richard Nixon's presidency. One wouldn't want to make too
much of this. By Terrence rafferty.

   FILM-DANCER (Undated) _ ``Dancer in the Dark,'' the film chosen
to open the New York Film Festival, is a musical about the battle
music wages for the soul's transformation amid the din of life. By
Ann Powers.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-ARCAND (Undated) _ When Denys Arcand stepped onto the red
carpet at Toronto's Roy Thomson Hall last week, he had reached the
end of a long road. His first major film in seven years,
``Stardom,'' was the opening-night offering at the Toronto
International Film Festival, and Arcand, a French-Canadian
Montrealer, was enjoying a welcome reserved for native sons. But
the premiere represented more than a jubilant return. By Murray

   TV-GIRLS (Undated) _ ``Generation O!'' made its debut on Aug. 26

season of extraordinary girl power in animation: At least eight
shows having their premieres in 2000 have female leads, radically
altering the entire landscape of television for kids. By Ted Loos.

   HOUSTON-ARCHITECTURE (Houston) _ Here in Texas, a one-time

discomfort. By Herbert Muschamp.

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COMPANY-OF-MEN-DANCE (Undated) _ As Charles Wright sees it, one
of the greatest disparities between men and women has to do with
touch. ``Women have the freedom to touch in public, and men
don't,'' Wright, the artistic director of the Dance Space Center,
says. His solution, In the Company of Men, is a series devoted to
the theme of men. Now in its fifth season, the program is a
celebration of the dynamic of men dancing together, in both joyous
and virtuosic terms. By Gia Kourlas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PHOTOGRAPHY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-PHOTOGRAPHY (New York) _ A glimpse of vanguard modernism
in photography, which has been studiously neglected and probably
largely unknown by historians, may be caught in the gallery of the
Mexican Cultural Institute in Manhattan , in a quiet and elegant
little show called ``Otras Cosas: Abstract Photography.'' By Vicki
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FISHMAN-ART (Undated) _ in the 1970s, process art, with links to
abstraction and minimalism, called attention to how artists
manipulated their chosen media; sometimes finished objects looked
like specimens from testing labs for industrial materials-which was
exactly their point. In the American painter Louise Fishman's work,
the lessons of those past eras and the challenges that emerged from
the artistic self-awareness they awakened are still discernible. By

<P>
   TRAVEL-LONDON-THEATER (London) _ Want a big theatrical success?
Hire yourself a celebrity, preferably a film star. This blunt
wisdom has recently brought Kevin Spacey, Cate Blanchett, Nicole
Kidman and others to London, and, with Jerry Hall replacing
Kathleen Turner as the seductive Mrs. Robinson, is currently
ensuring that an adaptation of ``The Graduate'' is packing the
Gielgud Theater. And the trend is set to continue this fall. By
Benedict Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-AMSTERDAM (Undated) _ As Dutch as tulips and considerably
more fun, bicycles _ or fietsen, as they're called in Amsterdam _
are ideally suited to the brick-paved canal streets of the old
central city and to the flat landscape surrounding the urban area.
They're everywhere: chained to bridges, parked by the hundreds
outside Central Station, rolling steadily by (often with one or two
small passengers aboard) as you sit in outdoor cafes. By Judith
Yarnall.

<P>
   TRAVEL-EUROPE-AIRPORTS (Paris) _ The fatal crash of a supersonic
Concorde northeast of Paris on July 25 has renewed debate over the
construction of a third major airport to serve the French capital.
The fact that the Concorde could easily have come down on top of a
small town, with even more than the four deaths that resulted among
people on the ground, is also raising questions about the safety of
existing airports in or near cities, about their further
development and about the location of future airports elsewhere in

   HURRICANE FLOYD ANNIVERSAY
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-ANNIVERSARY _ A look back a year after North Carolina's
most expensive natural disaster, Hurricane Floyd. (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-RESCUE _ Floyd tested emergency responders' ability to
handle a disaster of such proportions. They had to rely on
assistance from the state, the military and grassroots volunteer
efforts helped them rescue victims, provide relief and maintain
order. The logistics involved in coordinating such disparate
agencies led to separated families and a confused and angered
public who were unable to reach supplies and/or banned from
returning to their homes. How will emergency managers handle things
differently next time. (Greenville Daily Reflector).
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-SHELTERS _ Sheltering thousands of flood victims for weeks
on end tested officials with the Department of Social Services and
the Red Cross. Until Floyd, the system had never sheltered more
than a few hundred people for just a day or two. Things were
particularly bad in first week. Food and other supplies were short
north of the river and conditions were cramped all over. Grassroots
efforts based in Grifton and Bethel sustained victims and helped
bail out authorities. What did they learn from the experience and
how will they handle it differently next time? (Greenville Daily

JEFFERSON GETS HIS WISH:   AT LAST, A DECENT BOTTLE   OF VIRGINIA
WINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Mass., Calif., Italy, France)   (Editors: A list of places where Virginia wine may be purchased
appears at end of 2nd take.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BARBOURSVILLE, Va. _ Luca Paschina and a few other Virginia
farmers are succeeding in one of the few endeavors at which Thomas
Jefferson failed: winemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was one of the greatest of all Americans. He drafted
much of the noble language of the Declaration of Independence. As
president, he doubled the land area of the United States with the
Louisiana Purchase of 1803. He founded the University of Virginia
and designed its main buildings, which have held their place ever
since among the masterworks of American architecture. His books,
purchased by the government, formed the basis of the Library of
Congress, one of the world's greatest collections.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the nation's first connoisseur of fine wines. During
his five years in Europe, as ambassador to France from 1784 to
1789, he tasted and ordered that continent's best bottles, often at
the wineries where they were made. Names familiar today _ Volnay
and Meursault, Yquem and Margaux, Hermitage and Johannisberg _ are
in his journals.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Jefferson's old age at Monticello, when his means were
limited, his passion for the grape continued unabated. Between
January 1822 and February 1824, he and his guests consumed 1,203
bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
   But Jefferson was a flop as a winemaker. During his time in
Paris, he rooted cuttings from the Clos de Vougeot in his garden on
the Champs-Elysees, and later he planted vineyards at Monticello.
Though he grew grapes for 55 years in the hills of Albemarle
County, Va., James M. Gabler writes in ``Passions: The Wines and
Travels of Thomas Jefferson'' (Bacchus Press, 1995) that there is
no evidence Jefferson ever produced a single bottle of wine. He was
thwarted by untimely freezes and phylloxera, the root-eating louse.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he remained convinced that the potential was there.
He wrote in 1811 to John Dortie, ``We have every soil, aspect and
climate of the best wine countries, and I have myself drunk wines
made in this state and in Maryland of the quality of the best
Burgundy.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend and collaborator Filippo Mazzei, who was born in
Tuscany, agreed. He wrote in 1816, ``I do not believe that nature
is so favorable to growing vines in any country as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine of dubious potability was made at Jamestown as early as
1609; David Lett, the Oregon pinot noir pioneer, tells me that his
forebears planted Corinth grapes there. Between the end of the
Civil War and the turn of the last century, Virginia claret, based
on a native grape propagated by and named for a prominent Richmond
physician named Norton, achieved a measure of renown, but by 1930
those vines had all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two centuries after Jefferson's heyday, wines of quality
are at last being produced from classic vinifera grapes here at
Barboursville, only 20 miles northeast of Monticello, and other
vineyards scattered around the state. None is yet the equal of
``the best Burgundy,'' or even close to it, and regrettably few are
available outside Virginia and the District of Columbia. Even in
the commonwealth, it is hard to find the much-honored Valhalla reds
(like a cabernet franc called Goetterdaemerung and a shiraz) that
Dr. James Vascik, a neurosurgeon, produces 2,000 feet above the
Roanoke Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best vineyards produce less than 5,000 cases a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jefferson would have cheered. The best of the Virginia
wines are fresh, graceful, deeply colored and full of varietal
character. Those produced at Barboursville Vineyards, where
Paschina, 38, is the general manager and winemaker, are among the
most widely praised in the state, and they are available in New
York, Boston, Chicago, Washington and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   They come from grapes grown in fields surrounding the intensely
romantic red-brick ruin of a house designed by Jefferson and built
between 1814 and 1822 for his friend James Barbour, a governor of
Virginia, a senator and later an ambassador to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a recent tasting, the 1998 Barboursville Cabernet
Sauvignon Reserve, which will be released in late October, shows
every sign of developing into the best wine of the vineyard's first
two decades _ no one-dimensional fruit bomb, but focused, complex
and balanced in the European style.
</P>
<P>
   Paschina, a tall, lean, sharp-featured man with lively gray
eyes, came here as a consultant for the 1990 harvest. The vineyard
had been started in 1976 by Gianni Zonin, a Tuscan with holdings in
the Chianti region, Friuli, Piedmont, Lombardy and Sicily. He
spotted the property on a vacation trip to Charlottesville, ran
some analyses of its soil and of the prevailing climate, and
grabbed it. He was attracted to the lay of the land, Paschina said,
and by the fact that some of it had long since been cleared of
trees for use as a pasture for cows and hence could be planted
immediately with vines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the history of the place, the Jefferson connection,
the ruins all interested him, too,'' Paschina added. ``He's an
Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 15 years, Barboursville produced mediocre wine.
That is my view, having tasted some of the early vintages, and it
is Paschina's as well. To him, ``they really didn't amount to very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   To me, some exhibited a bouquet redolent of gym socks.
</P>
<P>
   Paschina had decided to return to his native region, Piedmont,
in northwestern Italy, when his contract was up. Progress, he had
concluded, would be very slow. But one night just before leaving,
he sat on the deck of his house, watching the sun set as a flock of
Canada geese flew above the orderly, well-tended rows of vines. He
was enchanted by the scene.
</P>
<P>
   This is idyllic, deeply rural country, with but a few crossroads
villages. The enigmatic Blue Ridge lie off to the west, cloaked in
the haze that gives them their name. White-fenced horse farms, some
owned by actors and actresses who have sought refuge here, give the
landscape a patrician flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Paschina was fated to be here. Piedmont is a region of
rolling hills at the foot of the Alps; this part of Virginia, also
known as the Piedmont, is an area of rolling hills at the foot of
the Blue Ridge. Maybe that's sloppy sentimentality. At any rate, he
went back to Italy, presented his report to Zonin, and three days
later returned to Barboursville as its manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year,'' he told me, ``I pruned all winter long with
the people here. They had no idea how to do it. I changed the
system of trellising, and gradually we built up our knowledge of
the conditions here. Gradually better vines became available, and
we learned which ones would do best here.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone who succeeds at his hard trade, Paschina, a
graduate of the oenological school at Alba, near Turin, ruthlessly
ripped out older, lower-quality vines, some of which had originally
come from upstate New York, in favor of higher-quality material
from California, Italy and France. Just recently, he uprooted 18
acres. He decided to change rootstock. He began rigorously
stripping smaller clusters of grapes from the vines, discarding
them so that all the plant's energy would be focused on producing
prime clusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old vines made pretty good wines,'' he said as he, my
wife, Betsey, and I bumped along the rutted vineyard roads in his
car. ``But they were never going to make great wines.''
</P>
<P>
   In between his pruning forays and his other vineyard chores,
Paschina travels widely through the region, promoting his wines. At
one tasting at the Boar's Head Inn in Charlottesville in 1991, he
met Patricia Yetman, who was working in computer engineering. The
next year, they were married in front of the Barboursville ruins,
and they now have two children, age 6 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Barboursville Vineyards covers 120 of Zonin's 870
acres, which are divided between Jefferson's Albemarle County and
James Madison's Orange County. A new restaurant, called Palladio,
is part of a complex of low, handsome buildings. In 1999, the
winery produced 28,000 cases; in 2000, it will make about 32,000
cases. Eventually, Paschina hopes to plant up to 150 acres, which
should yield roughly 50,000 cases. So what are his prospects of
making the great wine he covets?
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia producers have climate problems that may keep them
from reaching the heights,'' said Jean-Pierre Rovani, who studies
East Coast wines for Robert M. Parker Jr., the wine critic.
``There's too much humidity, which can cause mildew, and hurricanes
and storms roar up the coast some years at the critical point of
the growing cycle. Heavy rain when you least want it.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Rovani suggested that Barboursville Vineyards, of all
the Virginia producers, ``may have the most promise of
excellence.'' (MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   William C. Curtis, who is the proprietor of Tastings, a
Charlottesville wine shop, and is a leading authority on Virginia
wines, attributes the improvement at Barboursville to Zonin's money
as well as Paschina's ``drive, energy, youth and enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he thinks that growing conditions may in the long run
prove to be better in the Shenandoah Valley, where temperatures run
9 or 10 degrees cooler than here, he now puts Barboursville's in
his ``upper pantheon'' of wines, along with those of tiny vineyards
like White Hall, west of here; Breaux and Linden, in northern
Virginia; Rockbridge, in the Shenandoah Valley; and Valhalla, near
Roanoke.
</P>
<P>
   Other vineyards that have won high ratings in one competition or
another are Oakencroft, near Charlottesville, run by the doyenne of
the Virginia wine trade, Felicia Warburg Rogan; Horton, a viognier
specialist that also produces a historically interesting but, to my
taste, rather off-putting Norton; and Jefferson, whose grapes grow
on the site of Mazzei's experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The best Virginia wines are the reds, in my view, although
whites made most of the running in the 1980s and early 1990s, and
some chardonnays are still very well regarded. The biggest
shortcoming in the group as a whole is a certain lack of the acidic
backbone essential to outstanding wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting good, deep, mature tannins in our reds is difficult,''
said Jane Rouse of Rockbridge, ``and we aren't going to succeed
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of its competitors, Barboursville produces a whole
range of wines, including dry whites (chardonnay, viognier and
pinot grigio), sweet whites (malvasia and phileo, a blend of muscat
canelli and four other grapes) and dry reds (including cabernet
sauvignon, cabernet franc, merlot, sangiovese, barbera and
nebbiolo). Paschina and other Virginia growers argue that local
conditions are especially well suited for cabernet franc, which is
a secondary grape in the wines of the Medoc but the dominant grape
in great St.-Emilions like Cheval Blanc and Figeac and in Loire
Valley reds like Chinon.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of professionals like Paschina in the 1990s, either
as consultants or as resident winemakers, has vastly improved
quality.
</P>
<P>
   By now, there are more than 60 Virginia wineries, a startling
increase from the six lonely pioneers of 1979, and the state
government runs an active wine marketing program. A decade behind
Oregon, perhaps, still subject to wide variations from one vintage
to the next, the Virginia wine industry may be the most significant
of the ``emerging nations'' of American viticulture.
</P>
<P>
   A selection of Virginia wines is available at Tastings, William
C. Curtis' shop at 502 East Market Street in Charlottesville, Va.,
(804) 293-3663. Next to the shop is a small restaurant (dinner
only) with 250 wines by the glass, usually including several from
Virginia; wine in the shop's stock may be ordered at retail price
plus a $5 corkage fee.
</P>
<P>
   A fair number of Virginia wines appear on the wine lists of two
of the state's outstanding restaurants: the Inn at Little
Washington, at Main and Middle Streets in Washington, Va., (540)
675-3800, an hour and a half west of Washington, D.C., in the
shadow of the Blue Ridge, and Metropolitain, at 214 West Water
Street in Charlottesville, (804) 977-1043.
</P>
<P>
   Barboursville wines cost roughly $12 to $30 retail. Among
sources for the wines are Morrell &AMP; Co. in New York City, (212)
688-9370; Central Liquors in Washington, D.C., (202) 737-2800;
Pop's Wine and Spirits, 256 Long Beach Road, Island Park, N.Y.,
(516) 431-0025; and Mall Discount Liquors and Wines in Cambridge,
Mass., (617) 864-7171.

SYNAGOGUE OPENS NEAR HOLOCAUST-ERA DEATH CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSWIECIM, Poland _ For the first time since World War II, a
synagogue opened on Tuesday in the vicinity of the Auschwitz death
camp, and was hailed as a symbol of the healing of the
long-troubled relationship between Poles and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the small synagogue, ransacked by the Nazis and
later used as a carpet warehouse under Poland's post-war communist
government, Jewish leaders, Polish ministers and even a Jordanian
prince gathered to hear messages of reconciliation, including a
call from President Clinton to act with ``principle and purpose''
on the lessons of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere of goodwill was clouded slightly by the fact
that the synagogue's opening came a few weeks after that of a large
discotheque, located about a mile closer to the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish organizations, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Los Angeles, have protested that the discotheque ``in the immediate
vicinity of the largest Jewish graveyard in history'' amounts to an
affront, but local authorities have said that they can do little
because the dance club is on private property, a mile from the
Auschwitz-Birkenau complex.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties appeared to capture the tensions between the
desires of the living, particularly Polish youth, and the shadow of
the dead, including more than a million murdered Jews, in a
provincial Polish town stained forever by what the Nazis did
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better, and normal, that young people go and dance than
that they make trouble,'' said Klaudia Zaor, an 18-year-old
student. ``Sometimes we have the impression that the Jews just want
this town to die.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, she watched, with an amused twinkle in her green
eyes, as the ceremony at the synagogue proceeded. Speaker after
speaker referred to a restoration of life. The sun shone with a
late-summer glow on the newly painted cream-yellow walls of the
refurbished building, the only place of Jewish worship not entirely
destroyed by the Nazi onslaught in 1939 on the town of Oswiecim _
the Polish name for Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was this modest southwestern Polish town, whose Jewish
minority numbered 7,000 in 1939, that gave the German version of
its name to the adjacent camp.
</P>
<P>
   Not one Jew now lives in Oswiecim _ the last survivor died in
May. But the synagogue will serve as a place of prayer and
reflection for the many Jewish visitors to the Auschwitz camp. No
rabbi is to be permanently attached to the synagogue, so any formal
services must be organized in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The past, post-Communist, decade has brought a modest Jewish
revival in Poland. Fred Schwartz, the New York businessman who
raised $3 million for the new synagogue, said he backed the
building in part because ``the ashes at the camp communicated
nothing of the life that had been here.''
</P>
<P>
   His initiative was repeatedly applauded by more than 100 people
at a three-hour ceremony on Tuesday. The U.S. ambassador,
Christopher Hill, read a letter from Clinton that said that the
synagogue would serve ``as a place for contemplation where future
generations can reflect on the world they lost.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Poland's prime minister, Jerzy Buzek, was read by
the chief of the Polish chancellery, Maciej Musial. In notably
stark language, Buzek said that Jews had been ``sentenced to be
burned at the stake by the Nazis,'' but that the attempt at
annihilation had failed and the synagogue showed that ``those who
save traditions save a culture.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Poles and Jews have proved difficult in the
post-war years. They have been clouded by the competitive
victimhood of two peoples that both suffered terribly at the hands
of the Nazis, by the intermittent anti-Semitism of the Polish
communist government, by the sometimes hostile attitude of Poland's
Catholic Church, and by the fact that the epicenter of the Nazi
killing-machine for Jews lay in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   But these difficulties have come a long way toward resolution in
recent years, and the ceremony on Tuesday included an emotional
speech by the local bishop and an equally warm evocation of
Polish-Jewish relations by Marek Siwiec, the national security
adviser to the Polish president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Saying that the dignity of the victims of the Holocaust had
always remained intact but that ``our own dignity needed to be
restored,'' Bishop Tadeusz Rakoczy praised the synagogue as a place
of ``meeting and hope.'' He concluded with a simple greeting:
``Shalom.''
</P>
<P>
   Siwiec said the synagogue, flanked by a cultural center filled
with photographs of the town's pre-war Jewish life, was a ``symbol
of the links between Poles and Jews'' and a sign of a shared
determination ``to close an age of pain and sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But some problems remain. The furor over the disco, situated in
a former tannery where camp inmates worked and died, follows
conflicts over crosses erected outside Auschwitz to commemorate
Catholic victims and over a Carmelite convent. All but one of the
crosses _ the largest _ have now been removed; the convent closed
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The government denounced the disco last week, saying that
``amusement places should not be located at areas marked with the
suffering of the inmates of former death and concentration camps.''
But it also said it could not order the club's closure because
``the disco and the land under it are both private property.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafal Waliczek, the club's owner, has also made this point,
arguing that it lies well beyond the 100-yard-deep zone around the
camp in which all commercial activity is banned and that his
premises are not the original tannery, as most historians contend,
but a factory erected in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jozef Krawczyk, the town's mayor, met representatives
of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which has demanded the disco's
immediate closure, and said the town needed money from
international organizations or the government to compensate
Waliczek and buy the building. He said he was confident that the
problem would be solved.
</P>
<P>
   Krawczyk avoided any reference to the controversy in a speech on
Tuesday that focused on reconciliation. He was followed by Prince
El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, the brother of the late King
Hussein, who made an impassioned plea for people of all religions
to ``make a commitment to our common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   He was profusely thanked by Shevach Weiss, the chairman of the
Yad Vashem Memorial in Jerusalem, who said the prince's presence
was a moving ``symbol of the continuity of making peace, of
solidarity in its pursuit, and of understanding of what happened
before.''

&HT;     FEC SAYS $12.6 MILLION IN ELECTION MONEY BELONGS TO BUCHANAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Election Commission on Tuesday awarded
Pat Buchanan $12.6 million in disputed federal election funds owed
the Reform Party's presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   However, Buchanan, whose campaign is nearly bankrupt, still
faces more battles over the money with his rival for the party's
nomination, John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-1 vote, the commission said Hagelin, an Iowa physicist
who is also the presidential candidate for the Natural Law Party,
failed to prove that he was the Reform Party candidate on at least
10 state ballots _ a minimum requirement for claiming that party's
election funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin submitted the requisite documents, but FEC auditors said
he was the nominee of the Natural Law Party, not the Reform Party,
in six of the states he listed. Hagelin attorneys argued that the
Natural Law Party and the Reform Party are the same in those six
states. The auditors disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan submitted documents showing he is on the Reform Party
ballot line in Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Idaho, Maryland, New
Jersey, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my vantage point, only one candidate meets our standard:
Pat Buchanan,'' said FEC Vice Chairman Danny Lee MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   The nominee is entitled to the money because Ross Perot, the
party's standard-bearer in 1996, received 8 percent of the
presidential vote, exceeding the commission's 5 percent
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's sister and campaign chairwoman, Bay Buchanan, said
her brother wants to use the money on radio and TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in pretty good shape as long as the money comes in this
week,'' she said. ``I think we'll have a strong opening next
Monday.'' Her brother, whose campaign was interrupted by two gall
bladder operations last month, is scheduled to resume speech-making
Monday in South Carolina, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan announced earlier this week that he had beefed up his
campaign staff and has hired Love Advertising Inc. of Houston to
produce his ads.
</P>
<P>
   But he will likely have to wait for the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin has 15 days to ask the commission to reconsider its
decision, which he has said he would do if the FEC ruled against
him.
</P>
<P>
   If the FEC again favors Buchanan, Hagelin can file an appeal in
federal court, which his spokesman, Robert Roth, said he would do.
``This will only be resolved in the court of appeals,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion over which candidate legitimately represents the
Reform Party began last month when its national convention in Long
Beach, Calif., disintegrated in shoving matches between delegates
with differing loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan won more votes in his convention than Hagelin did at a
rump convention. Hagelin supporters accused Buchanan of massive
vote fraud, but on Tuesday the FEC commissioners agreed not to
investigate the fraud claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the authority or capabilities to conduct a long
investigation into party's rules,'' FEC Chairman Darryl R. Wold
said. ``If Mr. Hagelin chooses to appeal our decision in a court of
law, then this matter could be looked into properly,'' Wold said.
</P>
<P>
   The only dissenting voice came from Commissioner Karl J.
Sandstrom, who objected to what he called the FEC's ``rush to
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan joined the Reform Party last year after bolting from
the Republican Party, which twice denied him its nomination.

AMERICAN AIRLINES TO REARRANGE FLIGHTS AT DALLAS AND CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   by LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines, the nation's second-largest airline, said
Tuesday that it would rearrange flights at its two largest hubs to
improve its overall reliability after this summer's high number of
delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   American said it would slow the number of arrivals and
departures and add more time between connecting flights at its hubs
in Dallas and Chicago. And in a bolder step, the airline plans to
``isolate'' its operations at O'Hare International Airport in
Chicago, which it said was one of its most unreliable hubs, so that
delays there will not upset its flights elsewhere in the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing, in fact, is building a firewall between our
O'Hare operation and the rest of our network, so if there's a
snowstorm in Chicago, it won't affect your flight from New York to
Dallas,'' said Donald J. Carty, the chief executive of AMR Corp.,
American's parent.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, which will take effect Oct. 1, appear to take into
account criticisms made by the Federal Aviation Administration, air
traffic controllers and some members of Congress that the major
airlines contribute to delays by scheduling more flights at peak
hours than the air traffic system can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accusation that airlines overschedule is absolutely
true,'' Carty said Tuesday at a meeting with securities analysts in
New York. His statement contradicted the long-held position of the
Air Transport Association, the airline industry lobby, whose
current chairman is none other than Carty himself.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As delays have increased in recent years, other airlines have
also tried revamping their schedules to improve on-time performance
_ with mixed results. For example, at Newark International Airport,
Continental Airlines has shifted flights frequented mostly by
holiday travelers to off-peak times to relieve congestion during
the busy morning and afternoon hours, when business travelers most
want to fly. Newark has now moved from being the airport with the
most number of delays to being the fourth worst, said Greg
Brenneman, Continental's president.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, the country's largest airline, extended the
scheduled length of all its flights this summer after it
experienced a steep decline in on-time performance. Indeed, the
Transportation Department's inspector general recently concluded
that such schedule stretching over the last decade had succeeded in
masking how greatly airline delays have grown.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Carty said that American planned to eliminate some morning
flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, its biggest
hub, and extend its operations at the airport by about 30 minutes
each day to give its passengers and employees ``a little bit more
breathing room.''
</P>
<P>
   American had been making minor changes to its schedule to make
it run more smoothly for years. Finally, several months ago, its
operations staff decided to start from scratch. After running
sophisticated computer models, they were surprised to learn that
they could make changes that would not only increase on-time
performance but also enable their jets to spend more time in the
air carrying passengers, a measure of efficiency closely tracked by
airlines who pay tens of millions of dollars for each airplane.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Carty said that the changes at O'Hare would enable
American to fit nine more flights into its schedule using the same
number of aircraft it flies today.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting off its O'Hare flights from the rest of its nationwide
network means that American jets will fly back and forth between
Chicago and their destinations rather than connecting to other
airports from Chicago, as they do now.
</P>
<P>
   For many passengers, the changes may be invisible. ``The guy in
Burbank who never understood why a snowstorm in Chicago affected
his flight to Atlanta will probably never know the difference
because his flight will now simply get to Atlanta,'' said Timothy
J. Doke, an American spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the improvements that will result from the changes
remains to be seen. And despite American's latest moves, Carty did
not hold out much hope that overall reliability of the airline
industry would improve significantly during future peak travel
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two summers are going to be pretty ugly,'' he said,
until some new air traffic control technology comes online. He
attributed much of this summer's problems to high demand, unusual
weather and a covert job action by pilots at United Airlines.
American suffered similar disruption last year when hundreds of its
pilots called in sick.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carty also commented on recent speculation that British Airways,
American's principal European partner, might be forced to back out
of its deal with American to complete its proposed merger with KLM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even absent the comprehensive deal we seek with BA, we are,
from an alliance standpoint, well positioned in Europe,'' he said,
referring to American's partnerships with Swissair and Sabena.
</P>
<P>
   The American-British Airways alliance has been stalled by
regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for four years because of
fears that it would give the two airlines too strong a position at
London's Heathrow Airport. KLM has a much closer partnership with
Northwest Airlines that would be difficult to unravel, leading many
analysts to believe that British Airways would link up with
Northwest instead of American.
</P>
<P>
   But Carty said that British Airways might find that buying KLM
would nullify the antitrust immunity now enjoyed by KLM and
Northwest, making a BA-KLM partnership less attractive.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: GETTING A WHIFF OF THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been to the future and it smells. It smells like.... But
I'm getting ahead of myself.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, technology has struggled to catch up with human
perception. The eye perceives motion, but until the 20th century,
mankind made do with static representations of the visual field.
The ear hears, but the first recordings did not come along until
the late 19th century, and films did not add sound until the 1920s.
And what about the nose?
</P>
<P>
   The nose, treated as a third-class citizen, is finally getting
the attention it deserves. And for food lovers, it's not a moment
too soon.
</P>
<P>
   The nasal perspective was given its due this week at a panel
discussion and demonstration organized by DigiScents, a company in
Oakland, Calif., that sees the Internet as one huge smelly online
opportunity. If its vision of the future is correct, every personal
computer will come with a plug-in apparatus, analogous to a
printer, that wafts odors in the general direction of the user's
nose. Users download images and sound. Why not smell?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a thundering herd of experts gathered in the Nose
Room of Trattoria dell'Arte in Midtown, ostensibly to thrash out
the olfactory issues, but actually to give the hard sell for the
company's smell machine, which it calls iSmell. Joel Bellenson, the
chief executive officer of DigiScents, led the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Two messages came across loud and clear. First, iSmell is a
wonderful thing and a boon to humankind. Perhaps not as important
as the wheel, but much more fun. Second, the human olfactory system
is enormously complex, underserved by industry and a potential gold
mine. Doron Lancet, the director of the Crown Human Genome Center
at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, pointed out that humans have
four genes for vision, but 1,000 genes that govern olfaction,
accounting for about 2 percent of the human gene total. We may eat
first with the eyes, but not very well, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the nose seems to lead more directly to the
emotions than the eye or ear. Avery Gilbert, the vice president of
sensory research and development at DigiScents, pointed out that
nonolfactory perception gets routed to the hypothalamus and then on
to the cortex for further analysis, while smells proceed directly
to the areas of the brain responsible for emotions and memories.
Gilbert, in a fanciful moment, looked forward to the day when
scientists would be able to generate ``the smell of fear and the
smell of success.'' That would be New York's official fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   We'll all have to wait for the smell of fear, which should be
ready just in time for ``Scream 12.'' I was ready to settle for a
whiff of orange. After the visionary talk was over, the audience
headed off to a demonstration of iSmell. By this point, I more or
less understood the principles involved.
</P>
<P>
   The magic machine contained a cassette with a ``palette'' of 128
chemical odors that could be combined to generate an almost
infinite number (actually, 10 to the 120th power) of smells by
software programmed with mathematical models of specific odors.
Users, by clicking on a mouse, could manipulate the mixture of
scents to create a signature perfume, or simply create new, weird
smells (and e-mail them). Or they could summon up a specific smell
corresponding to an image on the screen. Or they could passively
receive the smells encoded in, say, a game. Computer game companies
have jumped at the chance to do deals with DigiScents, which plans
to start selling iSmell early next year for $50 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   I could feel deep skepticism seeping into my every pore as the
futurefest proceeded. Smell-O-Vision was supposed to transform the
moviegoing experience, too. Where is it now? But sharper minds than
mine have sniffed at the new technology and they are not laughing.
Procter &AMP; Gamble, for example, recently signed an agreement with
DigiScents to share research. And other companies are following the
Internet scent trail.
</P>
<P>
   AromaJet.com is working with video game companies to add smell
as a sensory component to their products. A company called TriSenx
has developed scent-producing hardware, MultiSSENX, that it plans
to sell for less than $25. It has also developed a product called
FirstSENX that allows users to print scent sheets on cards or apply
flavors to a thin sheet of potato starch, a little like a communion
wafer.
</P>
<P>
   The implications for the food industry are mind-boggling.
Shopping online for truffles or barbecue sauce or fancy coffee
would become a multidimensional experience, involving smell and
sight. Restaurants could add aroma to their online menus. When
Mario Batali throws garlic in the pan on the Food Network, viewers
would not only hear it sizzle in the olive oil but smell the
intoxicating perfume.
</P>
<P>
   There were two iSmells to try. An early version looked like a
clock radio minus the face and dials. A long copper tube with a
nozzle at the end snaked over the box, ready to broadcast odor. I
sat down and looked at a laptop screen, where a woman was pouring
orange juice into a glass. A puff of air blew across my face,
bearing the unmistakable aroma of orange juice. There was a faintly
alcoholic undertone to the smell, as though it were an orange
perfume rather than a real orange, but the orangeness could not be
denied. It was there.
</P>
<P>
   Onscreen, the scene shifted. I was now entering a cave. A cave
that smelled like oranges. That was the problem with early iSmell:
an inability to shift gears quickly. Smoothing out that glitch led
to second-generation iSmell, a black box that looks a little like
an electric pencil sharpener outfitted with the tube from a
bronchial inhaler. The screen showed an online supermarket, with
the different departments represented by icons. I clicked on
pastry, then on a pecan pie. It smelled like a banana. Was this a
banana-pecan pie? I tried chocolate chip cookies. Banana again.
</P>
<P>
   Three possibilities suggested themselves. First, a banana had
bolted from the produce department and was hiding among the
pastries. Second, I suffered from a disorder in which sugar of any
kind triggered a banana response. Third, it's extremely difficult
to reproduce certain families of smells. Fear, yes. A chocolate
chip? Perhaps not in our lifetime. &QL;

&HT;     GLORIA STEINEM THE BRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thank you twice, Gloria Steinem.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers for more than three decades of crusading for the right of
women to hold decent jobs for decent pay.
</P>
<P>
   And fresh whoops for venturing now into a whole new area of
discrimination against women: the attitude that it's great for male
geezers to woo younger women but ridiculous for older females to
pant for similar romance. ``Over the (sexual) hill'' is a
pejorative frequently applied to women, but seldom to men.
</P>
<P>
   Good health care means we're all living longer in this country.
More and more people in their 70s, 80s and 90s enjoy productive and
happy lives.
</P>
<P>
   Steinem, the feminist pioneer who founded Ms. Magazine and
pushed relentlessly for social change, has been a glamorous symbol
of gender independence for decades. But when she wed a man five
years her junior earlier this month, she outraged female followers
who felt she had fatally compromised her well-publicized conviction
that marriage is a form of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The troops failed to get it. Steinem has found a new cause, and
hopefully a new happiness. Nothing wrong with that. Icons get to
change their minds just like other folks.
</P>
<P>
   Steinem is now 66, a senior citizen eligible for Social
Security. The equal rights momentum she helped build is virtually
on auto-pilot; no politician in his right mind would try to beat
back the practical gains that women have made.
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt me, ask that right-wing crowd at the 1992
Republican National Convention that mocked working women _ just
before women voters helped defeat the Republican candidate,
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Steinem's political role is less important now than it was in
the beginning of the women's movement, when she was one of very few
recognizable and socially acceptable voices. But she remains a
widely admired and thoughtful figure.
</P>
<P>
   She married David Bale, a 61-year-old businessman and animal
rights activist frequently identified as the father of actor
Christian Bale, a minor claim to fame by association that may have
prepared him for life as Mr. Gloria Steinem.
</P>
<P>
   I think what Steinem has done is an inspiration to all aging
women. She is implausibly slim and attractive, unlike many of us
who are her age and prone to plump tummies and wrinkly eyes. But we
can identify with her, by golly. She's still desirable! Love is
still out there!
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say her message that marriage subjugated women
was wrong. It is just slightly out of date.
</P>
<P>
   When Steinem burst upon the feminist scene in the 1960s, married
women could not retain their own names or get credit, hold
individual bank accounts, own property or do much of anything else
without their husbands' approval. Yet these barriers have fallen,
one by one, and young women today have forgotten how unfair it used
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Women stayed home to raise the children and men had all the
careers and fun. But nowadays husbands and wives decide together
how to handle their finances, where to live, how to care for their
families. It's still not a perfect division of labor, but it is a
lot more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   And if a partnership doesn't work, there's divorce practically
everywhere, which was not true in the early 1960s. (This is not an
endorsement but a bow to reality.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of her feminist allies, Steinem has never been a
man-hater. It was the enslaving institution of marriage, not the
sexual intimacy, she feared. She has had a series of romances,
including a highly visible one with the publisher of U.S News &AMP;
World Report, Mort Zuckerman. He went on to marry a much younger
woman, speedily have a baby and just as speedily divorce his new
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Doing what comes naturally, Steinem wrote a book dissecting her
ill-fated fascination with Zuckerman. She has already promised to
write about her new husband too. What a shame if she married to get
new material for a book.
</P>
<P>
   Instead let us hope the happy couple embodies the ideal of the
New Millenium Marriage, senior citizen category. Whatever happens,
they will defy tradition. They took their vows wearing jeans for
the ceremony, ready for anything in their seventh decade.

AN INDIAN IDYLL, FILMED IN SWITZERLAND, OF COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 By ELIZABETH OLSON 
 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENK, Switzerland _ In take after take, Preity Zinta pivoted
into the arms of Sunny Deol, bringing to life the heroic tale of an
Indian policeman's struggle to win the love of his life. A
30-member film crew hovered protectively to make sure that this
musical dream sequence, integral to Indian cinema, was captured in
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor scenes for the movie, ``Farz,'' which means duty,
were filmed in the Bernese Oberland in central Switzerland, a
tourist paradise of Alpine peaks and lakes. Many of the 800 to 900
films produced annually by the Indian movie industry are filmed at
such spectacular scenic Swiss locations.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for these long, lavish odes to romance with
diaphanous singing interludes is enormous, with millions of Indians
flocking to their village cinemas regularly for a few hours of
romantic escape. The movies are also exported abroad for an
estimated 25 million expatriate Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the films are considered wholesome family entertainment
because they have no sexually explicit scenes and usually have
happy endings. They are known as masala, a combination of spices,
for their blend of song-and-dance routines, glamorous stars,
romance and stylized action sequences.
</P>
<P>
   They draw so many expatriate Indians in the United States and
Britain that some theaters show Indian films exclusively. In Bern,
the Swiss capital, a movie house opened recently to cater not only
to immigrants but also to a growing number of Indian tourists who
travel to Switzerland to take in the scenery that has become so
familiar on the movie screen.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen movie crews can be found at any one time in the
Swiss Alps starting in late April or early May, when snow remains
on the mountains but the roads are passable. Typically, the crews
film for a week or two, mostly at ski resorts like Lenk, Gstaad,
Interlaken or St. Moritz.
</P>
<P>
   Deol, a screen idol in India, is best known for his roles in the
action films ``Border'' and ``Ghatah.'' Zinta has acted in films
for just three years but already has traveled to Switzerland for
five movies, among them ``Dil Se,'' described in The Sunday
Telegraph of London as a `` terrorist action musical adventure
film,'' and ``Kya Kehna,'' atypical in that it centers on an
unmarried pregnant woman who decides to have her baby.
</P>
<P>
   The latter two films spent longer on the Top 10 movie list in
Britain this year than ``Battlefield Earth'' with John Travolta and
``Saving Grace'' with Brenda Blethyn.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Indian films, ``Farz'' is a modern-day tale focusing
on the hopes and trials of middle-class people.
</P>
<P>
   Why pack off a crew of 30 and two stars to Switzerland, one of
the most expensive countries in the world? ``We can't get proper
glaciers in India, or proper facilities or weather,'' said N.R.
Pachisia, a co-producer of ``Farz.'' ``It's often too humid
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're not so comfortable going to Kashmir,'' the
disputed mountainous border region between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vikram Bhatt, in Switzerland to direct an as-yet-unnamed
drama about a couple fleeing what is now Pakistan during the
partitioning of British India, said that filming in Switzerland was
cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``India is far more costly because travel is more expensive,''
he said. ``Certain areas are difficult politically and mountains
are far.''
</P>
<P>
   In shooting picturesque village scenes, Indian producers rely on
local Swiss companies to obtain the necessary visas and government
approval, then negotiate with individual farmers or villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very bureaucratic here,'' said Bhatt, who is filming
near Gstaad. Swiss companies ferry crews around, provide Indian
food, attend to medical needs and, for Bhatt's movie, provide train
rails. The actors were filmed with the rails in the background as
if they were walking by while a train was stopped. Scenes with a
1947 train were added later in a Bombay studio.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that ``Farz'' will cost about $3 million; if it
is a hit, it will net $5 million, a small amount by Hollywood
standards but a comfortable cushion that will encourage the Indian
production company to pursue other foreign locations.
</P>
<P>
   Indian moviemakers are starting to film stories with scenes in
locations that are obviously not Indian, and Bern and London are
becoming especially popular sites.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the masala films offer resolutely beautiful fantasy
and outdoor scenes, leading to the question of whether the audience
knows that what is being shown a different country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's meant to be happening in India, but audiences know it's
not,'' said Raj Kanwar, director of ``Farz.'' ``Switzerland is the
most fantastic place from the pictorial point of view. It looks
just like Kashmir.''

JOHN VARVATOS REACHES OUT   TO THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the Gucci men's show in Milan earlier this summer,
Dylan McDermott, the actor who plays a Boston lawyer on ``The
Practice,'' sat in the front row in the kind of attenuated black
suit (Gucci) his character would only wear if he were delivering a
summation to 12 jury members putting together the next Whitney
Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   What came down the runway _ indulgent expressions of a momentary
Bruce Lee fascination _ wasn't for smug lawyers, either. As it
turned out, McDermott had already found some clothes for his
character to wear this season, and they were from a designer named
John Varvatos.
</P>
<P>
   Varvatos, who is showing his second men's collection on Thursday
morning in Bryant Park, where much of Fashion Week will be held, is
everything a new fashion star generally isn't.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the fact that he designs clothes for men rather
than women. Then there's the matter of his age, which is 45, not
26. Surely that is one reason he is so decidedly averse to the
zanily effete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few men's wear designers understand that regular blokes
do not want to look like hairdressers or skateboarders or street
hustlers,'' said Simon Doonan, creative director at Barneys New
York. Barneys has given Varvatos hundreds of square feet in its
Madison Avenue store, putting him in a league with the Dolce &AMP;
Gabannas, and Doonan is featuring Varvatos' fall clothes
prominently in the store's current advertising campaign. Varvatos
also received a lot of room for a new designer at Bergdorf Goodman
and at Saks Fifth Avenue, which were quick to pick him up after a
first collection that did not go unnoticed by the press.
</P>
<P>
   The designer's clothes seem intended for the kind of guy who has
moved into a salary bracket that no longer confines him to Banana
Republic. Varvatos, who garnered the award for best new designer of
men's wear at the American Fashion Awards in June, creates
masculine clothes. There are bulky knit sweaters, wide-leg pants
and topcoats _ made in Italy, not Taiwan _ with fabrics Varvatos
develops with his manufacturers. For his spring line, the
silhouettes are similar, this time with sweaters made of a
cashmere-linen blend.
</P>
<P>
   A native of suburban Detroit, Varvatos was the head men's wear
designer at both Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein before going out on
his own with backing from Nautica. Executives from Nautica in fact
called him seven years ago about starting a line, but Varvatos
turned them down. ``I decided my ego wasn't that big,'' he said.
Eventually, though, he started to see a real void in the men's
market, and when Nautica called him two years ago with the same
offer, he said yes. He also oversees Nautica's jeans line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the modern guy who shops at Prada and Gucci and Helmut
Lang,'' Varvatos said. ``And then there's the classic Armani
customer. But there's a guy in the middle and there isn't that much
out there for him.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a point Varvatos likes to make as he travels to stores
to rouse the sales people. ``Please take the time to go through the
collection because you can find great details to talk to the
customer about,'' he said to a group at Bergdorf Goodman a few
weeks ago as he picked up acoat with a built-in cell phone pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a business person as well as a designer,'' Varvatos said
later. ``Sometimes designers are brilliant creatively, but they
lose touch with what's happening at the store. You have to ring the
register.''

`ALMOST FAMOUS': WITH SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, A ROCK WRITER FINDS
HIS WAY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By   A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The power of popular music _ its ability to give shape, meaning
and intensity to the inexpressible emotions of daily life _ is
something of a motif in Cameron Crowe's career as a director. Think
of John Cusack hoisting his boombox aloft outside Ione Skye's
window in ``Say Anything'' or Tom Cruise hurtling down the highway
in ``Jerry Maguire,'' spinning the radio dial in search of a song
to suit his mood and happening upon Tom Petty's ``Free Falling.''
Crowe has always used rock not merely as soundtrack decoration but
also as a window into the souls of his characters.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Almost Famous,'' a loose, affectionate look back on his
earlier career as a teen-age music journalist, Crowe has devoted a
whole movie to the love of rock 'n' roll. The soul he lays open _ a
sweet, forgiving and generous one _ is his own. The movie follows
the adventures of William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a San Diego
15-year-old whose fairy-tale ascendance from nerdy schoolboy to
Rolling Stone reporter mirrors Crowe's own life story. But Crowe is
less interested in biographical or historical literalism _ he
freely mixes real and fictional characters and prefers period
atmosphere to period detail _ than in evoking the joyful, reckless,
earnest energy of rock in the years between 60s idealism and punk
nihilism.
</P>
<P>
   He may be the least cynical director working in Hollywood today.
In his hands this coming-of-age story is as much about the
preservation of William's innocence as its loss; the music William
loves protects him even as his involvement with it introduces him
to all manner of worldly corruption (including his deflowering by
three groupies in a Tennessee hotel room). He is introduced as an
articulate, somewhat anxious boy (played in the early scenes by
Michael Angarano), living with his rebellious older sister (Zooey
Deschanel) and their protective mother, a college professor
portrayed with glowing intelligence and scary intensity by Frances
McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is decidedly eccentric and a bit hysterical about
the evils of pop music (``They're obviously on drugs,'' she fumes,
pointing to the clean-cut portrait on the cover of Simon and
Garfunkel's ``Bookends''), McDormand's Elaine Miller is far from
the standard uptight movie mom. The bonds between her and William
are strong and complicated.
</P>
<P>
   As a screenwriter, Crowe is an unmatched comic portraitist who
rarely stoops to caricature, and as a director he has an
extraordinary gift for drawing out rounded, complex performances
even in supporting roles and for indicating the fine emotional
shadings in the relationships among his characters. What other
filmmaker is as devoted to the nuances of decency or as fascinated
by the subtle and complicated ways people can be nice to one
another?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, rock 'n' roll is not always about being nice.
``Almost Famous'' overflows with sympathy for the devil, but glides
over the demonic power and decadent excess that remain integral to
the music's allure and central to the rock star lifestyle. It's not
exactly that Crowe's script whitewashes the period: the plot hinges
on the sexual exploitation of female fans, and its turning point
involves a drug overdose. But while he acknowledges that human
beings can be cruel, self-destructive and dishonest, Crowe declines
to probe too deeply into the darkness and irrationality of the
human heart.
</P>
<P>
   This is fair enough and a welcome antidote to the chic
misanthropy that often masquerades as artistic seriousness, but
darkness and irrationality _ the thrill of sexual danger and
violent abandon _ are central to the film's subject, and its
handling of them sometimes feels timid and evasive.
</P>
<P>
   But this matters less than it might, thanks to Crowe's smart,
expansive script and an approach to visual storytelling that
becomes richer and more assured with every movie. ``Almost Famous''
is shaggier and less emotionally satisfying than ``Jerry Maguire''
_ by far the best romantic comedy of the 1990s _ but it teems with
high-spirited life. I, for one, am unable to resist a movie that
places the voice of wisdom in the mouth of a critic, the great
Lester Bangs, played with guile and gusto by Philip Seymour
Hoffman. ``These people are not your friends,'' Bangs tells
William, warning him to keep a critical distance from the musicians
he writes about, but of course once William joins up with the band
Stillwater he finds it hard to follow this advice. He is especially
drawn to Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), the band's skinny,
smoldering lead guitarist, and to Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), the
leader of a troupe of liberated groupies (``We don't have
intercourse _ we inspire the music'') who call themselves the
Band-Aids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' is pushed into rough narrative coherence by
the emotional triangle involving writer, groupie and star, which
culminates in a rather precipitous set of crises. These are
resolved a little too neatly and sunnily. The movie's real
pleasures are to be found not in its story but in its profusion of
funny, offbeat scenes. It's the kind of picture that invites you to
go back and savor your favorite moments like choice album cuts.
Fugit, who has the abashed charm of a pubescent Jeff Bridges, is
remarkable in his first film role. He falters a bit when he has to
show big emotions, but for the most part he is perfect as a wise,
credulous child trying out a series of grown-up stances, looking
for the one that feels right. Hudson and Crudup inhabit their roles
with such mellow ease that the film opens up around them, giving
the splendid supporting cast room to shine. In addition to
McDormand and Hoffman, Jason Lee as Stillwater's hotheaded lead
singer and Fairuza Balk as one of Penny's fellow Band-Aids are
especially memorable.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before its release, ``Almost Famous'' was reportedly trimmed by
about 40 minutes, and though I don't know what was cut I found
myself wishing the movie, still an ample two hours, could be even
longer, fuller, more episodic. The '70s, after all, were a great
era of creative excess: 15-minute guitar solos, endless gonzo
ramblings in the pages of Rolling Stone and movies whose messiness
was the measure of their ambition. But young William Miller, much
as he sips at the bad craziness around him, is too responsible to
permit himself a full swallow. (``Don't take drugs!'' his mother
shouts into the phone as he struggles to hear her through the din
of hotel lobbies and dressing rooms. As far as we know, he obeys
her.)
</P>
<P>
   The child is father to the man. Crowe's confident faith in human
decency shrinks the movie; sometimes the good is the enemy of the
great. But if he hasn't quite captured the Dionysian madness of his
subject _ the epic grandiosity that the recently reissued ``This is
Spinal Tap'' so lovingly lampoons _ what Crowe has done is
nonetheless remarkable. He has made a movie about sex, drugs and
rock 'n' roll that you would be happy to take your mother to see.
</P>

   ``Almost Famous'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying

CEMEX, A MAJOR LATIN MULTINATIONAL, PLANS INTERNET UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cemex, the Mexican cement producer that is one of Latin
America's most successful multinationals, is expected to announce
Wednesday the formation of a subsidiary that will consolidate its
Internet strategies and expand into online procurement services,
the company's chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving beyond Cemex's core business, producing and trading
cement, the subsidiary, called CxNetworks, will focus mainly on the
online procurement of goods and services for the construction
industry and on Internet consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   The move is indicative of an effort by several of Latin
America's largest companies to move part of their operations
online, even if their main business has little to do with the
Internet. In Cemex's case, management hopes the new unit can use
the stable cash flow generated by its cement operation to branch
out into areas that are potentially faster growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not simply about selling cement,'' said Lorenzo H.
Zambrano, Cemex's chairman and chief executive, in a telephone
interview Tuesday. ``In the end, we're selling timeliness and
quality and the image of a company that is at the top of its
class.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-largest cement company after Holderbank of Switzerland
and Lafarge of France, Cemex, with large operations in Mexico,
Spain, Egypt and several Asian and Latin American countries, has
already become known for its use of real-time updating of
inventories and global positioning systems that use satellites to
track its trucks.
</P>
<P>
   With the new subsidiary, Cemex plans to branch out beyond these
efforts and a previous strategy to create an online
business-to-business exchange for the construction industry
together with the Votorantim and Bradesco groups of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a pilot program in Mexico, Cemex has signed up
120 construction companies that are seeking lower prices for goods
and services that are not necessarily cement-related, said Juan
Pablo San Agustin, the executive who will head the new unit.
Similar online procurement programs are planned in coming weeks for
Brazil, Argentina and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cemex is seeking to broaden its sales of
information technology and of Internet-based consulting services,
which will be grouped under the new unit. Cemex estimates these
activities will generate revenue of about $100 million this year,
with 40 percent coming from companies that are not already Cemex
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short- to medium-term, these initiatives won't mean
much for the bottom line,'' said Graham Makohoniuk, a portfolio
manager for Globalvest Management in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands,
which owns Cemex shares. ``But this could be the first step in the
evolution of the company from the Cemex we know today to one that
uses the cement cash cow to get into other markets.''

``PARAGRAPH 175'': CONDEMNED BY THE NAZIS, BUT NOT FOR RELIGION
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the growing body of invaluable cinematic literature
documenting for posterity the hideous barbarity of Nazism may now
be added ``Paragraph 175.''
</P>
<P>
   At once admirable and deeply unsettling, this film draws upon
the testimony of little more than a handful of the all-but-vanished
ranks of survivors to relate the horror of the Nazi purge of
homosexuals from the life of Germany and the aftereffects that scar
and roil these men as the 21st century begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ashamed for humanity,'' says one of the survivors as he
recounts his personal ordeal and the horrors visited on those he
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paragraph 175'' was directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey
Friedman. Together they won an Academy Award for their documentary
``Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt,'' after Epstein won an
Oscar, among many other awards, for ``The Times of Harvey Milk.''
</P>
<P>
   This year their new documentary won the grand jury award for
directing at the Sundance Film Festival and the International Film
Critics Association Award at the Berlin International Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paragraph 175,'' using new and archival film, family
photographs and narration by the actor Rupert Everett, takes its
title from a portion of the German penal code enacted in 1871: ``An
unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex or by
humans with animals is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of
civil rights may also be imposed.''
</P>
<P>
   This provision, expanded by the Nazis, remained law in West and
East Germany until nearly the end of the 1960s. Some of the film's
witnesses were rearrested under this law after the defeat of the
Nazis. During the years of the Weimar Republic, between the end of
World War I and the rise of Hitler, Paragraph 175 was rarely
enforced, and Berlin of the 1920s was, in the words and images of
the film, ``a homosexual Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the filmmakers _ who drew upon German records and
were assisted by Klaus Mueller, a German historian and the project
director for Western Europe for the United States Holocaust Museum
_ about 100,000 men were arrested for homosexuality between 1933,
when Hitler assumed power, and 1945, when World War II ended. About
half were sentenced to prison; 10,000 to 15,000 were sent to
concentration camps, and by the end of the war, only about 4,000 of
those in the camps had survived. Of the eight known to be alive,
six appear in ``Paragraph 175.''
</P>
<P>
   Because women were regarded by the Nazis as vessels of
motherhood, lesbians were spared mass arrest. Some chose exile;
others entered into marriages with gay men. Only one woman, who
escaped to England, tells her story in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, the film's associate producer and director of research,
notes that he grew up in Germany without ever hearing of the
persecution of its gays.
</P>
<P>
   Among the male survivors seen in ``Paragraph 175,'' one tells of
torture; another recalls a daring but vain attempt to rescue his
lover from a Gestapo camp by donning a Hitler Youth uniform; a
third remembers his years in concentration camps; and yet another
tells how he was released from prison during the war only to find
that all the men were gone. So, he says, he joined the German army
because ``that's where the men were.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of them tells of ``the singing forest,'' where the agony
of gay men subjected to torture wailed from the poles on which they
were hanging.
</P>
<P>
   For generations to come, ``Paragraph 175'' lets them be heard.
</P>
<P>

   CHASE-MORGAN (New York) _ Chase Manhattan is in serious talks to
acquire J.P Morgan &AMP; Co. Inc., an executive close to the deal said
on Tuesday. Details of the negotiations were not immediately
available, although the executive said an announcement could come
as early as Wednesday morning. The transaction would end the
independence of J.P. Morgan, the storied investment bank and the
nation's fifth largest. For Chase, which has historically made
smaller acquisitions like its buyout of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and
Robert Fleming Holdings, the deal would catapult the bank into the
top echelon with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. By

to sell the company's ``tax relief'' system to others. Then, almost
any time you leave the house _ whether to commute to your day job,

   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's national security
strategy, which has drawn cutting scorn from Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick
Cheney, was in fact devised by then-Defense Secretary Cheney eight
years ago and has enjoyed broad bipartisan support in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, first detailed in a February 1992 report by Cheney
to Congress and endorsed by then-President George Bush and Gen.
Colin Powell, who at the time was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, articulated a rationale for maintaining an ambitious
``forward presence'' of U.S. military forces worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's strategic blueprint, faithfully followed by the Clinton
administration, rested on the conviction that America's safety and
prosperity depend on stability in vast stretches of the globe, from
the Taiwan Straits to the Persian Gulf and Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   His plan mandated not only a frenetic pace of traditional
military operations but also the engagement of U.S. military forces
in peacekeeping, humanitarian and nation-building missions _
missions that candidates Bush and Cheney now say ``squander''
American combat power.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP team charges that the military is ``over-used and
under-resourced,'' and accuses the Clinton administration of
overextending and neglecting U.S. military forces.
</P>
<P>
   But it was budget cuts and base closings begun while Cheney was
defense secretary and deepened under Clinton that left the military
struggling to keep up with the strategy's global demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney today is running against the sorts of things he
endorsed back in the early 1990s,'' said James Lindsay, a senior
foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
``But this is really more about slogans than substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney campaign responded Tuesday that even if Cheney's 1992
strategy set the direction for U.S. forces in the 1990s, the
Clinton administration had exceeded what Cheney intended as a
prudent management of military forces and defense budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush administration in 1992 laid out a plan for what it
thought might occur in the future, and that plan would have been
subject to annual revision,'' said Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna
Glover Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the Clinton administration made the mistake of hiking
up deployments to a level unanticipated by Bush's projections,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeanne Kirkpatrick, who was President Reagan's ambassador to
the United Nations from 1981 to 1985, agreed that the Bush and
Clinton administrations shared a strategy of global leadership and
military engagement, ``not constantly engaged in military
operations, but doing so when necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   She said their common strategic approach enshrined the idea of
working in coalition with other countries and with multilateral
organizations such as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay said the strategy was actually a ``common sense''
approach that steers clear of both isolationism and an ``intervene
everywhere'' policy. ``Most Americans are comfortable with that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the strategy's core is the idea that only the United States,
with its unparalleled military reach and power, can underwrite
world stability.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney drew on that concept as he struggled in 1992 to deal with
the uncertainties and dimly perceived dangers of the post-Cold War
world that was just emerging. He and Bush sought to justify
maintaining much of America's Cold War military force in the face
of popular pressure for deeper cuts and a ``peace dividend.'' But
their strategy was put in place just as they slashed the Cold War
defense budget and military manpower by a third and closed ``more
than 700'' U.S. bases overseas, as Cheney boasted at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1992 report, Cheney said U.S. military forces would
maintain stability by engaging globally in ``peacekeeping, disaster
relief, nation-building assistance, humanitarian assistance'' and
other non-combat functions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon soon found it difficult to cover all the new
missions Cheney envisioned without the convenience of the foreign
bases he had ordered closed. The result was a significant strain on
warships and aircraft, and longer deployments for troops, sailors
and airmen.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Air Force squadrons that a decade ago could have
flown daily missions over Bosnia from home bases in Europe now must
deploy to Europe for months at a time from home bases in the United
States. That ``time away from family'' has cut deeply into pilot
morale.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush has vowed to ``restore morale.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has curtly dismissed the Clinton administration's use of
the military as ``action without vision, activity without priority
and missions without end _ an approach that squanders American will
and drains American energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in a speech Aug. 30 at the Southern Center for
International Studies in Atlanta, noted that ``over the last
decade, (military) commitments have gone up 300 percent while our
military forces have been cut by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military has been overextended, taken for granted and
neglected,'' Cheney charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's needed,'' Bush thundered in a Sept. 7 speech to the
Veterans of Foreign Wars, ``is a strategic plan with a strategic
vision as to how to keep the long-term peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Cheney has suggested which missions they would
halt, or where they would cut back today's military presence.
</P>
<P>
   But Kirkpatrick, in an interview, suggested that Bush would use
military forces more carefully, under more restrictive conditions,
than Clinton has. What has emerged in the presidential campaign
rhetoric, she said, are ``not huge differences, but more than
nuances.''
</P>
<P>
   While some specific missions within Cheney's strategy have
generated controversy, including the ill-fated U.S. intervention in
Somalia in 1992, the overall concept of global engagement has drawn
remarkably little fire.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as articulated by other politicians, and by successive
defense secretaries who followed Cheney, the strategy reflects an
extraordinary consensus about America's place in the world and the
role of its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the United States should not seek to be the world's
policeman ... but in a world where we are the only remaining
superpower, it is the role of the United States to marshal its
moral and material resources to promote a democratic peace. It is
our responsibility, it is our opportunity to lead. There is no one
else,'' President George Bush said in a speech to West Point cadets
in January 1993 after he was defeated for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen used almost the same language
last year, when he declared: ``We are not the world's policeman.
What we seek is to promote stability and democracy wherever we can
and in whatever capacity we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, the chief national security and foreign policy
adviser to candidate Bush, maintains that the United States ought
to pay less attention to areas of ``questionable'' importance, such
as Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   But in an article in Foreign Affairs magazine earlier this year,
she declared that U.S. military forces need to be decisively
engaged in the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, the Persian
Gulf and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is the only guarantor of global peace and
stability,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, annual Pentagon reports and official White House
statements of national security policy have reflected Cheney's
original strategic concept.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military ``forward presence,'' Cheney wrote in 1992,
``continues to be critical to stability and world confidence in
America's leadership. ... Future peace and stability in the world
will continue to depend in large measure on our willingness to
deploy forces overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. military forces must maintain a forward presence to show
U.S. commitment and lend credibility to our alliances, to deter
aggression, enhance regional stability, promote U.S. influence and
access, and when required, provide an initial crisis response
capability,'' Cheney wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, Congress year after year has generously
supported the forces assigned to carry out the strategy, including
aircraft carrier battle groups, expeditionary Air Force squadrons,
and the ground troops that rotate through the Far East and Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, with concern mounting about the wear and tear
on people and machines, Congress has consistently added money to
the defense budget. This summer it appropriated $3.3 billion more
than Clinton requested, for a total of $287.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That money finances a military operating tempo more reminiscent
of Cold War days than today's peacetime environment.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for example, the Navy has 146 warships under way on
routine operations, including two aircraft carriers, 14 submarines
and two amphibious fleets carrying 4,200 Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20,000 Air Force personnel _ pilots, ground crews and
other support people _ are on temporary missions abroad. The Army
has 21,000 soldiers on temporary missions overseas, and another
124,300 stationed abroad, in South Korea, Germany and 124 other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, almost 20 percent of today's active-duty military _
or some 265,518 people _ are deployed overseas, together with about
188,000 military dependents, according to a Defense Department
report issued in March.
</P>
<P>
   And they are involved in a vast array of missions that reflect
Cheney's 1992 list: peacekeeping in Kosovo and Bosnia, crisis
prevention in Kuwait, disaster relief in Honduras, even a minor
nation-building mission in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, George W. Bush has savaged such missions
as ill-considered.
</P>
<P>
   As president, he would ``order an immediate review'' of all U.S.
commitments and ``replace uncertain missions with well-defined
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   But his father, in his 1993 West Point speech, warned against
adopting such a ``rigid'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that many people would like to find some formula, some
easy formula to apply, to tell us with precision when and where to
intervene with force. Anyone looking for scientific certitude is in
for a disappointment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the complex new world we are entering, there can be no
single or simple set of fixed rules for using force. Inevitably,
the question of military intervention requires judgment,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Some senior military officers privately have chafed at the broad
responsibilities of ``stability operations,'' as many of today's
military missions are known.
</P>
<P>
   But publicly, at least, they seem skeptical that any other
approach can be devised.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as our strategy remains that we will be `forward'
(deployed), I see no way to avoid being out there and doing all
those things,'' Marine Gen. Terrence Dake told reporters last
month. ``And I don't see the world changing.''

   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's national security

defense budget and military manpower by a third and closed ``more
than 700'' U.S. bases overseas, as Cheney boasted at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1992 report, Cheney said U.S. military forces would
maintain stability by engaging globally in ``peacekeeping, disaster
relief, nation-building assistance, humanitarian assistance'' and
other non-combat functions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon soon found it difficult to cover all the new
missions Cheney envisioned without the convenience of the foreign
bases he had ordered closed. The result was a significant strain on
warships and aircraft, and longer deployments for troops, sailors
and airmen.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Air Force squadrons that a decade ago could have
flown daily missions over Bosnia from home bases in Europe now must
deploy to Europe for months at a time from home bases in the United
States. That ``time away from family'' has cut deeply into pilot
morale.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush has vowed to ``restore morale.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has curtly dismissed the Clinton administration's use of
the military as ``action without vision, activity without priority
and missions without end _ an approach that squanders American will
and drains American energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in a speech Aug. 30 at the Southern Center for
International Studies in Atlanta, noted that ``over the last
decade, (military) commitments have gone up 300 percent while our
military forces have been cut by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military has been overextended, taken for granted and
neglected,'' Cheney charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's needed,'' Bush thundered in a Sept. 7 speech to the
Veterans of Foreign Wars, ``is a strategic plan with a strategic
vision as to how to keep the long-term peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Cheney has suggested which missions they would
halt, or where they would cut back today's military presence.
</P>
<P>
   But Kirkpatrick, in an interview, suggested that Bush would use
military forces more carefully, under more restrictive conditions,
than Clinton has. What has emerged in the presidential campaign
rhetoric, she said, are ``not huge differences, but more than
nuances.''
</P>
<P>
   While some specific missions within Cheney's strategy have
generated controversy, including the ill-fated U.S. intervention in
Somalia in 1992, the overall concept of global engagement has drawn
remarkably little fire.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as articulated by other politicians, and by successive
defense secretaries who followed Cheney, the strategy reflects an
extraordinary consensus about America's place in the world and the
role of its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the United States should not seek to be the world's
policeman ... but in a world where we are the only remaining
superpower, it is the role of the United States to marshal its
moral and material resources to promote a democratic peace. It is
our responsibility, it is our opportunity to lead. There is no one
else,'' President George Bush said in a speech to West Point cadets
in January 1993 after he was defeated for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen used almost the same language
last year, when he declared: ``We are not the world's policeman.
What we seek is to promote stability and democracy wherever we can
and in whatever capacity we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, the chief national security and foreign policy
adviser to candidate Bush, maintains that the United States ought
to pay less attention to areas of ``questionable'' importance, such
as Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   But in an article in Foreign Affairs magazine earlier this year,
she declared that U.S. military forces need to be decisively
engaged in the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, the Persian
Gulf and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is the only guarantor of global peace and
stability,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, annual Pentagon reports and official White House
statements of national security policy have reflected Cheney's
original strategic concept.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military ``forward presence,'' Cheney wrote in 1992,
``continues to be critical to stability and world confidence in
America's leadership. ... Future peace and stability in the world
will continue to depend in large measure on our willingness to
deploy forces overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. military forces must maintain a forward presence to show
U.S. commitment and lend credibility to our alliances, to deter
aggression, enhance regional stability, promote U.S. influence and
access, and when required, provide an initial crisis response
capability,'' Cheney wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, Congress year after year has generously
supported the forces assigned to carry out the strategy, including
aircraft carrier battle groups, expeditionary Air Force squadrons,
and the ground troops that rotate through the Far East and Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, with concern mounting about the wear and tear
on people and machines, Congress has consistently added money to
the defense budget. This summer it appropriated $3.3 billion more
than Clinton requested, for a total of $287.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That money finances a military operating tempo more reminiscent
of Cold War days than today's peacetime environment.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for example, the Navy has 146 warships under way on
routine operations, including two aircraft carriers, 14 submarines
and two amphibious fleets carrying 4,200 Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20,000 Air Force personnel _ pilots, ground crews and
other support people _ are on temporary missions abroad. The Army
has 21,000 soldiers on temporary missions overseas, and another
124,300 stationed abroad, in South Korea, Germany and 124 other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, almost 20 percent of today's active-duty military _
or some 265,518 people _ are deployed overseas, together with about
188,000 military dependents, according to a Defense Department
report issued in March.
</P>
<P>
   And they are involved in a vast array of missions that reflect
Cheney's 1992 list: peacekeeping in Kosovo and Bosnia, crisis
prevention in Kuwait, disaster relief in Honduras, even a minor
nation-building mission in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, George W. Bush has savaged such missions
as ill-considered.
</P>
<P>
   As president, he would ``order an immediate review'' of all U.S.
commitments and ``replace uncertain missions with well-defined
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   But his father, in his 1993 West Point speech, warned against
adopting such a ``rigid'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that many people would like to find some formula, some
easy formula to apply, to tell us with precision when and where to
intervene with force. Anyone looking for scientific certitude is in
for a disappointment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the complex new world we are entering, there can be no
single or simple set of fixed rules for using force. Inevitably,
the question of military intervention requires judgment,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Some senior military officers privately have chafed at the broad
responsibilities of ``stability operations,'' as many of today's
military missions are known.
</P>
<P>
   But publicly, at least, they seem skeptical that any other
approach can be devised.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as our strategy remains that we will be `forward'
(deployed), I see no way to avoid being out there and doing all
those things,'' Marine Gen. Terrence Dake told reporters last
month. ``And I don't see the world changing.''

HEAD-SPINNING EVIL IN THE `EXORCIST' GETS A NEW TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 17)  
Terrence Rafferty is the critic at large for GQ magazine. 
 By TERRENCE RAFFERTY  
 &HT;     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When William Friedkin's ``Exorcist,'' based on William Peter
Blatty's best-selling theological-horror novel, opened on Dec. 26,
1973, it was not only the movie event of the Christmas season that
year; it also became the dominant pop-culture phenomenon of the
final days of Richard Nixon's presidency. One wouldn't want to
suggest that Blatty's tale of the expulsion of a possessing demon
from the body of a 12-year-old girl in any way enhanced the
national will to eject rascals from the White House. You could do
that. But it would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, undeniably a fairly hysterical time, and
audiences' reactions to ``The Exorcist'' at the very least
reflected something of the era's high-strung personality. There
were reports that preview audiences were so upset by the film's
blasphemies, obscenities and graphic physical hocks that several
viewers fled the theater, fainted and/or vomited. (As it turns out,
the scene that evoked the strongest flight response was a long
sequence of medical testing.) Although such reactions are perfectly
valid critical comments on many movies, in the case of ``The
Exorcist'' audience revulsion became a kind of selling point:
people lined up for hours, braving the winter cold, to see little
possessed Regan (Linda Blair) swivel her head 360 degrees, hurl her
well-meaning mother across the room, belch profanities at anyone
within earshot, crush the genitals of a psychiatrist, masturbate
with a crucifix, and spew green liquid in the faces of unsuspecting
Jesuits.
</P>
<P>
   I have to confess that I did not stand in line for ``The
Exorcist'' that winter but caught up to it later, when the fuss had
died down. Because I was at that time living in a university
dormitory, I didn't need to go to the movies to see people vomiting
and passing out. The spectacle of clever priests drinking Scotch
and wrestling with their faith had less exotic allure for me than
it had for many members of the audience: I'd known Jesuits all my
life, because my father taught at Brooklyn Prep, a Jesuit high
school of which, as it happens, Blatty is an alumnus. When I
finally saw the picture, the audience was clearly shaken, but the
screening was medically uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``The Exorcist'' is back, in a new, longer version that
Warner Brothers is releasing in theaters on Friday. Since the
advent of home video, more and more films have been turning up on
cassette and DVD in altered states designated as ``director's
cuts.'' This edition of ``The Exorcist,'' however, appears to be
essentially a writer-producer's cut: many of the additional scenes
are those that Blatty has, over the years, loudly criticized
Friedkin for excising. (The director had banished Blatty from the
editing room because he was being, in his words, ``a pain.'')
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, when Friedkin and Blatty were
interviewed for a BBC documentary (which is included on the
25th-anniversary ``Special Edition'' DVD), the director still
believed that his cut of ``The Exorcist'' was ``as close to a
perfect film as you can make,'' while the writer continued to argue
that the movie's current ending left his story dangerously
vulnerable to theological misinterpretation: for all these years,
Blatty has been bugged by the knowledge that some viewers thought
the Devil had won.
</P>
<P>
   But Blatty has apparently worn Friedkin down. This new
``Exorcist'' restores the writer's preferred ending (which is also
the final scene of the novel), an exchange of excruciating
jocularities between a middle-aged police detective and a young
Jesuit, in which we are given to understand that the spirit of the
story's martyred hero, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) lives
on. On this issue, Friedkin was right the first time. The scene was
an embarrassment in the book, and it is immeasurably worse on the
screen: Lee J. Cobb's grotesque performance as the detective
italicizes every inanity. The triumph of the Devil isn't any more
depressing than the idea that grown men might actually talk to each
other the way this priest and this cop do.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes are trivial. There's a brief shot of Georgetown in
Washington _where the heroine, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) and
her satanically challenged daughter live _ inserted before the
film's original opening sequence, in which the title character, the
elderly archaeologist-priest Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow), digs
for evil in northern Iraq. The new beginning is inoffensive but
useless, as are a handful of superimposed images of scary-monster
heads that have been added to later, more horrific scenes in the
MacNeil household: they are coals to Newcastle, or, if you will,
priests to Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   The longest restored sequence, an additional (earlier, less
grisly) diagnostic scene, slightly improves the structural clarity
of the narrative. And for horror-movie aficionados, the main
attraction of the expanded ``Exorcist'' is undoubtedly the
inclusion of the legendary (well, to some) ``spider walk'' _ i.e.,
the scene in which Regan skitters down a staircase on all fours,
hands first and her body facing upward. It's a good, unnerving
shock effect: whether the picture needs another of those is, I
guess, a matter of taste.
</P>
<P>
   By far the best thing about this ``Exorcist'' is that it makes a
bit more room for Max von Sydow, arguably the planet's greatest
living actor. Father Merrin is just a routinely brilliant
supporting turn for him, and in a way this character is to von
Sydow what Obi-Wan Kenobi was to Sir Alec Guinness: the role that
the general audience would forever identify him most closely with.
But the movie wouldn't work at all without his enormous, mysterious
authority and grace. von Sydow's terse readings suggest the
let's-get-it-done manner of an old spiritual gunslinger wearily
cleaning up one more rotten town: he appears to be the one person
involved in the movie who understands that it's not a theological
parable but an exceptionally perverse western. The revised
``Exorcist'' gives him a few more scenes, and, though they're
brief, anything that increases the amount of Max von Sydow in the
world has to be considered a force for good.
</P>
<P>
   Like every powerful horror movie, ``The Exorcist'' gains from
being seen on a big screen, with an audience primed to scream and
talk back. No one should expect vomiting and fainting this time,
though. Horror is mainstream entertainment now, and our collective
tolerance for gore, obscenity and even invasive medical procedures
is exponentially greater than it was in the Trickster era.
</P>
<P>
   Our gross-out threshold has risen as fast and as high as the
stock market _ thanks largely, it should be said, to ``The
Exorcist'' itself. Twenty-seven years ago, moviegoers stood in line
to get queasy. We must have acquired a taste for it, because we
haven't stopped yet.

HILL PANEL TO HEAR TESTIMONY ON MARKETING OF VIOLENCE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When critics of the entertainment industry fret
about the marketing of violent material to children, they are no
doubt thinking of artists like rapper Eminem, who screams violently
about ``blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns,
sluts'' in his song ``Kill You.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem isn't on the witness list for Wednesday's Senate Commerce
Committee hearing on the marketing of violence to children, but
lyrics like his are on the agenda along with the blood-soaked
imagery of many video games and the gratuitous gunplay of some
R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the Federal Trade Commission released its report
charging the entertainment industry with marketing violent music,
movies and video games to children, the industry is set to defend
itself before the Senate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding politics to the mix, Democratic vice presidential
candidate Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut will testify, as
will Lynne Cheney, wife of Dick Cheney, the Republican vice
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said in its report that the motion picture, recording
and software industries routinely ignore their own rating systems
when devising marketing strategies. The commission found all
samples it examined of music rated for adults were marketed to
children younger than 17, as were 80 percent of R-rated movies and
70 percent of adult-rated video games.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not say which titles the FTC used for its
analysis, but the commission's concerns about marketing to youth
audiences would apply generally to all music that contains warnings
about adult language, all movies with R ratings and all video games
rated for consumers 17 or older.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Examples might include Eminem. His current release, ``The
Marshall Mathers LP,'' contains violent, misogynist and homophobic
lyrics, including ``Kill You,'' a song with lyrics like ``I
invented violence you vile, venomous, vomital bitches. ... Touch
the chainsaw, left his brains all dangling from his neck while his
head barely hangs on.''
</P>
<P>
   And Slayer, for decades the most successful satanic rock band.
Its 1998 album ``Diabolus in Musica'' includes the song ``Death's
Head'' with the lyrics ``Death's pointed at your head, your mind on
the trigger pull it. Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Among video games, there's ``Soldier of Fortune,'' a
first-person shoot-'em-up game from Activision. On its Web site,
Activision promotes the game, saying: ``Real bullets do real
damage: Shoot someone in the leg and he falls, writhing and
grasping his wound; shoot someone in the head and he falls down
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Redneck Rampage'' from Interplay, an unusual
blend of violence and rank humor that has spawned at least two
sequels. A review of the game linked to the Interplay site says:
``Peek at the industry rating _ mature for animated blood and gore,
strong language, and use of tobacco and alcohol _ and that should
be your first clue that this ... is no `Hee Haw.'''
</P>
<P>
   The movie category is by far the broadest, including everything
from sexploitation flicks and action films to some modern classics:
anything that received an R or NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Among current films that would qualify as violent fare are ``The
Way of the Gun,'' which is rated R for ``strong violence/gore,
language and some sexuality,'' and ``The Art of War,'' which got
its R rating for ``nudity, language, excessive violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the category also would include ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the
1998 World War II classic, which was rated R for ``strong, intense,
prolonged, realistically graphic sequences of war violence and for
language.''
</P>
<P>
   James T. Hamilton, director of the Duke University Program on
Violence and the Media, said movies like ``Saving Private Ryan''
are the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry likes to talk about `Saving Private Ryan' and
`Schindler's List' as examples of movies that would get an `R' for
violence and also get a four-star rating. But if you look at all
movies, violent four-star movies make up only about 2 percent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Expected to defend the industries Wednesday against the FTC's
charges of marketing violence to children are a parade of witnesses
representing the movie, recording and software industries.
</P>
<P>
   They are likely to point to the voluntary rating programs that
have been established to help parents take the initiative in
steering their kids away from violent music, movies and video
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents, not the government, have the responsibility for
guiding their children toward music that is appropriate for a
child's age and maturity,'' said Hillary Rosen, president of the
Recording Industry Association, who is slated to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Another scheduled witness, Douglas Lowenstein, president of the
Interactive Digital Software Association, added that ``parents have
the tools and, as importantly, the power and the opportunity to act
responsibly on behalf of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Parental vigilance, he said, ``is ultimately the best way to
ensure that games that are inappropriate for kids are kept out of
their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman said on Monday that their administration
would give the industry a period of perhaps six months to change
its marketing techniques before seeking regulatory or legislative
means to crack down on them.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for Lieberman's Senate office, said
Lieberman will reiterate the campaign's position Wednesday. He
would not say if Lieberman's testimony was drafted by his Senate
office or by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see him expand on the points that he and the vice
president made yesterday,'' Gerstein said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proper way to think about this is that we're looking at
things the industries themselves say are inappropriate for kids.
And if they are targeting their marketing at kids, then that is
wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Cheney, the author of a 1995 book on the nation's
dysfunctional culture, will issue a similar call on the industry to
police itself. Marguerite Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Cheney, said
Cheney opposes legislative means to crack down on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will be addressing the bigger cultural issues: how the
industry needs to start taking real responsibility for its
products,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, neither Cheney nor Lieberman will be testifying on
behalf of the presidential campaigns, though their appearances on
the witness list seem hardly coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   After Gore and Lieberman made an issue of the FTC report on
Monday, Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said Gore ``deserves an Oscar
award for hypocrisy'' for criticizing Hollywood while accepting
millions of dollars in campaign contributions from the
entertainment industry.

   The minister, Mohammed Mafud, told journalists in Jakarta that
the government Cabinet considered the incident an internal matter
better handled by the Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will reject the presence of that mission,'' Mafud said,
according to the French news agency Agence France-Presse. ``We will
negotiate on our own, we will settle this on our own,'' the defense
minister said. ``We are a sovereign nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, being sent by the Security Council, was expected
to depart early next week for Indonesia and West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But President Abdurrahman Wahid said that the minister had gone
beyond his instructions, diplomats here reported. They said that
Indonesia's foreign minister, Alwi Shahab, would convey his
government's formal response to the council's president, Moctar
Ouane of Mali, here on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
predicted that the visit would go ahead. ``I can't imagine why it
won't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit's purpose, Holbrooke said, was not to embarrass the
Indonesian government but to offer help by directly expressing the
council's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mission is to support the civilian leadership of
Indonesia,'' Holbrooke said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The three workers for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees _
Carlos Cacere, Samson Aregehegn and Pero Simundza _ were killed in
the West Timorese town of Atambua when a mob led by armed militia
members stormed their office and battered and hacked the three
unarmed men to death. The assailants had been attending a funeral
for a militia leader killed the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
promised to bring the killers to justice.
</P>
<P>
   The national police chief, Gen. Rusdihardjo, who uses only one
name, reported on Tuesday in Jakarta that five suspects had been
arrested in the investigation into the death of the militia leader,
Olivio Mendosa Moruk. Rusdihardjo said another five suspects were
being sought.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, in its resolution adopted Friday, called
the killings ``outrageous and contemptible'' and demanded that the
Indonesian government take immediate steps to disarm and disband
the undisciplined militias, which oppose independence for East
Timor and are thought to get support from elements in the
Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   The slain U.N. workers were in West Timor to assist refugees who
had fled militia-led violence in East Timor. The council said that
the U.N. workers, more than 400 of whom were evacuated from West
Timor after the murders, would not return until the government
showed that it could guarantee their security.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Indonesian government initially refused to meet
another delegation from the Security Council, only to back down
later.

TOBACCO COMPANIES TRIED TO HIDE SECONDHAND SMOKE, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Using code names such as ``Project Stealth'' and
``Project Ambrosia,'' cigarette manufacturers have tested
ingredients that hide secondhand smoke in a bid to make smoking
more socially acceptable but not necessarily safer, the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health alleged in a study
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study was issued just four days after a federal court struck
down Massachusetts' 1996 law requiring tobacco companies to reveal
each brand's ingredients in order from largest to smallest, like
the ingredients printed on soup or cereal packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department is extremely disappointed with the opinion,''
said Dr. Gregory Connolly, head of the Department of Public
Health's Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program and an author of the
study. ``It's denied the department's right to do basic research.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said the new study highlights public health officials'
need to know about ingredients that may be used as a ``marketing
ploy'' to make smoking more palatable to consumers _ particularly
women _ who are concerned about exposing their children to smoking,
or about odors on their hair and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1980s, tobacco companies tested a number of
compounds on people or animals to see if they would lower the
``visibility, aroma, irritancy, or the actual level of secondary
smoke,'' Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big concern is there was little evidence (that) they
tested the product to see if it was reducing risk for disease,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Carnovale, a spokeswoman for Phillip Morris, said that for
every new additive, the company does a ``rigorous assessment to
make sure it doesn't increase the health risks of cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Phillip Morris never masked cigarette odor, and did not
know if it had used additives to reduce the appearance of
secondhand smoke. But she stressed that the DPH study was based on
``past documents,'' adding that the company is ``doing things very
differently today,'' including working to cut down on the actual
effects of secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Health study, published Wednesday in
Tobacco Control, a journal of the British Medical Association, was
based on tobacco company documents that were either filed with
patent applications or made public in the massive lawsuit by state
attorneys general against the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The study cited two 1990 Philip Morris describing Project
Stealth, a product with less smoke from the lit end and low odor
aimed at ``helping smokers feel better about smoking in social
situations.'' But after research showed smokers felt the product
did not reduce smoke enough to make them feel better around
non-smokers, the company instead positioned it as ``the first
cigarette that doesn't leave a stale, lingering odor after
smoking,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Phillip Morris spokesman said the company was pleased
with the decision by U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr., who
ruled that it would be unfair to force companies to disclose
recipes that help create distinctive flavors and brand identity.
</P>
<P>
   State legislators, led by Senator Mark Montigny, are working on
an amendment to address concerns about the 1996 law, the first in
the nation to force the disclosure. One possibility, Connolly said,
is to require disclosure to public health officials but not to the
public, as in a Texas law that has not been challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1986 federal law, tobacco companies are required to
provide lists of ingredients to the Department of Health and Human
Services, but the information isn't made public. It does not
specify quantities or indicate which additives are used in which
brands; nor does it include ingredients in wrappers or filters.
</P>
<P>
   Carnovale said Phillip Morris would welcome ``reasonable
regulation'' of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, smoking kills 10,000 people in Massachusetts and
secondhand smoke kills 3,000 people nationwide, public health
officials estimate.

 &HT;    Gore, Lieberman tour in Ohio
 &HT;    By Thomas Gnau
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Ohio _ Close up, Democratic presidential candidate
Vice President
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore doesn't look larger than life. But the roar of students
that greeted him in the Middletown High School cafeteria Tuesday
was.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and running mate U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., brought
their campaign to classrooms, hallways, the cafeteria and Paul
Walker Gymnasium surrounded by
</P>
<P>
   school staff, campaign aides, Secret Service agents and - of
course - a lot of students.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Middletown as part of his campaign's ``On the Road
to A+ Education'' tour. The focus was Democratic ideas on improving
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good message,'' said Middletown Board of Education member
Katie McNeil. She added, ``Our students need to hear that from more
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and I love the Middletown High School Middies,''
Lieberman declared
</P>
<P>
   after he and Gore ascended a platform in the gym to the tune of
``Rocky Top,'' performed by an MHS pep band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we take these cheerleaders with us around America?'' the
Connecticut
</P>
<P>
   senator asked, referring to the girls on bleachers behind the
candidates. That ignited shrieks and another roar from 1,700
assembled students.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Middies appeared taken with the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore entered the cafeteria at about 11:30 a.m., cheering
students stood
</P>
<P>
   on tables and chairs to get a glimpse and take photographs.
Students exchanged cameras with other students in an effort to get
better shots. Beaming cafeteria workers waited behind the lunch
serving counter as Gore picked up a tray. He took onion rings, a
bowl of spaghetti and bottled water, and he shook hands with
students and employees as he went.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman, who entered the cafeteria a few moments
later, sat down
</P>
<P>
   with Principal Gary Perkins, social studies teacher Mary Harvey
and four female students.
</P>
<P>
   Gore invited those surrounding his table to ask him questions.
``How's the food?'' junior Josh Estoye, standing a few feet away,
shouted at Gore above the din.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent,'' Gore answered.
</P>
<P>
   Estoye, 17, said a moment later he spoke to Gore ``just to start
up a
</P>
<P>
   conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The student said he will be old enough to vote on Election Day
Nov. 7. He
</P>
<P>
   said he doesn't know which candidate will get his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I watch TV and all the political shows, I realize it's
interesting to
</P>
<P>
   know what's going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Lieberman greeted members of Libby Armentrout's
English class. Before the vice presidential candidate arrived,
Armentrout described her students as ``all seniors, all potential
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the class had missed lunch, and had been holding off
hunger with
</P>
<P>
   ``animal crackers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pretty pumped up since 10 o'clock, so we're very
excited,'' she
</P>
<P>
   said. A few minutes later, Lieberman entered the room with a
slight smile and a
</P>
<P>
   wave. ``Hello, everybody,'' he said. ``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We saved you the seat of honor, which is perched at my desk,''
Armentrout
</P>
<P>
   said.
</P>
<P>
   She told Lieberman that the class was starting to study
``Beowulf,'' an Old
</P>
<P>
   English poem written some 1,000 years ago. A first draft of a
paper on the
</P>
<P>
   work was due today, but his visit delayed the assignment due
date, she told
</P>
<P>
   him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So did I give you a break there?'' Lieberman asked the
students. ``Tell your
</P>
<P>
   families to all vote for the Gore-Lieberman campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   When he learned that one student was 18, Lieberman told him:
``Be sure to
</P>
<P>
   register (to vote). I'm serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman learned that striving to write well was an ongoing
concern in the
</P>
<P>
   class. ``It's such an important skill,'' he said. He said when
he was a high school student, ``the time I was expressing myself
most at that time was when I was writing because I was awkward
verbally.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the class that he had about 120 attorneys working for
him when he was
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's attorney general. Some of them, he said, couldn't
write very
</P>
<P>
   well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made them less effective lawyers,'' he said. ``I didn't
expect to give that lecture this morning,'' he added a bit
wistfully a moment later.
</P>
<P>
   When told the students would soon tackle resume and technical
writing,
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman became more serious. He said a poorly-written resume
``closes my
</P>
<P>
   mind to that person, even if that person happens to be capable
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lieberman asked senior Aaron Fay where he wanted to go to
college, Fay shook his head. ``Anywhere but a school in Ohio,'' Fay
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing as you come along is to be educated
today,'' Lieberman said. ``We want to try, Al Gore and I, to make
that a little easier for you.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the students about Gore's plans for a ``$10,000 tax
deduction for tuition'' at a college, trade or technical school as
well as a savings fun in which citizens and their employers could
invest tax-free for education costs.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of friends with whom he graduated from high school in
Stamford, Conn., almost 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their expectation was, so long as they went to work and did
their job, they
</P>
<P>
   could work at their place for 35, 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all changed now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides ushered watching reporters out of the class
before Lieberman
</P>
<P>
   finished his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the candidates arrived, about 11 protesters made their
presence felt
</P>
<P>
   near Manchester Technical Center, just north of the high school
at the
</P>
<P>
   intersection of Breiel Boulevard and Manchester Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not really pose a problem,'' said Middletown Police
Lt. David
</P>
<P>
   VanArsdale. ``They were orderly and complied with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was arrested, he said. He said one of the protesters held
a sign that
</P>
<P>
   said, ``Gore lies.''

 &HT;    BOTH GORE, BUSH SHOULD SPARE US DETAILS
 &HT;    
 &HT;

<P>
   The longer this presidential campaign goes on the more one
wonders if Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush
understand the way our government works.
</P>
<P>
   Or, one wonders, is it possible the two candidates do understand
how our government works but are so sure we don't that they think
they're better off campaigning on governmental details over which
the president has little control?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than letting Gore stampede him into their current contest
of whose tedious legislative specifics are better, Bush should have
stuck to one of his stronger campaign points: His claim he has a
proven record of working well across partisan lines in passing
legislation through a bipartisan Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has stepped off into the deep end of his political
pool by trying to out-wonk one of America's all-time great wonks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only genuinely enjoys excruciating details, he, at
least at the moment, is proving himself a far better politician
than GWB.
</P>
<P>
   He has taken almost total control of the presidential campaign
by setting an agenda that has little to do with the presidency.
Indeed, he has steered the campaign into a contest driven by more
legislative specifics than those to which most legislative
candidates should be willing to commit.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for presidential candidates to disagree on the
general form and financing of Medicare _ especially as the plan
deals with prescription drugs. It's quite another to wrangle over
the design of prescription forms and the number each Medicare
doctor must keep.
</P>
<P>
   You think that sounds silly? Listen to some of the Medicare
specifics on which Bush and Gore are campaigning _ and arguing.
</P>
<P>
   And, meanwhile, the voting public _ and, ultimately, the
presidential election _ would be well served if the voters were
paying attention to what is going on in the Congress right now.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pretty fine demonstration of a couple of political
cliches that are cliches because the truth of them has made them
trite:
</P>
<P>
   No. 1) Politics is compromise. As was graphically proven during
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's Republican reign in the
Congress: The GOPers who won't compromise are likely to be made
politically miserable by a Democratic president who will veto their
purist legislation.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2) When all else fails a president who wants legislation the
Congress doesn't, the president can share his unhappiness with the
veto.
</P>
<P>
   If you will recall, when GWB's father, George Bush the Elder,
was a GOP president, with a Dem Congress, his main legislative fame
was, for a political eternity, the number of his vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   That man vetoed right and, well, right tons of bills.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say a president can't be quite important when it
comes to passing legislation. Bill Clinton, the Democratic
president who outlasted Gingrich and made so many other Republicans
willing to see the merits of pragmatism over purism, is being
important right now.
</P>
<P>
   Lame duck and despised by many GOPers though he may be, Clinton,
who once made Republicans look to be unfeeling jerks to many, is
offering to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   He is not likely to get that opportunity, however. Instead,
legislative deals will be cut and political trades will be made
within the Congress _ and with him, if necessary. But Clinton, as
should be the case with presidents, is not going to waste the
legislative power he has to deal for minor, tedious legislative
details.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore and Bush, Gore has moved to adopt one of Bush's
strong political points, while Bush has embraced one of Gore's
least realistic and likable traits in a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Al Gore won friends and influenced women voters when he
kissed his wife and joked with Oprah. But, he's winning more
friends and influencing lots more voters the easier he gets in
style. Not so for Bush, who's been suckered into being less a
likable big-philosophical-picture type and more a wonk who has
trouble pronouncing his details.
</P>
<P>
   Our government has three branches: executive, legislative and
judicial. Good political judgment suggests their campaigns would be
better and far more meaningful if Gore and Bush would spend less
time on the legislative and more effort in proving their abilities
to be the leading executive of the Free World. &QL;

<P>
   The Republicans' circular firing squad has stood down, but it
could re-form on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   About this time last week, the mau-mauing started. Veteran
Republican whingers knew that several new national polls were about
to hit. They thought George W. Bush was in for more bad numbers
(worse, actually, than they turned out to be) so they elbowed to
the front of the line to get in their usually anonymous licks early
against their beleaguered candidate. An appearance of prescience is
so important.
</P>
<P>
   A modestly seminal story appeared on the front page of The New
York Times. It spoke of Republican disaffection with Bush's
campaign and worry that his Austin handlers weren't up to the
demands of a national effort (which may ultimately prove to be
perfectly true). It quoted Bill Bennett, whose chief virtues are
that he almost always answers his phone and wants to appear to have
some Jesuitical compulsion toward earnest truth-telling. (Bennett
was also hard to avoid on the weekend talk shows.)
</P>
<P>
   As these things happen, the Times piece was read in New York
over coffee by network anchors and producers, and the day's agenda
for political pieces was set. Yes, it's a touch incestuous, but
nevermind.
</P>
<P>
   As could have been expected, Bush did not take the grousing well
and, perhaps remembering his father's 1992 fiasco, told aides that
only when a campaign is in trouble do you ``find out who your
friends really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Bush blamed the carping on ``Washington,'' contending
``that's the place where you find people getting ready to jump out
of the foxhole before the first shell is fired.'' (Given Bush's &QL; 
daring service in the Texas Air National Guard, perhaps he should
leave off the battlefield metaphors.)
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the complaining also was coming from around the
country, especially from Republican fat cats who only weeks ago
were measuring for drapes in Washington or some exotic capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bush observed: ``I guess some of my supporters wanted it to be a
run-away.''
</P>
<P>
   Then as last weekend began, the poll numbers started coming out,
showing the race to be a dead heat, the closest post-Labor Day
surveys in 20 years. Slap-dab even or within the margin of error in
almost every national survey.
</P>
<P>
   A new sounding published Tuesday by the historically dead-on
Battleground poll, now an adjunct to Voter.com, also showed a
neck-and-neck race, with Gore at 41 percent and Bush at 40.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasn't rebounding, but he also wasn't in free-fall as some
of the GOP doubters feared. Most worrisome for Bush is what appears
to be a slight trend to Gore in the USA Today-CNN-Gallup tracking
poll. Also, new polls in key states shows a shift to Gore. A
Missouri survey found the vice president leading 45-40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The best possible reading of the new numbers is that Bush has
just been through the worst three weeks of the campaign and hasn't
been knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Democrats believe, however, that Gore has sufficiently
allayed voters' concerns about the vice president's personal
leadership qualities and his relationship with President Clinton to
let the natural effect of ``peace and prosperity'' work through the
undecided electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his team aren't dummies. They were aware of their
problems (it would have been difficult not to be, given three weeks
of slippage and daily media reminders) if not exactly what to do
about them. But alterations were already in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turn on a dime,'' Bush communications director Karen Hughes
observed, in a bit of overstatement, as her candidate left the
lectern and headed for coffee shops and shop floors, the informal
settings that proved salutary after John McCain knocked the Texas
governor's crown off.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, Bush operatives took firmer control of the
Republican National Committee staff (about time) to ensure better
coordination on the RNC's television ad campaign. Bush had
personally scratched the RNC's first attack ad against Gore.
Republican sources said that the RNC ad that eventually aired was
insufficiently market-tested before being slammed into a time buy
costing up to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hopeful Republicans believe that a campaign that rebounded, as
Bush's did, after the nasty surprise in New Hampshire, can retool
effectively. Others in the party believe the Bush effort is still
floundering and has no clear idea of how it can get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Any minute now, the doubters may again circle round and cry,
``Lock and load.''

 &HT;    Caraustar says G-P dispute brings mill closure
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Recycled-packaging company Caraustar Industries claims
a contract dispute with Georgia-Pacific has forced it to shut a New
Jersey mill.
</P>
<P>
   Austell-based Caraustar also said Tuesday it will fall far short
of earnings estimates for the third quarter, partly because of
reduced orders from Georgia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves a contract that calls for Georgia-Pacific
to use Caraustar's paper products in its gypsum wallboard products.
Gypsum wallboard, made from a layer of gypsum sandwiched between
two sheets of paperboard, is used widely to finish interior walls
in houses and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Caraustar claims Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific, the country's
No. 2 paper and lumber company, violated the contract when it
started using products from its own mills to make the wallboard. As
a result, Caraustar said Georgia-Pacific's average monthly purchase
dropped by more than 80 percent from 7,000 tons during the first
half of this year. Caraustar also said Georgia-Pacific, its largest
wallboard paper customer, indicated it will further cut back in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   The cutback in business caused Caraustar to close its mill in
Camden, N.J., where it makes about 50,000 tons of paperboard a
year, the company said. That's about 3.3 percent of Caraustar's
total production of paperboard. The company also makes tubes,
cartons and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Caraustar has filed a lawsuit against Georgia-Pacific in
Superior Court in Charlotte, N.C., seeking damages of more than
$100 million for breach of contract. Georgia-Pacific in turn filed
a separate action in Fulton County, Ga., Superior Court for
judgment seeking to justify its interpretation of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific said the contract doesn't include certain grades
of gypsum-facing paper that it makes itself. The company also said
it was surprised by the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia-Pacific is committed to complying fully with its
contracts. We repeatedly have attempted to negotiate this issue in
good faith and we are disappointed by actions taken by Caraustar
Industries,'' said Pete Correll, chairman and chief executive of
Georgia-Pacific. ``We completely disagree with its interpretation
of the contract and its representation of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Caraustar said the loss of Georgia-Pacific business, plus rising
fiber costs and lower profits in some businesses, will
significantly hurt third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   After one-time charges for the mill closing and other costs,
Caraustar expects third-quarter earnings to be between 21 cents and
24 cents a share, said Chief Financial Officer Lee Thrash.
Caraustar was expected to earn 47 cents in the third quarter,
according to a poll by First Call/Thomson Financial.

 &HT;    Long days ahead for iXL chief
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Last week was the worst for Bert Ellis, founder,
chairman and CEO of iXL Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   First, the company announced it would not meet its third quarter
earnings projections, due in part to lengthening sales cycles from
its Global 2000 client base.
</P>
<P>
   That news was followed quickly by a company reorganization that
included the resignation of Bill Nussey, president of iXL Inc., the
company's professional services division. Ellis stepped into
Nussey's job, announced a new management team and began to
streamline iXL's operations that culminated the layoff of 350
employees, about 65 of them in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After what he referred to as one of the worst weeks of his life,
Ellis took time out to talk about what's happened. Ellis remains
confident he can reverse iXL's fortunes by stepping in, working
18-hour days and focusing on bringing in more revenue.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's confident his clients and most of his investors
will stick with him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This is a challenging time for iXL, but you've been through
other rough times in other businesses you've had. Are the problems
the same, or is the Internet economy a totally different business
environment?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe, maybe not. What's different is what I'm doing about
it. I've got a nose for the revenue side of the business. When I
get up every morning, I think about what I can do about the
business, how are we doing with our existing business, with our
existing clients, what's in the pipeline and what can we do to
close the deal, and how can I help close the deal, and what else
can I do. Sales, revenue, client service and delivery. That's what
I spend half my time on. With me driving the company, we will focus
on that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The big question most analysts and investors want to know
right now is when will you be able to show some gains on the
revenue side?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've got a 30-day bubble problem. We let some things bite us
in the back that took 30 days out of our pipeline. The closing
cycle takes 30 days longer than it used to.
</P>
<P>
   There's the same amount of business out there. It just takes 30
days longer, and I didn't have enough revenue to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   We used to fill it with the dot-com business, but the dot-com
business is gone. We need six deals in the pipeline to close two.
We used to have a lower ratio.
</P>
<P>
   It's just math. The dilemma before was you had too much business
and you didn't have the people to build it. You used to have to
scramble around to get people. Now you have to scramble to get the
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you characterize your relationship with Wall Street
right now? Do you think they understand, not just iXL but all the
companies in your space, like Razorfish, Sapient, Viant and the
others having the same problems?
</P>
<P>
   A: We are in the penalty box and we have to understand that. We
have friendly cordial relationships with the analysts that cover
us. But we have to re-prove ourselves. Mike Casey (iXL's chief
financial offer) is crackerjack, and he knows how to do this. But
it's going to be one of those ``show me'' things.
</P>
<P>
   This quarter we take our lumps and they'll see what we do next
quarter. I think people will be pretty ... happy with what we do
and they'll look on us more favorably. There's not much point in
trying to win people over until we put another quarter behind us.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to miss our numbers, we've said we're going to miss
our numbers and we're going to use this time to make some strategic
changes that we couldn't make if we were going to hit our numbers.
The changes would have caused us to miss a number or two. Once you
miss a number, it doesn't matter. You miss a number you get thrown
in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What you're doing is using a quarter you know isn't going to
look good to make key changes in the company that would have had a
negative impact on the third quarter anyway.
</P>
<P>
   A: We're getting out of some business it doesn't make sense for
us to be in.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to reduce the cost of operating this company. It's
going to throw two bad things into our quarters. It's going to
throw a boatload of severance into the quarter and mess with our
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what we say, they're going to say `show me.' We've
already told them what we're going to do this quarter, and they
don't like the story. We gave them expectations, and we didn't meet
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You are one of the most visible Internet executives in
Atlanta and in the Internet community (Ellis serves on 10 corporate
and six nonprofit boards). Now that Bill Nussey has resigned, and
you are stepping into his post, how will you run iXL Enterprises,
iXL Ventures, iXL Inc., and be an active member of the Internet
community without having a heart attack?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer is it's always been my style to hire really good
people, put them in good positions and let them run with it. If
they can't, then I step in. Bill (Nussey) and I decided he couldn't
do the job we needed to get done, and I decided that it would be
me.
</P>
<P>
   I have a great team running AppGenesys, CyberStarts and CFN (iXL
owns a 48 percent interest CFN). They don't need my attention right
now. I have really good managers there. I put iXL Ventures fund on
hold. iXL is my main focus right now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you have to admit you've got a pretty full plate right
now, even with just the business of iXL, given the financial
situation and corporate reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm going 18 hours a day right now, and we've accomplished a
lot. We have accomplished more in one week than we have in nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you be more specific?
</P>
<P>
   A: We reorganized this company. Regrettably, we fired 350
people.
</P>
<P>
   But I feel great about the company, and I was feeling pretty
gloomy some of last week. Firing 350 people is something I never
want to do again.
</P>
<P>
   But our management team is so invigorated. We are making
battlefield promotions, and we are at it full bore. I've had my
team in here all weekend. This is something we can solve, and we
can solve it fast.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Is making quick decisions what iXL needs right now to get back
on track with clients and investors?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ninety percent of it is about management. I've talked to a
lot of our clients. They are disappointed we are having a blip, but
they've seen it in their own businesses, too. They see what we are
doing about it. We haven't had any defections yet.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What are you saying to your investors?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know Atlanta and you know my situation here. There is a
boatload of people in Atlanta who own iXL stock because they know
me and a lot of people wanted to see what we were going to do about
this.
</P>
<P>
   My reputation and everybody I know is affected by this company.
I'm going to get it fixed fast. I gave Bill the ball and I said run
the company. Now, it's time to make a change there's no bigger
change you can make than changing the person at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When we talked with Bill Nussey when he resigned (Sept. 1),
he said he knew this management change was coming. During Bill's
tenure with iXL what positive contributions did he make to iXL? He
was named consultant of the year, after all.
</P>
<P>
   A: He put some structure to the company and we will take
advantage of that. Bill had a different focus at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Bill was with us a during a period when revenue was coming over
the transom, so he could afford to take the focus off the revenue
side. It didn't affect us until this quarter. It won't surprise us
again, now that I've restructured the company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Unlike a lot of new economy executives, this isn't your first
experience running a company or your first experience running into
some roadblocks. You've ridden this roller coaster before. Is this
any different, or is it just a new version of what you've been
through before?
</P>
<P>
   A: The difference with my other companies is they were private
and weren't in the fishbowl. These days if you are a public
company, it's a very confining environment. There are Internet
message boards and chat rooms and many more outlets for all kinds
of information. The market is like an accordion and snapped. Some
companies won't come back up. We're going to come back up.

   E-COMMERCE LABEL OWNER SUES MP3.COM
</P>
<P>
   Zomba Recording said it had filed a lawsuit against MP3.com, the
online music distributor that only last week was found in violation
of copyright law in a similar suit filed by Universal Music Group.
The lawsuit accuses of MP3.com of willful copyright infringement in
relation to its MyMP3.com site, a service that lets users listen to
the company's CD collection over the Internet. Zomba's Jive label
records some of the biggest pop acts today, including Britney
Spears, the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. A sister company, Zomba
Music Publishing, filed a separate suit on the same grounds.

   America Online has invested in Cybiko, Inc., a Bloomingdale,
Ill.-based maker of Palmlike hand-held devices aimed at teen-age
consumers. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Don
Wisniewski, president of Cybiko, said that as a result AOL had
become a ``significant shareholder'' in the company. The two
companies have also agreed to work together to give users of the
Cybiko devices access to AOL features such as Instant Messaging and
other teen-oriented content. The Cybiko hand-held devices, which
were released in April 2000, sell for $129. &QL;

   In a deal that could lengthen the life span of the beleaguered

joint venture owned by Hearst and Walt Disney. Lifetime
Entertainment Services said it would purchase a 4.6 percent equity

   ULCER DRUG WORKS IN TRIALS
</P>
<P>
   Human Genome Sciences said Tuesday that its drug for wound
healing had accelerated the repair of chronic venous ulcers in an
early Phase II clinical trial. The drug, repifermin, is a natural
human protein and is believed to be the first drug discovered using
genomics that has shown effectiveness in a randomized clinical
trial. In a test of 94 patients, 63 percent of patients who
received the high dose and 71 percent who got the low dose achieved
75 percent wound closure after 12 weeks, compared with 45 percent
of the patients who got a placebo. The trial was not long enough to
show a difference in complete wound closure between the drug and
placebo, the company said. Venous ulcers are skin lesions in the
legs of people whose veins cannot remove blood fast enough.

   PRI OFFERS EARNINGS WARNING
</P>
<P>
   Shares of PRI Automation plummeted $16.8125, or 39.4 percent, to
$25.875, Tuesday after the semiconductor industry supplier warned
of lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. The company, which
provides automation systems and software for the semiconductor
industry, said it expects its net income for the fourth quarter,
excluding extraordinary items, to be slightly above the breakeven
point. Analysts' consensus estimate had been for earnings of 52
cents. PRI cited manufacturing, capacity and supply chain problems
as reasons for the shortfall.  &QL;

SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES NOTHING NEW IN ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the flashes of ``Buy Coke'' that had moviegoers stampeding to
concession stands, the hidden images of genitalia in liquor ads,
and the word `SEX' secretly emblazoned on Ritz cracker ads, now can
be added George W. Bush's ``RATS.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, only the last example, the latest presidential
campaign flap, actually appeared in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   But fears of subliminal advertising _ nanosecond flashes of
words on TV or carefully embedded images in print _ have flitted in
and out of popular consciousness for four decades. Despite repeated
debunking, the idea has slowly and surely taken root, and the Bush
gaffe, whatever its political consequences, will probably further
the belief that manipulative ad makers are secretly controlling
viewers and readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love conspiracy theories, and people love to hate
advertising. The idea of someone else manipulating you without you
knowing it seems to explain so much,'' said Jef Richards, chair of
the advertising department at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   This latest chapter in American paranoia was uncovered by a
sharp-eyed engineer in Seattle who noticed that a Bush TV ad
slamming Democrat Al Gore's prescription drug plan flashed the word
``RATS,'' as part of the word ``bureaucrats.'' He videotaped it
and, using slow motion, confirmed that the potential epithet
appeared for about one-thirtieth of a second. The registered
Democrat forwarded his findings to the Gore campaign, which alerted
the media.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that subliminal ads have any impact on
viewers' decision making, according to psychologists. Ad makers
have never confessed to using such techniques and the majority
dismiss them as quackery, according to advertising specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign Tuesday vigorously denied that use of ``RATS''
was intentional, but the bizarre lapse broke new ground in the
annals of political advertising. Analysts said they couldn't recall
another example in politics; all research on subliminal ads have
focused on commercial campaigns. Tuesday, psychologists said that
political opinions were even less likely to be swayed by quickly
flashed words than buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As to how ``RATS'' got into the ad in the first place, those
interviewed offered speculation interspersed with chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intentional on somebody's part. You don't miss this
sort of thing,'' said Richards. ``I think maybe it was
tongue-in-cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a time when academics and politicians took
subliminal advertising far more seriously. It started in 1957, at
the height of Sputnik-era paranoia, when ad man James Vicary
boasted publicly that he had done a six-week test at a Ft. Lee,
N.J., movie theater where the messages ``Eat Popcorn'' and ``Drink
Coke'' were flashed every five seconds during movies. He claimed
popcorn sales jumped by 58 percent and coke sales by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The public reacted immediately and Congress called for hearings.
Vicary refused to offer hard data to back his claim, but he did
reassure Congress that his powerful new technique could be used to
benefit humanity by flashing messages like ``Fight Polio.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Vicary was more candid, telling the public his
New Jersey study had relied on a ``small amount of data _ too small
to be meaningful.'' But it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Public fears were stoked, and advertisers' interests piqued.
Several television stations, beginning with one in Bangor, Maine,
used subliminal flashes to simply see if they provoked a response.
In every case, they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists began testing the phenomenon. The notion
that indirect images or suggestions could influence people was
well-known. But researchers have been unable to make the jump from
there to proving that words flashed on a screen could influence
behavior in any significant way.
</P>
<P>
   Most psychologists agree that a person exposed to a visual flash
of a single word can sometimes be steered, immediately afterward,
to pick a similar word from a list of words. The effect lasts
seconds, and only single-word flashes work.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was revived in the 1980s through a book by a
journalist that claimed print ads frequently contained veiled
sexual images used to seduce consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And there was another piece of alleged evidence: a psychoanalyst
published a study in 1982 allegedly showing that some
schizophrenics could be calmed by flashing the phrase, ``Mommy and
I are one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally ridiculous,'' said Robert Fudin, a professor of
psychology at Long Island University in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Fudin has spent part of his career debunking these ideas and, in
one indication of their staying power, published his most recent
attack in an academic journal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subliminal advertising is a joke, wishful thinking at best,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the issue has surfaced regularly, and Congress has
held several hearings over the years.
</P>
<P>
   At one hearing, in 1984, former Congressman Dan Glickman of
Kansas, who is now US Agriculture Secretary, asked aloud: ``How do
you know if subliminal messages are or are not being used during
television and radio commercials?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one of the strange parts of this, it is a Catch-22, of
course,'' replied a Federal Communications Commission official.
``If you know it is there, it is not subliminal.''

X-RAY TELESCOPE DISCOVERS THIRD TYPE OF BLACK HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Black holes, among the most exotic and mysterious objects known
in the depths of space, have just become even more mysterious:
Astronomers reported Tuesday discovering a new type of black hole
whose existence they can't yet explain.
</P>
<P>
   Two types have been known before of these massive objects whose
gravitational fields are so intense that even light cannot escape
from their grip. They were either ``stellar,'' meaning they
contained all the matter of one star, compressed into a region just
a few miles across, or ``supermassive,'' containing the mass of
billions of stars and located in the centers of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   The new black hole, discovered by the orbiting Chandra X-ray
Observatory, falls in between. Its mass is at least as much as 500
stars, and possibly up to 100,000, and it is located in the
vicinity of a galaxy's center, but well away from it _ 600 light
years, or about 3,600 trillion miles, from the center of the galaxy
M82.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers had previously suspected that there might be an
``intermediate'' black hole in M82, but it took the amazing power
of the Chandra telescope, designed and operated by scientists and
engineers at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, to prove it and to determine its approximate size.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found a black hole that sits right in the middle''
between the known types, said Martin Ward of the University of
Leicester in England, in announcing the new find at National
Aeronautics and Space Administration headquarters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new find has another odd characteristic: Its brightness
varies wildly, with small pulses every 10 minutes and with larger
variations over periods of days. This may be a sign that the black
hole is devouring stars or gas from its immediate neighborhood,
which become so hot that they emit a bright burst of radiation just
before disappearing forever into the bottomless abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Stellar-size black holes are believed to form when normal stars
that are three times the sun's mass or more collapse at the end of
their lives, when they have finished burning up all their nuclear
fuel (smaller stars, like the sun, collapse to become white dwarves
instead). But the mass of this black hole is far greater than any
star could ever be, according to accepted theories of star
formation. Either the theories are drastically wrong, or this black
hole must have formed some other way, the astronomers say _ perhaps
by the merger of a cluster of many smaller black holes.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, nobody really knows how the supermassive black holes
at galaxy centers form, although there are at least five theories
in the running. At this point, there remains a central
chicken-or-egg mystery about them: Nobody knows whether the black
holes formed first, becoming the ``seeds'' around which galaxies
condensed, or whether the galaxies formed first and somehow spawned
the black holes within them.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in the theory of black holes that restricts the
sizes they might have. It's just that nobody has yet figured out a
way to make them of such a size. ``There's no physical reason why
midsize black holes can't exist,'' said Douglas Richstone of the
University of Michigan, another member of the team that made the
new find. But, he said, this is ``the first object in this
intermediate range. It points to what will likely be a series of
discoveries of many of these objects, and that will point us toward
an understanding of the formation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first big step in what's going to be a very
exciting period of discovery with black holes,'' he said.

   While this black hole is away from the center of M82 _ a
relatively small and nearby galaxy _ nobody knows whether there is
also a supermassive black hole at the center of that galaxy, which
is obscured from view by a veil of gas and dust. Many astronomers
have become convinced that most, and possibly all, galaxies contain
such black holes at their cores.
</P>
<P>
   This intermediate black hole, said astronomer Andrea Preswich of
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge,
Mass., ``most likely formed by a merger of black holes, or by
swallowing other stars or gas.'' On the other hand, if it formed by
the collapse of a star larger than the theories say should exist,
that too would be an exciting finding for astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the theories are wrong,'' said Preswich, ``that's extremely
interesting.''

FOR GLENN, THE FRUSTRATION IS OVERWHELMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The game was over and it was time to get
on the bus that would take the 0-2 Patriots to the airport, where
they would depart for Foxborough in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Glenn was one of the last players in a glum and defeated
locker room, looking over the summary package of the game and
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so frustrating,'' Glenn would say over and over. ``We had
the game won and we let it slip through our hands like this. This
one really hurts. You can't lose games like this, not when you've
beaten them for 3 1/2 quarters like that. It doesn't make any
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   What made the least sense to Glenn was how his team could have
thought the game was over when they had a 19-7 lead in the fourth
quarter. What would give them any right to think that way or play
that way?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think it's over,'' said Glenn. ``We didn't have a
30-point lead. We weren't blowing anyone away. It was a close,
hard-fought game. We were in it from the beginning. But to think we
had it won when there's that much time left and in their home
stadium with their fans behind them? We should never act that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said coach Bill Belichick's postgame theme was that the
Patriots had to play 60 minutes of football, not 50 or 55. It was
the mantra of the evening, reflected in every sad nook and cranny
of the visitors' locker room at the Meadowlands. It was the look on
everyone's faces and the words on the tip of everyone's tongue. The
players didn't have to be told this. They knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should have to tell us that we need to play 60
minutes,'' said Glenn. ``As professional football players we should
know that. You take nothing for granted. It just seems that when we
need to get a first down so we can run out the clock and put the
game away, we can't get it. It's been that way since I've been
here. We have to put the other team away. We can't give them an
opening to get back into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who caught six passes for 81 yards, played well, but he
wished he could have sprung loose for a long gain like the 39-yard
touchdown pass he caught against Tampa Bay in the opener, or that
he could have kept his feet inbounds on the first drive of the
game, deep in Jets territory, so that the Patriots may have gone in
for a touchdown instead of settling for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets know, more than anyone, that to beat the Patriots
you don't let Glenn out of your sights. The Patriots know, more
than anyone, that to beat the Jets you don't let Wayne Chrebet out
of your reach. For 3 1/2 quarters they didn't. Chrebet saw a lot of
Ty Law and a lot of Lawyer Milloy. But when it counted, he
distanced himself from both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense did a good job against us,'' said Glenn. ``They
played a Cover-2 so they don't give up the stuff down the field.
They had Aaron Glenn on me the whole time with some help and they'd
give us the underneath stuff and that's what we took. We were
hoping to be able to get loose and break a long run after the
catch, but their defense didn't allow that. They played very tough
until the end. We had a chance to still win the game after they
took the lead, but we couldn't get the ball off. Their coverage got
tighter and they really pressured Drew (Bledsoe) at the end where
he didn't have time to find one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn made some key grabs. On third and 2 from the New England
39 late in the first quarter, he caught a 5-yard pass for a first
down to keep alive a drive that led to a 35-yard field goal by Adam
Vinatieri. On the same drive, on third and 3, he made his longest
gain of the night, 20 yards, on a throw into the flat, after which
he scooted free from Glenn and was pulled down by free safety Scott
Frost.
</P>
<P>
   He became more of a force in the second half. He had a 15-yard
gain on third and 5 to the Jets' 25, though Vinatieri subsequently
missed a 29-yard attempt. A 17-yard gain to the New England 46 on
third and 9 kept alive the drive that led to the Patriots' only
touchdown, a 6-yard toss to tight end Eric Bjornson for a 19-7 lead
with 9:56 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets scored on their subsequent drive to pull within 5
points with 6:20 remaining, this was when the Patriots needed to
put the game away. This was where the offense needed to make plays
so the ball wouldn't go back to New York with any appreciable time
left on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our problem the whole game,'' said Glenn. ``We didn't
make any big plays. Our biggest play was _ what? _ 22 yards? They
took that away and we didn't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets handed them their biggest gain of the night _ a 24-yard
interference call on Ray Mickens on that late drive. That penalty
moved the ball to the Patriots' 47, and a few plays later Bledsoe
kept the drive alive by sneaking for 2 yards on fourth and 1 at the
Jets 44.
</P>
<P>
   By this time the clock was running down to the three-minute
range. This is where victory should have been secured. They had
received life twice on the drive. Just one more first down and the
Patriots might have nailed it down.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 7-yard pass to Troy Brown. Chris Floyd then was
stuffed for a 1-yard loss, and the Jets called time out with 2:48
left. On third down, Bledsoe dropped back to pass, trying to play
ball control through the air, since there was no chance of doing it
on the ground. He was sacked by Shaun Ellis (one of the Jets' four
first-round draft picks this year, incidentally), a huge play at
the wrong time for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had to punt, and the Jets struck quickly for the
go-ahead score. All it took was a 44-yard pass to Dedric Ward, then
a 28-yard touchdown toss to Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis sacked Bledsoe again on second down after the Patriots got
the ball back with 1:48 remaining, and rookie John Abraham finished
the Patriots with a sack on fourth and 16.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the defense that was ultimately red-faced at the
end, but it was the offense that couldn't sustain ball control.
That ultimately comes down to the offensive line, and the running
backs not being able to handle the blitzes the Jets threw at them
late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still had a chance to win the game,'' said Glenn. ``We had
plenty of time left, but we didn't make any plays and they did. I
guess they wanted it more than we did.''

TV DEBATE TO PIT RODHAM CLINTON, LAZIO FOR FIRST TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - The season's hottest Senate battle sees its first
real skirmish Wednesday night, as Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick
Lazio meet for a televised debate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of public speaking, the First Lady has never
before engaged in this sort of candidates' forum _ a point she has
made several times lately, in a stab at lowering expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, several politicians and analysts say, it is Lazio _ the
four-term congressman from Long Island _ whose performance could
transform the tenor of the race, one way or the other, in a single
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a fairly well-formed opinion of Hillary Clinton,
but Rick Lazio remains a work-in-progress,'' Maurice Carroll, head
of the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazio's job,'' he continued, ``will be to show he can play in
the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   One well-placed Republican agreed: ``If he looks good, shows he
has some presence, shows he can talk in the same room with Hillary
for an hour and not look foolish, then he comes out ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had a preliminary hurdle to clear Tuesday _ a
Democratic primary against Mark McMahon, an unknown Manhattan
doctor who had collected enough petition-signatures to force a
formal run-off and who hoped to sponge up anti-Hillary
protest-votes from the few who turned out for various,
better-publicized House primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady and her husband voted Tuesday morning at a school
near their new home in suburban Chappaqua. ``After all these years
of her helping me, it was a thrill,'' President Clinton said after
casting the ballot, his first as a New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio did not have to contend with a Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Several top Republicans are anxious about the debate _
including, some say, Gov. George Pataki, who hand-picked Lazio to
run for the Senate seat last May after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of disappointment with Lazio,'' said a close
associate of Pataki's, who asked not to be identified. ``He's been
a lazy campaigner. He hasn't made himself a visible force. He
hasn't let people know who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has spent most of his campaign emphasizing who he is not.
One fundraising letter stated, in its entirety: ``It won't take me
six pages to convince you to send me an urgently needed
contribution for my United States Senate campaign in New York. It
will only take six words. I'm running against Hillary Rodham
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   This I'm-not-Hillary tactic catapaulted the previously obscure
Lazio to a neck-and-neck standoff with the Mrs. Clinton just a week
after entering the race. But he has not advanced an inch in the
months since.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not made much progress, either.
</P>
<P>
   Three statewide polls, taken over the past week, all show her
and Lazio essentially tied. In all three, Clinton is ahead, but by
fewer percentage-points than the statistical margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady knows she rankles many people. So, from the
outset of her campaign, she has emphasized key issues _ education,
health care, Social Security _ on which the majority of New Yorkers
agree with her positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the election is decided on the issues,'' Carroll said,
``she wins.''
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, the more genial Lazio has focused on
character. The refrain in one of his most frequently aired TV ads
goes, ``Hillary Clinton _ you just can't trust her.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lazio has watched his own nice-guy image deteriorate in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, a Zogby poll found 55 percent of likely voters had a
positive view of Lazio, while only 15 percent had a negative view.
By last week, the positives were up just slightly, to 59 percent,
but the negatives had doubled to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Mrs. Clinton is viewed positively by 53 percent,
negatively by 43 percent _ about the same as when her campaign
began in the summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Lazio has started emphasizing some issues, too.
Monday, he issued an education-reform proposal that would cost $98
billion over 10 years. Polls show voters consider education as the
most important issue _ and Clinton as better-suited to deal with
it. Lazio's proposal gives him something to tout when the topic
comes up at the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80 percent of likely voters plan to watch the debate,
according to one statewide poll. In New York, it will be broadcast
live from Buffalo at 7-8 p.m. Nationwide, MSNBC will air it from
10-11pm EST.

A KNIGHT DISCIPLE EXPLAINS HIS FIERCE LOYALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the late '60s, and Bobby Knight's West Point gang had
just finished a daily ritual. At noon, Knight and the young
assistant coaches from all the sports at Army met for a game of
pickup hoops, which is still remembered on campus today as being
more bloodbath than basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But upon leaving the gym this particular day, the weary group
noticed a young woman jogger huffing and puffing her way up a hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at her,'' Knight said. ``No matter how hard she tries,
she'll never lose that fat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' answered Bill Parcells, ``that's my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor basketball coach Dave Bliss told that story yesterday.
``I realized then,'' said Bliss, laughing, ``that no matter how
special Bob Knight was _ and it was obvious he was going to be
special _ he would be sticking his foot in his mouth at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, of course, Knight's mouth would end up with both
feet, both ankles, both knees, etc., firmly planted. It became part
of the legend. And his legend grew to massive status, which,
speaking of fat, included a hangover gut not so well hidden
underneath a red sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, count me among the media masses who said, ``It's about
time,'' when Indiana University ended the 29-year Knight reign this
week. The Ayatollah of college basketball had been ousted. He would
bully no more athletic department secretaries in Bloomington.
</P>
<P>
   The tough side of Knight was fine. Even commendable. Blasting
away at the media, his bosses, his players _ I've got no problem
with that. But he also picked on people who couldn't fight back _
secretaries, NCAA tournament volunteers, bus drivers, and anyone
else who happened to be in his line of fire on a particular day.
I've got no use for people like that.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there is obviously another side of Knight, the side
that inspires such long-term loyalty and devotion from a wide
variety of people who have crossed paths, and maybe swords, with
Knight over the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among that group is Knight's old basketball-at-noon West Point
gang. He was head coach of his sport, but this bunch came from all
over campus. Parcells, Al Groh (now the coach of the Jets), Ken
Hatfield, and John Mackovic from the football staff. The late
Arthur Ashe from tennis. Bliss and Bob Weltlich were Knight
assistants in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   When Bliss says, ``Bob Knight is like my older brother, which
means our friendship is unconditional,'' he is sounding an echo
from prominent Knight disciples around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't always agree with Bob or with his actions, but I love
him,'' Bliss said.
</P>
<P>
   Next question: ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss told of a dinner he attended this summer in Indiana that]
was a wrapup for Knight's charity golf tournament. At that dinner
an Army general spoke of his basketball-playing days under Knight
at West Point. Addressing the current Indiana players who were in
attendance, the general said, ``I knew Bobby Knight before he
mellowed,'' a line that brought down the house.
</P>
<P>
   But then he added, ``I left West Point, and went to Vietnam and
I know I saved lives on the battlefield because of the discipline I
learned under Bob Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bliss, that's the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than my parents, Bob had the biggest impact on my life
because he made me realize things about myself that I didn't know,
and would probably have never found out,'' he said. ``Working for
him \Rat both Army and Indiana\S was the hardest thing I've ever
done, and also the best thing I've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the ``abuse'' carried over to his assistants. ``Maybe more
so than the players,'' Bliss said. ``But if you accept and learn
from it, you know it's his way of showing tough love. And you also
know you have a fiercely loyal friend for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there a fine line, however, between tough love and someone
who has a problem with anger management? And that is, don't you
think, Knight's problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question it is, and he knows it as well as we know
it,'' Bliss said. ``The day isn't long enough for me to list my
sins, but his anger is Bob's sin. You can't just take some of Bob
Knight, you have to take all of Bob Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed, and he hasn't. I'm not so sure either one
is wrong. There was a time when every coach wanted to be the strict
disciplinarian. Truthfully, every coach wants that right now. But
Bob is from another era and this is a different era, whether we
like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Indiana University found out, defending his decisions and
his actions finally reached a point where that relationship had to
end. Probably, this ending was best for both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   What the future now holds for Knight is uncertain, but a devoted
friend like Bliss doesn't concern himself with where that next
basketball job might be. ``I don't want his story to end with the
image of the last few days,'' Bliss said. ``Bob brought much of
this on himself, but he's also better than this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patton and MacArthur also had their names soiled a bit late in
their Army careers, but over the years, their images have evolved
the right way. I hope Bob's legacy evolves that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, ``General'' Knight would be highly pleased to join
such esteemed company. \Ntagtop:Randy Galloway's ``Sports at Six''
can be heard weeknights, 6-8 p.m., on WBAP NewsTalk 820.

SYNAGOGUE NEAR INFAMOUS NAZI DEATH CAMP REOPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSWIECIM, Poland -- Elinoar Paleiov was four years old when she
fled Poland just weeks before the outbreak of World War II. This
week, she came back to her hometown, a place known to most of the
world as Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Now an Israeli citizen, Paleiov was one of about 100 Jews who
went to Oswiecim, where the Auschwitz death camp was located, to
attend the rededication of the only synagogue in the city to
survive World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said reopening a synagogue just 1.9 miles from the
infamous Nazi concentration camp was an important step in reviving
Jewish culture in Oswiecim. The city, which once boasted a thriving
Jewish majority, became synonymous with the holocaust, and today
there are no Jews among its 50,000 people. The last Jewish
resident, Eimelech Korneich, died in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a vibrant symbol of life regenerated and of the
angel of death that passed over here,'' said Fred Schwartz,
President of the New York-based Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation.
The foundation raised $10 million to renovate and reopen the Chevra
Lomdei Mishnayot synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Like Paleiov, several of those at Tuesday's solemn rededication
ceremony were natives of Oswiecim who had been back for more than
60 years. Paleiov, now 65, fled Poland with her brother and father
in August 1939. The family made its way to Israel by way of Russia,
Iran, and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   As she explored her childhood home this week for the first time
in 61 years, she got a pleasant surprise. Tereza Miton was waiting
for her and gave her an envelope filled with prewar photographs of
Paleiov's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother worked as a housekeeper for your family, and
she wanted you to have these,'' Miton, 30, said. ``I have been
saving them for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' Paleiov said, choking back tears.
``You don't know what this means to me. When we left we had no
pictures of our family. And to think that somebody thought to save
these.''
</P>
<P>
   Many said they hoped such small gestures of reconciliation would
become commonplace as the city rediscovers its heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 50 years of communism the Jewish past and present were
forgotten,'' said Tomac Kuncewicz, who will administer the
synagogue and an adjacent Jewish historical center. ``But this is
part of Polish history and we need to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuncewicz, 28, is a Catholic who earned a masters degree in
Jewish Studies at Brandeis University outside Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue was the only one of 12 in Oswiecim that the
occupying German army didn't level. They defaced it and used it to
store munitions.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue was briefly revived after World War II but was
abandoned when most Jews left communist Poland. Authorities used
the building as a carpet warehouse and it fell into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Polish government returned the synagogue to the
Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dignitaries on hand was Prince El Hassan bin Talal of
Jordan, brother of the late King Hussein, and representatives of
the United States, Israel, Poland, and the Roman Catholic Church.
Hassan joined Jewish leaders in nailing a traditional mezuza prayer
scroll to the door frame of the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our commitment is the reconciliation between the adherence to
our faith and respect for what's human and sacred in each of us,''
Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
   Polish officials said they hoped the synagogue's renewal would
bring Jews and Poles closer together and help lessen some of the
stigma attached to the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a place that is symbol of our times. It could become
a place of reconciliation,'' said Mayor Jozef Krawczyk. ``World War
II was a tragedy for both Jews and Poles.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 6 million Poles, including 3 million Jews _ 91 percent of
the prewar Jewish population _ died at the hands of the Nazis. At
the Auschwitz death camp alone, some 1.5 million people, most of
them Jews, were systematically murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the surviving Jews eventually left for Israel, the US
and other countries, and only about 20,000 live in Poland today.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent to the synagogue, the Auschwitz Jewish Center also
opened Tuesday with exhibits on prewar Jewish life, a library and
archives, conference rooms, and a kosher cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will serve the needs of Jewish visitors who want to meet,
pray, reflect and feel safe,'' said Nadine Greenfield, a native of
Boston and project manager for the Auschwitz Jewish Center
Foundation.

Sport: Track and field
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gold medals at stake: 46 (24 men, 22 women) Events: Men will
compete in 100 meters; 200; 400; 800; 1,500; 5,000; 10,000;
marathon; 110 hurdles; 400 hurdles; 4x100 relay; 4x400 relay; high
jump; pole vault; long jump; triple jump; shot put; discus;
javelin; hammer; and decathlon. Women also compete in those events,
except they have 100-meter hurdles instead of 110 and the
heptathlon instead of the decathlon. The men also have the
3,000-meter steeplechase and the 20-kilometer and 50K walks, and
the women have a 10K walk. Venue: Sydney Olympic Stadium
Competition dates: Sept. 22-25, Sept. 27-Oct. 1 Year introduced:
1896 History: The first Olympic event in ancient times, circa 776
B.C., was a footrace. When the Games were revived in 1896, track
and field reassumed its preeminent place on the Olympic card.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's history, in many ways, is the saga of the Olympics.
On the ovals of the world's great Olympic stadiums, legends were
born, through the feats of Jesse Owens, Paavo Nurmi, Carl Lewis,
Florence Griffith Joyner, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful nation in track and field has been the
United States, with 299 gold medals and 694 overall. The former
Soviet Union is a distant second in the gold-medal count with 71
and has 214 medals overall. Third place, interestingly, is Finland
with 48 golds. Past heroes: Where to begin? How's about Carl Lewis,
Jesse Owens, Paavo Nurmi, Bob Beamon, Al Oerter, Emil Zatopek,
Lasse Viren, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Heike Drechsler, Wilma Rudolph,
Betty Cuthbert, Abebe Bikila, Edwin Moses and many, many others.
1996 medalists: U.S. gold medalists included Michael Johnson, 200
and 400; Allen Johnson, 110 hurdles; Derrick Adkins, 400 hurdles;
men's 4x400 relay; Charles Austin, high jump; Carl Lewis, long
jump; Kenny Harrison, triple jump; Randy Barnes, shot put; Dan
O'Brien, decathlon; Gail Devers, women's 100; and the women's 4x100
and 4x400 relays. It's going to be a tough act to follow. Rule
book: New events for 2000 include the women's hammer throw and the
immensely popular (don't ask why) women's pole vault. Best of the
Yanks: Marion Jones, who will try to capture gold medals in the
women's 100, 200, long jump and both relays; Michael Johnson in the
men's 400; Maurice Greene, men's 100; Charles Austin, men's high
jump; Allen Johnson and Gail Devers in their high hurdles; and
Stacy Dragila, women's pole vault. Rest of the blokes: Australian
Cathy Freeman in the women's 400; Gabriela Szabo, Romania, women's
5,000; Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopia, men's 10,000; Ivan Pedroso,
Cuba, men's long jump; and Tomas Dvorak, Czech Republic, decathlon.
U.S. medal chances: Without benefit of the adoring home crowd, it's
going to be very, very difficult to match the 13-gold-medal
performance of Atlanta. The Americans won 22 medals overall. In
Sydney, the number could dip below 15. Et cetera: If you want the
name of a possible Marion Jones spoiler, remember Fiona May of
Italy in the long jump. ... TCU ex Jon Drummond will run the 100
and probably the 4x100 relay. ... The pride of Keller, Bubba
Thornton, also known as head coach of the University of Texas men's
track program, is one of Team USA's assistant coaches. ... U.S.
discus thrower Adam Setliff calls California home but graduated
from L.D. Bell High School in Hurst. Setliff has been hot and could
medal in Sydney. ... Certain headline for next week: ``Visiting
track athletes complain about constant winds at Olympic Stadium''
... Californian Adam Nelson is throwing the shot so well this year
_ 72 feet plus _ that Jones' husband, the scowling C.J. Hunter,
injured and scratched from the Games, likely will not be missed.
</P>
<P>
   Let Jones' Drive for Five begin Michael Johnson captured hearts
in Atlanta by dashing to a world record and three gold medals in a
pair of golden slippers.
</P>
<P>
   But how about what Marion Jones is after _ a whole golden
necklace?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this will be an odd Olympics for Johnson, the epicenter
of all things electric and golden four years ago. Having seen his
workload diminished to one individual event, the 400 meters,
Johnson will not be nearly as visible, nor seem as dominating, as
he did in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The torch now passes to Jones, the wonder woman who will attempt
to win gold medals in the 100, 200, long jump and both relays.
</P>
<P>
   Look for her now at your neighborhood grocer checkout stand.
Jones' million-dollar smile radiates from the cover of various
national magazines this week. To a lesser person, this would be
some awfully heavy baggage to tote.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones is so even-tempered, so unflappably confident, she has
shrugged off the pre-Olympic hype about her five-medal quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a dollar for every time someone has asked me about
that,'' Jones sighed at the Olympic trials, ``I'd be a rich person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oops. Wrong choice of words, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Mrs. Jones really is rich, even by track and
field's occasionally nouveau riche standards. Her pleasant face
beams back not just from magazine covers, but billboards. The Nike
TV spots showing just part of her, playing the soulful DJ Mrs.
Jones, has been a marketing hit.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones has an Achilles' heel, it could be the long jump. It's
her weakest event. Even Marion admits that. Her problem is one of
technique and timing and, in the long jump's case, maybe even being
too fast for her own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've decided I'm not even going to talk about that anymore,''
Jones said about the relentless media critiquing of her jumping
technique. ``People are going to criticize my jumping even if I win
the gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson four years ago, Jones is in for a busy Olympics.
Her only respite figures to be in the preliminary rounds of the
relays, in which Jones is expected to be spelled by other U.S.
runners.

   IRELAND: NO RELIEF IN IRISH INFLATION
</P>
<P>
   The inflation rate in Ireland remained at 6.2 percent in August,
the highest in the European Union, according to figures released by
the Central Statistics Office. The government said the rate would
moderate by the end of the year, but Irish economists predicted
that the worldwide increase in oil prices would push inflation up
to 7 percent within the next few months. In response to the
figures, three of Ireland's largest trade unions called for a
renegotiation of the national wage agreement, implemented when
inflation ran at 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   IRISH PILOTS WANT MORE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Pilots in Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, demanded pay increases
that would make their salaries comparable with pilots in other
airlines that belong to the One World Alliance, of which Aer Lingus
is a member. In the case of top-earning pilots, who currently make
87,000 Irish pounds ($95,000) a year, the demands called for a 100
percent increase, to more than 160,000 Irish pounds ($190,000). The
Irish Airline Pilots' Association said that its members share work
with employees of other airlines, and that it had received
complaints that Aer Lingus salaries were lowering the industry
average.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE DEAL FOR INFOSTRADA
</P>
<P>
   The British mobile phone company Vodafone AirTouch is talking to
Wind SpA about buying Infostrada, an Italian fixed-line phone
company that Vodafone inherited as part of its purchase of
Germany's Mannesmann. Wind's bid of 11.5 billion euros, or about
$9.7 billion, exceeded a 9 billion euro offer from Albacom, a
business phone consortium that is 23 percent owned by British
Telecommunications. Specializing in wireless, fixed-line and
Internet operations, Wind is controlled by the Italian state-owned
electricity utility Enel and by France Telecom. Should the sale not
go through, Vodafone could revert to its original plan of selling a
49 percent stake of Infostrada through a share offering.

   DE BEERS REASSURES RUSSIA
</P>
<P>
   Top executives from De Beers, the supplier of half the world's
rough cut diamonds, met with Russian executives and government
officials Tuesday in Moscow to persuade them that its new company
strategy would not harm the diamond trade in Russia, the world's
second-largest producer of diamonds. Russia's monopoly producer,
Alrosa, said it would continue to work with De Beers and expected
to conclude a new contract before the current one expires late next
year. That was is in contrast to comments by Russian government
officials in July that Russia may change its relations with the
South Africa-based producer. &QL;

   BRAZIL'S INFLATION EASES
</P>
<P>
   The inflation rate in Brazil fell in August, reassuring
investors that a spike in consumer prices the month before had
faded. The benchmark IPCA inflation index rose 1.31 percent in
August, down from a 1.61 percent increase in July, as the effects
of government-regulated increases in electricity, telephone and
gasoline prices dissipated. Gasoline prices made the largest
contribution to August inflation, rising 7.54 percent. For the
first eight months of the year, the Brazilian inflation rate was
4.6 percent. The Brazilian government's goal is to keep the rate
from exceeding 6 percent in 2000.

   INVESTMENT IN CHINA
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment in China fell nearly 8 percent to $22.79
billion in the first eight months of the year compared with the
same period a year earlier, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation said. But it said new contracts for investment
not yet delivered rose 31.27 percent to $33.25 billion as foreign
companies position themselves for what is expected to be a
friendlier business climate after China joins the World Trade
Organization. The country's WTO membership is expected to be
finalized this year.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA INTERNET MERGER
</P>
<P>
   China's Nasdaq-listed Sohu.com Inc. has reached a preliminary
agreement to acquire rival ChinaRen.com, in what would be the first
major merger of an expected consolidation of China's fledgling
Internet industry. Neither company is making money and Sohu.com's
share price plunged shortly after it sold stock to the public for
$13 a share in July. The company's stock now trades at about half
that price.

<P>
   TELEVISION RECALL
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said it will recall two defective
color TV models that could overheat and catch fire, a problem the
company has known about for at least eight years. The sets were
marketed only in Japan. The company had not previously recalled the
TVs because the defect is not that serious, officials said. It
decided to do so now because of a recent defect cover-up by the
related Mitsubishi Motors Corp. &QC;

BRITISH WRESTLE WITH BLOCKADE-INDUCED FUEL PANIC

<P>
   LONDON _ Nearly all gasoline pumps in London were dry Tuesday
night, and the rest of Britain could be dry by Thursday as panicky
motorists continued their rush on the nation's petrol stations and
an emboldened group of protesters stepped up their blockades of
British oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, inspired by more militant outbursts in France last
week and reflecting similar unrest spreading across Europe, had
affected all nine of Britain's oil refineries. The resulting panic
emptied most of the nation's 13,000 gas stations by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the biggest crisis since his Labor Party won a landslide
election in May 1997, British Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed not
to lower the fuel tax that makes British gas prices, at nearly $5 a
gallon, the most expensive in Europe. Instead, a defiant Blair
ordered the oil companies to defy the demonstrators at the refinery
gates, and instructed police to make sure there was no intimidation
of drivers ferrying gas to gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legitimate protest is one thing. Trying to bring the country
to a halt is another,'' said Blair, emerging from 10 Downing St.
after daylong meetings to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, some trucks moved out of the refineries.
Facing the most serious challenge to his authority, Blair vowed
that things would be back to normal in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Truck drivers for the oil companies have expressed solidarity
with the demonstrators, many of them truckers and farmers, while
the oil companies had suggested they did not want to risk injury to
their drivers by defying the blockades. Angry British government
officials privately accused the oil companies of not doing enough
to force its drivers to make deliveries, claiming the oil firms had
a financial incentive to let pressure build for a tax cut, as lower
fuel prices would lead to more people buying more gas.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Britain, meanwhile, there were signs of panic, chaos
and what Bill Morris, head of the transporation workers union, who
called for an end to the blockades, described as anarchy.
Increasingly frustrated motorists waited for hours in long lines to
buy gas. The panic even spread to supermarkets, where panicky
shoppers loaded up on groceries, fearing that distributors would
soon run out of gas and be unable to deliver food. Some hospitals
cancelled operations, and the health minister, Alan Milburn, warned
that some people would die unless the crisis was resolved by
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Blair and his Cabinet huddled at 10 Downing St., trying to
forge a strategy to end the crisis, tension mounted among ordinary
Britons. At an Esso station in Highgate, in North London, a
fistfight broke out when one motorist accused another of cutting in
line by approaching on foot to fill a cannister.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy,'' said Mohammed Aziz, an engineer, as he sat in
the long line at the Esso station. ``People are panicking, and now,
you see, some are even fighting over petrol.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz said he left work early to fill his tank after hearing news
reports suggest that London would soon be dry. He said he had
sympathy for the demonstrators who were precipitating the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay more for petrol than anyone in Europe,'' he said. ``The
government should listen to the people and lower the fuel tax.''
</P>
<P>
   But speaking to the annual conference of British trade unions in
Glasgow, Gordon Brown, chancellor of the Exchequer, ruled out any
chance of the government lowering the tax. Sounding like Jimmy
Stewart's banker character George Bailey in ``It's a Wonderful
Life,'' Brown tried to calm those who were making a run, in this
case on gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   He said the money raised through the fuel tax, some $54 billion
last year, is used to pay for the national health service and
education. For some two decades, Britain's income tax rates have
been among the lowest in the 15-member European Union, as the
British treasury has instead relied on indirect taxation, such as
the fuel tax, to raise money for essential services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not make tax policy this afternoon because of
blockades this morning,'' a defiant Brown declared.
</P>
<P>
   But along the picket lines, the demonstrators accused the
government of backing itself into a corner by adopting such a hard
line and by not acknowledging that the fuel tax disproportionately
hurts some industries, such as trucking, which cannot reduce their
use of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the picket line at the Stanlow oil refinery in
Cheshire in northwest England, protest leader Keith Thompson
accused the government of being ``totally out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just about a few farmers and truckers looking for
tax relief. This is about a nation being ripped off by Tony Blair's
New Britain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the disruption and fuel shortages were most acute in
Britain, the popular anger over high fuel prices has spread across
Europe. In Germany, the government has taken a hard line similar to
Blair's, saying it will not bargain with demonstrators. In Ireland,
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern was scheduled to meet with the
association representing the nation's trucking industry, who have
vowed to bring the country to a standstill unless the government,
which has registered record surpluses in recent years, cuts the
fuel tax. Gerry McMahon, president of the Irish Road Haulage
Association, said his drivers wanted a 20 percent cut in the tax
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish drivers are threatening similar action, and protests in
Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway have disrupted those countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is most serious here in Britain, where a loose
federation of farmers, truckers and other small business people who
accuse the government of ignoring their concerns has seized upon an
issue that has struck an uncharacteristic chord with a British
population that is traditionally hostile to strikes and the
inconvenience that comes with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher largely
succeeded in breaking the strength of British labor unions in the
1980s, and there is little British appetite for the sort of street
protests that are a regular feature of life in France, where there
is widespread support for as many as 10,000 strikes and
demonstrations a year.

SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES NOTHING NEW IN ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the flashes of ``Buy Coke'' that had moviegoers stampeding to
concession stands, the hidden images of genitalia in liquor ads,
and the word `SEX' secretly emblazoned on Ritz cracker ads, now can
be added George W. Bush's ``RATS.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, only the last example, the latest presidential
campaign flap, actually appeared in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   But fears of subliminal advertising _ nanosecond flashes of
words on TV or carefully embedded images in print _ have flitted in
and out of popular consciousness for four decades. Despite repeated
debunking, the idea has slowly and surely taken root, and the Bush
gaffe, whatever its political consequences, will probably further
the belief that manipulative ad makers are secretly controlling
viewers and readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love conspiracy theories, and people love to hate
advertising. The idea of someone else manipulating you without you
knowing it seems to explain so much,'' said Jef Richards, chair of
the advertising department at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   This latest chapter in American paranoia was uncovered by a
sharp-eyed engineer in Seattle who noticed that a Bush TV ad
slamming Democrat Al Gore's prescription drug plan flashed the word
``RATS,'' as part of the word ``bureaucrats.'' He videotaped it
and, using slow motion, confirmed that the potential epithet
appeared for about one-thirtieth of a second. The registered
Democrat forwarded his findings to the Gore campaign, which alerted
the media.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that subliminal ads have any impact on
viewers' decision making, according to psychologists. Ad makers
have never confessed to using such techniques and the majority
dismiss them as quackery, according to advertising specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign Tuesday vigorously denied that use of ``RATS''
was intentional, but the bizarre lapse broke new ground in the
annals of political advertising. Analysts said they couldn't recall
another example in politics; all research on subliminal ads have
focused on commercial campaigns. Tuesday, psychologists said that
political opinions were even less likely to be swayed by quickly
flashed words than buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As to how ``RATS'' got into the ad in the first place, those
interviewed offered speculation interspersed with chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intentional on somebody's part. You don't miss this
sort of thing,'' said Richards. ``I think maybe it was
tongue-in-cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a time when academics and politicians took
subliminal advertising far more seriously. It started in 1957, at
the height of Sputnik-era paranoia, when ad man James Vicary
boasted publicly that he had done a six-week test at a Ft. Lee,
N.J., movie theater where the messages ``Eat Popcorn'' and ``Drink
Coke'' were flashed every five seconds during movies. He claimed
popcorn sales jumped by 58 percent and coke sales by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The public reacted immediately and Congress called for hearings.
Vicary refused to offer hard data to back his claim, but he did
reassure Congress that his powerful new technique could be used to
benefit humanity by flashing messages like ``Fight Polio.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Vicary was more candid, telling the public his
New Jersey study had relied on a ``small amount of data _ too small
to be meaningful.'' But it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Public fears were stoked, and advertisers' interests piqued.
Several television stations, beginning with one in Bangor, Maine,
used subliminal flashes to simply see if they provoked a response.
In every case, they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists began testing the phenomenon. The notion
that indirect images or suggestions could influence people was
well-known. But researchers have been unable to make the jump from
there to proving that words flashed on a screen could influence
behavior in any significant way.
</P>
<P>
   Most psychologists agree that a person exposed to a visual flash
of a single word can sometimes be steered, immediately afterward,
to pick a similar word from a list of words. The effect lasts
seconds, and only single-word flashes work.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was revived in the 1980s through a book by a
journalist that claimed print ads frequently contained veiled
sexual images used to seduce consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And there was another piece of alleged evidence: a psychoanalyst
published a study in 1982 allegedly showing that some
schizophrenics could be calmed by flashing the phrase, ``Mommy and
I are one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally ridiculous,'' said Robert Fudin, a professor of
psychology at Long Island University in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Fudin has spent part of his career debunking these ideas and, in
one indication of their staying power, published his most recent
attack in an academic journal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subliminal advertising is a joke, wishful thinking at best,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the issue has surfaced regularly, and Congress has
held several hearings over the years.
</P>
<P>
   At one hearing, in 1984, former Congressman Dan Glickman of
Kansas, who is now US Agriculture Secretary, asked aloud: ``How do
you know if subliminal messages are or are not being used during
television and radio commercials?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one of the strange parts of this, it is a Catch-22, of
course,'' replied a Federal Communications Commission official.
``If you know it is there, it is not subliminal.''

 &HT;    Gore, Lieberman tour in Ohio
 &HT;    By Thomas Gnau
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Ohio _ Close up, Democratic presidential candidate
Vice President
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore doesn't look larger than life. But the roar of students
that greeted him in the Middletown High School cafeteria Tuesday
was.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and running mate U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., brought
their campaign to classrooms, hallways, the cafeteria and Paul
Walker Gymnasium surrounded by
</P>
<P>
   school staff, campaign aides, Secret Service agents and - of
course - a lot of students.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Middletown as part of his campaign's ``On the Road
to A+ Education'' tour. The focus was Democratic ideas on improving
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good message,'' said Middletown Board of Education member
Katie McNeil. She added, ``Our students need to hear that from more
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and I love the Middletown High School Middies,''
Lieberman declared
</P>
<P>
   after he and Gore ascended a platform in the gym to the tune of
``Rocky Top,'' performed by an MHS pep band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we take these cheerleaders with us around America?'' the
Connecticut
</P>
<P>
   senator asked, referring to the girls on bleachers behind the
candidates. That ignited shrieks and another roar from 1,700
assembled students.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Middies appeared taken with the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore entered the cafeteria at about 11:30 a.m., cheering
students stood
</P>
<P>
   on tables and chairs to get a glimpse and take photographs.
Students exchanged cameras with other students in an effort to get
better shots. Beaming cafeteria workers waited behind the lunch
serving counter as Gore picked up a tray. He took onion rings, a
bowl of spaghetti and bottled water, and he shook hands with
students and employees as he went.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman, who entered the cafeteria a few moments
later, sat down
</P>
<P>
   with Principal Gary Perkins, social studies teacher Mary Harvey
and four female students.
</P>
<P>
   Gore invited those surrounding his table to ask him questions.
``How's the food?'' junior Josh Estoye, standing a few feet away,
shouted at Gore above the din.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent,'' Gore answered.
</P>
<P>
   Estoye, 17, said a moment later he spoke to Gore ``just to start
up a
</P>
<P>
   conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The student said he will be old enough to vote on Election Day
Nov. 7. He
</P>
<P>
   said he doesn't know which candidate will get his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I watch TV and all the political shows, I realize it's
interesting to
</P>
<P>
   know what's going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Lieberman greeted members of Libby Armentrout's
English class. Before the vice presidential candidate arrived,
Armentrout described her students as ``all seniors, all potential
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the class had missed lunch, and had been holding off
hunger with
</P>
<P>
   ``animal crackers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pretty pumped up since 10 o'clock, so we're very
excited,'' she
</P>
<P>
   said. A few minutes later, Lieberman entered the room with a
slight smile and a
</P>
<P>
   wave. ``Hello, everybody,'' he said. ``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We saved you the seat of honor, which is perched at my desk,''
Armentrout
</P>
<P>
   said.
</P>
<P>
   She told Lieberman that the class was starting to study
``Beowulf,'' an Old
</P>
<P>
   English poem written some 1,000 years ago. A first draft of a
paper on the
</P>
<P>
   work was due today, but his visit delayed the assignment due
date, she told
</P>
<P>
   him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So did I give you a break there?'' Lieberman asked the
students. ``Tell your
</P>
<P>
   families to all vote for the Gore-Lieberman campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   When he learned that one student was 18, Lieberman told him:
``Be sure to
</P>
<P>
   register (to vote). I'm serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman learned that striving to write well was an ongoing
concern in the
</P>
<P>
   class. ``It's such an important skill,'' he said. He said when
he was a high school student, ``the time I was expressing myself
most at that time was when I was writing because I was awkward
verbally.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the class that he had about 120 attorneys working for
him when he was
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's attorney general. Some of them, he said, couldn't
write very
</P>
<P>
   well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made them less effective lawyers,'' he said. ``I didn't
expect to give that lecture this morning,'' he added a bit
wistfully a moment later.
</P>
<P>
   When told the students would soon tackle resume and technical
writing,
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman became more serious. He said a poorly-written resume
``closes my
</P>
<P>
   mind to that person, even if that person happens to be capable
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lieberman asked senior Aaron Fay where he wanted to go to
college, Fay shook his head. ``Anywhere but a school in Ohio,'' Fay
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing as you come along is to be educated
today,'' Lieberman said. ``We want to try, Al Gore and I, to make
that a little easier for you.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the students about Gore's plans for a ``$10,000 tax
deduction for tuition'' at a college, trade or technical school as
well as a savings fun in which citizens and their employers could
invest tax-free for education costs.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of friends with whom he graduated from high school in
Stamford, Conn., almost 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their expectation was, so long as they went to work and did
their job, they
</P>
<P>
   could work at their place for 35, 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all changed now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides ushered watching reporters out of the class
before Lieberman
</P>
<P>
   finished his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the candidates arrived, about 11 protesters made their
presence felt
</P>
<P>
   near Manchester Technical Center, just north of the high school
at the
</P>
<P>
   intersection of Breiel Boulevard and Manchester Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not really pose a problem,'' said Middletown Police
Lt. David
</P>
<P>
   VanArsdale. ``They were orderly and complied with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was arrested, he said. He said one of the protesters held
a sign that
</P>
<P>
   said, ``Gore lies.''

 &HT;    Small school has a big day with Gore
 &HT;    By Rick McCrabb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Ohio _ Blood pressures returned to normal at
Middletown High
</P>
<P>
   School a few minutes before 1 o'clock Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the motorcade carrying Vice President and Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore and his running mate Sen. Joe
Lieberman pulled out of the school parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   For a school that has been in session for less than two weeks,
MHS passed its
</P>
<P>
   biggest test of the year Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big day for Middletown,'' said Principal Gary
Perkins, who credited his assistant principals, faculty and staff
for their extra effort
</P>
<P>
   the last few days. ``There is a certain sense of relief, and at
the same time, a true sense of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief that nothing happened to Gore and Lieberman; pride in the
way the
</P>
<P>
   students responded to the politicians.
</P>
<P>
   School officials learned late last week that Gore and Lieberman
planned to
</P>
<P>
   stop at the high school during their campaign swing - ``On the
Road to an A+
</P>
<P>
   Education'' - through southwestern Ohio. Sandwiched between
visits to
</P>
<P>
   Franklin High School and Cincinnati State Technical and
Community College,
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman spent about two hours at MHS.
</P>
<P>
   While the actual event lasted only a short time, the planning
and the hype
</P>
<P>
   went on for days.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins and the vice president's advance team - a lot of guys
who rarely, if
</P>
<P>
   ever, smile - spent the weekend at the high school, canvassing
the building
</P>
<P>
   for possible trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   They tapped the phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   They gave school officials a bomb threat plan.
</P>
<P>
   They locked the entrance to the roof.
</P>
<P>
   They inspected the drainage area by the nearby practice football
field.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs searched the hallways for explosives.
</P>
<P>
   They changed plans ``minute-by-minute,'' according to Renee
Martin, an office
</P>
<P>
   secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   More Secret Service agents, members of the Dayton SWAT team
perched on the high school roof, all available Middletown police
officers in uniform and
</P>
<P>
   officers from the Ohio Highway Patrol parked at about every
street corner.
</P>
<P>
   All for Gore and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives me a whole new appreciation of the Secret Service
and the police departments,'' Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin described the last few days as ``very interesting and
very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added with a smile: ``I'm glad it's over. I never knew
there were so
</P>
<P>
   many Secret Service agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Martin, who said she worked ``several'' hours of
overtime Monday
</P>
<P>
   and Tuesday preparing for the politicians' visit, never got a
glimpse of Gore. Whenever she thought she was in the perfect
picture-taking or hand-shaking position, Gore went the opposite
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of frustrating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cieara Pope and Amanda Downey, two of the more than 1,700 MHS
students who attended the rally in Paul Walker Gymnasium, said they
were impressed by
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a heck of a guy,'' Pope said of Gore. ``He can get some
good stuff for
</P>
<P>
   us.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey added: ``He really cares about us. I hope he gets it (the
presidency).''
</P>
<P>
   The two freshmen said they were most impressed by two of Gore's
presidential
</P>
<P>
   promises: increasing minimum wage by $1 an hour and hiring more
teachers.

   PREDATOR (Phoenix) - The Arizona Game and Fish Commission's
proposal to ban predator hunting contests got shot, skinned, gutted
and thrown out by a state panel Tuesday. There is no chance of
resurrection. The Governor's Regulatory Review Council not only
threw out the proposed ban on contests where hunters compete to see
who can kill the most nuisance creatures in a set amount of time,
it also questioned whether the Game and Fish commissioners had the
legal authority to manage wildlife in the state. By the time the

BUSH SEES AD GLITCH AS `CUTE POLITICS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ A platter of cheese in hand, Karen Hughes rushed to
the back of the campaign plane Tuesday on a mission for her boss,
Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheese, anyone? Cheese?'' she offered, laughing loudly. To a
newcomer baffled to see the senior aide playing flight attendant,
Hughes explained: ``It's a metaphor for the bizarre nature of the
story today.''
</P>
<P>
   The story was about rats _ the word superimposed onto a frame of
a negative television ad about Vice President Al Gore. But the
visit by Hughes, and her overtures to a wary press corps, were
noteworthy themselves, suggesting the campaign is trying to counter
some harsh vibes it has begun to give off.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Bush was the undisputed ``nice-guy'' candidate,
the one blessed with natural affability and charm. Even Al Gore
worried about the Texas friendliness of his opponent, warning in
his convention speech that the election is ``not a popularity
contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the conventions, however, as Gore has pulled
even or ahead in national polls, Bush has appeared to soften his
claim to the popularity prize, through a series of
carefully-planned negative tactics and accidental missteps.
Although some Republicans believe Bush needs to become more
hard-nosed to win, it is unclear whether he can do so and still
capitalize on his personality, arguably his greatest asset.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three weeks, Bush has all but called Gore a liar on
the stump, then approved two personal attack ads to air in a
rotation of 21 states. Last week, he accidentally called a reporter
a vulgar name before an open microphone, then refused to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush came under fire for what appeared to be another
negative move: an ad that ostensibly criticized Gore's prescription
drug plan, but subliminally flashed the word ``rats'' on the
screen. Bush insisted that, too, was a mistake, caused by a
computer editing glitch, but he refused to condemn the designer who
made it, and implied that, while the tactic was reprehensible,
there was nothing really wrong with his own ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``One frame out of 900 hardly in my judgment makes a
conspiracy,'' Bush said. ``I am convinced this is not intentional.
We don't need to play, you know, cute politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would not pull the ad, which has been running for
more than two weeks, because it was due to end its rotation anyway.
Asked whether Alex Castellanos, the designer of the ad, should
continue to produce spots for the campaign, Bush said: ``Yeah, as
far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the ``Rats'' message first broke on the Fox News Channel
weeks ago, but only Tuesday, when it was printed on the front page
of the New York Times, did it become an issue for Bush. Although he
reviewed an e-mailed version of the ad and approved it, the Texas
governor said he was unaware of the presence of the word ``rats''
until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has a policy, developed in
1974, recommending against using subliminal advertising. The agency
has not investigated the Bush ad because it has not received any
complaints, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, several Republicans brushed the contretemps over the
ad aside as a trivial distraction. But others were more critical,
regretting that Bush had failed to convey his message of the day,
catastrophic health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was silly, and you can't make silly mistakes in a
presidential campaign in September. Somebody ought to have the
grace to resign,'' said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who was
Bob Dole's campaign manager in 1996. ``One of Bush's strongest
assets is his upbeat, optimistic message. This silly business
undercuts that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been struggling to find ``momentum'' _ an intangible
force that suggests a combination of good poll numbers, positive
media coverage and successful campaign events _ for at least the
last week and a half. After stumbling over his tax plan in late
August, Bush kicked off the post-Labor Day campaign with an
incident that overshadowed his policies for days: The insult of
Adam Clymer, a New York Times reporter, in front of an open
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   That incident, which was clearly an accident, came on the heels
of two negative personal ads about Gore that Bush approved. The
first, which shows a clip of Gore at a Buddhist temple fundraiser
and mocks his claim to have invented the Internet, was described by
Bush as ``tongue-in-cheek.'' The second, which barely saw the air
but was promoted heavily by the campaign, ridiculed Gore for
agreeing to debate ``anytime, anywhere,'' then declining a
last-minute invitation to appear on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ads received harsh criticism from Republicans, and they
have not had any noticeable impact in the polls, which continue to
show the two candidates in a dead heat. At the same time, a
Time/CNN poll released this week showed more voters believed Bush
was running a negative campaign than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been a good two-week period for them,'' said
Darrell West, a political science professor at Brown University.
``I think people are taking another look at Bush, because you have
this example of outrageous advertising, you have the Adam Clymer
comment, and you have the Bush people pulling one of their attack
ads.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Over the last two weeks, there have been so many
distractions that Bush has been very ineffective at getting his
message out.''

TUFTS PRESIDENT SAYS HE'LL STEP DOWN BY 2002 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After eight years of aggressively raising money to catch up to
the richer endowments of other colleges, Tufts University president
John DiBiaggio said Tuesday he would step down by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As an academic leader, DiBiaggio was very much a businessman. He
sought to shore up Tufts' competitive advantage among top colleges
by securing donations to support the university's strengths: Funds
for buildings and programs in medicine, international relations,
and civic education, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived on the Medford, Mass. campus in 1992, Tufts was
dipping into reserves to meet its budget. The endowment stood at
about $180 million _ relatively small for a school that said it
offered a top education and charged a high tuition.
</P>
<P>
   DiBiaggio _ formerly president of Michigan State University,
where he had battled trustees for authority over the sports program
_ took to fundraising with similar gusto.
</P>
<P>
   The school's endowment has tripled to nearly $600 million,
boosted by the fund-raising campaign that DiBiaggio will wrap up
over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   DiBiaggio said Tufts was still behind other colleges that
courted donors more steadily during the last century. But he said
he was satisfied with the pace of fundraising today, though he said
he wished more alumni gave to the school; the current rate stands
at about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to convince people they should give even a modest, small
amount _ even those are important because they develop a habit of
giving,'' DiBiaggio said Tuesday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Under DiBiaggio, Tufts was regularly rated as one of the top 30
universities in the nation, and he tried to develop niches for the
campus to stand out among that field.
</P>
<P>
   His proudest accomplishment, he said Tuesday, was the creation
this year of a College of Citizenship and Public Learning. The
effort is aimed at adding ``an appreciation of the needs of
people'' across the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students shouldn't graduate with just the ability to compete
for jobs, but with the attributes of good citizenship,'' DiBiaggio
said. ``Every student in every course is reminded of their
responsibility to society.''

<P>
   Knight mask his good side, stirringly
</P>
<P>
   ByI'll put it this way to start: I'd like to like Bob Knight,
the basketball coach. I'd like to see in him a person I could
admire, and a percentage of him I can. There is a good side to him.
Trouble is, he masks it so stirringly.
</P>
<P>
   He won't tolerate the kind of miscreant players that other
coaches will play as long as they can keep them out of jail. He
believes in education and graduation. He is high on principle but
low on tolerance. He has a faction of unwavering supporters, an
army of them on the Indiana campus. Other coaches respect him on
the court, but he gives them grounds to want to shut him up.
</P>
<P>
   A coach I talked with the other day said, ``We were friends for
a long time, but I tell you, he can be a maniac.''
</P>
<P>
   Peculiar that he and Woody Hayes should have happened upon the
same campus. Knight was the ``sixth man'' on Fred Taylor's greatest
Ohio State team, of the Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek vintage,
while Woodrow the Great rode high on the football field. Just as
peculiarly, both careers jolted to a similar halt.
</P>
<P>
   There was a difference in response. Hayes was capable of
remorse. Knight, sadly, isn't, as represented by his performance on
television last evening. Hayes accepted his downfall with grace and
was a welcome figure on campus the rest of his life, maintained an
office there within view of the stadium where he had once been king
of all he surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Knight is not content to go quietly. He will fan the flame again
tonight, when he holds an open house with members of the student
body. They have already given him life with a protest march,
directed at the president, Myles Brand, who may rue the day he ever
accepted the chair.
</P>
<P>
   They resurrected an outdated expression of student disdain
usually reserved for football coaches. They burned in effigy the
freshman enrollee who triggered the whole mess, when he hailed The
General with, ``Hey, what's up, Knight?'' I'm certain it was not a
question to which he expected an answer, nor the reaction that he
got. He must surely find another place for his college education,
and I'm not sure the University of Bangkok would be far enough.
</P>
<P>
   How did it come about that the encounter went public? Why was it
three years later that Neil Reed, the disgruntled former player,
decided to level his blast at Knight? How do films of such an
incident get taken and conveniently go on display? It gives a
smithereen of logic to what Alan Henderson, the Hawks forward,
contends, that ``he was set up.''
</P>
<P>
   I offer no defense for Knight, I, one who once wrote I would not
like one of my sons to play for him. My first contact with him
impressed me, although it was by mail. Several seasons ago, I would
receive an annual letter from this young man who coached at West
Point. It was a polite request for the names of basketball
prospects in the state who might have the stuff to make it at the
Military Academy. I don't know that our agents ever helped him, but
we tried.
</P>
<P>
   Knight wants to coach again, but who would take a chance with
him, unless it's an obscure college willing to take the risk to get
attention? He does little to impress future employers by directing
a mass desertion of players he has recruited at Indiana. On the
other hand, he might take the nucleus of a good team with him, if
the attitude of A.J. Moye is widespread, who said, ``I'd travel the
world a million times to play for him.''

 &HT;    Bobbin show focused south of the border
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The theme song of this year's Bobbin Americas trade
show could be ``South of the Border,'' as American apparel and
footwear manufacturers hurry to set up production operations in the
Caribbean and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   There are two reasons for the rush _ a Caribbean trade
partnership act and pending changes in import barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act becomes effective Oct.
1. This law will enable clothing makers to move production offshore
and slash labor and overhead costs while avoiding import fees on
the returning goods, said Roy Bowen, president of the Georgia
Textile Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   But the real task is preparing for changes in World Trade
Organization import barriers that will occur in January 2005. After
that, cheap-labor countries like China will be able to pour apparel
products into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-based companies have four years to find offshore
manufacturing partners and transform into sophisticated,
computer-savvy contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies need new choices, sources and alliances to permit
them to get the product made and back into the U.S. to sell at the
lowest possible cost,'' said Sergio Cruz, an analyst with Kurt
Salmon Associates. . . . At this show, people will look for
manufacturing relationships as much as for new equipment and
software.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be a big change for little shops in countries such as
Jamaica and Costa Rica. They've been accustomed to receiving cut
pattern pieces from U.S. companies and simply sewing the cuff to
the sleeve. Now, those companies expect their contractors to
provide a complete package of services _ acquire the fabric, cut
and sew it, trim and zip it, label it and ship it.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica already is geared up to do this _ and to reap the
economic rewards _ said export promoters Irene Gago and Max Garcia,
who represent the country's Foreign Trade Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, fruit and coffee were her country's chief exports
to the United States, she said. Now, it's electronic components and
apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we came to the Bobbin show representing six of our
companies (that want U.S. business). This year, we represent 12,''
said Gago.

 &HT;    Falcons considering simplifying defense that ranks last in
league
 &HT;    ``We beat a team that wasn't ready to play.'' - - Brian Griese
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Atlanta and Denver won't play again, barring a Super
Bowl rematch. So the Falcons won't be able to turn the words of the
Broncos' young quarterback against him.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons defense, however, might end up owing Brian Griese a
thank you. The way the Broncos dismantled the Falcons 42-14 will
bring about welcome change.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the Falcons' defense is about to get simpler.
</P>
<P>
   Denver (1-1) gained 407 yards against Atlanta and scored on its
first seven possessions. The Falcons (1-1) are giving up 373 yards
a game, 26th in the league. Injuries to the defensive line and
linebackers have hurt, but the Falcons also have made it worse for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta acquired cornerback Ashley Ambrose in the offseason,
emboldening defensive coordinator Rich Brooks to add blitz
packages, line stunts and coverage changes, because Ambrose and
cornerback Ray Buchanan both would play man coverage. But the
defensive changes appear to be fooling the Falcons more than the
opponents. Ambrose said after the Denver game that everybody on
defense needed to ``get on the same page.'' ``A lot of us are
thinking too much instead of playing,'' free safety Ronnie Bradford
said. ``I think one of the most glaring things is it seems like
we're adjusting a lot to what (offenses) are doing instead of
playing our stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Patrick Kerney is ready for a change: ``You can
say it was only preseason, but when we were going first team
against first team playing mostly straight-up base defenses, I
thought we were whipping guys pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the stunting is opening up holes,'' Kerney said. ``I'd
have no problems going back and simplifying things, just straight
rushes, and playing your gap on the runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks will comply. ``You've got to simplify it,'' he said.
``That means (opposing offensive coordinators) will be able to get
a better bead on you, but at least you don't beat yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe instead of going in (to a game) with three or four
fronts, maybe go in with two. Instead of four or five zone
(blitzes), maybe go in with two _ whatever we can handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves said the temptation to question the team's
talent should be tempered by the rash of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very unfair to judge the defensive line ... when
you have as many things that have happened to it, moving people
around,'' Reeves said. ``I would wait to make an observation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks will wait no longer to get back to basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not making plays anywhere,'' he said. ``Therefore ...
I've got to make sure we play better. The disturbing thing is we've
got mistakes being made by players who haven't made them in the
past when we haven't had as many ... packages.''
</P>
<P>
   So there will be fewer packages, and, it is hoped, fewer
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some good players,'' Bradford said. ``I think ... we
just got to go out and play regardless of ... where they're lining
up. Hopefully, when this thing kicks off Sunday at Carolina, we'll
be able to play full speed.''

STARS ROOKIE LOOKS LIKE A SHOVER AND A FIGHTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
Stars rookie looks like a shover and a fighter 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ For those wondering if the Stars will be tough
enough this season, I have a name for you.
</P>
<P>
   John Erskine.
</P>
<P>
   Six-foot-four. Just a shade under 220 pounds but still a growing
boy. Nasty as a Texas summer. Fists as gnarly and big as pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   One word jumped out of the scouting report provided by a
high-ranking Stars official yesterday at training camp: ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   My kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if he can just make the team.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has raged almost from the moment Shane Churla dropped
his gloves for the last time and was handed a one-way bus ticket
out of town when the Stars actually started becoming good a few
years ago. Does this team need an enforcer?
</P>
<P>
   Those who say ``no'' point righteously to the final results the
past two years, when the Stars have basically gone without one and
made two trips to the Stanley Cup Finals. Try arguing with that.
</P>
<P>
   Those who say ``yes'' _ me, you, and most everybody else who
doesn't mind a little blood on the ice once in a while as long as
it doesn't belong to us _ still remember Anaheim's Ruslan Salei
running Mike Modano headfirst into the boards early last season and
the one Stars player who went after him in a berserk rage.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   That just won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the Stars afford for it to be Derian Hatcher, as ably as
the captain might fill that retaliatory role. They can't afford to
have their best defenseman being hit with game misconducts for
fighting unless he has no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody, however, needs to be able to deliver a message _ and
an effective right cross _ when the opposing team insists on taking
repeated and blatant cheap shots at Modano, or Hull, or Joe
Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at what San Jose is doing, bringing in a few more
retards there, that might be a route we have to go,'' agreed former
defenseman Craig Ludwig, an assistant coach for the Stars' top farm
team, the Utah Grizzlies, this season.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock had hoped Dave Manson would return to
provide that kind of physical presence. Manson could also anchor
the third defensive pair. But scratch that plan. The veteran got a
better offer from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the players who finished the season with us and aren't
with us now were some of our more physical players,'' general
manager Bob Gainey conceded. ``Manson, \RScott\S Thornton, even
\RGuy\S Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our preference would be to have a team toughness, a grain of
toughness running through our team so that we don't load it all on
one or two people to carry the burden.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' general philosophy since Hitchcock became coach has
been that if a player can't contribute on the ice as a player,
there's no place for him on the team. That hasn't changed, but I
sense a slight lessening in the rigidity of that position at this
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has moved back to more physical play, and fighting
sometimes comes as a result of the physical play,'' Hitchcock said.
``We're definitely going to have to have a physical sense to us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he's basically defined the role of his sixth
defenseman as a physical one with hopes that either the 20-year-old
Erskine or 6-5, 225-pound Sami Helenius, obtained from Colorado in
the off-season, can step up and fill it.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock sees a lot of Hatcher in the raw-boned Erskine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some skill that's in line with Derian,'' Hitchcock
said. ``Derian played for us at 19. This guy's 20. He'll play in
eight or nine \Rexhibition\S games, and I suspect that's how many
fights he'll have.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they don't know him in the NHL yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Ontario Hockey League, where he's played the last
couple of years, no one even comes near him anymore,'' Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year in the OHL, I was trying to make a name for
myself, and I just went out there and fought everyone,'' Erskine
said. ``As time went on, I started to play hockey. I fight when I
have to, but I don't go looking for fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, on the surface he sounds perfectly sane. Don't be fooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he snaps,'' one team scout said, ``you don't want to be
around. He destroyed everybody in that league a couple of years
ago. Now, nobody challenges him.''
</P>
<P>
   Goes to show that kids really are getting smarter these days.
</P>
<P>
   Having established his reputation, Erskine proceeded to settle
down and earn OHL defenseman-of-the-year honors last season. Good
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Erskine is going to wind up playing for the Stars and soon. The
only question is whether he'll break camp with them or get more
seasoning under Ludwig with the Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called enforcers have to play now, too,'' Ludwig
pointed out. ``Used to be, you'd pay somebody a couple of hundred
grand a year, and all they did was fight. Now, they've got to be
able to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RThe Stars\S play more of a style that if somebody takes a
run at one our guys, our answer to is capitalize on the power play
and put the puck in the net. But we don't back down from anything
either.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why, when push comes to shove, it's always comforting to
have a guy around who has experience at being the shover, rather
than the shovee. \Ntagtop:Jim Reeves, (817) 390-7760

   WASHINGTON _ I've known Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman for years.
They are smart, capable men who have a pretty good handle on what
makes our economy tick. But judging from their comments in recent
days, I'm a bit bewildered. In his speeches, Gore attacked ``big
oil,'' ``the pharmaceutical companies,'' ``big polluters'' _ in
short, corporate America in general.
</P>
<P>
   He seems quite willing to play the populist card even if it
distorts the record of corporations, fosters antagonism between
company leadership and workers and encourages the very stereotyping
that, on other fronts, the Democratic Party claims to be against.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly business is the enemy. Why, I'm not sure, since the
Clinton-Gore team takes such great pains to boast about the
economic achievements of the past eight years, including the 22
million new jobs generated by the free enterprise system. Consider
the words of Lieberman in his recent book, ``In Praise of Public
Life'': ``We New Democrats believe that the booming economy of the
1990s resulted more from private sector innovation, investment and
hard work than from government action.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman got it right. The men and women who make things in
America, from skilled workers on the factory floor to innovators in
the company lab, have fueled these achievements.
</P>
<P>
   And these workers have been duly rewarded. Today's manufacturing
jobs provide an average yearly compensation of $49,000 per worker,
nearly 17 percent higher than the private sector overall.
</P>
<P>
   But great success of business in creating good jobs seems to be
lost in this campaign. Gore and Lieberman are creating an
atmosphere of division between employers and employees at a time
when workers and their employers are partners as never before. The
newfound angry populism of the Gore-Lieberman ticket distorts the
true picture of the American economy and fosters resentment rather
than cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   As another centrist Democrat, the late Sen. Paul Tsongas, said
in his speech at the 1992 Democratic Convention, ``You cannot
redistribute wealth you never created. You can't be pro-jobs and
anti-business at the same time. You cannot love employment and hate
employers.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Democratic ticket would do well to heed these wise
words.

STOP BEGGING OPEC AND USE STRATEGIC OIL RESERVE

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. _ The cost of oil is rising again, and the
conventional wisdom in the industrialized countries is that prices
can only come down if OPEC increases oil production. President
Clinton, meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah last week in New
York, followed this line, cautioning the prince that high oil
prices threaten the global economy. The finance ministers of
European Union nations echoed his warnings and called on OPEC to
pump more oil.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to these politicians or to spokesmen of the American
oil industry, one might conclude that the entire problem is the
fault of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC
did, indeed, cut production in March 1999, when oil prices were
around $10 a barrel, and in reaction to the reduced supply, prices
more than tripled. But the West is not powerless in the pricing of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, American strategy has been dictated by the
assumption that only OPEC could bring oil prices down. Time and
again Americans are treated to the spectacle of our officials
prostrating themselves before officials from Saudi Arabia, Mexico
and Venezuela to beg for more oil. These officials seem less like
leaders of the free world than like Oliver Twist pleading,
``Please, sir, I want some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this approach to oil diplomacy humiliating, but it
is also completely unnecessary. We can keep prices down on our own.
</P>
<P>
   The world's leading industrialized countries hold more than 1.2
billion barrels of oil in their strategic reserves _ stockpiles
created 25 years ago in reaction to the Arab oil boycott. Nearly
half of this oil is owned by the United States, and Energy
Department officials have outlined a creditable plan to use the
stocks to moderate prices this winter: The government would lend up
to one-third of its crude reserve to refiners before demand reached
seasonal peaks, on the guarantee that the refiners would return the
crude later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington were to do this today, crude prices would be
likely to fall by at least 15 percent and possibly by 20 percent,
which might prevent heating oil prices from rising to $2 a gallon
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, instead of asking refiners to return the same number
of gallons of oil in the spring, the government could require them
to return oil with an equivalent dollar value. Because spring crude
futures can be bought at relatively low prices, refiners would end
up returning more oil than they borrowed, at no monetary loss. This
would mean a larger strategic reserve for the future.
</P>
<P>
   A similar plan to release some of the strategic reserve was
advocated last fall by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Susan
Collins, R-Maine. Yet nothing was done, and consumer heating oil
prices soared above $2 a gallon in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Why does our government choose to beg rather than act? There
seems to be a combination of reasons. One is the predictable
governmental fear of upsetting a status quo, especially one
involving the geopolitically sensitive nations of the Middle East.
Another is an ideological hesitancy to have the government
interfere with the free market (as though the OPEC-dominated oil
trade in any way resembles a free market). Also, we are under
pressure from our allies in Europe and Japan, who seem timid about
upsetting Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The American failure to tap into the reserve is part of a larger
bankruptcy in energy strategy. For example, the government
advocates increased use of clean fuels like natural gas, low-sulfur
diesel fuels and reformulated gasoline. However, it opposes steps
that would actually increase production of these fuels, such as
leasing more offshore land for exploration or loosening
environmental regulations that make it hard for companies to
overhaul their existing refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the government pushes the deregulation of electric
utilities, yet little has been done to break the monopolies that
traditional utilities have over distribution grids. When monopoly
practices cause prices to rise, the government's standard response
is to blame consumers for excessive consumption.
</P>
<P>
   As for tapping into the oil reserve, there is a perfect model
for using government power to bring sanity to the market: the
success of the Federal Reserve in using monetary policy to keep the
economy on an even keel over the last two decades. One hopes that
Clinton and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will realize that they
have the same types of tools used by Alan Greenspan. They only need
to decide to use them.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to go to OPEC on bended knee.

other areas). Remember: Few of the nearly 100 launches to date have
gone off as scheduled (think Hartsfield on a busy, or even slow,

viewing area, you can come back for the next attempt. But if the
mission is delayed after you get to the viewing area, you're out of

 &HT;    After years of separation, romance blooms at reunion of former
neighbors and leads to octogenarian marriage
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR _ On a beautiful late summer afternoon in Decatur, four
couples are seated in the eighth floor hallway of the DeKalb County
Courthouse, staring at eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Wedding bells are ringing in Associate Magistrate Mary W.
Whiteman's office. Here lovers can vow to be faithful forever, in a
civil ceremony performed with dignity _ and in just under five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The couples chat sparingly, some feeding babies, while
associates ready video cameras. Six of the eight are young, nervous
and hopeful. Hann and Huie, Sam and Sherese, Onofre and Maria _ all
take their turns standing before the DeKalb County seal, to repeat
their vows _ ``en enfermedad y en salud,'' say Maria and Onofre _
and retreat shyly to the elevators.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for Leroy Pinkerson and his betrothed, Lillian
Weaver. His hair is immaculately combed; hers is handsomely curled.
Both are adorned with white rose boutonnieres, his in the lapel of
his powder-blue blazer, hers pinned to her silky blue flowered
dress.
</P>
<P>
   He is 85, retired from the frozen food business; she is 80,
retired from the real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an age when you can win a bride on a TV game show and
marriage rates continue to fall, people still believe in the
institution _ and apparently, that it's never too late.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, about 60 couples over the age of 80 marry every year in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second marriage for both Leroy and Lillian. Former
neighbors on the same Druid Hills block, their daughters decades
ago became best friends at Fernbank Elementary School. Later, with
their children grown, they fell out of touch, until death and
divorce made them both single again.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35 years after Leroy and Lillian last spoke, her daughter,
Carol Davis, engineered a meeting. ``It was love at first sight,''
says Pinkerson.
</P>
<P>
   They are here on Tuesday to declare their love before God and
DeKalb County. Judge Whiteman addresses the couple. ``Hold hands,''
she says. Then she notices: They are holding hands already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you, Leroy, take this woman, Lillian, to be your lawfully
wedded wife ...''
</P>
<P>
   The groom jumps the gun. ``I do,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on,'' says the judge. ``You've got to promise more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Promises made, rings exchanged, Leroy and Lillian stroll to the
elevator, en route to a Toco Hill restaurant, where they will enjoy
a modest reception. They will settle in his house in Druid Hills.

   ``He says this is the fourth-biggest event in his life,'' says
Leroy's daughter, Shelley Hamilton, a Covington schoolteacher.
Those events are: ``marriage to my mother, my birth, catching a big
sailfish in Mexico and marriage to Lil.''

<P>
   Questioned about this pantheon of peak moments, Pinkerson
insists that his daughter has the order wrong.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Lillian, he says, definitely ranks ahead of the
sailfish.

TESTS WITH ASTHMA PATIENTS SHOW WAY TO TAILOR-MADE DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In what they call a key demonstration of how genetic information
is opening a new medical era, scientists report they have
discovered personal DNA differences that predict which asthma
patients will benefit from a certain drug before they take it.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first example, said the researchers, of ``personalized
medicine'' made possible by the decoding of the human genome. In
the not too distant future, they said, doctors will be able to
match individual patients to different medications, using their DNA
as guidance, to improve the drugs' effectiveness and eliminate
harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Although such tests aren't yet available, the results reported
in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
indicate that the concept is sound, said Dr. Stephen Liggett,
professor of medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of
Medicine and principal investigator of the study.
</P>
<P>
   In tests on the DNA of 121 asthma patients, the researchers
found four different patterns of DNA in a gene that helps relax
muscles in a person's lungs. Albuterol, a drug that is aimed at
spurring that gene into greater action to treat asthmatic wheezing
worked very well in those with one pattern, not at all in those
with another, and moderately in the other two cases.
</P>
<P>
   Based on this idea, tests for all kinds of diseases and
medications could vastly reduce waste of time and money spent on
drugs that don't help a specific patient, as well as sometimes
produce fatal side effects, they researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``there are no guidelines or explanation why one
individual with the same disease as another doesn't respond the
same way,'' said Liggett in a conference call news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, he said, ``physicians will need to get into their
mindset the notion that genetics will help guide treatment programs
which will result in better health care.'' The new approach signals
the end of a ``one drug fits all'' practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Liggett worked in collaboration with scientists from Genaissance
Pharmaceuticals Inc., in New Haven, Conn., a biotech company whose
aim is to market an array of gene tests for different diseases.
Genaissance says it has already studies 1,500 genes, looking for
telltale DNA patterns that predict how drugs will affect people.
</P>
<P>
   This is known as ``pharmacogenomics,'' and it's considered
perhaps the most likely spinoff of decoding the human genome to
have practical application in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Conway, president of Millennium Predictive Medicine in
Cambridge, Mass., said the report ``validates what we've been
talking about in the last few years'' _ that pharmacogenomics
underlies a new thrust in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacogenomics is made possible by the fact that one person's
genes differ from those of another person in about 1 of every 1,000
letters of the genetic code that makes up our chromosomes. There
are an estimated 2.3 billion letters of the code in our genome, or
set of all genes.
</P>
<P>
   These tiny differences in genetic code are called SNPs, for
single nucleotide polymorphisms. Some SNPs act like typographical
errors, causing abnormalities in the DNA, while others don't seem
to matter. But there's a great rush among companies to find SNPs
that correspond to differences in the way people respond to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Genaissance team had previously found that a human gene that
the asthma drug works on _ called the B2 adrenergic receptor _
contains 13 of these sites where SNPs are present in the genetic
code. The scientists analyzed all the possible differences people
could have and called each person's pattern a haplotype _ a kind of
genetic marker.
</P>
<P>
   In comparing the DNA of the 121 patients, the scientists found
four common haplotypes, or markers, that predicted how people would
respond to the drug albuterol.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to use this information to devise a test that
could identify which of the four patterns, or haplotypes, an asthma
patient carries, which would then predict whether or not it was
worth trying albuterol. If it wasn't, the doctor could then try
another drug.
</P>
<P>
   Genaissance plans to apply this technology to create tests for
individual differences that predict patients' responses to drugs
for heart disease, mental illness such as schizophrenia, high
cholesterol, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Ruano of Genaissance said that as these tests proliferate,
researchers will find diseases in which no individuals respond very
well to the current drugs. That, said Ruano, will provide feedback
that will focus research on devising better drugs.

 COOKWARE: Shopping online for cooking equipment can be
an  adventure  By Lynne Char Bennett 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Next to eating and cooking, most food-lovers enjoy
shopping for items like cookware, tableware and all those must-have
gadgets. Shopping on the Internet is a stress-free way to seek out
the fun, the practical and the unusual.
<P>
   Some cookware sites are slick, with beautiful graphics and
sophisticated search engines. Others are utilitarian and offer a
limited number of items geared to commercial restaurant operations
or the extremely serious home cook. And many sites carry only
specific brands.
</P>
<P>
   We selected five items to shop online _ a 5-quart KitchenAid
stand mixer (325 watts), aluminum half-sheet pan, 8-inch
Wusthof-Trident chef's knife, 8-inch nonstick frying pan and a
large white oval serving platter. We also did comparison shopping
at brick-and-mortar stores. As expected, availability and price
varied but, with the exception of Costco, online shopping prices
were similar to those found at stores, ranging from $493-$615.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dollar Deviations &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Out of three San Francisco stores _ Costco, Macy's and Economy
Restaurant Supply, Economy was the only store that had all five
items. Macy's does not stock large platters until next month, and
Costco only carried the chef's knife as part of a set. The largest
price difference was on the KitchenAid mixer _ $240 at Costco and
$400 at Macy's. Total prices for all items: $492 at Economy, and
$615 at Macy's (substituting a 13-inch platter for a 20- to 21-inch
one). A few weeks later I revisited Costco. Not surprisingly, as
die-hard Costco shoppers might guess, only one item _ the
KitchenAid _ was still available.
</P>
<P>
   The total at  &LR; www.bigtray.com &LR;  was lowest at $497.
</P>
<P>
   And  &LR; www.williams-sonoma.com &LR;  took the top at $614.
</P>
<P>
   We did not escape any sales tax, plus shipping was as high as 11
percent on some orders (Williams-Sonoma) while on others the
shipping would have been free since the order was over $250.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wandering the Web sites &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The best way to find something is to use the site's category
links. However, my hurry-up nature prefers using searches by typing
in an item name whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Navigating through the category links seemed more organized and
intuitive at  &LR; www.cooking.com &LR;  and it had reasonable response
times, as did the searches. You can also opt to get a larger view
of an item. If you are searching for only a specific, brand-name
item, it often makes sense to go to the manufacturer's Web site, as
I initially did for the KitchenAid mixer. You can usually find an
entire line of products, retail pricing and list of dealers or
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   However, to find all five things on one Web site, we chose some
that have a large presence.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the option of  &LR; www.williams-sonoma.com &LR; , which allowed
searching without having the graphics, beautiful though they were.
This feature would help speed up response time on computers with
slower modems and less memory capacity. It also displayed several
items on a page.
</P>
<P>
   Customer service over e-mail was very responsive for most sites.
 &LR; www.bigtray.com &LR; ,  &LR; www.surlatable.com &LR;  and  &LR; www.cooking.com &LR; 
answered my e-mail questions within one day. Tavolo's link to send
a message did not work after two attempts on different days. And as
of press time, we were still waiting to see whether
Williams-Sonoma.com could find us a couscoussiere (see attached
story below).
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, although the toll-free phone calls were quickly
answered, Cooking.com's and Sur La Table's customer service
representatives couldn't answer my questions about Web merchandise,
and shipping and return policy. The staff seemed focused on taking
catalog phone orders and were not familiar with the Internet side
of the business.
</P>
<P>
   The return policies varied between companies, but most have a
30-day ``unconditional guarantee'' return-refund-exchange policy.
However, the effort and cost of returning things via postal service
as opposed to returning an item to a store made the store-related
sites more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Helpful Hints &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites that may be useful to help answer a question or
make buying decisions include: &QL; 
 &LR; www.fantes.com &LR;  specializes in cookware but also provides
information on many of the products it sells, including tips on
equipment selection, use and care. &QL; 
 &LR; www.epinions.com &LR;  does not sell items. Instead, members of this
Web site write product reviews and opinions on all sorts of topics,
including cookware, even down to specific brands such as Le
Creuset.
</P>
<P>
   After all the surfing around, would we necessarily use the
Internet to purchase a mandoline for personal use without having
previously held it in hand and thoroughly inspected it? Doubtful.
Search for an obscure piece of equipment? Definitely yes. Joyously
select an All-Clad saute pan for a friend's wedding gift?
Absolutely _ especially when it could be gift wrapped and shipped
with one extra mouse click.

 &UR; Hunt for a Couscoussiere Becomes a Spelling Lesson &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Lynne Char Bennett &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Couscous, a grain-based staple of North Africa, is
showing up on a lot of menus and can be found on most grocery
shelves. What can't be easily located is the traditional North
African cooking vessel for couscous, called a couscoussiere.
</P>
<P>
   The couscoussiere resembles a double boiler with the upper part
having perforations like a flat-bottomed colander. The couscous is
placed in this upper portion and steamed over simmering stew, broth
or, as a last resort, boiling water. Then comes the fun of
intermittently working the swelling grains by hand to keep them
separated and evenly cooked.
</P>
<P>
   So how would the Internet fare for finding this specialty item?
After all, if we're making a wish list, it might as well be a
complete one.
</P>
<P>
   Google.com came up with 373 hits, few of which were in English.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite sites,  &LR; www.cooking.com &LR;  has a 10-quart
aluminum couscoussiere for $129. A smaller (6 quart) version can be
ordered for $49 at  &LR; www.surlatable.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But beware. An innocent spelling error while searching the Web
sites had me convinced such an animal didn't exist. That is, until
a couscous-savvy co-worker checked my spelling. Even then,
different sources differ on the spelling of this pot.
</P>
<P>
   Is it couscousier? Couscousiere? Couscoussier? or Couscoussiere?
</P>
<P>
   All are correct spellings, depending on which reference you use.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a match on the exact spelling each Web site used was
more challenging than I'd expected. I should have typed in the root
word ``couscous,'' which would have located all the spelling
variations.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted from my spelling lesson and not to be outdone, I used
this assignment as an excuse to go shopping at a very fun San
Francisco foodie store, Cookin', where I found two used
couscoussieres: a 4-quart pot for $48 and an 8-quart version for
$80. But for that kind of money, I'd rather buy a new one from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Does using a couscoussiere improve flavor and texture? I think
I'll try a steamer and pot before clicking that mouse.

 HEALTH: Recommended sites just a starting point  &HT;     By Kim Severson 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; There is no shortage of diet and nutrition sites
on the Internet. You can count calories, join the latest fad diet,
e-mail a personal trainer or order any number of health
supplements. Egg safety, diabetic recipes, organic food sources _
the list goes on.
<P>
   It's enough to make you reach for a cheeseburger.
</P>
<P>
   After wading through several sites, talking with nutritionists
and turning to the sites I use when reporting on food news, I came
up with four I can recommend.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the United States Department of Agriculture site
( &LR; www.usda.gov &LR; ). Although it can be difficult to figure out which
arm of the USDA handles which food issue, the site is a wealth of
reliable nutrition information. It features a searchable database
on food safety and links to other government agencies like the
Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration and
the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. You can read the
latest press releases and scan the list of local and national food
recalls. There's even maintain a section that highlights health-
and food-related hoaxes and rumors.
</P>
<P>
   For a fun, easy-to-use site that links to almost every food and
nutrition site imaginable, check out The Blonz Guide
( &LR; www.blonz.com &LR; ). You can surf to CNN's food-and-health site and
the BBC's home page, sustainable agriculture Web sites and
pediatric journals, Irish health-food magazines and almost every
university food and nutrition department in the country. The site
also links to lots of commercial operations, such as Ben&AMP;Jerry's
ice cream and the American Egg Board. It even translates text into
other languages.
</P>
<P>
   The site is part of More.com, which wants to sell you health and
beauty aids, and is named after Ed Blonz, More.com's director of
nutrition and the man in charge of which link gets on the page. You
can e-mail questions to him and he will post answers. He's a decent
writer and a good nutritionist, relying on a Ph.D. in nutrition
from the University of California at Davis and more than 25 years
of experience in the fields of nutrition, foods and health. He's
also a winner of the James Beard Foundation Award for writing on
diet, nutrition and health.
</P>
<P>
   The health and nutrition site at Yahoo.com ( &LR; www.yahoo.com &LR; ) has
a similarly wide range, with the added bonus of live chats on
issues like what you should eat for a healthy liver. The site also
features newsgroups with ongoing discussions about all sorts of
nutrition issues, as well as tools to help determine the health
factor of many common foods. The search feature is easy to use,
which is always a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, if you want specific nutrition information tailored to
you or your family, check out the Tufts University nutrition
navigator ( &LR; navigator.tufts.edu &LR; ). Experts have ranked various
health and nutrition sites on a scale of 1 to 25 and divided them
into categories for women, children and other groups. For example,
if you have special dietary needs, you can find what the academics

   UKRAINE: PUTIN DEATH PLOT FOILED
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by unidentified foreign intelligence services,
Ukrainian agents foiled a bid to assassinate President Vladimir
Putin of Russia in Yalta last month, the head of Ukraine's security
service said. At the time the security chief, Leonid Derkach, said
four Chechens had been held, along with several Middle East
residents. Russia has long asserted that Chechen rebels are
supported by Middle East militants.

   RUSSIA: THE KURSK'S FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   The minister for atomic energy, Yevgeny Adamov, said it might be
safer to leave the submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea rather than
risk a nuclear accident by raising it. ``From the point of view of
the nuclear reactors, and the nuclear situation, there is no need
to raise the submarine,'' he said. Environmental groups have warned
of the risk of leaking radiation in adjacent fishing grounds. An
aide to Adamov said he was concerned that cutting holes to retrieve
crew remains could further weaken the vessel and make its raising
more dangerous.

   Ireland marked its tenth successive year of population growth,
reaching a total of 3.79 million people in the year to last April,
the highest level since 1881. Immigrants outnumbered people leaving
the country for the fifth year in a row, by 42,300 to 18,200. Irish

the Liberals. The move deflated the Monday night victory of Joe
Clark, the Tory leader, who was elected to Parliament. Stockwell
Day, leader of the Canadian Alliance, was also elected. With 57

 RECIPES: Top four recipe sites come from reliable sources  &HT;       
 By Tara Duggan 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; When evaluating the best recipe Web sites, I
looked for those with recipes from a reputable source, hopefully
pre-tested. I also sought out sites with enough recipes to provide
a broad range, but not necessarily 100,000 different ones, a number
that one site boasts.
<P>
   I avoided sites that were difficult to use or had too many
flashing ads, which I hate almost as much as having to listen to
someone chat on their cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my list of the top four recipe sites, in no particular
order:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ SOAR _ The Searchable Online Archive of Recipes &LR; .
 &LR; soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/ &LR; . This mammoth site _ at last count,
67,784 recipes _ was created by students at the University of
California at Berkeley and has no ads or links to e-commerce sites.
It also doesn't have bells and whistles such as printer-friendly
versions of recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes come from random sources but the broad range,
including 952 for chili alone, makes up for their potentially
dubious origins. Some sophomoric but funny choices like Crudites
with Vomit Vinaigrette (for Halloween) reveal collegiate origins.
</P>
<P>
   The site is celebrated for its variety of ethnic cuisines,
including recipes from Tahiti, Ukraine and Iceland. It's easy to
search for recipes by category, but the site can get overloaded and
slow down if you try to look up specific recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Epicurious.com &LR; . &LR;  www.epicurious.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This site features 11,000 tested recipes from Gourmet and Bon
Appetit magazines, accompanied by ratings from users, photos and
videos. A nice-looking layout makes the site fun to use, even
though you do have to deal with some flashing ads and links to
Williams-Sonoma. There's also a dictionary of culinary terms, and
``boxes'' where you can save your favorite recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ RecipeLand.com &LR; . &LR;  recipes.wenzel.net &LR;  or
 &LR; www.recipeland.com &LR; . Although a commercial site, this one is
similar to SOAR in that it has a pared-down layout and a kind of
populist appeal. The two sites even have some of the same recipes.
Although viewers can't make submissions, the recipes were collected
``from various sites around the world,'' the site states.
</P>
<P>
   There's a disclaimer that some of the recipes have missing
information, and there are an overwhelming 1,000 categories. You
can, however, search quickly by ingredient. And when you get 20,000
recipes for free, who's complaining?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Food Network &LR; .  &LR; www.foodtv.com &LR; . The recipes _ more than
11,000 of them _ on this easy-to-navigate site have been presented
by chefs on the Food Network, so they do come from a reputable
source. Even if you don't want to try the more complicated recipes
at home, they provide fresh ideas and inspiration, and there are
video demos for many of the recipes if the technique sounds too
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   A great part of this site is the ability to search for a wine
match for a specific recipe or style of food, and by price range.
However, the colorful site is littered with some annoying ads and
the home page is overloaded with categories.
</P>

LAWYER IN HOLOCAUST CASES GETS WARNING FROM JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York state judge threatened on Monday to hold a
lawyer involved in the Holocaust-related reparations lawsuits in
criminal contempt for failing to pay court-imposed penalties in a
personal injury case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Albany state Supreme Court Judge Thomas W. Keegan,
said the lawyer, Edward D. Fagan, had ignored his orders to show
that he had paid $12,500 in court-imposed penalties in the case.
Keegan had warned Fagan in May that if he failed to show proof of
payment he risked being held in contempt of court, court papers
show.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan did not respond to a telephone call for comment on
Tuesday. A lawyer who has represented him, Hal R. Lieberman, said
he did not have any comment on the matter. Keegan ordered Fagan to
explain his actions at a hearing scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, who has been one of the principal lawyers involved in
actions against companies and banks charged with profiting from the
Holocaust, was the subject of an article in Friday's New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The article, which chronicled complaints against the lawyer, was
prepared under a joint reporting agreement between The Times and
ABC News. It was also broadcast Friday on the ABC program
``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing of the order by Keegan did not have a connection with
the appearance of the article.
</P>
<P>
   The order involves a lawsuit filed in 1997 by Fagan on behalf of
Christopher Bombardier and his parents against Christian Brothers
Academy of Albany, a parochial school. In the action, Bombardier
contended that while a student at the school in 1993 he was
assaulted by a classmate and severely injured.
</P>
<P>
   The judge imposed $5,000 in sanctions in 1998 against Fagan
after finding that the case filed in his court was identical to one
brought on Bombardier's behalf in another New York State court. In
August 1999, he ordered Fagan to pay an additional $7,500 to the
defendants in the case to reimburse them for legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare, legal experts said, for a lawyer to be held in
criminal contempt. If such a finding is made against Fagan he could
face a fine of $1,000 or 30 days in jail or both.
</P>
<P>
   One legal expert said Fagan might be able to resolve the matter
by paying the court-ordered penalties.

 NEWSGROUPS: The cybercooking community is ready to chat with you   By Kim Severson 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; An interesting slice of the food community can be
found by dipping into the world of newsgroups and listserves.
Newsgroups, and to a lesser degree, listserves, are the places
where communities form on the Internet.
<P>
   Using a newsgroup is basically like reading a bunch of e-mails
about a specific subject and then joining in the debate. With a
newsgroup, you will have to wade through lots of personal
discussions to get to what you want, but there can be some good
nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   When you subscribe to a listserv, you'll get e-mail about a
subject sent directly to your computer. Be careful _ some can
generate so much e-mail that it can be annoying.
</P>
<P>
   By participating in a newsgroup, you'll get a feel for the
cybercooking community, the modern-day recipe swap and coffee
klatch. For example, if you wanted to know why your bread didn't
rise, you could log into a newsgroup, post the question and sit
back and wait for the answer. Or if you're interested in a
particular kind of food, you can find a group of people willing to
chat about it.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial sites sometimes have their own newsgroups, but the
mother of commercial-free newsgroups is Usenet.com, a global,
community bulletin board system that began in 1979. People can log
onto  &LR; www.usenet.com &LR;  and post messages about food-related events
and recipes, or ask the community for cooking help.
</P>
<P>
   Food, of course, isn't the only subject. Usenet is organized
into thousands of separate topic areas that discuss anything from
religion to sports to politics. There are some 20,000 newsgroups,
and fans of Usenet post more than a quarter-million messages a day.
It is a free-wheeling part of the Internet that can be useful and
maddening.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are divided into formal categories. Food science, for
example, is found under  &LR; sci.bio.food-science &LR; . But there are also
unofficial groups, designated with the prefix ``.alt.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does it work? Newsgroup resources are only available if
your Internet service provides access to newsgroups and your
browser is capable of reading them. Some providers give you access
to newsgroups, but many do not subscribe to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in a listserv, consider World Wide Recipes
( &LR; www.wwrecipes.com &LR; ). You can subscribe and receive a recipe a
day. Each morning, a recipe from one of seven categories _
breakfast &AMP; brunch, starters, soups &AMP; salads, entrees, sides,
desserts and extras _ is e-mailed to you. In addition to the
recipe, there's a pen-pal forum, tips forum and recipe request
area.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to get a feel for newsgroups is to search the Usenet
archives using Deja.com or any major search engine. Just be aware
that your food questions will sometimes be answered by real chefs,
sometimes by expert amateurs and sometimes by people who don't have
a clue. Beware, but it can be fun. A few sites to explore:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Deja.com &LR; .  &LR; www.deja.com/usenet &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Get a good, general introduction to newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Star Chefs &LR; .  &LR; www.starchefs.com/boardtopic.html &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is a good example of a commercial newsgroup. Note that all
responses become the property of the Web site, preselected topics
can get a little forced and commercial advertising often can creep
in posing as information.

 TESTING: Internet recipes often have unsuccessful outcomes  &HT;       
 By Lynne Char Bennett  
 and Scott Clapp 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Halibut cheeks _ a surprise find at the Ferry
Plaza Farmers' Market _ led to a trip on the Internet. These
delicate and tender cheeks turn up on local restaurant menus, but
are rarely found at supermarkets. We wanted to see if we could find
good recipes for using them, since none of our cookbooks had any.
<P>
   That search was fruitful _ we dined on wonderful sauteed halibut
cheeks in citrus-brown butter vinaigrette _ but when we tried doing
the same thing for other randomly selected recipes, we were much
less successful.
</P>
<P>
   We chose three common dishes: the ever-popular chocolate chip
cookie, a simple marinara sauce and a stuffed chicken breast.
</P>
<P>
   To begin, we logged onto Google ( &LR; www.google.com &LR; ), which has
the ability to search more than a billion Web sites. We typed in
chocolate chip cookie recipe and got a list of 12,400
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The first one was a recipe written specifically for chemists. It
required adding gluten, NaHCO3 and refined halite to a 2-L jacketed
round reactor vessel with constant agitation. Huh? We skipped it.
</P>
<P>
   Even with basic searches we discovered changing just one letter
made a big difference. Adding an ``s'' to ``cookie'' turned up an
additional 3,500 possibilities. Inserting ``spaghetti'' before
``marinara sauce'' turned up restaurant sites and Web pages with
Italian menus.
</P>
<P>
   We randomly chose three recipes for each of the three dishes.
Out of the nine, only one proved a keeper and one was merely
acceptable. Problems with ingredients, instructions and techniques
doomed the others.
</P>
<P>
   One cookie recipe with ``Mrs. Fields'' in the title _ a definite
lure _ called for water. The sticky, shiny batter resulted in thin
rather flavorless cookies. These were not Mrs. Fields'.
</P>
<P>
   One of the marinara recipes was simmered entirely at moderately
low heat and never shed its canned flavor. All three chicken
recipes were terrible. One said to saute the thick, stuffed breasts
over medium-high heat for four minutes per side. After following
these instructions, the breasts were still raw in the thickest
part. We didn't want to serve partially cooked chicken so we stuck
the breasts in the oven to finish.
</P>
<P>
   With most cookbooks, recipes are tested and edited. But anyone
can write a recipe and post it on the Internet. In fact, a few Web
sites solicit recipes from people visiting their pages. Going to an
Internet site associated with a food-oriented company or a cohesive
archiving system (see Tara Duggan's article elsewhere in this
section) may make recipe selection less random and more consistent
with what you'd find in a cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill of choosing an Internet recipe from thousands and
coming up with a success can be as addicting as spinning a roulette
wheel _ and just as risky. There is more to choosing a recipe from
the Internet than just printing one out and using it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RECIPE ROULETTE
</P>
<P>
   Gambling can be fun, but if you want to increase your odds of
picking a good recipe from the Internet, ask these questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you have the ingredients on hand or are they easily
obtained?
</P>
<P>
   _ What is the quality of the ingredients?
</P>
<P>
   _ If brand name products are specified, are measured amounts or
acceptable substitutions given? A brand-name instant soup packet
was required for one chicken recipe. We couldn't locate the exact
brand and didn't know how much to use of our substitute brand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are instructions and techniques clear and concise?
</P>
<P>
   _ Are you familiar with the basic style or type of dish? If you
are, you can readily make necessary adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is the recipe source mentioned? Even if it is, beware. Anyone
posting recipes on the Internet can make any sort of claim. A
marinara sauce we tested titled ``Marinara Sauce (Food&AMP;Wine,
1990)'' probably had no relationship to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does the recipe make sense?
</P>
<P>
   _ If you find a good recipe you might make again sometime,
bookmark it, save it in your cookbook software program or print it
out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Read over the entire recipe before beginning. Recipes are
often not specific about ingredients or any special equipment
needed until you are midway down the instructions.

DONORS PLEDGE HELP AS AIDS THREATENS TO RAVAGE CARIBBEAN 
</HEADLINE>
  By   DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados _ With the Caribbean facing the highest
rate of infection with the AIDS virus outside of sub-Saharan
Africa, international donors and banks have pledged at least $120
million to support a regional strategy to combat the disease, they
announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which includes a proposal from the World Bank
for $85 to $100 million in loans, came at the end of a conference
on AIDS in the Caribbean, where many speakers emphasized that the
epidemic threatens to undo the social and economic development in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Official estimates place the number of HIV and AIDS cases at
360,000, but many health experts said that the actual number
exceeds 500,000 because of underreporting.
</P>
<P>
   While the average rate of infection of the total population is
about 2 percent _ compared with 8 percent in sub-Saharan Africa _
it has burdened the region's smaller economies. It has also forced
political leaders to acknowledge the need to act, rather than to
stay quiet because of fears of breaking taboos or scaring off the
tourists that are a mainstay of many Caribbean economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have a choice in the matter _ we must act now,''
said Prime Minister Owen Arthur of Barbados. ``The Caribbean has
never lost a generation of its most talented young people because
of war or natural disaster. It is in danger of doing so because of
the pandemic of AIDS. With it, goes the hope, promise and idealism
of the best educated and most creative minds in the history of the
Caribbean people.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread of the disease has been fueled by tourism, migration
between islands, poverty and religious and cultural resistance to
combating the spread of the disease through the use of condoms and
sex education. Haiti and the Dominican Republic account for the
vast majority of cases _ the infection rate is 12 percent in parts
of Haiti. Growing concern about the virus' spread led the Caribbean
Community to form an AIDS task force in 1998 to develop a regional
plan to track and treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   More new cases of HIV infection were diagnosed in the region
between 1995 and 1998 than in all the previous years since the
disease was first identified, and as in Africa, it is spread
largely by heterosexual contact. In the English-speaking Caribbean
it has become the leading cause of death for men and women ages 15
to 44.
</P>
<P>
   Current spending is about 10 percent of the estimated $258
million a year needed for effective regional treatment and
prevention. The United States, which has supported anti-AIDS
programs in several of the worst-hit countries in the Caribbean,
did not pledge to a specific amount because of continuing budget
discussions in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While international aid will help, Arthur underscored the need
for regional efforts to combat the disease. ``There has been stigma
and discrimination,'' he said. ``There has been the usual Caribbean
serendipity that the solution to the problem will be found
elsewhere and applied here.
</P>
<P>
   This week's conference is the latest in a series of recent
events at which AIDS has dominated discussions. In June, during a
meeting of Caribbean finance ministers in Washington, officials
from the World Bank and international health organizations placed
the disease and it threat in sobering context. The cost of
treatment and the loss of life and income, they said, could reduce
gross domestic product in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago alone by
6.4 and 4.2 percent, respectively, by 2005. Some Caribbean nations
responded to the epidemic at its beginning in the early 1980s, with
mixed results. The Bahamas, for instance, established comprehensive
and innovative programs that actually have reduced the rate of
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond money, the challenge facing many of the island nations
comes from societal attitudes that often lead to discrimination,
forcing people with HIV to sink further into obscurity rather than
seek help. Phillip Goddard, Barbados' Minister of Health, said that
good leadership could help transform these attitudes. ``The message
has to be sent by demonstrably macho leaders who speak plainly
about human sexuality and the human condition,'' he said.

 SEARCH TIPS: Pointers to help you surf the Net without wiping out  &HT;       
 By Laura Perkins 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; It can be great fun to surf the Web and float from
one hyperlink to another, exploring unexpected treasures along the
way. But if you are looking for information on a specific topic,
surfing can be downright distracting.
<P>
   The millions of Web sites on the Internet are not cataloged like
a library collection, but there are ways to navigate the World Wide
Web and take some of the guesswork out of searching.
</P>
<P>
   Subject indexes are good starting points for general topics.
These Web sites are similar to library catalogs because they list
Web sites by category. The better subject index sites describe and
evaluate each site they list.
</P>
<P>
   The Librarians' Index to the Internet ( &LR; lii.org &LR; ) is a
user-friendly annotated guide to more than 6,600 Internet sources
that have been selected and evaluated for reliability and quality.
For example, a keyword search for ``wine'' using this guide returns
a list of 19 sites divided into several categories, including the
best all-around sites, directories of wineries and searchable
databases. On the other hand, , a keyword search of ``wine'' using
the search engine Google yields more than 4 million records.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a more specific topic in mind or feel ready to
narrow your focus after you have taken a look at a subject index, a
search engine will help locate relevant Web sites. Each search
engine works differently and has its own database of Web sites, so
similar searches will produce different results depending on which
search engine you use.
</P>
<P>
   You can access some of the best search engines by clicking on
``Best Search Tools'` at the Librarians' Index to the Internet
site. Clicking this link will take you to a list of search engines
and metasearch engines, which are sites that search more than one
search engine at a time. Two of the better search engines:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Google &LR; .  &LR; www.google.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is a personal favorite. Though it does not support advanced
searching, it allows you to search for phrases and it returns the
most-relevant sites near the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   If you search for ``chocolate chip cookie recipe'' and enclose
the phrase in quotation marks, Google returns a list of 1,390
sites, with the most relevant sites at the beginning. If you run
the same search without the quotation marks, Google returns a list
of 12,400 sites.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; AltaVista &LR; .  &LR; www.altavista.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Advanced search techniques are allowed, which means that you can
design the search to retrieve only Web pages that contain all the
words in your search, exclude certain words or allow for spelling
variations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you search for ``+chocolate +chip +cookie
+recipe -cake,'' you will retrieve only Web pages that include each
word that has a plus sign in front of it, and none of the pages
retrieved will have the word cake anywhere because of the minus
sign in front of that word.
</P>
<P>
   To check for spelling variations, truncate a search term with an
asterisk: Plugging in cook will retrieve Web pages dealing with
words that begin with the four letters ``cook,'' including cooks,
cooking and cookies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; GLOSSARY OF TERMS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Boolean Logic: &LR;  There are three logical operators or ways to
combine search terms using Boolean logic. You can use ``or,''
``and'' or ``not'' between terms to refine a search. For example,
if you search for ``restaurant or cafe'' you'll retrieve records
that have either of those terms. If you search for ``chocolate and
chip'' you'll retrieve only records that have both terms. If you
search for ``jalapenos not chipotles'' you'll retrieve records that
mention jalapenos but do not mention chipotles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Browser: &LR;  A browser is a software program that allows you to
access the Internet to view World Wide Web pages. Examples include
Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Domain Name: &LR;  This is a name that identifies one or more
Internet addresses. In the URL  &LR; http://www.sfchronicle.com &LR; , the
domain name is sfchronicle.com. Every domain name has a suffix that
indicates a top-level domain. These include .gov, .com, .org and
.net.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ FAQs &LR; : A FAQ is a document that lists answers to Frequently
Asked Questions and is often a hypertext link on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ HTML: &LR;  Hypertext Markup Language is the standardized computer
language behind Web documents. Hypertext documents contain text,
pictures, music, programs and sound that can be creatively linked
to one another. For example, while reading about different
varieties of tomatoes you might click on a word to see an image or
a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Internet: &LR;  The Internet is a global network connecting
millions of computers. The Internet is decentralized by design;
each computer is independent. According to CyberAtlas, over 144
million people have access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Link: &LR;  A link is the URL embedded in another document, so
that if you click on highlighted text or on a button referring to a
link you will go to that Web site address.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Search Engines: &LR;  Search engines are intermediate databases
that give you access to Web sites, which are not indexed according
to a standard vocabulary like a library catalog. Search engines and
meta-search engines (which search more than one search engine at a
time) allow you to enter names or subjects and then give you a list
of Web sites that might be useful.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ URL: &LR;  The Uniform Resource Locator is the unique global
address of individual documents on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Web site: &LR;  A location on the Internet. Each Web site contains
a home page, which is the first document a user sees when entering
the site. The site might also contain additional documents or files
that can be accessed from the home page.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _www: &LR;  The World Wide Web is a system of Internet servers which
supports documents that are formatted in HTML.

 GROCERS: Minus the formalities, Cyber shopping can be
a  time-saver  By Lesli Neilson 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; My mission: Rate online grocers serving the Bay
Area. The contenders: Webvan.com and Peapod.com _ the only two in
the area that offer full-service grocery delivery online.
<P>
   Although some view grocery shopping as a chore, I find it a
tactilely pleasing adventure. Still, because I consider myself
Web-savvy, I was up for the challenge. The trick was to design a
dinner menu for two and see how the two sites measured up.
</P>
<P>
   After my first shopping session with Peapod, characterized by
endless waiting for the site to respond, I felt like throwing my
computer out the window, grabbing my keys and heading to the
grocery store. But out of fairness, I tried both sites a second
time, ordering the same 16 products. I was much more satisfied with
the experience, probably because I knew my way around the site and
I didn't have to re-enter my credit card and other information.
</P>
<P>
   This was the menu I chose:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Appetizers. &LR;  Assorted olives and skewers of bocconcini
mozzarella, basil leaves and cherry tomatoes and a bottle of white
wine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Entree. &LR;  Grilled salmon, roasted garlic mashed potatoes, corn
on the cob and a baguette.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Dessert. &LR;  Vanilla ice cream with fresh nectarines and
blackberries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pre-Delivery &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I logged onto Webvan.com, selected a delivery time and began
shopping, selecting items and placing them in my virtual basket. I
was interrupted and didn't get back to ordering until the next day.
Webvan had remembered my shopping list, even though I had to
forfeit my confirmed delivery time.
</P>
<P>
   At a second shopping session, it took 20 minutes to select the
same 16 items and delivery time. (Webvan allows you to choose a
half-hour delivery window.)
</P>
<P>
   Although I was impressed with the product images and ease of
navigating the site, getting what I wanted was hit and miss. Webvan
has at least 1,200 grocery-related items, including seafood from
Monterey Market, beef from Niman Ranch and produce from Greenleaf.
The selection of several items was vast (at least on the screen),
like nine kinds of cherry tomatoes, 18 varieties of butter and many
organic products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I had to substitute several items from what I'd
originally wanted _ roasted golden beets for corn on the cob, and
fresh figs, mascarpone and pistachios for nectarines, blackberries
and vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Once I completed my order, I was reminded that I could make any
order changes until 8:30 p.m. the day before my scheduled delivery
time. Webvan requires someone to receive the order if there are any
perishable items. Delivery is free for purchases of $50 or more;
otherwise, it is $4.95. Drivers do not accept tips.
</P>
<P>
   I then ordered the same items on Peapod.com. The site wasn't as
user-friendly as Webvan. I had to use several extra mouse clicks to
complete my order, plus the graphics weren't as good.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Webvan, Peapod offered only one kind of cherry tomato but
had 27 kinds of vanilla ice cream (all of Peapod's products are
from Andronico's).
</P>
<P>
   Fresh corn on the cob wasn't available, so I had to purchase
frozen. But gourmet products such as white truffle butter were
available.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the system for sizing and pricing seemed odd. It was
rather daunting to see a 0.67-ounce package of fresh basil listed
at $80.91 per pound (totaling $3.39). It's also necessary to know
your conversions _ Haagen Dazs ice cream is priced at $6.58 per
quart, but comes in pint-sized packages so it costs $3.29 per
package.
</P>
<P>
   On the first visit to Peapod.com, it took me 11/4 hours to order
16 products. Needless to say, I was a little frazzled. On a second
visit shopping for the same products, I was able to finish in 17
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod's delivery window is two hours, and some slots can fill
up quickly. I could, however, select an unattended delivery time,
even though I had ordered perishables. Order changes can be made
until 4 p.m. the day before scheduled delivery time. Peapod charges
customers $4.95 for orders less than $75. Above that, delivery is
free. Tipping Peapod drivers is optional and they do accept
manufacturer coupons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What's in the Bag &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Webvan delivery arrived within the half-hour window. Fred
unloaded all the products for me from a yellow Webvan tote and
included a free jar of salsa. He also asked to see identification
for the bottle of wine purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cherry tomato ``medley'' I'd chosen looked great on
the screen, what arrived were skimpy, beadlike red cherry tomatoes.
A wimpy portion of olive ``cocktail'' arrived, including
reconstituted raw fava beans. I had ordered a three-seed baguette,
but that was unavailable so I received an anemic-looking plain
baguette. The nectarines were rock hard.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the corn ears arrived in the husk and were
fresh and chilled, the salmon fillet was beautiful and the quality
of all the other products was more than acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The Peapod delivery was scheduled between 7 and 9 a.m. It
arrived at 8:25 a.m. The order was left outside the door _ no one
requested identification. A dispatcher did phone to remind me of
the delivery because there were perishables in the order.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 items arrived in eight plastic Andronico's bags. The four
corn ears were frozen, as I was notified when I ordered that they
would be. Only a couple of leaves in the skimpy, browning portion
of basil were usable. The 3/4-pound portion of salmon, the only
size available, would be enough for only two small entrees. The
nectarines arrived rock hard.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the cherry tomatoes were large, perfectly
ripened and sweet tasting. The ice cream arrived rock hard, and the
assortment of olives was great (albeit $5.09 per half-pound). All
the other products were acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Bottom Line &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a fast Internet connection (DSL or cable
connection), ordering groceries online is frustrating. The biggest
consolation is the ability both Web sites offer to create lists
from past shopping sessions, which lessens the time spent on future
visits.
</P>
<P>
   For my order, Webvan cost about $10 less than Peapod. Similar
items at Safeway cost roughly $5 less than Webvan and $15 less than
Peapod. Safeway's salmon, at $6.99 per pound, was much less that
Peapod's or Webvan's, and a bunch of basil was only $1.39. Cherry
tomatoes were middle of the road at $2.49 a pint, as were bamboo
skewers at 99 cents.
</P>
<P>
   I'd probably use online grocers to order food staples and heavy
products such as laundry detergent and 12-packs of soda _ the
delivery services mean I don't have to carry them on a bus, up the
stairs or unload them. However, if you have young children or it is
difficult to get out of the house, shopping online does offers a
great option.

N.Y. REAL ESTATE MARKET IS TOUGH, EVEN FOR A KINGDOM
</HEADLINE>
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the annals of relations between the West and
Bhutan, a remote Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas, a vote by the
Manhattan Borough Board on Monday may not rank up there with the
opening of that country to tourists in 1974 or the debut of its
first television network last year.
</P>
<P>
   But after a nearly three-year struggle that drew the Manhattan
board and the Clinton administration into a human rights debate,
the isolated country won permission to buy a Manhattan town house
that will serve as the permanent home of its mission to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan, a rugged country of an estimated 660,000 residents that
is bordered by China to the north and India to the south, has
operated its only diplomatic office in the Western Hemisphere out
of rented space on United Nations Plaza since it joined the United
Nations in 1971. But in an effort to expand its presence and
eliminate a skyrocketing rent bill, in 1997 it bid for the right to
buy a five-story town house on 42nd Street, across from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   It paid a deposit on the city-owned property and won approval
from the local community board, but when it came time for the
Manhattan Borough Board to vote on the $2.3 million sale, the
protracted rights debate began.
</P>
<P>
   Led by City Councilman Stanley E. Michels, the board refused to
approve the sale, citing Bhutan's treatment of settlers from Nepal
and India a decade ago. Thousands of them were forced to leave
Bhutan for refugee camps set up in Nepal. The building itself is of
particular significance, Michels said, because its southern
exterior is the so-called Isaiah Wall, where a biblical quotation
urges nations to ``beat their swords into plowshares.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not get involved voluntarily,'' said Michels, who
serves on the borough board with other council members and
officials from Manhattan. ``They asked us to get involved because
we have to approve the sale of the city building. I was not about
to approve of their human conduct, as of two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan, the last surviving Himalayan Buddhist monarchy, has long
been protective of its borders and traditional ways. Serfdom did
not become illegal until 1958, and only a limited network of paved
roads and telephones have turned up in the years since then. The
international news media were not allowed into the country until
1974.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of the small but prominent building, while
motivated in a large part by the potential rent savings, reflects
Bhutan's gradual drive to broaden its connections with the outside
world, said Om Pradhan, the Bhutanese ambassador to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are settled down, if we can have a more established
mission, we will be able to play an ongoing and more meaningful
role in international affairs,'' Pradhan said on Monday. ``The
United Nations is going to be there for a long time, and so are
we.''
</P>
<P>
   The borough board's refusal to approve the sale, first in
September 1998 and again in August 1999, initially drew little
attention. But it gradually drew together unlikely allies in
protest, including the Clinton administration and the U.N.
Development Corp., a nonprofit agency, both of which have argued
that the Manhattan board needed a foreign affairs tutorial of
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Holbrooke, the American representative to the United
Nations, wrote to the city in May, urging it to approve the sale.
He cited a decision by the Bhutanese government in 1999 to grant
pardons to 200 prisoners, including some considered to have been
detained on political charges. Negotiations are also under way to
decide what should happen with the approximately 100,000 refugees
in Nepal camps who seek permission to return to Bhutan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on my observations, and compared to what I have seen in
numerous other countries, I would say that Bhutan is clearly a
country where there is peace and respect for people, in sharp
contrast to other countries that despite their problems, have not
been subject to such problems in New York,'' Holbrooke wrote in his
letter to the city, citing his own visit to Bhutan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Development Corp., which is controlled largely by the
Giuliani administration, prepared to sue Michels and other members
of the City Council who had voted to block the sale. The
corporation cited the Constitution in contending that the borough
board had no right to intervene in international affairs,
particularly given the corporation's belief that the board was
misreading Bhutan's human rights record. The threat of a lawsuit
only intensified the struggle; City Council members said they did
not want to signal that they were caving into threats by the
Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was resolved on Monday by a unanimous vote after a
decision by Michels _ along with C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan
borough president; and other board members who had objected to the
sale _ that Bhutan had made progress toward addressing what they
had called human rights abuses. The sale of the building is
expected to be completed this week.

 Wine Potpourri: Gratification Is Slow in Cyberspace  &HT;        By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Ah, the Internet! Just when I was getting used to
wine warehouses and wine clubs, I'm now faced with the opportunity
(challenge?) of buying wine through cyberspace.
<P>
   This new sales approach, which I'm convinced nobody really
understands, is called e-commerce, a techno-term for buying stuff
by pushing an electronic button and then waiting for it to show up
at the door a few days later. But there's the rub, at least so far
as wine is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The delay between selection and fulfillment is tolerable if
you're buying wine to lay down and drink later. But most people
today buy a bottle of wine on the way home from work, or while
grocery shopping, for dinner that night.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the confusion over pricing and selection that I
found, even on the most thorough e-tail site, that's not likely to
happen in a real-time customer-merchant relationship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sales Climb &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Despite these potential problems, Internet wine sales are
climbing as more people decide they don't have the time to shop at
a wine store. So, I spent some time _ a lot more time than I ever
expected _ looking at wine-sales sites on the Internet, plus a few
others that offer wine information.
</P>
<P>
   Buying wine through cyberspace, inner space, outer space or any
space is not like buying a loaf of bread. There are legal
considerations. In California, you must be 21 years old to purchase
wine. Wine can also be shipped only to certain states (California
is one of them).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Major Sites &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Although there are many small local or regional wine sites, the
following are the major ones. For each site, I sent a question to
its experts to see if I'd get a response, and searched the database
for one of three widely available Chardonnays: 1998 Saintsbury
Carneros Chardonnay, 1999 Rosemount Diamond Chardonnay and 1998
Kendall-Jackson Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Wine.com &LR; .  &LR; www.wine.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is the premier Internet site for ordering wine. It's smart,
sometimes a little cute, staffed with wine-knowledgeable people and
carries an extensive selection of wines from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wine.com ships directly to consumers in states where it is legal
and it works through distributors and retailers in other states. I
liked the wide range of information, wine events and more than
2,000 wine selections. The home page is attractive and inviting,
with no advertisements and plenty of links to other wine-interest
sites. It is easy to read and navigate, and gives you a lot of bang
for the buck, with five price ranges to fit all budgets. The Short
Cuts feature quickly takes you to your wine.
</P>
<P>
   However, when I e-mailed Wine.com a question, I never received a
response. The site did not have the Saintsbury Chardonnay, but
listed Rosemount Diamond Chardonnay for $9.95 (more than both
EVineyard.com (CQ)  &LR; and Drinks.com) and the Kendall-Jackson
Chardonnay for $12.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Drinks.com &LR; .  &LR; www.drinks.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If Wine.com is the best e-commerce site for wines of all
stripes, then Drinks.com is the hands-down top choice for wine,
spirits and beer.
</P>
<P>
   Because it covers all alcoholic beverages, Drinks.com projects
an inventory of more than 14,000 products, including 11,000 wines.
Rather than shipping direct to the customer, Drinks.com works
through established distributors, thus promising delivery in two to
three working days.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the look of the Drinks.com home page. The use of file
tabs (Home Page, Wine, Spirits, Beer) at the top of the page is
convenient and familiar. There are options for Cuisine Complements,
Party Ideas, Drink Recipes, a Drinks Dictionary and commentary by
wine experts such as Anthony Dias Blue and Andrea Immer.
</P>
<P>
   Some e-tail wine buyers wanting to know more about Drinks.com
may find ``About Us'' requires a bit of a search, but the site puts
the products up front and that's what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   Drinks.com never responded to my e-mail question. I had a
difficult time locating Chardonnay through the Super Search and
couldn't price either the Saintsbury or Kendall-Jackson Chardonnay.
I did find the Rosemount Diamond Chardonnay at a very good $7.96.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; WineShopper.com.  &LR; www.wineshopper.com  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Until the merger with Wine.com, WineShopper.com was considered
by wine Web surfers to be Wine.com's major competitor. The site has
an attractive home page, with no advertisements, and all the bells
and whistles it takes to get around a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   I especially liked the Quick Search and Community Favorites
features and the Pro Review, even if I didn't agree with all of the
reviewers' choices. Easy links are available to the Wine Spectator
and WineToday.com for more ratings and wine information. Although
WineShopper.com has plenty of easy links to other wine sites, it
seemed to me that it relies too much on the ratings of associate
sources such as the Wine Spectator. For now, WineShopper.com sends
orders to producers or distributors, which then ship to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A message sent to WineShopper.com brought no response. On the
wine search, I found the Saintsbury Chardonnay at $16.99 and the
Kendall-Jackson Chardonnay at $12.49, but I ran into a curious wall
on the Rosemount wines. Although WineShopper listed five Rosemount
Diamond varietals, the popular Chardonnay was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; EVineyard.com.  &LR; www.evineyard.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Operating out of offices in Portland, Ore., EVineyard.com ships
to 12 reciprocal states, including California. The thing I most
liked about EVineyard.com is the strong commitment to consumer
education and assistance. When I clicked on Our Cellar, about 200
wines came up to consider, which appears to be less than the other
sites. But EVineyard.com has a lot of other things to like. It's
easy to locate the wine of your choice, plus there is a Teach Me
feature that answers questions about wine in real time. There's
also assistance like Help Me Pick and Wines by Chance, a random
selection of 20 wines, many at special prices.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the sites, EVineyard was the only one to respond to my
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   While EVineyard.com did list the Rosemount Diamond Chardonnay at
$9.19, I found some confusion with the Saintsbury and
Kendall-Jackson wines. Saintsbury 1998 Chardonnay is available only
in the 375 ml bottle, for $9.79, while EVineyard.com lists the
Kendall-Jackson 1998 Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay at $6.99 and
$7.99 and the 750 ml bottle at $11.99. More attention to detail
would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Two Companies Merge Instead of Making War &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
In the business world, one way to overcome competition is to
eliminate it. Some dot-com observers say that is what happened when
the wine e-commerce leader, Wine.com, recently merged with its
online competitor, WineShopper.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two competing sites slugging it out for sales,
it creates problems for the sites as well as the wine consumer,''
said Peter Granoff, proprietor of Wine.com.
</P>
<P>
   Granoff said the new company, which will be called Wine.com, is
working out the transition. WineShopper.com will continue as an
e-commerce site through the end of the year, he said, ``Then the
site will disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine.com and WineShopper.com handle online wine sales using
slightly different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Granoff said ``every single sale (through Wine.com) touches
every tier of the system,'' referring to the traditional three-tier
system of distributor/wholesaler, retailer and consumer.
</P>
<P>
   WineShopper.com is often described as an intermediary that
passes wine-sales orders on to producers or distributors, who in
turn ship the wine to the retailer or directly to the consumer. The
method used depends on state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Gannon, director of public relations and corporate
communications for WineShopper.com, said a lot of things have to be
worked out. ``Basically the deal will not be closed for several
more weeks,'' she said. ``Until the end of the year, both sites
will continue to operate independently.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the new company is working toward launching a
site sometime in the first quarter of 2001 and that it will use
WineShop- &QL; 
per.com's network of distributors and retailers in all 50 states;
Wine.com does not have shipping arrangements in all states.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon disputed speculation in the industry that the merger was
forced by either venture capitalists looking to increase the bottom
line or one competitor seeking to eliminate the other.
</P>
<P>
   She said the merger is simply two companies joining forces to
create a bigger and better company. ``The merger will represent an
enhanced opportunity for the consumer,'' she said. ``It will double
the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Busman, director of public relations for Drinks.com,
another Internet wine e-tailer, said her company sees things
differently. ``It seems as though this teaming is more about
consolidation to survive rather than a merger of equals to become
the category leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Busman said that, along with all of the expenses the new company
will incur during the merger, ``their new business model will need
to incorporate the three-tier system.''
</P>
<P>
   Busman said Drinks.com has built its business on the traditional
structure that has been in place since Prohibition. ``Other online
counterparts have focused on the possibility of direct shipping (to
the consumer) or reciprocity agreements to succeed and are now
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   She said no online business can hope for a long-term future with
that vision.
</P>

 Dining Out: The Surfing's Dangerous in Review Land  &HT;       
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; When Jon Wilson wants to find a restaurant, he
doesn't go to the phone book or newspaper. He relies on the
Internet.
<P>
   The 23-year-old information specialist types in the name of a
restaurant and the city in a search engine then clicks on whatever
site it brings him. But how reliable is the information he finds?
</P>
<P>
   Let's say he wanted to find out about Backflip, the trendy
restaurant adjacent to the Phoenix Hotel in the Tenderloin. If he
typed in Backflip in San Francisco on Google, his favorite search
engine, he'd get 17,400 sites. But in the first 10 that come up,
there are two that look the most like what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   First is Citysearch, which shows a photo and gives a brief and
mostly accurate description of the restaurant/nightclub. It also
has a hyperlink to Backflip's Web site. That's good.
</P>
<P>
   The second site is Metroactive, which would tell him that the
restaurant serves dim sum-style cuisine. That's bad _ Backflip
hasn't served that style cuisine since it first opened almost three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Diners relying on the Internet for restaurant reviews,
descriptions or online reservations are in for a mixed bag of
results. Not all of the information on Metroactive.com is outdated,
for example. In fact, the site has a longer list of Silicon Valley
restaurants than just about anyone else. But the reviews are
reposted from other publications, not written for the site itself,
and some of them are more than 3 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Food.com, another popular site, boasts of having 18 restaurant
critics around the country on staff. However, those critics work
for other publications and generally repackage their reviews for
Food.com. The site doesn't pay for them to revisit a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem at Food.com is that the listings are some
of the most inaccurate and outdated we've seen. Elephant Bleu, a
Vietnamese restaurant in the Mission, is categorized as an Italian,
Chinese, barbecue, American/casual and seafood restaurant. On the
Peninsula, 231 Ellsworth, which has been closed for over a year,
and Gibson, which has been closed for two, still come up in
searches.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list of our favorite general restaurant Web sites, not
including any from individual restaurants:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Citysearch &LR; .  &LR; www.citysearch.com &LR;  is one of the most
comprehensive sites of restaurants _ and more _ in the Bay Area.
Surfers can search by cuisine or neighborhood, and can find lists
of late-night eats, romantic dining and places that are good for
groups. The site also features brief synopses of new restaurants as
well as restaurant gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The review policy of the site is clear: Citysearch pays for
reviewers to visit the restaurant multiple times before a review is
written. Citysearch is also tied into Zagat.com, but it's
convoluted getting the information from that site. It's better to
just go to Zagat.com directly.
</P>
<P>
   Citysearch also has a relationship with Foodline.com for online
reservations. Unfortunately, Foodline doesn't have many Bay Area
restaurants in its stable.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the information is accurate, though occasionally we ran
across a chef who was no longer at a certain restaurant, such as
Ken Rosselot, who is no longer at Backflip.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; SFGate &LR; .  &LR; www.sfgate.com/food. &LR;  This site, currently composed
of information from The Chronicle, the San Francisco Examiner and
KRON-TV, requires you to go to the food page to see the latest
restaurant reviews or search for a restaurant. But once you're
there, it's pretty easy. Surfers can search by cuisine or
neighborhood, or look at presorted lists of late-night dining,
four-star dining or cheap eats.
</P>
<P>
   However, searches can be frustrating. Any restaurant with an
apostrophe in the name seems to wreak havoc on the results. (The
trick is to leave the apostrophe off.)
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Zagat.com &LR; .  &LR; www.zagat.com &LR; . If you're more interested in
diners' comments rather than professional reviews, Zagat.com is the
site for you. This site is an online version of the paperback
guides that many people swear by when it comes to finding a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Zagat.com can also handle online reservations. Once the surfer
finds a restaurant he likes, he can make reservations through
OpenTable or Foodline. The caveat? Only restaurants currently using
one of those online reservation systems can be used.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit is the ability to search. If you're browsing and
find a restaurant you like, you can search for restaurants that are
similar, either in food, decor or for things as specific as
fireplaces and views.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; OpenTable &LR; .  &LR; www.opentable.com &LR; . For online reservations in
the Bay Area, OpenTable is the current leader. Foodline is trying
to make inroads, but OpenTable has the most restaurants on board.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is easy: Customers can either decide where they want
to eat, then see what reservations the restaurant has available, or
they can choose a date and time and see what restaurants have
reservations available at the requested time. Searches usually take
only a few seconds, and reservations can be confirmed online.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that customers are restricted to those
restaurants that are signed up with OpenTable. That's limiting,
especially on the Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; The Low-Down on Take-Out Food &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Take-out food hasn't been left out of the Internet food
explosion, but options are limited. In fact, there's only one site
we liked.
</P>
<P>
   Waiters on Wheels, the popular company that delivers meals from
restaurants to customer's homes, can be accessed through
 &LR; www.waitersonwheels.com &LR; . The site is easy to navigate and offers
food from a number of restaurants, although the vast majority are
neighborhood pizza, pasta and Chinese places.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few negatives. First, you can't search, and have to
scroll through lists of restaurants. Second, you can only order
food when the restaurant is open. And finally, while the restaurant
has a decent selection of San Francisco and Peninsula/South Bay
restaurants, there is no service in the East Bay or Marin.

Friendship gives Poe shot at taekwondo gold
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID BARRON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kay Poe and Esther Kim were nose to nose, lost in their own
world, which was nothing unusual.
</P>
<P>
   And they were crying, which was.
</P>
<P>
   It was the afternoon of May 20, and Poe and Kim were huddled
next to the bleachers in an out-of-the way corner of the Olympic
Training Center gymnasium in Colorado Springs, Colo. They were
minutes away from their match that would decide the U.S. Olympic
team berth in the women's taekwondo flyweight division.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't hard to imagine the problem faced by these two
distraught young women. Best friends since childhood, they clearly
were upset at the prospect of having to kick and punch each other's
Olympic dream into submission. They talked, then cried some more,
then hugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' said a bystander. ``They really don't want to
fight each other.''
</P>
<P>
   That had to be it. That much was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Then Poe and Kim turned to walk toward the competition floor and
suddenly things weren't so clear after all.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you know the story that emerged from the confusion of
May 20. Poe had suffered a dislocated kneecap in a preliminary
match and couldn't walk without leaning on Kim for support. Rather
than fight her injured friend, Kim elected to forfeit, assuring
that Poe, the No. 1-ranked competitor in the world in her weight
class, would advance to the Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting furor was considerable. Poe and Kim became
standard fodder for most big magazines and every major network. Kim
and her father, Jin Won Kim, who coaches both women, were offered
an expenses-paid trip to Sydney by Juan Antonio Samaranch,
president of the International Olympic Committee. Esther Kim threw
out the first pitch at an Astros game and visited Washington, D.C.,
to receive a national sportsmanship award.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, along with assorted television tapings, they have
been together in Korea, for a tour by the U.S. Olympic team, and in
Colorado Springs, where Kim won a berth on the U.S. team for the
Pan American championships while Poe cheered from the sidelines,
and in San Antonio, site of the U.S. Taekwondo Union's Junior
Olympics, and back in Colorado Springs, where Poe spent several
weeks training with Kim and members of the national team.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Olympics drew near, Poe was alone. Kim and her father
left in early August for another training trip to Korea. And as she
trained, the very act that gave Kay Poe her ticket to the Olympics
was the very thing that stood in her way.
</P>
<P>
   The grim resolve, the virtual imperviousness to pain and the
focused vision that have made a Poe a favorite to win the gold
medal in Sydney represent a stark contrast to the childlike
qualities that got her into the sport at age 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Umm, I was kind of a mischievous child,'' she said, almost
apologetically. ``My parents wanted something for me to do. I tried
other sports, but I always got bored.''
</P>
<P>
   So what sort of things would a bored 7-year-old do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just things I wasn't supposed to do,'' she said. ``I'd go
outside and do things and get into things, and my parents would be
upset. Nothing big. I didn't rob houses at 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob, no. Paint, yes. Poe's father, Ken, who works with wife
Linda for a Houston insurance agency, is the unofficial historian
of his daughter's mischievous period. It is a role he fills with
relish. He doesn't quite have Dennis Miller's sense of comic
timing, but he's working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of the white brick house and the Krylon
spray-paint can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kay was maybe 5, 6 years old and just learning to read,'' Ken
Poe said. ``I came home one afternoon and found that someone had
taken Krylon spray paint and sprayed it across the back of my white
brick house.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I asked the girls to come outside. The oldest one (Kerri,
who is four years older than Kay) said, `I don't know anything
about it.' So I said, `Kay, do you know anything about this?' And
she says, `Yep.' And I said, `Kay, did you do this?' And she said,
`Yep.' I said, `Kay, ' and she blurts out, `It's not my fault.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I say, `Kay, please explain to Daddy why it's not your
fault.' And Daddy's ears are turning red and his blood pressure is
going up. And she grabs the Krylon spray and points to where it
says `clear' (as in ``shake can to clear nozzle``) and says, `Look,
it says right here that it's clear.' So I said, `Kay, just go into
the house and let Daddy stand outside for a few minutes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We had those kinds of experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 911 call,'' said Linda Poe. ``That was a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time that Kay had an argument with the family
housekeeper. She was too young to read, but she managed to riffle
through the Yellow Pages, used pictures to find the listings for
maid services and tried to hire a new maid.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the trip to Chicago. When radio problems
delayed the airplane's departure, Poe allowed his fidgeting
daughter to leave her seat to use the rest room. Ten or so minutes
went by. Kay didn't return to her seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Kay has gone into the doggone terminal,'' Ken Poe
said. ``So I go into the terminal, frantically looking for the
child. I send a lady into the women's rest room to find her. No
Kay. They make the announcement that the plane is about to leave. I
go back and tell the stewardess that I have to stay because I can't
find Kay.
</P>
<P>
   And then I see the door cracked to the cockpit. That's what she
did. She went to the bathroom, saw the door open, waltzed into the
cockpit and just started talking to the pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Poe, of course, has explanations for everything. She was
just being friendly. The housekeeper was working too hard. Cartoon
shows encouraged kids to become familiar with 911. The paint can
said ``clear,'' and, besides, she was spray painting nice things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to write `I love God,''' she said. ``But I had trouble
with my d's and b's. So it came out `I love Gob.'''
</P>
<P>
   However his name is spelled, the Poes could have used some help
from the Almighty in dealing with their younger daughter. They
tried gymnastics. They tried dance. ``They didn't dance like she
did,'' Ken Poe said. They tried softball. And then, when Kay was 7,
they tried the Korean martial art of taekwondo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have imagined,'' Ken Poe said, ``that a contact
sport would be something that would hit her hot button. There
aren't too many contact sports that a woman can get involved in
that are considered respectable. And she was so little.''
</P>
<P>
   She still is. At age 18, Poe stands only 5-1 and weighs 101
pounds. But she can break boards and bricks with her hands, and she
can cave in a grown man's side with one swift kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Poes enrolled Kay in a taekwondo school on Houston's
northwest side owned by Master Jin Won Kim, a Korean-born American
citizen who opened his first Houston school in 1978. She quickly
fell under the spell of Simona Hradil, an older student who would
go on to win 11 gold medals in national and international
competition. And she quickly became friends with Kim's daughter,
Esther, who is two years older.
</P>
<P>
   At one particular Halloween party, Esther came dressed as a
pirate and was assigned by her father to keep watch over Kay, who
was dressed in a black ninja outfit. The two grabbed hands and, in
some ways, they've never let go.
</P>
<P>
   Just as easily as they seem to invite stereotypes, Esther Kim
and Kay Poe take equal delight in smashing them and then, on
occasion, building them back up.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Olympic committee workers were circulating her smiling
mug shot with the girlish flip hairstyle, Poe showed up in San
Antonio this summer, a few weeks after the Olympic team trials,
with a closely cropped, spiked haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Things had gotten boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when I was little. You see what happens when I get
bored,'' she said. ``I went with a friend who was getting his hair
done, and I was flipping through a book and wondering if this would
look good on me. I asked the hairdresser, and she said I had the
face for it. So I cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks good,'' Kim said. ``You don't even have the baby
bangs anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the messy look, but I never had the guts to do it,''
Poe replied. ``It was blonde in January and February, then red, and
now it's going back to brown. Nothing extreme. I just want it to
look natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as they can behave for the camera, Poe and Kim can be
boisterous when the lights are off. When Poe expressed some
confusion about their upcoming schedule, Kim shook her head and
said, ``When they cut off her hair, they must have cut off her
brain, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a little chat between friends
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of it is inside stuff,'' Kim said, ``things only we can
know and joke about. In a way, we're in our own little bubble. If
we let people in, they wouldn't understand the way we can
understand each other. We don't have to say things. We know what
the other is thinking. We can make conversation with eye contact.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to paint either or both as stereotypes, and
several have tried. A week after the Olympic trials, University of
Minnesota sports psychologist Mary Jo Kane hypothesized to the New
York Times that the Poe-Kim encounter could indicate that women
were not as competitive as men and reinforced stereotypes that
women don't care as much about winning as men do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She needs to go back and take some more classes,'' Kim said,
scowling. ``She put a big shame on women. This isn't about gender.
It's about being an athlete. She put shame on women, and she should
be ashamed of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wanted to comment on something, she should know what
she's talking about. She had no knowledge of what taekwondo is. She
should read some books, takes some notes and find out what she's
talking about before she says anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of taekwondo, as a sport or as a martial art, has
been something of a player in the ongoing story of Poe and Kim.
</P>
<P>
   The young women were not above laughing raucously after one
conference call at the earnest question from a reporter for a
taekwondo magazine. The woman asked Kim which tenet of taekwondo
(courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control or indomitable
spirit) was on her mind when she forfeited the match to Poe.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, in her own way, Poe talks about the
importance of each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of life to me,'' she said. ``It teaches about
morals, how you should act, respect and discipline. It always
challenged me. It challenged my physical ability. I didn't know
anything about the sport when I was little. It was just challenging
physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get older, people can get bored with something that
challenges just one part of them. But as I started to grow, it
challenged me mentally, too. And now, I find it in my heart and
soul to do it. There are so many things about it that I love.''
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years at Jin Kim's studio, Kay announced to
her father that she wanted to be like her friend Simona, the future
national champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Kay, if that's what you have on your mind, you need
to tell Master Kim,''' Ken Poe said. `Now, at the time, talking to
Master Kim was like talking to God. But I took her to the school
and said, `There's the man's office. There he is.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So she timidly goes in there and he says, `What do you want?'
She tells him, and he said, `OK, I can't promise you anything. But
if you'll be a good student, I'll be a good teacher.'''
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, at age 13, she was a national champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always a competitor,'' said Jin Kim. ``It's the speed.
She goes at 100 miles an hour, and nobody can stop that. She gives
everything. That is what I do with my students. I tell them the
more time you put in, the better you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming a great taekwondo practitioner is like any sport. If
you want to be a good swimmer, go play in the water. If you want to
be good at taekwondo, come to school more often. I don't believe in
other methods. People ride bikes to strengthen their legs. I say if
you want stronger legs, come to school. I don't do any fancy
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The old ways seemed to work for Jin Kim's new student. She won a
silver medal at the Pan American championships in 1996, the first
year since 1984 that taekwondo had not made the Olympic Games as a
demonstration sport. She won international events in Denmark and
Mexico in 1997, taking bronze at the world championships. And in
1999, she began a backbreaking schedule of competition that
established her as the Olympic favorite for 2000, the first year
that taekwondo would be a full medal sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was an athlete in the world who took on
the schedule that child did (in 1999), and I thought she was
nuts,'' Ken Poe said. ``She fought at the Pan Am championships in
December 1998 in Peru, February at the U.S. Open, March at the Pan
Am Games trials, the national championships in April, the national
team trials in May, the worlds in June, the world Olympic
qualifying event in July, and in August she went to Korea to train.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this little bitty ordinary kid. The only thing she may
have done differently from any other kid is that she had the
courage to set her goals pretty high and the good sense to tell
other people about it. And then she just went out there and did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She had come a long way from the little girl in the ninja
costume. But with one blow to the knee May 20 in a preliminary
match against Mandy Meloon of Sugar Land, she almost lost it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell it was a nasty bruise,'' Ken Poe said. ``But
after the match, when she's walking to the holding area, I can see
it might be a little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kay has a huge tolerance for pain, and this is the second time
I've seen it. She probably was about 9 when she broke her arm. She
came home from practice and, typical knothead Kay Poe, she runs off
to play with her friends and trips and breaks both the radius and
ulna in the arm. There wasn't a tear until they had to cut off her
taekwondo uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ken Poe joined Esther Kim and his daughter in the
basement of the Olympic Training Center gym, Kay's left knee was
swollen with blood and fluid. Esther asked Ken Poe to find her
father. ``That's when I thought there was a good chance that Kay
wouldn't be able to return to fight,'' Ken Poe said.
</P>
<P>
   The final conversation that led to Esther Kim's withdrawal came
after the women had the holding area to themselves. It was not a
gentle discourse between two old friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still arguing about it,'' Ken Poe said.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Kim, however, prevailed. She and her father helped Kay to
her feet, and the two friends made it back upstairs for one last
conversation near the gymnasium bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you want to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I told you. We can't turn back now. I know this is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   And then they hugged, and then they turned, and then they walked
toward the mat, toward the judges, toward the cameras, toward the
moment that Bud Greenspan, the filmmaker who has chronicled the
Olympic movement for more than 40 years, describes as the very
essence of sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic oath says that we will take part for the honor of
our team and the glory of sport,'' Greenspan said. ``That
expression about the glory of sport seems to be an outmoded one at
times. But what those two kids did brought it back to life.''
</P>
<P>
   One task remains in Sydney. But even though Kay Poe will have
made it to the ring with the help of her parents, her coach and her
best friend, she steps into the ring alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal answer would be yes, I want to go to Australia and
win it for Esther,'' she said. ``But to be honest, right now it's
back to being all about me. Every time I think about what happened
in Colorado Springs, I think about the stadium filled with people,
but it was her and me alone. There are so many emotions, I can't
express them. It was too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now, I have to focus on fighting. If I have any doubts or
any other thoughts, it affects me. Even when I talk about what
happened at trials, it has to be in the third person kind of view.
I can't keep reliving the moment. If I keep doing it, I'll start to
doubt myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when this is over I'll be able to reflect on it
better.''

Juarez hasn't forgotten where he comes from
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID BARRON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Rocky Juarez, as befitting a world champion boxer who
was named after Rocky Marciano, is a student of the fight game.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of 140 amateur fights with only 16 losses, Juarez sits
into the night in front of his family's big-screen television,
playing tapes of his fights over and over again until he can recite
the exact series of punches before they unfold.
</P>
<P>
   He studies other fighters as well. He knows all the stories
about Oscar De La Hoya and George Foreman and Ray Leonard, and that
their Olympic gold medals laid the foundation not only for a
professional career but financial success as well.
</P>
<P>
   And he knows what is on the line as he prepares to leave for the
Olympics as the defending world champion in the featherweight
division, the favorite to bring home a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always thinking ahead,'' he said. ``But at the same time,
I know I have to take it day by day. So the first thing in mind is
the Olympics, concentrating on the Olympics. I can't predict what
will happen. I can only hope that I win that gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way. Anybody who wins a gold medal
skyrockets in the pros. The promoters want you. It's a business.''
</P>
<P>
   The businessman, however, also is the baby of the family _ the
youngest of Pedro and Emelinda Juarez's six children. And while he
dreams of medals and championships, his goals for life outside the
ring extend no further than the street where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky (or Rocky, the names are used interchangeably by friends
and family) had little choice but to become a boxer. There was the
name, of course. Actually, his father wanted to name his youngest
child Rocky Marciano Juarez before he compromised on Ricardo Rocky
Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Juarez, 88, grew up in Mexico in the years before World
War II as a fight fan _ and, for one bout in the 1940s, a fighter
in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped the other guy in the first round,'' said the
younger Pedro Juarez, translating from Spanish for his father.
``But when he went to be paid, the promoter said there wasn't
enough action and paid him only 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said they cut off his two arms, humiliated him, by treating
him that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Juarez left Mexico in November 1944, moving to Houston
to work as a carpenter, a trade he passed on to his son. He also
passed on the love of boxing to the younger Pedro, his only son
among seven children, staying up with him on Friday nights at the
family home in the Silverdale neighborhood just north of downtown
Houston, watching the Gillette Cavalcade of Sports on television
and taking him to fight cards across the city.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Juarez never followed his father into the ring. But when
Ricardo came along in April 1980, his grandfather was ready to
spread the word to a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would stick out his hands and say, `Throw punches,
throw punches,' but none of the other kids would listen, just
him,'' Pedro Juarez said. ``He would start throwing punches at my
father's hand, and almost from the beginning he would use his left
hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always like the way he threw the hook. He threw it real
nice. And one day I said, `Son, you have to throw that left hook
more often. It looks like a gift that God gave you.'''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a gift for baseball, as well as something of a flair
for the dramatic. A pitcher for his neighborhood Little League team
at Lindale Park, he led his team to a local championship and was
nicknamed ``Babe'' for his habit of calling his shots at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   When Juarez turned 13, it was apparent he wouldn't be big enough
to consider a career in baseball. So Pedro took his son to Ray
Ontiveros, proprietor of Ray's Boxing Gym on Freeman Street, a
couple of blocks west of North Main.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw in the gym how he was throwing punches, and people
who were there asked me how long he had been boxing,'' Pedro Juarez
said. ``I said he just started today, and nobody believed me. The
way he threw punches, they thought Ricky had been fighting for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he had been working there for two or three days, he
wanted to go into the ring. So Ray put him in to spar with a
friend, and Ricky caught him with an uppercut and made him cry.
That's when Ray came to me and said he wanted to enter Ricky in a
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Juarez likes the symmetry of having taken up the game at 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali started at 13,'' he said. ``It's a good age because it
gives a kid a chance to decide what they want to do. If you start
him too early, they don't know what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The first six months in the ring weren't easy. Juarez had to get
used to getting beaten up every day by the same sparring partner,
Juan Campion, who later went on to the professional ranks. But from
the beginning, Juarez knew this was what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just a feeling about it,'' he said. ``When you step
into the ring with the guy in front of you, it's just him and you,
and there's no better feeling than to come out victorious. After I
won the first one, I said, `This is a good feeling. I want to do it
again. I want to win again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Juarez won his first fight at Chapas Boxing Gym in Houston, then
traveled to Fort Stockton to compete for a state championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a camera to tape his first fight, and Ricky beat him
in the first round just by using body shots,'' Pedro Juarez said.
``That's when I knew the kid had something. He was a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the tape recording of the first fight didn't
survive. Pedro Juarez was so nervous that he hit the rewind button
and accidentally erased the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez won a state Junior Olympics title in 1994, his second
year in the ring, and was national Junior Olympic champion in 1996.
He finished third in the 1997 national championships, won the Ali
Cup Invitational and made the world championship team, losing to
the eventual champion at 119 pounds, Cruni Otteanu of Romania.
</P>
<P>
   But that first trip to worlds, in Budapest, Hungary, and a 1997
dual meet against the Russian team at the George R. Brown
Convention Center where Juarez lost 16-6 convinced Ontiveros that
Juarez would have to change his strategy to succeed on an
international level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. boxers have beautiful legs and movement but no upper
body strength,'' Ontiveros said. ``The Russians and Cubans, that's
all they have is upper body strength. They use it to push people
around, and they're good at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when we came back, we decided in December (1997) that for
the next two years that we were going to work on upper body
strength, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros' last Olympic boxer, Raul Marquez in 1992, also
learned the hard way about the often strange ways of amateur
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the computer scoring system, to be honest with
you,'' Marquez said. ``It favors the European countries because
they fight straight up and don't throw body shots. In the Olympics,
you've got to throw straight shots that are accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in my first Olympic bout, I fought a 6-foot-4
Nigerian. Well, what are you gonna do with a tall guy? You hit him
in the body. But none of those shots counted (with the judges). I
won 7-6.''
</P>
<P>
   While Juarez adjusted to the demands of the amateur scoring
system, he didn't lose the characteristics that could make him a
successful pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. fighters are more technicians. They fight better, they're
smoother, faster. That's our style,'' he said. ``Foreign boxers are
more straight up, stronger, not too much head movement. Not a lot
of them make it the pros because of the way they fight, straight
up. But a couple have been world champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked on my upper body, but I still punch to the body a
lot. The coaches say judges don't count body shots, but I go to the
body and stick with it. That's how I've gotten a lot of my
knockouts, from body shots.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1999, Juarez had remade his body and his game. He won his
first national championship, advancing to the world championships
before a home crowd at George R. Brown. He beat fighters from
Kazakhstan, Germany, Scotland and Turkey, then beat Tulkunbay
Turgunov of Uzbekistan by decision for the world championship.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he was becoming an internationally successful
boxer, Rocky Juarez tried hard to be one of the guys at Davis High
School. He generally avoided trouble from classmates who might be
tempted to test his skills, in part because of his deceptively
slight build, in part because of a loyal cadre of protective
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are proud of me on the north side,'' he said. `I can
walk around _ say to a club or something, and people might say,
`Hey, Rocky, do you want a beer?' and somebody will say, `Are you
crazy? This boy doesn't drink. He's going to be a world champion.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I like about my neighborhood. People protect me.
And I think I'm a good person. I never let things go to my head. If
you think too highly of yourself, there are people out there who
don't care who you are and can take everything away from you, and
your whole career is down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to respect everybody, and I try to reduce things from
happening. Say I go to a dance and I'm with friends. It may be
crowded and I tap a guy on the shoulder and say `excuse me' rather
than trying to push by him and bragging that I'm an Olympian.''
</P>
<P>
   Juarez is proud of having graduated from Davis High School, and
Davis is proud of him, too; a mural at the school includes a
painting of Juarez with the Olympic rings in the background. His
success in the ring, however, complicated things in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to miss a month of school at a time (for
competitions and training),'' he said. ``That was the hard part.
But when I was in school, I made the grades, did my homework.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Davis in December but made a return trip to
Houston from the team's training base in Colorado Springs this
spring so he could go through graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't give up,'' he said. ``My dream has always been to
become a world champion, and I was thinking more about boxing. But
I was trying to do my best because I would have been the only one
in my family not to graduate. I'm glad to have the diploma. It
shows that I'm not a quitter and that I didn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Juarez in the classroom is a lot like Rocky Juarez in the
ring _ troublesome start, successful finishes. He has never been
knocked off his feet in 156 fights, even though he is anything but
a quick starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who sees me knows that Rocky always loses the first
round, always,'' he said. ``I'm patient. I try to make the guy show
me everything he has in the first round. In a way I'm getting beat
in the first round, but I know what he's going to do the whole
fight. I make the other guy commit.''
</P>
<P>
   Juarez's road to the Olympics got off to a slow start, too.
After qualifying for Sydney earlier this year, he suffered a cut
while sparring and had to sit out dual meets against Mexico and
Ukraine. He's had a lot of time to think, and what he usually
thinks about his life after the Olympics and the beginning of his
professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``My amateur career is about to end,'' he said. ``Then I'll have
to take another step and have to prove myself on the next level,
the professional level. I think about what happens if I don't
fulfill that dream and people say, `Oh, he was only a good
amateur,' that I stopped at that one spot and didn't keep going
step after step. I think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where it becomes a money thing,'' he said. ``The
promoters promise so much if you win a bronze, then it goes up with
a silver medal, and with a gold you can almost name your price.''
</P>
<P>
   No Houston fighter has won a gold medal at the Olympic Games
since Foreman in 1968. But Ontivaros and Marquez think Juarez has
the potential to bring it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make a mistake with Rocky,'' Ontivaros said. ``They see
him shorter (5-4) and so the guys go right to him, and that's a
mistake. He tears at their body and then goes to the head. He's a
good boxer, a good hitter. That's what we teach here. None of that
moving and playing around.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether he wins a medal, Juarez's thoughts in
Australia will never be far from his home on Silverdale, where he
lives on the same street with his grandparents, an uncle and a
sister, and from the lessons his grandfather taught him so long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he prepares for the longest trip of his life, and then
the professional journey to follow, he hopes to remain the guy just
up the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go well, I'll come back,'' Juarez said. ``I don't
even want to move from Houston. I don't even want to move from my
neighborhood. That's how happy I am there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say I was a millionaire and things go well for me. I'll still
live in my neighborhood and get the response of being who I am and
live a happy life. I want to make Houston a fighting city again.
Las Vegas, MGM Grand? I want people to come here.''

 Purveyors Gear Up to Offer Ingredients Online But
Hard-to-Find  Products Can Still be Hard to Find   _ Salad: Perishable products are fairly scarce 
 &HT;       
 By Lesli Neilson 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Cyber-hunting for a specific recipe ingredient is
like trying to find a needle in a haystack _ especially if it's
perishable. To see how well the Internet worked for finding
specialty ingredients, we took a green salad recipe and went
surfing.
<P>
   We were able to find a variety of sites which offer upscale
ingredients which led to some gourmet finds with expensive totals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Dean &AMP; Deluca. &LR;  If you want to splurge,
 &LR; www.deananddeluca.com &LR;  (or  &LR; www.deandeluca.com) &LR; , the site from
the gourmet retail grocer, is just for you. This sharp-looking site
has four categories: marketplace, recipes, articles and wine. Crisp
product images and colorful styled recipes signal that this is no
amateur site. General food information taken from the Dean &AMP; Deluca
Cookbook is also helpful.
</P>
<P>
   I purchased upscale olive oil and vinegar for the recipe. With
descriptions like, ``More tart than sweet, with a true raspberry
taste, this is a vinegar destined to dress the most delicate
salads. Serve with young lettuces or goat cheese on cro &LR; u &LR; tes,''
how could you not select French Champs Champagne Vinegar with
Raspberry for $8.25 for 16.9-ounce bottle? For a traditional red
wine vinegar, there was domestic Delouis Aged Red Wine Vinegar for
$5 for a 500-ml bottle.
</P>
<P>
   I also chose a bottle of California Bariani extra virgin olive
oil for $24 (33.8-ounce bottle). In addition, there are three other
California olive oils and 14 Mediterranean olive oils.
</P>
<P>
   Customer assistance provides all sorts of useful information
like Frequently Asked Questions, shipping information and company
history.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ World of Cheese &LR; .  &LR; www.worldofcheese.com &LR;  is a no-frills site
that offers cheese from 12 countries. A search for goat cheese led
to nearly a dozen choices, many from Bay Area cheese artisans like
Cypress Grove Humbolt Fog. But after selecting a 7-ounce round of
Sea Stars Monet goat cheese for $11 and proceeding to check out,
the delivery charge ended up costing an additional $16.95. You're
better off ordering several cheeses to make up for such a hefty
shipping fee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Webvan. &LR;  After endless searching,  &LR; www.webvan.com &LR;  was one of
the only sites I found for mixed greens. The popular mix includes
baby lettuce leaves, frisee, radicchio, mizuna, arugula, baby red
chard and baby spinach. A 4-ounce bag sells for $3.37. With seven
kinds of goat cheese _ the most expensive for $5.38 _ this
easy-to-navigate site simplifies shopping. English shallots were
available for $1.87 a pound. Diamond Kosher salt was $3.06 for a
3-pound box. Webvan charges $4.95 for deliveries under $50 and
offers a 30-minute delivery window.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Monterey Bay Spice Co. &LR;  This Santa Cruz company seems to
carry every herb and spice imaginable. Clicking to  &LR; www.herbco.com &LR; 
will bring you to a fairly rudimentary site but the immediate
response while searching for products is refreshing. A search for
black peppercorns revealed nine kinds. Spices are available by the
quarter-pound or in bulk. A $3 processing fee is added to orders
less than $20. Orders are shipped via UPS for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SALAD OF WILD &AMP; CULTIVATED GREENS
</P>
<P>
   Include a well-balanced selection of assertive and mild greens
for this salad from Georgeanne Brennan. Choose from dandelion,
chicory, borage, watercress, mache, purslane, spinach, arugula,
radicchio, chervil, frisee, escarole, sorrel and parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 cups mixed young tender greens (see above)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup red wine or other vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 ounces fresh goat cheese, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Rinse and clean all the greens carefully, discarding any old or
bruised leaves. Tear any large leaves into bite-size pieces. Dry
the greens well in a salad spinner or with a towel and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the olive oil into a large salad bowl. Add the shallots,
vinegar, salt and pepper and stir with a fork to mix.
</P>
<P>
   Put the greens in the salad bowl and gently toss in the dressing
until they are well coated. Let the salad stand for about 10
minutes to soften the taste of the greens and to blend the flavors.
Top with the goat cheese and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6.

 &UR; _ Couscous: Search yields few hits, lots of misses &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Lesli Neilson &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; It was quite a task coming up with reliable Web
sites to purchase ingredients for Marlena Spieler's recipe for
Vegetable Couscous, especially the fresh produce required.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Ethnic Grocer. &LR;  Trying to shop _ more than once _ on
 &LR; www.ethnicgrocer.com &LR;  was a negative experience each time. I was
able to purchase some spices for my recipe and the number of
products available was impressive. A search for olive oil brought
up 53 choices. But the product images were too small and amateurish
to determine the brand name and it wasn't immediately apparent
where to select the product if you wanted to purchase it.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for paprika (nine kinds were found) turned up an
informative little blurb at the bottom of the page telling all
about the pepper.
</P>
<P>
   However, all the bells and whistles made it tough to move around
the site. Each step of searching and selecting items seemed
endless. Although shipping is free for orders of $30 or more, it
would take forever to acquire that sum in products. Otherwise,
shipping costs $5.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Ethnic Superstore &LR; .  &LR; www.ethnicsuperstore.com &LR;  is divided
into five categories: products, recipes, festivals, recipe contest
and promotions/sales. The product category is divided into tea and
coffee, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean and Indian Subcontinent.
We were able to find canned and dried chickpeas. However, a search
for ``chickpea'' came up with nothing. Typing in ``chick pea'' came
up with 10 results. Shipping is by UPS and costs $4.50 for orders
up to $35.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; San Francisco Herb Co &LR; . Neil Hanscomb has been in the herb
and spice business for over 25 years. In addition to a
brick-and-mortar outlet at 250 14th St., San Francisco (10 a.m.-4
p.m. Monday-Saturday), he sells more than 450 items at
 &LR; www.sfherb.com &LR; , including dried herbs and spices, spice blends,
teas, baking items, nuts, seeds and potpourris. There is a minimum
order of $30, and shipping is through UPS.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Eco-Organics USA &LR; . Based in New Jersey,
 &LR; www.eco-organics.com &LR;  was simple in design but had several
ingredients I needed, including onions, garlic, carrots, sweet
potatoes, cabbage, green beans, zucchini, tomatoes and vegetable
broth. In addition, the site offers a variety of other products,
including hemp goods, groceries and juicers. Ground shipping is
available for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; American Spice Co &LR; .  &LR; www.americanspice.com &LR;  is a virtual
pantry filled with all sorts of spices, sauces, seasonings and
more. Although the site is rather bare bones (no product images or
other useful information), I was able to find many of the
ingredients _ olive oil, paprika, cumin, turmeric, coriander,
ginger, curry powder, cloves, cinnamon, salt and pepper. There is a
fee for ground shipping.

   Recipe from Marlena Spieler.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Stew
</P>
<P>
   1 yellow or white onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon turmeric
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ras el hanout or curry powder
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 turnip, peeled and cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1/2 head cabbage, cut into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound green beans
</P>
<P>
   2 zucchini, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups diced tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   11/2 to 2 quarts broth of choice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cooked chickpeas
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/2 to 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   Couscous
</P>
<P>
   2 cups couscous grains (traditional or quick-cooking)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 2/3 cup dark or golden raisins, or chopped dried
apricots, figs or dates
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Harissa sauce
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; To make the stew:  &LR; Saute the onion and half of the garlic
in the olive oil for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the onion softens.
Add the paprika, cumin, turmeric, coriander, ginger, ras al hanout,
cloves and cinnamon. Let cook for a few moments, then add the
remaining garlic, the vegetables, tomatoes and broth. Simmer for
about 40 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Add the
chickpeas and cook until heated through. Season with salt, pepper
and lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make traditional couscous:  &LR; Rinse traditional couscous
grains in cold water. Spread in a baking pan and set aside for 15
minutes. Rake through the grains with your fingertips, breaking up
the lumps. Line a steamer or top of a couscousiere with
cheesecloth. Place the grains inside; cover and steam over
simmering water for 15 minutes. Spread the grains in the baking
pan, sprinkle with cool water and rake through them again.
</P>
<P>
   To finish: Just before serving, add the raisins and return the
couscous to the cloth-lined steamer. Cook over simmering water for
15 to 20 minutes. Toss with the butter and cinnamon. Heap onto a
platter and top with the stew. Pass harissa at the table.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make quick-cooking couscous:  &LR; Combine the quick-cooking
couscous with an equal amount of cold water. Cover and set aside
for 15 minutes, until the water has been absorbed. Transfer to a
baking dish. Add the raisins, cover tightly, and bake in a 425
degrees oven for 20 minutes, or until hot. Remove from the oven,
fluff with a fork, then toss with the butter and cinnamon.

 &UR; _ Mole: Latino food sites dot the Net &LR;
</P>

   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Lesli Neilson &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Cooking an authentic Oaxacan mole might be
challenging for a Northern Californian but could the Internet be
used to bridge the gap between us and our Southern neighbors? With
South to North columnist Jacqueline Higuera McMahan's mole recipe
in hand, we went to the Net to get some of the ingredients and came
up with the following finds:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; CMC Co. &LR;   &LR; www.thecmccompany.com/mexico.htm &LR;  offers many
Mexican products. Dried ancho chiles were $6 for 6 ounces and
guajillo chiles were $7 for 6 ounces. Ibarra Mexican chocolate
costs $3.75 for 18 ounces and Mexican cinnamon,  &LR; canela &LR; , is $2.50
for six 5-inch sticks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the extensive Mexican category, the site covers
ingredients for Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Indian and Jamaican
cuisines. Clicking on a product name will bring up a helpful
description. The site is easy to navigate and response is quick.
Simple but effective graphics are a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The site does have a major flaw _ the capability to select items
and place them in a cyber shopping basket is not yet available. It
is necessary to fill out an order form and e-mail it, print it out
and send it by snail mail or fax, or call in your order. But this
is scheduled to change next month. Delivery is through UPS, and
charge is based on weight of the order.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Buchanan Hollow Nut Co. &LR;  Located off Highway 99 near Merced,
the little town of Le Grand is home to this Northern California nut
company. Rudimentary in design, the Web site  &LR; www.bhnc.com &LR;  does
carry a handful of products, including the almonds and dark raisins
we were looking for. It is necessary to print out the order form to
make purchases. Shipping costs are determined by weight and is
through UPS.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Latin Grocer. &LR;  Although I wasn't able to find fresh plantains
on  &LR; www.latingrocer.com &LR; , I did find ancho and guajillo dried
chiles, sesame seeds and oregano. Set up like a grocery store, this
Miami-based Web site has colorful graphics with quick response
time. Among its offerings: Latin food and music, vitamins, beauty
products, housewares and electronics. Simply place purchases in the
shopping cart and check out.
</P>
<P>
   UPS ground shipping is free for non-perishable items (which are
sent next-day for a fee).
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Cuban Food Market &LR; . We were very excited to find
 &LR; www.cubanfoodmarket.com &LR;  _ this site had the fresh plantains our
recipe called for. Unfortunately, due to California's regulations
regarding accepting exotic fruit and vegetables, we were unable to
purchase them.
</P>
<P>
   The site is divided into categories: groceries &AMP; produce,
kitchen &AMP; accessories, gifts &AMP; baskets, clothing &AMP; accessories,
books &AMP; videos and memorabilia &AMP; music. The design of the Web site
is pretty simplistic and the colors are gaudy. A search for
plaintains led us to a quick 22 results. But switching between
categories can be slow. Ground shipping is free for orders of
$17.99 or more. Otherwise, charges are $4.95.

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   8 ancho chiles
</P>
<P>
   4 guajillo chiles
</P>
<P>
   2 large tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 yellow or white onion
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup whole blanched almonds
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons raisins
</P>
<P>
   1 plantain, or 1/4 banana
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   2 whole cloves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   2-inch piece canela (Mexican cinnamon)
</P>
<P>
   1 piece pan dulce, or 1 slice French bread, toasted
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce Ibarra Mexican chocolate (1/2 round), broken into small
pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Toast the ancho and guajillo chiles in a dry skillet over
medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the chiles to a bowl
and cover with boiling water. Cover and let steep for 45 minutes,
pushing the chiles down into the liquid from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Roast the tomatoes, onion and garlic in a 400 oven for 25
minutes. At the same time, put the almonds and sesame seeds in
separate pie tins, place in the oven and toast for 5 minutes. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the plantain and slice in long diagonal pieces. Fry the
pieces in 1 tablespoon of the oil in a nonstick skillet until
golden. (If you use a banana, peel it but do not fry.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove the stems and seeds from the soaked chiles. Place the
chiles in a blender (do not use a food processor), add the
tomatoes, onion, garlic and 1 cup water. Puree (do this in batches,
if necessary).
</P>
<P>
   Combine the toasted sesame seeds, almonds, raisins, cloves and
cinnamon in a spice grinder or electric coffee mill reserved for
spices; grind to a fine powder. Add to the chile-tomato mixture in
the blender. Process to blend. Add the sauteed plantain, the bread,
oregano, pepper and salt. Process until pureed.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy pot; add the
pureed ingredients, the chocolate and 1 cup of the chicken broth
(use more, if necessary, to thin the mole). Simmer for 30 minutes,
stirring frequently (be sure to stir down to bottom of pot). Be
cautious, as mole tends to splatter.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 1 quart mole; enough to serve 8.

 &UR; _ Sambar: Indian recipe calls for unusual spices &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mildred Fernandes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Like other make-or-break ingredients, there's
something about fresh curry leaves that defies explanation. Purists
of Southern Indian cuisine swear by this leaf, homesick Indians
worship it, and there's nothing quite like the smell of it
overpowering golden-fried onions freckled with mustard seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, trying to source curry leaves online was like
trying to get a tan in a San Francisco summer: time-consuming and
often unsuccessful. This unique spice grows well in tropical climes
and is, sadly, quite perishable, which means it can survive for
only three days outside the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   These difficulties mean that only a smidgen of online retailers
offer fresh curry leaves, and in varying doses. Since this was the
hardest spice to find, it quickly became my benchmark for
evaluating Indian grocery Web sites. Most sites offer dried curry
leaves, which I recommend avoiding at all costs. It's far too easy
for them to leave an acrid aftertaste that no amount of pleading
and tweaking will diminish.
</P>
<P>
   The following sites are my recommendations, listed in order of
preference:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Namaste. &LR;   &LR; www.namaste.com. &LR;  The guru of all online Indian
grocery stores, Namaste.com offers just about everything Indian. A
search for turmeric, for example, yielded turmeric powder in a
variety of packages, as well as turmeric skin cream, a popular
herbal cleanser.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the two places that stocks fresh curry leaves,
which they will ship via two-day special freight. The downside is
that they're only available by the pound and a pound costs a hefty
$31.99. Ideal if you're running a South Indian restaurant, but an
expensive and overwhelming stash otherwise. There's also free
shipping for orders over $30, but without the curry leaves, you'd
need to buy a whole lot to take advantage of that.
</P>
<P>
   The blurbs that accompany every ingredient are a perfect touch.
A site as extensive as this can be a little time-heavy to navigate,
and Namaste.com scores again with a handy database. I popped in
every individual ingredient I was looking for and it gave me the
option to buy any of the ones it found. Other little things I
liked: 1) leaving your name and information for future shopping is
an option, which was perfect for a test driver like me, and 2) they
had pomegranate seeds.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Patel Brothers. &LR;   &LR; www.patelbrothersusa.com. &LR;  A no-frills
little site that's a good example of the legendary Gujrati knack
for business. This was my second favorite site because they include
a number you can call to place an order for fresh curry leaves ($1
per ounce, plus a two-day shipping fee _ since this company is
located in New York). A slow server and clunky design restrain this
site, as does its lack of bells and whistles (like pictures of
ingredients), but it is a spunky little site with a lot of promise.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Mahabazaar. &LR;   &LR; www.mahabazaar.com. &LR;  Ace customer service,
prompt replies to e-mail queries. Lots of background information
about the owners, which was reassuring. No pictures and the actual
order form can get annoying, but there's a lot of potential here.
Easy to navigate, thoughtfully put together: the checklist offers a
``quantities'' column and an ``add-to-cart'' column.
</P>
<P>
   However, no fresh curry leaves, and they tragically tried to
convince me that the dried would do just fine. Saving grace: They
offer fresh mangoes.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; India Plaza. &LR;   &LR; www.indiaplaza.com. &LR;  Offers the options of
shopping in the United States, Britain or India, which is a pretty
tall order for a single site. There's a lot of stuff here and it
takes awhile to get down to the actual grocery shopping. The sheer
volume of goods means they list groceries by alphabetical order,
which can get crazy if you're not sure whether ``curry leaves'' is
spelled ``kari leaves.'' Patience is a must.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Caveats: &LR;  All the online Indian supermarkets I found listed
different brands for individual spices: You could choose between
MTR, Shan, Rajah, MDH or Badshah versions of garam masala, for
example. Even the prices vary, so unless you've used a particular
brand before or can view or take a whiff of its contents to guess
its authenticity, this is definitely one of the downsides of online
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Specialty spices. &LR;  If you're buying saffron, curry leaves or
fresh mangoes, seeing really is believing. If it's expensive,
perishable or if there's a particular type of mango you're looking
for, then it's almost impossible to be satisfied online.

<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Read it online! Get recipes online!
<P>
   Your favorite food magazine may be touted as offering these
tempting options, but don't cancel your subscription just yet.
There is valuable information you can get with a few clicks of your
mouse _ including some recipes _ but it's far from complete and, in
some instances, barely more than a teaser.
</P>
<P>
   Print magazines are not in the business of putting themselves
out of business. So in many instances, the magazine's Web site is
filled mostly with information on how to subscribe to the
paper-and-ink product rather and on purchasing special merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   We checked out a sampling of some of the best-known food
magazines and found that their online offerings vary widely. All
give you subscription information, sometimes with promotional
discounts; most offer one or two free sample issues; all let you
bookmark what free recipes they carry or send them to a third
party; and several offer weekly e-mail newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what's available is free, but some sites charge. Some
give you listings of recipes that ran in past issues, but you'll
have to order those issues _ and pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Bon Appetit &LR;  and  &UR; Gourmet &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; www.epicurious.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The two Conde Nast publications, which you can find on
Epicurious, were the most user friendly of the sites we perused,
with lots of recipes.
</P>
<P>
   You don't get the whole magazine, but you can find a great deal
_ enough, if nothing else, to whet your appetite for the whole
product, which might just be the idea behind the Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Cooking Light &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; www.cookinglight.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the more frustrating sites. It has some
interesting features _ an explanation of test kitchen procedures
and a virtual tour of the kitchens _ and you can call up some 2,000
recipes. But the indexed list of year-to-year recipes seems
pointless; it's just a list.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Fine Cooking &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; www.finecooking.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Fine Cooking has extensive listings but few recipes online, and
it is complicated to search. The main thrust here seems to be to
sell back issues _ at $5.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Food &AMP; Wine &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR; www.foodandwine.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FoodandWine.com gives you a recipe of the day the moment you
sign on but not much more in the way of recipes. There is an
easy-to-use wine search that lets you find, say, a Sonoma County
Chardonnay in a price and quality range you determine. Once you
have found that wine, you can also click for foods that would be a
good match _ sans recipes.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Cuisine &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; www.cuisinemagazine.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cuisine magazine has a good number of free recipes done in
cooking-class style: Ingredients are listed on the left third or so
of the screen, with step-by-step pictures to the right. This is a
helpful approach, especially when dealing with unfamiliar
ingredients or techniques.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Cook's Illustrated &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; www.cooksillustrated.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This site has a limited number of articles and recipes, plus a
free newsletter, but if you want the full content of the magazine,
you have to subscribe to the Web site: $19.95 a year if you also
subscribe to the print magazine; $24.95 if you don't, or $3.95 for
one month. This is not unreasonable, since Cook's Illustrated
operates on principles similar to Consumer Reports: No advertising
or other promotional revenue. This policy assures a high degree of
independence _ and it means that online or in print, you are not
assaulted by a clutter of advertising and special promotions.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Atlantic Monthly &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; www.atlanticmonthly.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Monthly is not the first magazine you think of when you
are interested in food, but the excellent, frequently amusing food
articles and cookbook reviews make for good reading. They can be
found at the magazine's online site, Atlantic Unbound.

<HEADLINE>
THE MYSTERY OF THE PICKLE JAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By DULCIE LEIMBACH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilfred Kean is famous for his dill pickles, but on one
particular day last fall, he couldn't make them by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Wilfred, 86, is my neighbor at our weekend place in Equinunk, a
fleck of a town overlooking the Delaware River in the northeastern
corner of Pennsylvania. He had called me over, so I followed him
into his comfortable kitchen, with its flowered linoleum floor,
sparkling white stove and porcelain sink, all of which his wife,
Grace, keeps immaculate. Grace is also mindful of her pantry,
stocking it with so many sugary items that my daughter always
manages a visit, even though Wilfred's gravelly voice and teasing
manner scare the daylights out of her.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, Wilfred stood stooped at the sink, his arthritic
hands as gnarled as ginger root, his body not cooperating, leaving
him unable to stand for too long. ``Hold them like this, Delsey,''
he instructed, mispronouncing my name, as he has for 12 years, as
he showed me how to scrub the small black warts off one of his
Kirby cucumbers, of which, I noticed, there were a bucketful.
Inwardly I sighed, aware that the many tasks on my own to-do list
were about to be slighted in this venture. Still, I was drawn to
the job. I had rinsed many cucumbers, but never scrubbed. I was
curious, too, about the makings of these pickles.
</P>
<P>
   He handed me a small plastic brush, and I picked up the first
cucumber and whisked away, removing every black knob. Then I looked
down at the bucket and realized I had to pace myself better if I
was to last at the sink.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wilfred sat down at the kitchen table and mumbled
through a monologue about how no one helped him pick the cucumbers
in his garden but how everyone wanted his pickles, about the bald
eagles he'd seen nesting on the Delaware last winter and about the
virtues of sweet pickles, which he makes occasionally. ``Can't
write the recipe down,'' he said. ``A recipe ain't worth the
woof.''
</P>
<P>
   Although I was swamped with cukes, Wilfred's dill pickles were
worth it: Crunchy on the outside, firm on the inside and snappy
with garlic, they lived far beyond the pale of any other pickles I
had ever known.
</P>
<P>
   With the cucumbers washed and Wilfred pleased with my efforts,
we prepared the brine: Water, cider vinegar, sugar and canning
salt, all boiled in a big pot. I looked at the recipe written in
Grace's girlish cursive on notepaper, thinking I would be able to
recall it by memory when I got back to the city, but it drifted out
of my head, just as my grandmother's recipe for lemon cake with
lemon icing had died with her 25 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The brine heating up, we started to pack two gallon-size jars.
At the bottom Wilfred dropped a handful of dill, and then threw in
a bunch of chopped white onions as I sliced a garlic pod on top.
Next came the cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with the smallest ones,'' Wilfred said. ``Then put the
ones that look pregnant in the next layer. You can slice the ones
that are too big _ just put them face down. Put the curve side
against the jar. Don't leave any gaps. Fill the middle with the
tiny ones. There you go.''
</P>
<P>
   The jar was now two-thirds full _ time to insert more dill,
onions and garlic. It was hard for Wilfred to stick his hand in the
jar, so I put the dill in for him, though he managed the onions,
dropping some on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   As time ticked away, I fleetingly wondered what was happening
across the lawn in my own house. It had been ages since I had
lingered in any kitchen, and though this had felt self-indulgent at
first, it now felt totally right. Wasn't I old enough to dawdle?
How long did I have to wait? My 80s? The last time I had spent so
many hours in a kitchen was probably the summer of 1963, when as a
young girl I stayed with my grandmother in her bungalow in New
Jersey. Day after day, I'd watch as she stirred her cake batters,
popped the pans in the oven and sat down to a good, hot cup of tea
despite an indoor temperature of 90.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get any more cucumbers in here,'' I complained to
Wilfred, slightly annoyed that he expected me to find space where
there was none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, come on, there's plenty of room,'' he grumbled as I
searched for possible victims. ``Pack them in. You don't want a jar
of floating cucumbers, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   The brine had been boiling a few minutes. I asked Wilfred again
how he made sweet pickles. ``By guess and by God,'' he said, waving
his hand but elaborating. ``You use four times as much sugar than
in dill pickles. You got to go with your taste. The brine must be
sweet but still quite sour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who gave you these recipes?'' I prodded some more. I knew
Wilfred had grown up on a farm, had even worked his own a few years
before he switched to construction and ended up on a state road
crew. ``Delsey, you know these recipes are from a hundred years
ago,'' Wilfred chastised, putting an end to my query.
</P>
<P>
   We put the packed jars in a plastic basin and ladled the hot
brine in, sure to fill every cranny. We then threw in a teaspoon of
mustard seed _ to keep the pickles fresh longer _ and let the
pickles set before topping them off with more brine. The pickles
would need to stay refrigerated over the months it took to eat
them.
</P>
<P>
   The last steps _ leaving the jars out until they cooled down
before refrigerating them _ I left to Wilfred. The afternoon had
nearly vanished, and I could see my husband approaching Wilfred's
house, a weary look in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   We made the pickles with Wilfred another time. Grace helped, and
my husband prepared the brine. ``He was afraid you wouldn't do it
right,'' Wilfred said jokingly, trying to catch me off guard. As we
took a noontime break, my daughter and I sat with Wilfred under his
carport, as he hand-fed a chipmunk.
</P>
<P>
   He told a story about the white swans that swam in the Delaware
within view of our houses, how a mother had laid her tail down flat
and her babies walked right up it onto her back and they all
floated away. How nice, I mused _ much like a day making pickles.
</P>
<P>
   DILL PICKLES
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Wilfred Kean
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus 24 hours' marinating and refrigerating
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup noniodized salt or canning salt
</P>
<P>
   { cup (packed) fresh dill
</P>
<P>
   3 white onions, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3{ to 4 pounds small Kirby cucumbers, well scrubbed (to fill
1-gallon jar)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon mustard or celery seed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Sterilize 1-gallon glass jar and lid by immersing in boiling
water for 10 minutes. Remove from water, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In large enameled, glass or other nonreactive saucepan,
combine 6 cups water with the cider vinegar, sugar and salt. Bring
to boil, reduce heat to low and then simmer mixture while
proceeding with recipe.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place a third of the dill in bottom of jar. Top with a third
each of the onion and garlic. Starting with smallest cucumbers,
pack 1 layer horizontally over garlic. Place another layer
crosswise over first. Continue until jar is two-thirds full,
packing jar tightly and filling gaps with cucumbers halved
lengthwise.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add another third of the dill, followed by another third each
of onion and garlic. Top with cucumbers, packing tightly. Top with
remaining dill, onion and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   5. Place jar in large plastic basin and carefully pour hot
vinegar mixture (brine) into jar to fill it completely. Using a
long wooden skewer, gently nudge the pickles deep in the jar to
dislodge any air bubbles. Add more brine, if necessary, and allow
to sit 5 minutes. Add more brine to fill the jar to the brim, and
top with mustard seed. If using glass lid, place lid directly on
jar. If using metal lid, to prevent corrosion place large piece of
wax paper over top of jar before fastening lid.
</P>
<P>
   6. Let mixture cool to room temperature. Remove jar from basin,
and wipe clean with damp sponge. Refrigerate jar at least 24 hours
before eating. The pickles may be refrigerated for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 20 to 25 pickles.

 CHRON  
 It's a Weird Wired World for Cooks Who Surf the Net   By Kim Severson 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Fran Goss, 55, runs a bed and breakfast near
Yosemite. She considers herself a kitchen sophisticate and a darn
fine baker.
<P>
   Sue Kim, 22, pumps software for Bluemartini.com in San Mateo.
She lives in San Francisco and doesn't cook much. She can, however,
name a dozen of the city's best chefs.
</P>
<P>
   As cooks, they are worlds apart. Yet they both recently sat at
their computers searching for solutions to culinary dilemmas.
Gross' peach trees were weighed down with fruit; Kim had become
obsessed with some five-pound bags of catfish she had seen at
Costco.
</P>
<P>
   Their common experience demonstrates the tentative, early
courtship between two pursuits dear to the Bay Area _ food and
cyberspace. Yet, although the Internet has promised to
revolutionize how we live, the wonders of the Web have yet to make
it into the kitchen. Online grocery shopping sales remain flat,
cooking Web sites battle to be recognized and diners and
restaurateurs still rely on the telephone to handle reservations.
</P>
<P>
   How long will it be until the Internet invades America's
stomach? Experts are divided. Some say food is a latecomer to the
cyber revolution because of the nature of eating _ a tactile
experience built on smell and taste that the Internet can never
replicate. Others say demographics are to blame _ many accomplished
cooks with a honed knowledge of food and wine tend to be older than
the generation that takes the Internet for granted.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, food and the Internet are mixing like, well, oil
and water. Among sizzling e-commerce categories like computers, CDs
and books, food is barely a blip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monumental challenge,'' says Bill Wallace, culinary
director of Tavolo, a Web site that mixes specialty food and
equipment sales with recipes and content from food magazines, ``is
to express on the Internet the wonderful sensual quality of food
and the art of cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Food made up less than 1 percent of the $440 billion in online
sales last year, according to Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   _ No food site was among the 50 most visited, according to a
July report by Media Matrix, which tracks Internet activity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Foodtv.com, a companion site to a popular cooking network,
generated the most traffic of any food site. But even that site's
1.147 million monthly ``visitors'' pale next to the 6.2 million
visitors logged each month by sites like Freelotto.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are not yet ready to transfer this care-giving
function (buying food) to a detached process like online
shopping,'' said Mary Brett Whitfield, an analyst with
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people who have their feet in both worlds predict the Web
stands to revolutionize how Americans _ especially those in Middle
America _ eat. Cyber-analyst International Data Corp. predicts that
online grocery shopping, which accounted for about $200 million in
sales in 1999, will reach $8.8 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But food on the Internet is not just about buying groceries. The
Web is dramatically impacting politics and consumer issues like
food safety.
</P>
<P>
   When the Department of Agriculture recently proposed changes in
rules regarding irradiation and egg processing, tens of thousands
of responses to the changes were logged by e-mail. And
organizations focusing on hot-button issues like organic
regulations and genetically altered food use the Internet to drive
the public debate. With e-mail and Web sites, Berkeley's
Frankenfood protesters, for example, can be instantly linked with
their European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   And the most recent results of an annual food safety study
conducted by CMF &AMP; Z Communications shows that last year 23 percent
of those surveyed used the Internet to learn about the issue. This
year, that number jumped to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area restaurateurs are cautiously optimistic about how the
Web will affect their future. Reservations and restaurant reviews
can increasingly be found online, and chefs in Bay Area kitchens
are using the Internet to order food and handle reservations and
patron preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Wilson, a 23-year-old information specialist in San
Francisco, eats out five to seven times week at restaurants he
often picks from the Internet, checking hours and sometimes making
reservations _ if the restaurant is as wired as he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do it at work very quickly since I'm on the Internet
anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But industry watchers point out that it's still early in the
game. Carolyn Everson of Zagat.com likens the online reservation
revolution to the cyber travel industry. Only about 10 percent of
all travel reservations are expected to be made online by 2003, she
said. And restaurant industry is far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see 20 or 30 percent of the population making online
restaurant reservations in the next two years,'' she said.
``Consumers need time to trust it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefs also fear the personal touch might be lost in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that it never goes completely Internet,'' says Doug
Washington, general manager at Jardiniere in San Francisco about
restaurant reservations. While he's happy with OpenTable.com, he
talks about a woman who called him one day, explaining she had
forgotten to make reservations for that night for her husband's
birthday. The restaurant was booked, but Washington was able to fit
her in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she'd tried to make reservations online, she would have
seen the restaurant was full and she would have gone somewhere
else,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Those chefs who have turned to the Internet to order ingredients
praise its efficiency, but worry about losing personal contact with
their purveyors _ the people who provide the raw ingredients that
can make or break a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Obranovich, executive chef at Left Bank in Larkspur,
orders about 70 percent of his food through the Internet, but he
still goes to the farmers' market twice a week. ``You need to be in
touch with local growers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the Internet is going to affect the Bay Area food
scene has yet to be revealed, maintains Wallace of Tavolo.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, a pioneer in the food specialty ingredient industry,
believes food fanatics in San Francisco will use the Internet for
recipe ideas, to learn about food from other cultures and to keep
up on the region's artisan food producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet will provide access, but many people in San
Francisco don't need that kind of access,'' he said. ``Where I live
now I can walk a half a block or two to Clement Street and find
almost any ingredient from around the world. But people who live in
Missoula or Davenport, Iowa, can't.''
</P>
<P>
   As America continues to get more sophisticated about food,
people in less populated, less food-driven environs will want to be
able to order Filipino spices, Chinese noodles or even artisan goat
cheese from Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all over the country are attuned to wonderful food but
they're just not enough people in many places to support a store
that carries 75-year-old balsamic vinegar,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet certainly has enhanced bed and breakfast owner Fran
Goss' culinary life. She lives in the mountains, and the closest
grocery store in Mariposa isn't exactly the multicultural culinary
wonderland of Berkeley Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great. If I do want to buy something I don't have to go
to Fresno or the coast,'' she said. ``It has really revolutionized
my cooking. I don't feel so isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also changed life for Sue Kim, the San Francisco
dot-commer. A year ago, she organized a dining club using an online
bulletin board to find people who wanted to eat at the same
restaurants she did. And when she decides to cook she turns to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at the office until 7 or 8 p.m. some nights,'' she said.
``So I've got the laser printing going and I print a couple recipes
out really quick and maybe hit the Trader's Joe's on the way
home.''

 Dot-com Food: A user's guide to recipes, ingredients,
equipment,  restaurants, wine and more   By The Chronicle Food Staff  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For the adventurous cook, the Internet seems like
a dream.
 &HT;    Want to make Laotian catfish stew or a vegetable Moroccan
couscous? A wired cook need merely download a recipe, check in with
a few other online cooks for tips on technique and then click over
to order the ingredients and the pots to cook it in.
 &HT;    But reality has a way of smashing dreams. Type ``couscous'' into
a popular search engine and you get 15,500 entries. It's like
trying to get a drink of water from a fire hose.
 &HT;    When it comes to reading about restaurants online, most
restaurant Web sites are fine for hours and menus, but even the
most popular portals have out-of-date information.
 &HT;    In this week's special Food issue, we've devoted ourselves to
helping Bay Area cooks find their way around the brave new world
that blends food and technology. We've cooked recipes we pulled off
``the Net.'' We've sent our best cooks surfing to find their top
recipe sites. We've researched how to order ethnic ingredients and
compared shopping for equipment online versus what can be found in
stores.
 &HT;    As we've rated sites and picked our favorites, we've tried to
keep in mind the practical needs of cooks with average computer
equipment. Using the Internet is a lot like cooking _ if you don't
have good equipment, both pursuits can become difficult And, we've
researched with an eye toward people who might not have much skill
navigating the Web. So whether you think a search engine is stored
in a garage or you surf Google daily, you'll find something here to
help you use the Internet to enhance your kitchen.

   (ART ADV: Photos and a map of Hanover are available on Newscom
or by calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW ROSENBAUM &QL; 
 &UR; c.2000 by Michelin. &QL; 
 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people come to Hanover each year, but most of them
never see the city.
</P>
<P>
   The two great exhibitions, this year's world's fair, EXPO 2000,
and the world's largest information technology show, CeBIT, each
hosted in a 2-million-foot space outside the city, attract all
their attention. But those who do take the time to see Hanover find
a jewel box of history and art.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this important German port was destroyed in World War
II, but there are still beautiful public buildings and gardens plus
several notable collections of modern art.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors arriving at Hanover's main railroad station are greeted
by a red arrow which leads them along a three-mile walk past the
city's principal treasures. Although the walk takes less than three
hours to complete, it spans medieval to modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up the red thread at the Hanover Tourist Information booth
at Ernst-Augustplatz not far from the station.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to bypass the first stop on the tour, Galerie
Luise, the high-roofed shopping gallery with a selection of
international stores _ (come back later to shop at your leisure) _
and head straight for the old Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Originally built between 1845 and 1852, this three-tiered
neo-Palladian gem gives viewers their first taste of the classic
architecture favored by the Hanoverian princes. The Opera House
burned down during the war, but was rebuilt in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   When you pick up the red trail again, it will lead you to
Georgstrasse, Hanover's main thoroughfare. Here you will find
19th-century cafes and some monumental sculpture. Don't miss the
four stone statues of famous Hanover burghers, who, these days,
ogle the traffic below.
</P>
<P>
   Breeze past the one-time headquarters of Europe's largest bank,
Deutsche Bank, and head straight for the haunting Aegidienkirche.
In 1347, pious Hanoverians began to build a Gothic church to
replace a 12th-century Romanesque basilica on this site. This
church was destroyed on October 9, 1943 by Allied bombs. Today,
only the walls remain. Inside the bombed-out church is a peace bell
presented by another war-torn city, Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   As you proceed down the red trail, you will go from the historic
to the post-modern at the Kubus Galerie, which regularly hosts
shows by well-known contemporary artists. Hanover has a thriving
gallery scene of which Kubus is only one example.
</P>
<P>
   After this, move on to Hanover's best-known cultural monument,
the Rathaus (City Hall), which dominates the lake in front of it.
With its carved stone walls and its copper-roofed turrets, it looks
far older than it is. It took 12 years to build and opened in June
1913.
</P>
<P>
   Skip the tour of the interior _ the outside is much more
interesting _ but take a few minutes to ascend the tower and get a
panoramic view of the entire city.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to pause at the Kestner Museum after that. The
building itself with its 5000 windows, is unusual. The collection
includes ancient coins, antiquities from Egypt and Rome and
European decorative art.
</P>
<P>
   Another important museum, the Sprengel, is just a short distance
away from the Rathaus. Bernhard Sprengel, a chocolate manufacturer
in Hanover, began collecting modern art in 1937 to preserve it from
Nazi destruction. He has left a thrilling collection of art from
the greatest masters of the 20th century including Paul Klee, Max
Beckmann, Pablo Picasso and Hanoverian-born Kurt Schwitters.
</P>
<P>
   When you leave the Sprengel, retrace your steps to a bridge that
crosses the Leine River. (The name ``Hannover'' as it is spelled in
German, comes from ``hohen ufer,'' referring to the high banks of
the Leine river.) On the far side are some of the most outrageous
monumental sculptures in the world _ Niki de Saint-Phalle's buxom,
curvaceous and colorful ``Nana's'' who cavort with decidedly
un-Germanic abandon. When they were first installed on this site in
1974, petitions were circulated to have them removed. However, they
stayed and are now much loved fixtures in the Hanoverian landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The path will now lead you into the ``Altstadt,'' a quarter that
dates back to medieval times. Here you can see some half-timbered
houses from the 13th and 14th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Move a bit faster here, but don't miss the ``Leineschloss,'' a
13th-century cloister with carefully sculpted columns.
</P>
<P>
   You will also want to see the old Rathaus, some of which dates
from the 15th century. It was nearly torn down in 1844, but was
saved and rebuilt in the Gothic style of 1500.
</P>
<P>
   The red trail now takes you back into the modern city, where it
ends. But there are more treasures to be savored in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   You should not miss the Herrenhausen Gardens, a 17th-century
masterpiece adorned with sculpture from Roman to Renaissance. An
avenue of lime trees connects four gardens with a 270-foot-tall
fountain in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Are you convinced? Will you leave the software of the world's
largest information technology show or the reconstructed landscapes
of EXPO 2000 for a look at this varied and marvelous city?
</P>
<P>
   Those who do will enjoy a rare day out. The rest will be able to
take advantage of two of the most unusual events anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   CeBIT, which takes place in March, is the world's largest
information technology exposition. Experts don't miss it _ they
routinely spend at least three days examining everything from the
latest in semiconductors to massive supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   And this year's world's fair _ EXPO 2000, which runs from June 1
to October 31 _ has 180 countries hosting pavilions, offering
visitors everything from fine art to fine cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the fair this year is
``Humankind-Nature-Technology'' _ that is, showing how all these
interact. A cable car carries visitors to the site and, as it is
395 acres in size (designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban), the
visitor should allow a few days to get a good look at it.

REACHING FOR BETTER TEQUILA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Heard about the tequila shortage? It seems that
because of a shortfall in the supply of agave plants, from which
tequila is distilled, the demand for this liquor is exceeding the
supply.
</P>
<P>
   But fear not, margarita lovers; plenty of tequila is still
around, although in a twist, there is now less bad stuff.
</P>
<P>
   As tequila producers in Mexico wait for the supply of agave to
rebound _ the plant takes eight years to mature _ they are cutting
back on their least profitable products, the cheap, generic
tequilas used primarily for slushy frozen margaritas, sugary house
cocktails or for downing shots with lime and salt. Instead, the
existing agave is being channeled into the higher-quality tequilas,
which are generally more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better tequilas haven't doubled and tripled in price _
they were charging top dollar for them already,'' said Al Lucero,
author of ``The Great Margarita Book (Ten-Speed Press, 1999) and an
owner of Maria's New Mexican Kitchen in Santa Fe, which offers
about 100 brands of tequila. ``The rotgut stuff was so bad that
they were almost giving it away.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise in quality will be subtle. Replacing generic house
tequilas with more expensive brands like, say, Jose Cuervo White,
offers only marginal improvement, at a slightly higher price. For
example, the classic margarita at Mi Cocina in Greenwich Village is
now $7, up from $5.50. And it is irrelevant with frozen margaritas,
which are so intensely sweet that you cannot taste the spirit
anyway. Both branches of the Manhattan Chili Co. in Manhattan have
replaced the cheap tequila in their frozen margaritas with cheap
rum to create a ``rum-a-rita,'' not that you can tell the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who are connoisseurs aren't going to order the
frozen anyhow,'' said Ken Kessler, an owner of the Manhattan Chili
Co., which still uses tequila in its other margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   A classic margarita uses two parts tequila to one part Triple
Sec and one part lime juice, served straight up with or without
salt around the rim of the glass. A better grade of tequila may
point to a day when the cocktail may be savored rather than slugged
back. Anybody who orders a margarita with a better tequila, made of
100 percent agave juice rather than the 51 percent required in the
cheaper tequilas, will discover a smoother, more complex cocktail
that cushions the salty, mineral agave flavor of the tequila with
the orange sweetness of Triple Sec and the sweet-sour edge of lime
juice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rising prices for tequila raise the question of why
variations on the martini, using fine rum or vodka, haven't gone
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flavor of the agave is so distinct that it's hard to
replicate it with anything else,'' said Lucero, who once formulated
an Absolut margarita but saw it die on the menu. ``The popularity
of tequila is so high that there's no reason to change the formula.
Why fight success?'' &QL;

GROUP INSTRUCTS INDIVIDUALS ON CORPORATE-STYLE TAX-AVOIDANCE
SCHEMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Mo., Texas, Calif., N.Y.)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Treasury officials say that abusive corporate tax shelters are
the government's biggest tax enforcement problem, costing billions
of dollars annually. Now a company called the Tax People is
teaching similarly dubious tax avoidance techniques to middle-class
Americans and says it has already signed up 50,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   At Tax People's national convention last month, 3,500 people
hollered with delight as the group's president told them that not
only would they cut their own tax bills but they would also grow
rich by selling the same tax-advice system to other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the system, which Tax People has been selling since
late 1997, is to set up a home business. For almost everyone who
participates, that business is to sell the ``tax relief'' system to
others. Then, almost any time the taxpayer leaves the house _
whether to commute to a day job, buy groceries, play golf or go to
church _ he deducts the cost of the trip as a business expense on
the ground that everywhere he goes he is doing business recruiting
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf, hunting, fishing and even vacations with your family''
can become tax deductible expenses, asserts a brochure from the Tax
People. Learn it all for $300 down and $100 a month _ costs that
are themselves deductible.
</P>
<P>
   It does not stop there. Hire the children to clean your home
office and then provide them with a fringe benefit _ their college
education _ and deduct the cost as a business expense.
</P>
<P>
   Tax People's president, Michael Cooper, 46, of Topeka, Kan.,
said he was marketing ``a way for people to legally, ethically and
morally reduce their taxes to the absolute legal minimum so they
can get out of debt and enjoy the lifestyle they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   But a variety of seasoned tax experts who have examined the Tax
People system said they did not share Tax People's views on the
legitimacy of the techniques. ``This is very clever,'' said
Professor Charles Davenport, a Rutgers Law School tax professor,
when asked to examine the system. ``They have created a system to
cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax People is just one example of the vulnerability of the
income tax system to questionable operations in an era when
Congress has sharply reduced the resources to hunt for tax cheats
and has imposed new rules that make it difficult for IRS agents to
pursue cases.
</P>
<P>
   Tax People advertises that a family of four with $60,000 of
wages can take $33,560 in federal income tax deductions if they
have a home-based business with just $1,000 of revenue. Those
deductions would slash their federal tax bill 81 percent, to
$1,384.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, tax law requires that a business report a taxable profit
at least two of every five years, or those deductions will be
disallowed. That is no problem, said Jesse Cota, a former IRS
district director and head of Tax People's ``tax dream team.'' He
said one need only switch to a different money-losing business
every three or four years to take these deductions for life.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tax People has ardent supporters. At the San Diego convention,
Cooper introduced the Rev. Terry Thomas, a retired Army sergeant
who leads an independent congregation on the Japanese island of
Okinawa, and his wife, Phyllis, noting that their trip was a
tax-deductible expense.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said they were thrilled with the system and that
since joining in July they had signed up 33 other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tax People teaches people to be debt free, and by selling
this system we can help people do that,'' Terry Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Thomas said persons who embrace the system ``tend to be
visionary and business-oriented people.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Thomas said the integrity of Tax People was critical to
his involvement. ``We are in the business of helping people, and we
feel this is a way to help people achieve financial freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Independent tax experts say that Tax People is advertising
techniques that can be legal only in unusual circumstances and is
glossing over limits on who can use them. For example, the rule
allowing a deduction for commuting expenses applies only when one's
wage job and home business are in the same line of work and the
taxpayer can show a bona fide expense.
</P>
<P>
   As another example, the Tax People teach that the owner of a
home-based business can deduct $5,250 for each child in education
benefits if they employ the child in the business. But among the
many complex rules to qualify for this tax break, is one requiring
that the business first give the same benefit to at least 19
nonfamily employees at a cost of $99,750.
</P>
<P>
   The tax experts warned that while many of the techniques the Tax
People teach may have a patina of legality, they would not survive
an audit because they ignore complex tax rules.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the techniques are similar to some used by big companies
that have been criticized as abusive by Treasury officials, in that
they have no purpose except tax avoidance, as opposed to a
legitimate business purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But even if adherents of the Tax People abuse the rules, they
might get away with it, tax experts say. Congress has cut the
budget for auditing tax returns to historically low levels. For
those who file the kind of tax return that Tax People recommends,
there was only a one in 77 chance of being audited last year, down
from one in 31 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And if a taxpayer is audited, the IRS is more likely to pursue
further the cases of people who do not keep good business records.
Because Tax People teaches members to keep exhaustively detailed
records, even dubious deductions might make it past the IRS simply
because the deductions appear to be documented.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sheldon Cohen, the IRS commissioner during the Johnson
administration, said the IRS has the power to shut down Tax People,
but he doubted it would act.
</P>
<P>
   After examining Tax People literature, Cohen said that if Tax
People had come along in his day ``I would have issued a summons
for the names of everyone who has paid for the system and then we
would have mailed each of them a letter saying that this is not
legitimate, but if you file an amended return, then that will be
the end of it, with no penalties, but if you do not, then we will
come after you.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Charles O. Rossotti, the current tax
commissioner, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tax People is under scrutiny by state officials in Kansas and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, in an interview, confirmed the investigations and said
that state officials suspect, wrongly, that he is running a pyramid
scheme in which an expanding base of recruits pay fees that are
funneled up to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Stovall, the Kansas attorney general, said company records
show that virtually all of those buying the system are trying to
make money selling it to others.
</P>
<P>
   She said her attention was drawn to the company in part because
of complaints by people who said they were lured into paying four
enrollment fees with a promise that doing so would bolster their
earnings as independent marketing associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is illogical for people to buy four or more tax
relief systems unless it is to expand the pyramid,'' Stovall said.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the last six years Kansas authorities have moved
against Cooper and his marketing companies with accusations of
fraudulent and deceptive practices. He twice signed consent
decrees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when Cooper had discovered tax avoidance as a product,
he told marketing associates that he would give each of them 1,000
shares of stock in his company, which he valued at $40 a share now
and a fortune in the near future. Kansas securities regulators
valued the shares at one five-hundredth of a penny each.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was recorded telling the associates that the stock gift
was ``double secret stuff'' that ``cannot be discussed publicly''
and expressing concern about violating securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, in an interview, said he thought his gifts of the stock
were legal. ``I had legal advisers, and I thought it was all
appropriate,'' he said. ``I paid a $10,000 fine, and I am still
giving the stock away.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who join Tax People get a slim booklet and audio tapes
that explain complex tax avoidance strategies in very simple
language.
</P>
<P>
   W. Bradford Murray, a businessman in San Rafael, Calif., is
suing Cooper and Tax People in federal court in Kansas City. Mo.,
for copyright infringement, saying much of the best tax advice in
the Tax People manual was taken verbatim from Murray's work. The
company says it acquired the rights legally through an
intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits to Tax People can also listen in on daily conference
calls with tax preparers and accountants who are affiliated with
the organization and, at the end, can ask questions about their own
tax concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the event a return is audited, Tax People promises that its
``tax dream team'' of tax experts will represent the taxpayer. The
Tax People says it has a 100 percent success rate in audits and
that in 60 percent of the cases the IRS approves additional
reductions in the taxpayer's bill.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting in San Diego of 3,500 of what the company calls
independent marketing associates, Tax People's speakers repeatedly
characterized the ``tax dream team'' as having such prowess that
when the IRS learns who is representing the taxpayer, it quickly
``wilts.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Keith, the senior IRS spokesman, said that ``we decide
cases on the basics of facts and law, not who represents the
taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has not disclosed any documentation of his company's
claim of 100 percent success in audits and getting an increased
refund in 60 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has not set aside any reserves to cover the cost
of future audits. He said in an interview that if the IRS were to
make targets of his clients the company might not have the
resources to fulfill its audit representation promise. ``That's a
risk you take with any business, that they might not be there to
honor the guarantee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit guarantee itself is limited. Not only must the
marketing associate have done exactly as instructed by the Tax
People manual, meticulous records must also have been kept.
</P>
<P>
   The audit representation guarantee ends if the individual stops
paying the $100 monthly fee. Typically, IRS audits begin 18 months
or more after a tax return is filed. Thus an individual who paid
Cooper's company $6,300 over five years and then retired and
stopped paying would have no right to audit representation if his
tax returns were selected later for audit.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Siddons, a San Diego woman who bought audit protection
from Cooper's company, said she could not persuade the company to
represent her last year until she went to the Tax People sales
meetings and loudly declared that the company was not delivering on
its promises. She said Cooper eventually hired someone to represent
her but that she lost her deductions. Other clients say they were
well represented, though one said he had to pay additional taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say Tax People's Web sites make grossly inflated
promises. Many, for example, guarantee $5,000 in tax savings, when
the company actually promises only $5,000 in tax deductions.
``That's a huge difference,'' said Mike Wellman, a Texas tax
accountant who is one of a half-dozen tax professionals who have
sought in an Internet news group to debunk Tax People's statements.
``No one at the company seems to be correcting the false claims by
the marketing agents, but then what incentive does the company have
to police its sales force?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Zehr of Watertown, N.Y., said he paid $1,200 for four
subscriptions because he was told this would make him eligible for
bonus payments if he sold the system to others.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that after contacting the Better Business Bureau in
Kansas he had questions about the company and began calling its
customer-service number to stop further charges on his credit card.
``I could never get through,'' he said, so he canceled his credit
card number to stop further charges.
</P>
<P>
   Zehr said he regarded the Tax People as ``unethical, dishonest
and fraudulent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Nelson of Wichita, Kan., said he, too, could not get the
company to stop charging his credit card $100 a month and the
customer-service line was answered with a recording saying that the
company was so busy processing new orders it did not have anyone
available to process cancellations. Tuesday night, he said, his
money was finally refunded, though his calls were never answered. &QL;

 &HT;    Body beautiful stripped down as athletes pose for risque photos
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would you pose nearly nude?
</P>
<P>
   The question swished through the brain of swimmer Jenny Thompson
in May. The answer: a qualified no.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human body is a beautiful thing,'' said Thompson, owner of
five Olympic gold medals, with more expected to come in Sydney.
``If it's done right ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson cited a teammate who would ``do it in a heartbeat.''
Then she drew a personal line: ``I wouldn't mind posing for the
swimsuit edition'' of Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   SI's Aug. 14 edition is far removed from the knockoff of a
Victoria's Secret catalog that SI sends out in the dead of winter.
But there on page 52 is Thompson wearing red boots and a
form-fitting bottom patterned after the American flag, with her
hands covering her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Her apparent change of heart touched off a debate on whether
athletes should flash excessive American skin.
</P>
<P>
   Olympians can be found in various stages of undress all over the
newsstands. Others grin and bare it on calendars that generate
charitable contributions along with either admiration or
titillation, depending on your take.
</P>
<P>
   America is downright prudish next to Australia, the Olympic host
with the most athletes au natural. Some female soccer players went
the whole nine meters with full-frontal nudity. One magazine
unveiled 29 athletes; another 20 turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just a bare-naked ladies show. The Aussie magazine
co-featured males, as did a Canadian periodical with nine jocks and
jockettes. Such gender equity is rare in the U.S., a notable
exception being cyclist Lance Armstrong, who doffed it all in
Vanity Fair last year while sufficiently obscured by his bike.
</P>
<P>
   The guys tend to be dismissed as harmless exhibitionists, if
that. Women have been accused of playing into the hands of media
inclined to present them as sexual objects.
</P>
<P>
   Some athletes said they agree to photo shoots with no cheesecake
poses in mind. They show up decently clothed. And when the camera
keeps clicking, well, stuff happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media has to be just as responsible (as the athletes),''
said Brandi Chastain, 32, soccer's poster and pin-up girl. ``Jenny
posed for more than two hours, but look at the picture they chose
to run. The same went for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there have been no loud complaints from the subjects about
any finished products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't giving a seductive look,'' Thompson, 27, said. ``I'm
a strong female athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Thompson is a finely toned athlete proud to display
pictorial evidence of her diligent work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the Jenny Thompson photo,'' Chastain said, ``my
first thought was, 'My God, where did she get those thighs?' ``
</P>
<P>
   It was not Chastain's nudity but her underwear that brought the
topic to America's radar screen. When she struck the winning goal
in last year's World Cup finals, she pulled off her jersey to
expose a sports bra that was hardly risque. But some people branded
her as a shameless showgirl.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain offered no apologies, not for her televised
pseudo-striptease or her spread in Gear magazine, where she removed
everything else and replaced it with a few well-situated soccer
balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all must make decisions for ourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also defended her counterparts Down Under doing a female
full monty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Australian team did was absolutely acceptable, a very
gutsy decision,'' Chastain said. ``You can't knock them for that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Chastain acknowledged concerns that the photos
could send mixed messages to impressionable youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is not a one-timer. She teams in a more discreet shot
with Dara Torres, Amy Van Dyken and Georgian Angel Martino, who
failed to qualify for the Games, in Women's Sports &AMP; Fitness.
</P>
<P>
   High jumper Amy Acuff has appeared in Rolling Stone, Maxim,
Esquire and Glamour showing different amounts of flesh. Acuff
organized a calendar of track-and-field Olympians she is Miss July
that includes former Atlanta schoolteacher Tisha Waller, a
high-jumper who did not make the 2000 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a calendar of bimbos,'' Acuff said. ``I think it's
pretty sexist to assume that a woman can't show her body without it
being sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   The skin-is-in movement is explained easily:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most Olympic sports participants need money, and such exposure
can bring another type to companies with available endorsement and
sponsor funds.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic activities tend to attract or produce better bodies than
the more widely appreciated sports. A magazine editor might see an
athlete in the same context as an actor or a musician.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Magazines, which seem to be multiplying like rabbits, are in
an race of sorts. Nakedness generates some buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Once athletes qualify for the U.S. team, they must abide by a
code of conduct. USOC spokesman Mike Moran said: ``No one at this
point considers (posing nude) a violation. It's a personal choice
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the trend coincides with a Games in which some
competitors are covering up for their activity. Many swimmers have
exchanged their skimpy Speedos for full bodysuits designed to
propel them faster through the water. Some extend below the knee,
others all the way to the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   And female beach volleyballers got permission to bend federation
rules, which require a two-piece bikini with low-cut tops and
narrow straps on their hips. In a concession to possible cold
weather in Sydney, players can slip on shorts, one-piece suits,
even leggings.

COMMENTARY: BUSH GIVES NO QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush has lately taken to explaining his economic plans
by pulling out four dollar bills to represent the projected budget
surplus. Two dollars, he explains, will be used to support Social
Security; one to pay for new programs like prescription drug
insurance; and one will be used to cut taxes. ``I think it's fair,
I think it's right that one quarter of the surplus go back to the
people who pay the bills,'' he declared last week.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nice rhetorical device; too bad about the arithmetic. An honest
presentation, using numbers from Bush's own economists, would
allocate not $1 but $1.40 to tax cuts, only 45 cents to new
programs _ and would admit that he got 25 of those 45 cents by
violating his own party's promise not to touch either the Social
Security or Medicare surpluses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am not making this up. The Congressional Budget Office
projects a surplus over the next decade, including Medicare and
Social Security, of $4.6 trillion. As I pointed out last month,
this is unrealistically optimistic, but never mind. One quarter of
that surplus is $1.15 trillion. Meanwhile, Bush's economists
concede that his tax plan will reduce the surplus by $1.6 trillion.
So representing the cost of the tax cut by just one of those four
dollar bills is a $450 billion misstatement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And on the other side, Bush's proposed spending on new programs
is far lower than that other dollar bill would suggest _ about 10
percent of the surplus, not 25 percent. Indeed, some of Bush's
penny-pinching comes as a shock. With all his huffing and puffing
about America's military decline, who would have thought that he
proposes to increase defense spending by less than 2 percent? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Bush remains convinced that he can play by his own
rules _ that it doesn't matter whether what he says is true, as
long as he lays on the charm. But the story of the bogus bills also
reminds us just how bad an idea that tax cut _ originally offered,
say the political reporters, to ward off Steve Forbes _ really is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After all, Bush's routine with the dollar bills isn't just a
piece of stagecraft. It's his way of saying that there's plenty of
money to play with: That he can secure the future of retirees, give
a big tax cut and still have plenty left over _ one dollar out of
four! _ for popular new programs. But that just isn't so, as Bush's
own plan demonstrates.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that we agree (as both parties have) that tax cuts and
new spending should not cut into the Social Security and Medicare
surpluses _ the surpluses those trust funds are now running to
prepare for the demographic deluge, the time when baby boomers stop
paying in and start collecting benefits. That, even using those
unrealistic surplus projections, immediately takes $2.40 of Bush's
four dollars off the table, leaving at most $1.60 to be divided
between tax cuts and new spending. And a prudent plan would set
aside a good part of that $1.60, both because the surplus
projections are probably too optimistic and because our current
peace and prosperity aren't guaranteed to last. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has already promised to give away $1.40 in tax cuts.
What that leaves him for new spending is not the whole dollar he
waves at his audiences, but at most 20 cents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And that isn't enough. Now that Bush has caved on the issue of
prescription drug insurance _ though he still claims that he can
get it at bargain prices _ the additional spending proposed in his
plan amounts to about 45 cents out of his four dollars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How does he find the extra 25 cents? Through selective
absent-mindedness. Congressional Republicans have solemnly pledged
to put both Social Security and Medicare in ``lock boxes,'' that
is, not to count their surpluses as available funds. But while
Bush's number-crunchers ostentatiously put the Social Security
surplus aside, Medicare somehow goes unmentioned.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that because of that tax cut, Bush's economic
plan cannot be both coherent and honest _ and in fact it is
neither.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what is Bush thinking as he stands up there with those
dollars in his hands? Does he know that he is saying things that
aren't so? Or is he so unfamiliar with his own economic plan that
he thinks he is telling the truth? Either way, shame on him.

CALIFORNIA SCHOOL TESTS GET POOR MARKS FOR ACCURACY 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza, batting .332, could win this year's Most
Valuable Player award. He has been good every year, with a .330
career average, twice a runner-up for MVP and a member of each
All-Star team since his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets reward Piazza for this high achievement, at the rate of
$13 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the team decided to pay him based not on overall
performance but on how he hit during one arbitrarily chosen week?
How well do one week's at-bats describe the ability of a true .330
hitter?
</P>
<P>
   Not very. Last week Piazza batted only .200. But in the second
week of August he batted .538. If you picked a random week this
season, you would have only a 7-in-10 chance of choosing one in
which he hit .250 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Are standardized-test scores, on which many schools rely heavily
to make promotion or graduation decisions, more indicative of true
ability than a ballplayer's weekly average?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. David Rogosa, a professor of educational statistics
at Stanford University, has calculated the ``accuracy'' of tests
used in California to abolish social promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, Rogosa says, a fourth-grade student whose ``true''
reading score is exactly at grade level (the 50th percentile). The
chances are better than even (58 percent) that this student will
score either above the 55th percentile or below the 45th on any one
test.
</P>
<P>
   Results for students at other levels of true performance are
also surprisingly inconsistent. So if students are held back,
required to attend summer school or denied diplomas largely because
of a single test, many will be punished unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   About half of fourth-grade students held back for scores below
the 30th percentile on a typical reading test will actually have
``true'' scores above that point. On any particular test, nearly 7
percent of students with true scores at the 40th percentile will
likely fail, scoring below the 30th percentile.
</P>
<P>
   Are Americans prepared to require large numbers of students to
repeat a grade when they deserve promotion, permitting an injustice
attributable to measurement error?
</P>
<P>
   Rogosa's analysis is straightforward. He has simply converted
technical reliability information from test publishers (Harcourt
Educational Measurement, in this case) to more understandable
``accuracy'' guides.
</P>
<P>
   Test publishers calculate reliability by analyzing thousands of
student tests to estimate chances that students who answer some
questions correctly will also answer others correctly. Because some
students at any performance level will miss questions that most
students at that level get right, test makers can estimate the
reliability of each question and of an entire test.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, districts and states use tests marketed as having
high reliability. Yet few policy makers understand that seemingly
high reliability assures only rough accuracy _ for example, that
true 80th percentile students will almost always have higher scores
than true 20th percentile students.
</P>
<P>
   But when test results are used for high-stakes purposes like
promotion or graduation decisions, there should be a different
concern: How well do they identify students who are truly below a
cutoff point like the 30th percentile? As Rogosa has shown, the
administering of a single test may do a poor job of this.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, there has not yet been a wave of lawsuits by
parents of children penalized largely because of a single test
score. As more parents learn about tests' actual accuracy,
litigation regarding high-stakes decisions is bound to follow.
Districts and states will then have to abandon an unfair reliance
on single tests to evaluate students.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Piazza comes to bat, he may face a pitcher who fools
him more easily than most pitchers do, or fools him more easily on
that day. Piazza may not have slept well the night before, the
lights may bother him, or he may be preoccupied by a problem at
home. On average, over a full season, the distractions do not
matter much, and the Mets benefit from his overall ability.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when a student takes a test, performance is affected
by random events. He may have fought with his sister that morning.
A test item may stimulate daydreams not suggested by items in
similar tests, or by the same test on a different day. His energy
level may be lower than usual. Despite a teacher's warning to eat a
good breakfast, he may not have done so.
</P>
<P>
   If students took tests over and over, average accuracy would
improve, just as Mike Piazza's full-season batting average more
accurately reflects his hitting prowess. But school is not
baseball; if students took tests every day, there would be no time
left for learning.
</P>
<P>
   So to make high-stakes decisions, like whether students should
be promoted or attend summer school, giving great importance to a
single test is not only bad policy but extraordinarily unfair.
Courts are unlikely to permit it much longer.

itself was the financial capital of the world's largest economy.
Now J.P. Morgan _ the last of those six to stay independent _ is
about to be bought, in the latest example of a trend toward
financial concentration. If the planned takeover by Chase Manhattan
is completed, it will bring together four of the six biggest banks
in New York, circa 1980. And yet the combination reflects weakness
as much as strength, as both institutions seek growth in areas
where their previous efforts have not been especially successful.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has shaken the pervasive view of voters
that he was not particularly likable. Gore is now as highly
regarded as Gov. George W. Bush on matters of character, leadership
and overall personal popularity, the latest New York Times/CBS News
Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Now that public opinion has settled somewhat since the
Democratic convention nearly four weeks ago, and voters say they
are far more interested in the race, the survey makes clear that
Gore's enhanced fortunes are deeper and more sustained than a
post-convention afterglow.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has achieved substantial gains among women, independent
voters and those from middle income groups. While Bush's support
has diminished somewhat overall, he still retains the overwhelming
support of men, Midwesterners and Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows that the presidential race is neck-and-neck, and
that Bush and Gore are facing off in the tightest competition just
after Labor Day in 20 years. If the election were held today, 42
percent of registered voters said they would back Gore and 39
percent said they would vote for Bush. Four percent said they would
back Ralph Nader, the Green party nominee, and 2 percent would
favor Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has gained on Bush in recent weeks, but not to a degree
that is statistically significant. The nationwide telephone poll,
conducted Saturday through Monday with 843 registered voters, has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   And there was some good news for Bush in the numbers.
Forty-seven percent of Gore's supporters said they had reservations
about him; only 38 percent of Bush's backers registered concerns
about their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most pronounced shift in the survey is that the
public's perceptions of Gore have markedly improved. For months,
Americans said they found Gore's issue positions more appealing
than Bush's, but the vice president's most persistent problem was
that voters said they had significant misgivings about him on
issues of character.
</P>
<P>
   Now, while Bush has held his own in retaining impressive
favorability ratings, Gore's favorability ratings have increased
substantially _ to the point where the two men are now equally
popular. Forty-four percent of voters say they have a favorable
view of Gore, while 29 percent have an unfavorable view. Gore has
not done that well by this measure for years. In recent months, the
public either had more negative views of Gore than positive ones,
or, more recently, given him positive ratings that equaled his
negatives.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking example of how perceptions have transformed,
voters no longer view Bush as the runaway winner in the November
election. They are now split on whether Gore or Bush will make it
to the White House. As recently as two months ago, Bush led Gore on
this question by more than 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are also more confident in Gore's ability to deal wisely
with an international crisis. Forty-nine percent said they were
confident in Gore, a gain from 43 percent in a Times/CBS poll in
July. Bush's standing on that issue has remained steady at 46
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While 63 percent of the public thinks Gore cares about the needs
and problems of ordinary people _ a figure that has not changed
since July _ Bush has shown some slippage. Forty-nine percent say
that of Bush cares about ordinary people, a decline from 55 percent
in July.
</P>
<P>
   It is not altogether clear what has prompted the more kindly
feelings toward Gore. But in follow-up interviews Tuesday, many
voters who now back Gore said they were impressed by what they saw
at the Democratic convention. Repeatedly, they said, Gore seemed to
be coming into his own _ and moving out of President Clinton's
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the convention, he did a better job of concealing anything
that was negative, if he had anything to begin with,'' said Wilma
Akins, 69, a retired office manager in Statesboro, Ga. ``He made me
feel hopeful and optimistic about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Taylor, 46, a grocery store manager in Philadelphia, said,
``He's become stronger and seems to be speaking out more since the
convention. He's becoming his own man now, and he's not as stiff as
he once was.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is still not a single overwhelming issue that
defines the race _ as the economy has in the past _ the survey
found that the closest contender this year was health care, and the
related matter of Medicare. Nearly two-thirds of voters said the
high cost of prescription drugs for the elderly was quite important
to them personally.
</P>
<P>
   Voters said they thought the government _ not insurance
companies _ would do a better job of providing coverage to the
elderly for prescription drugs. Gore was seen as more likely than
Bush to succeed in reducing the cost of prescription drugs for the
elderly. Bush has proposed allowing private insurance companies to
compete for Medicare clients, while Gore has proposed adding a
subsidy for prescription drug coverage to the current Medicare
plan.

</P>
<P>
   While Bush has recently accused the administration of presiding
over a weakening of the military, the issue did not register much
with voters. And many seemed confused about the state of the
nation's missile defense capability.
</P>
<P>
   Half the voters agreed with Bush's assertion that the military
has weakened under Clinton, and just under half said it had either
strengthened or stayed the same over the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But half the voters said they thought that the United States had
a missile defense system, although it does not; only 28 percent
knew that the country does not one. One explanation may be that
nearly seven in 10 respondents said they had not heard or read much
about the debate over proposals for a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, four in 10 voters said it was important that the United
States try to build a missile defense system; two-thirds said they
favored such an effort even though the government has already spent
$60 billion trying to develop one.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has repeatedly called upon Gore to elevate the
discourse and not sink to harsh commercials, voters gave the vice
president higher marks for his advertising campaign. Two thirds of
voters said Gore was spending more time explaining what he would do
as president than he was spending attacking Bush; half said the
same of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of voters have seen advertisements for Bush,
and they are divided over whether they mostly explain things about
Bush or attack Gore. About a third have seen advertisements for
Gore. But those viewers, decisively, say Gore's commercials explain
things about Gore rather than attack Bush.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the voter interviews, many said Gore's selection of Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut spiced up the ticket, especially
when Lieberman was compared with Dick Cheney, who even many
Republicans say has not been as beneficial to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move to choose Lieberman took a lot of guts and was
brilliant,'' said Nati Gottlieb, 53, an insurance salesman in
Philadelphia. ``That move stopped Bush dead in his tracks and
started his current momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such comments, the poll reinforced the accepted wisdom
that running mate choices do not matter much. Cheney and Lieberman
are each well liked _ and each are about twice as likely to be
viewed favorably as unfavorably. But most people still have no
opinion of them. And more than half of voters said the selections
did not make them any more, or less, inclined to vote for Bush or
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Voters did not sound exercised about the frequent references
that Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, has made to his faith. Voters said
it was perfectly appropriate for candidates to discuss their
religious beliefs, and a majority said none of the Democratic or
Republican candidates had used their religion improperly.
</P>
<P>
   On the topic of televised debates, a subject that has dominated
much of the campaign news in recent weeks, 49 percent said they
believed Gore and Bush want to debate; 21 percent said only Gore
wanted to debate and 10 percent said only Bush wanted to take part.
Eighty-six percent said the bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates should hold the events; the Bush campaign had earlier
sought other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This is only the third time in 40 years that a presidential
contest has been this close immediately after Labor Day, and that
may be why more voters _ 53 percent _ now say the race is
interesting; 39 percent say it is dull.
</P>
<P>
   A continuation of such interest could spur turnout in the range
of 50 percent to 55 percent, slightly higher than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the contest between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan was
a dead heat at this point, with Reagan pulling ahead only over the
final weekend. In 1960, the match-up between Richard M. Nixon and
John F. Kennedy was equally tight at this stage, and stayed that
way until Kennedy's narrow victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be one of the best horse races we've had in the
country since Kennedy and Nixon,'' said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald,
R-Ill. ``The Bush campaign is going to have to do most everything
right between now and November to win. And it will not be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster, put it this way: ``This race
is shaping up to be more like Kennedy-Nixon than anything else,
mostly because of the closeness but also because of the dynamics of
an incumbent hanging on with the country in pretty good shape but
against a tough challenger.''

 &HT;    Rats!
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. - In a high-stakes political game where success is
measured in the amount of time spent on message, Tuesday was
another time out for Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The day's centerpiece was to have been Bush's chat with husband
and wife cancer patients whose financial tale provided support for
his health-care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush and aides spent much of the day explaining why the
word ``rats'' flashed on the screen during a Republican television
ad and denying that Bush is dyslexic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous,'' a Bush aide groaned as it became clear
the candidate again was not in control of the message during a
crucial week in which the GOP ticket hopes to get poll numbers
moving in its direction.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, now dubbed the ``rats'' ad, was a product of the
Republican National Committee. It questioned Democratic nominee Al
Gore's health-care plan. In a section charging that bureaucrats
would be in control, the word ``rats'' appears in large letters for
a fraction of a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' Gore said Tuesday in
Middletown, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said neither Gore, nor anybody who had not
slowed
</P>
<P>
   the ad and frozen the frame, has seen the offending word.
</P>
<P>
   The word appeared in one frame of 900 in the 30-second ad,
making it unreadable in real time, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes
said. She said it appeared as the result of a technique called
``visual drumbeat'' in which words and parts of words flash on the
screen. You can't spell bureaucrats without rats, Hughes said,
that's why those four letters popped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no effort in this ad to have any subliminal
message,'' Hughes said. ``At the risk of mixing rodent metaphors,
I'd say the Democrats are making a mountain out of a molehill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Darrell West of Brown University, an expert on political
advertising, said, ``The word 'rats' is so carefully superimposed.
It's not like it just randomly appears on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign insisted it knew nothing about the ``rats''
problem until questioned about it Monday night by The New York
Times. However, Fox News Channel reported on it during an Aug. 28
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   As the controversy simmered, Hughes, aboard the Bush campaign
plane en route to St. Louis from Orlando, rephrased the key
question when asked if Bush's day had been ruined by having to
discuss the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the American people be better served if the Democrats
chose to focus on the issues as opposed to keeping the focus on
bizarre allegations like this?'' she said. ``Yes, I think they
would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush got knocked off message when he inadvertently
let a microphone pick up a disparaging remark about a New York
Times reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's time off-message Tuesday began early and chewed up
crucial seconds during a brief interview on ABC's ``Good Morning
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns take bizarre twists,'' said Bush, denying a
nefarious plot to link Gore and rats _ though Hughes later noted
that the word Democrats also ends with rats.
</P>
<P>
   Should the ad be pulled from the air, interviewer Diane Sawyer
asked, unaware that Tuesday was the final day of its scheduled
two-week run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea, Diane. I'm just telling you I don't think
there is a plot to try to put subliminal messages in the people's
minds,'' said Bush, eager to get back on message. ``The most
important thing is to point out the differences between what I
believe and what the vice president believes when it comes to
important issues like prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took another shot at getting back on message later Tuesday
when he stood at the Orlando airport, as he does at every airport
arrival, with a local family he claims would fare better under his
tax plan than under Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   But reporters wanted to talk about rats and dyslexia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced this was not intentional,'' Bush said of the
rats controversy. ``We don't need to play cute politics. I'm going
to win this election based on issues. And one frame out of 900 is
hardly a conspiracy, it seems to me ... I want to make it clear to
people that the idea of putting subliminal messages into ads is
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Bush, whose penchant for mispronunciation has
become well-known _ subliminal came out as ``subliminable'' several
times Tuesday _ the questioning turned to a Vanity Fair article
speculating that he might be dyslexic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing when you run for president. I've been standing
for 54 years as a person. I didn't realize I had dyslexia until her
article came out,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I haven't,'' he said when asked if he has been tested.
``Thank you for asking. I appreciate your concern.''
</P>
<P>
   After months on the campaign trail, Bush has become adept _ if
not always graceful _ at answering off-message questions with
on-message responses. An immigration question, for example, can
lead to an education answer.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no message to swerve to, when Bush was asked on
``Good Morning America'' about the Vanity Fair magazine profile
that raised the possibility that the Bush family has a history of
dyslexia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering if you were ever tested for dyslexia,'' Sawyer
asked Bush, who said he had not read the article but branded it as
``one of those stories that just kind of rambles around guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And no, I'm not dyslexic. That's all I can tell you,'' said
Bush, who then moved to the morning's final nationally televised
question.
</P>
<P>
   What's the hardest lesson you've learned on the campaign trail?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be patient,'' said Bush, a candidate banking on the theory
that, eventually, message will triumph.

   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Inside a modern, secular private school
here, the first-grade boys and girls stuffed their Pokemon and
Barbie backpacks into their cubbies and gathered on the blue rug
for story time.
</P>
<P>
   Their 24-year-old teacher, Nesrin Alayan, kneeled, clasped her
hands and began, in a singsong voice, to tell ``the tale of a
joyful home called Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale begins, she told the children, with a large, happy
family eating and laughing inside their house. One day, she said,
``some people'' come to the door with rifles and pistols, open fire
on the house and seize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We the Palestinian family are forced out into the cold,'' she
said. ``And then we spend many, many years trying to get back into
our house. In order to do so, we start throwing stones. And then
people are killed. Do you boys and girls know the word intifada?
That's when the world starts paying attention to our tale.''
</P>
<P>
   With her story, which concludes on the ``path of peace,'' Alayan
was improvising a setup for the opening lesson in a new first-grade
reader, the very first official reader written by and for
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson deals with the symbols of the new Palestinian
identity _ the flag, the passport _ and it is part of a fledgling
home-grown curriculum that was introduced last week in first- and
sixth-grade classrooms throughout the Palestinian-ruled
territories.
</P>
<P>
   For decades Palestinians in the West Bank have used Jordanian
textbooks and those in Gaza have relied on Egyptian ones, making
for a disjointed and ultimately borrowed educational program. As
part of the process of building institutions for an emerging
Palestinian state, the Palestinian Authority, with money from
European countries, is trying to create from scratch a genuine
Palestinian curriculum, starting with two grades as a pilot effort.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Palestinian nation has not yet emerged, the
curriculum is a delicate work in progress, fodder for criticism
from within and without.
</P>
<P>
   With peace negotiations unresolved, it is hard to know how
Alayan's tale will end. Her principal, Maha Shihadi, said it was
almost impossible to teach geography. The regional map, as far as
every Palestinian is concerned, cannot be drawn before borders are
determined as part of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   How, Shihadi asked, can the children illustrate Palestine? She
wondered if they should make cutouts, like snowflakes, to portray
the unconnected parcels of land that now constitute the
Palestinian-ruled territories. The textbook writers opted for what
they call ``the historic map of Palestine,'' the map of 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Israel is not pictured. Tel Aviv does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   This greatly upsets those Israelis, mostly rightists, who
monitor Palestinian media and literature, documenting hostility
toward Israel and Jews. They say it betrays the whole spirit of the
peace effort for the Palestinians to generate a new educational
curriculum that, for starters, ignores Israel on maps.
</P>
<P>
   Salah Yassin, the director general of curriculum development for
the Palestinian Authority, defends this omission as calculated and
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complain to the education minister!'' he joked. Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, holds that portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Yassin said Israel, like Palestine, remained undefined. ``That
is what these peace talks are about, no? When the crisis is solved,
we will clearly mark: `This is Palestine. This is Israel.' But for
now we educators are not going to get involved in politics. The
texts are, by necessity, works in progress, and they will be
modified.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian educators think it is significant that
Palestinian students will crack open textbooks saturated with local
images and references for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Math books ask students to calculate the distance between
Bethlehem and Nablus in the West Bank, not Amman and Petra in
Jordan. Arabic texts feature poems and essays by Palestinians and
reading comprehension passages about the Palestinian olive oil and
stone industries. Yassin also cited ``Mary and Jesus'' as examples
of Palestinian personalities in the new books.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth-grade books, Palestinian history is presented not
in linear narrative form but sketchily.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Israel is explained tersely as ``the Israeli
occupation of 1948,'' which with the assistance of Britain
``destroyed most of the Palestinian villages and cities and kicked
the Palestinian inhabitants from their lands.''
</P>
<P>
   In a section on the Palestine Liberation Organization, its
``liberation army'' is mentioned, as well as the return to the West
Bank and Gaza of its ``fighters'' after the Oslo interim peace
agreement was signed in 1993. Terrorism is not mentioned, and Oslo
is not explained.
</P>
<P>
   A chapter on ``Palestinian problems'' includes a grab bag of
issues, including high unemployment, a brain drain, the Israeli
settlement expansion policy and the ``Judaization'' of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Text blocks tend to be short, followed by suggested activities _
like inviting a Palestine Liberation Organization official to class
_ or fill-in-the-blank exercises:
</P>
<P>
   Palestine in the 20th century was under (blank) occupation and
(blank) occupation.

 &HT;    RENO 'TROUBLED' BY PATTERN OF FEDERAL DEATH CASES
 &HT;    Attn: Texas papers.
 &HT;    By BRUCE HIGHT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Tuesday she is
``sorely troubled'' by a Justice Department study that shows that
blacks and Hispanics are ``overrepresented'' in federal death
penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that U.S. attorneys in a few states,
including Texas, seem to produce a high number of death penalty
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey today finds that minorities are overrepresented in
the federal death penatly system, as both victims and defendants,
relative to the general population,'' Reno said at a news
conference. ``Sadly, the same is true of the entire criminal
justice system, both state and federal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno rejected calls for a moratorium on federal death
penalty cases. She said that minorities were also over-represented
among the victims and cited ``social ills and harsh conditions''
that have had a disproportionate effect on minorities.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he would consult with Reno on the study,
but acknowledged that the data raised questions because ``we're
supposed to have a uniform law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a system begun in 1995, all U.S. attorneys must submit
cases in which the defendant is eligible for the death penalty to
Reno for her review. Of 682 such cases since 1995, U.S. attorneys
recommended in 183 that she actually seek the death penalty, and
she gave approval in 159 cases.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that of the 183 recommendations to seek the
death penalty, 26 percent involved white defendants, 44 percent
blacks and 21 percent Hispanics. The rest were of some other group.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed that about half of those 183 cases came
from just five states, including Texas, plus Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to concerns about the disproportionate number of
minority group members, critics noted that many of the death
penalty recommendations were coming from U.S. attorneys in
relatively few states.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 183 cases, the study showed, the four U.S. attorney's
offices in Texas recommended seeking the death penalty in 14 cases.
Of these, two defendants were white, nine were black and three were
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. attorneys in Virginia during the same period recommended
seeking the death penalty for 25 defendants, while those in Puerto
Rico and New York each submitted 14 cases. U.S. attorneys in
Missouri had 13 such recommendations, and Tennessee had 10.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that while she is concerned about the figures, she had
not detected any bias and saw no reason to call a moratorium on
federal death penalty cases. She said the guilt of those sentenced
was not in question, and that minority group members also were
disproportionately represented among the victims of those sentenced
to death.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, there were 590 victims in the 183 cases
in which the U.S. attorney recommended the death penalty. Of those
victims, 34 percent were white, 58 percent were black and 5 percent
were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The number includes the 168 who died in the bombing of the
federal building at Oklahoma City. Timothy McVeigh, who is white,
has been sentenced to die in that case.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that of the 19 defendants sentenced to die
by a federal jury, six _ five black and one Hispanic _ were Texas
cases. The federal government has not actually executed anyone
since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it were chance that so many on federal death row were
from Texas, Reno said she would ``have to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the state of Texas has 445 convicted defendants
on its death row, according to the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice. Of those 445, 36 percent are white and 64 percent are
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she has asked the National Institute of Justice to
solicit research proposals on the question of why murder cases get
diverted from a state to the federal system and ``the factors
accounting for the present geographic pattern of submissions by the
U.S. attorney's offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, speaking at the same news
conference, resisted a suggestion that the study indicates the
federal system is arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can draw the conclusion that you have that
the system is arbitrary based on the numbers that we've seen so
far,'' Holder said.

 RAMALLAH, West Bank: (blank) occupation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The correct answers are British and Israeli, omitting what some
Palestinians consider to have been periods of Ottoman and Jordanian
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   For much of Israel's history its textbooks were far from neutral
themselves, sticking closely to a heroic Zionist narrative and
avoiding any Palestinian perspective. Starting last year, shortly
after Israel's 51st birthday, a revised curriculum began using the
term Palestinian freely and referring to a Palestinian people and a
nationalist movement.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to introduce greater historical detail to the story of
Israel's founding, new textbooks said that in 1948 some
Palestinians were expelled from their villages and that some fled
because they feared Israeli soldiers. But the new books are used
only in the mainstream secular school system, which serves about 60
percent of schoolchildren. And since some secular Israeli educators
consider them offensive, they are not used throughout the system.
</P>
<P>
   Yassin emphasizes that the first- and sixth-grade books must be
seen as part of what will eventually be a complete first- through
12th-grade curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot be judged in isolation, he said. Over the next four
years, the Palestinian government intends to phase in the remaining
grades and introduce broader educational reforms: more creative
teaching, less rote learning, compulsory English starting from the
first grade, third-language electives including Hebrew, technology
classes.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many inside and outside the Palestinian world
anxiously wondering what shape the new state will take, the books
were pounced on last week, and not just by Israeli rightists.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, too, have been scouring them for signs of how the
government is managing the delicate question of forging a national
identity from so many strands: the West Bank and Gaza, Muslims and
Christians, religious and secular. And academics are scrutinizing
them to evaluate the educational standards they set.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the Palestinian newspaper Al Quds, a local
professor condemned the new first-grade reader for underestimating
Palestinian children. Every Palestinian child knows and understands
the camel, a part of the landscape here, ``the cargo ship of the
desert,'' he said. Why, he asked, did the textbook writers feel
compelled to concoct a story about a camel and a lion that
describes the camel as ``the king of the jungle?''
</P>
<P>
   At the private school here, which is called Al Mustaqbal, or the
Future School, a seasoned science teacher expressed disappointment
with the new sixth-grade science book. After conducting a lively
anatomy class on joints, the teacher, Dalal Kasabri, said she had
greatly departed from the text because it was overly simplistic,
unimaginative and in some cases inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there are different levels in the West Bank and
Gaza, in public schools and private ones like this one,'' she said.
``But we should be setting high standards for our children and our
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The illustration for a civics book lesson on tolerance shows a
sheik and a priest shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   To the disappointment of Israeli critics, who were hoping that
the new Palestinian textbooks would preach tolerance for Jews, too,
the books look inward only, where Palestinian educators say a lot
of work must be done. As part of an interfaith effort, they also
produced textbooks on Christianity, which will be used by Christian
children during the period when their Muslim classmates study
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Alayan's class, the children were examining one little
girl's shiny new Palestinian passport. The young teacher, her face
shining, asked the children how they could use their new documents,
their new badges of Palestinian identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teacher, teacher,'' one boy called out, leaping with his
outstretched arm into the air. ``To go to America!''

A PROPOSED MERGER SIGNALS PASSING OF SWASHBUCKLING ERA ON WALL
STREET
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass.)  (Skedded earlier as DRESDNER-WASSERSTEIN) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan Bank captured the
spotlight on Tuesday, a smaller proposed union signaled the passing
of another era on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co. is in advanced talks to be acquired by
Dresdner Bank of Germany, a person close to those discussions said.
If the two can come to terms on price _ said to be $1.2 billion to
$1.5 billion _ a deal could be announced in three to five days, the
person said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an agreement would end the reknowned firm that embodied the
swashbuckling style of dealmaking celebrated in the 1980s. It was
then that Wall Street bankers were storied media stars, reveling in
a media world captivated by the rough-and-tumble business of
hostile takeovers. Bruce Wasserstein, along with his then partner,
Joseph Perella, made their names at First Boston, which was later
acquired by Credit Suisse. It seemed that there was almost no deal
without them, including Texaco's takeover of Getty Oil and the sale
of Beatrice Cos.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the two took a core of talented bankers with them and
set up shop as Wasserstein Perella. From the start it was a dynamic
team. Wasserstein, colleagues say, is a numbers whiz with the
ability to map out the maneuvers of a hostile takeover from memory.
He is a gruff, intimidating negotiator who earned the nickname
``Bid 'em Up Bruce'' for his ability to extract the highest price
from a suitor. But his reputation suffered after the hostile
takeover of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis, a deal in which he was
said in the book ``Barbarians at the Gate'' to have leaked
sensitive information to the press.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Wasserstein hoped to fashion himself after Felix
Rohatyn, the Lazard Freres dealmaker who went on to become the U.S.
ambassador to France, said one person who asked not to be named.
Not surprisingly, Wasserstein talked with Lazard in the past about
acquiring the firm, but those talks faltered over price, said
people involved in those talks. Wasserstein did not return calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Perella, say colleagues, was always the more affable, a
charismatic leader, liked by chief executives and the staff. But
the partnership, which was so successful at First Boston, grew
strained at Wasserstein Perella. In particular, the two clashed
over the direction their investment boutique would take and what
private investments it would make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marriage is a complex one,'' Perella told The Boston Globe
in 1990. ``Sometimes you hate your wife. Sometimes you love her.
The differences are often reconcilable.'` In this case, they were
not.
</P>
<P>
   Perella left Wasserstein in 1993 for Morgan Stanley, where he
became managing director in the investment banking department and
was later named head of that division. Despite Perella's protests,
former colleagues said, Wasserstein kept the Perella name on the
door. Perella has thrived at Morgan, spending hours with clients
and mentoring younger bankers there, leaving the day-to-day
operations to a colleague, Terry Meguid.
</P>
<P>
   But Wasserstein thrived, too. And indeed if Wasserstein's firm
gets the astounding price being discussed for the investment
advisory business, he could net as much as $750 million because he
owns more than 50 percent of the company, said a person close to
the discussions. The investment boutique is in a good place to
negotiate, particularly because bankers there are very familiar
with Dresdner's business. Wasserstein Perella helped advise
Commerzbank of Germany on its failed merger with Dresdner. This is
Dresdner's third try at a deal this year, having failed to close a
planned merger with Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   If Dresdner's talks with Wasserstein _ talks reported on Tuesday
by The Wall Street Journal _ bear fruit, the German bank will get
the long sought presence in the United States it needs to compete
on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just about mergers,'' said Richard Strauss, a
Goldman Sachs analyst. ``It is any business generated from those
transactions to help them grow,'' such as initial public offerings
of stock and bond deals.
</P>
<P>
   One person involved in the transaction said Wasserstein would
probably be named a vice chairman of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson,
while Frank Biondi, who is the chief executive of Wasserstein and
who has been there since the beginning, would probably become
co-head of investment banking with a Dresdner official.

WAVERING SENATORS FEELING PRESSURE ON CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Corporate leaders and several of President
Clinton's cabinet officers intensified pressure on wavering
senators on Tuesday to reject an amendment that could jeopardize
passage this year of a trade bill with China.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate girds for a crucial vote on the measure this week,
supporters of legislation to establish permanent normal trading
relations with China are pressing for a bill free of amendments.
Those supporters say there is not enough time before Election Day
to reconcile an amended Senate bill with the version that the House
passed in May.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House meeting with congressional leaders on Tuesday,
Clinton urged speedy approval of an unamended bill. The measure is
one of his top remaining foreign policy goals and a necessary step
for American companies to benefit fully from a deal reached last
year by the United States and China that paves the way for China's
entry into the World Trade Organization. That 135-member trade
group sets rules for global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an amendment sponsored by Sens. Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.) and Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) that would impose
sanctions on Chinese companies if they were caught exporting
nuclear, chemical, biological weapons and long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers, Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, and
the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, began
telephoning senators on Tuesday, arguing that the amendment would
not only imperil the trade bill, but would also actually hamper
American efforts to combat the spread of sophisticated weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides negotiated the timing of votes. Senators could take
up Thompson's amendment on Wednesday or Thursday. Final passage of
the overall bill, which has overwhelming support, could occur as
early as Friday or as late as next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   China will enter the WTO no matter how the Senate votes. But
without Congress' blessing, Beijing could withhold some of the
trade benefits, including lower tariffs, from the American farmers
and companies that it will extend to other members in the trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
warned retribution against senators who support the
Thompson-Torricelli measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should this vote get tangled up in the politics of nuclear
proliferation and other amendments to the extent that it might not
be passed,'' Donohue said, ``I think that would have a very serious
political implication for those who were a party to that action.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators easily dispatched several other amendments on Tuesday,
including those on prison labor and human rights in China, as well
as subsidies from Beijing to Chinese companies. But on the floor
and in news conferences, the focus was on the Thompson-Torricelli
amendment. ``This is  &UR; the &LR;  vote on PNTR,'' Sen. Max Baucus
(D-Mont.) said as he used the bill's abbreviation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, stated
that opponents ``have the votes to defeat Sen. Thompson's
amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Thompson acknowledged that he faced an uphill battle.
``We've always known it was going to be a tough vote,'' Thompson
told reporters. ``A lot of people are saying they would like to
vote for it. But since it is on PNTR, they're afraid it will
complicate PNTR''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the measure was necessary to clamp down on
Chinese exports of sophisticated weaponry to Iran, Libya, North
Korea and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is especially troubling about the Chinese activities is
that this sensitive assistance is going to the most dangerous
nations in the most volatile areas of the world,'' said Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the amendment scoffed at fears that amending the bill
would doom the larger bill this year. ``To say we cannot amend a
bill that has been passed by the House would be the height of
irresponsibility,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   But amendment critics, including farm-state Republicans, said it
was senseless to jeopardize a trade bill that would lower barriers
to China's vast markets. ``Approval for this bill will keep the
United States economically and diplomatically engaged with
one-fifth of the world's population,'' Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan.,
said. ``I cannot support a redundant and counterproductive
amendment that would effectively kill this legislation.''

 &HT;    FCC chair pokes fun at Baby Bell maneuvers
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - In a speech to a trade conference Tuesday, the
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission criticized
regional phone companies like BellSouth, and then went off to meet
with the company's top executive.
</P>
<P>
   At the Voice on the Net conference, Chairman William Kennard
poked fun at what he said was the legal-centric way the regional
Bells had responded to demands that they open their local networks
to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this behavior `regulatory capitalism,''' Kennard said.
``Regulatory capitalism is when companies invest in lawyers,
lobbyists and politicians, instead of plant, people and customer
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard left after the speech to meet with BellSouth Chairman
and Chief Executive F. Duane Ackerman to be briefed on BellSouth's
preparations for its long-delayed request to enter the
long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've met in the past, and it's not unusual when they are in
the same city for them to have lunch,'' said BellSouth spokesman
Jeff Battcher.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has failed in both Louisiana and South Carolina to
transform local endorsement into FCC approval. In the meantime,
Verizon _ the former Bell Atlantic _ has been granted the right to
offer long-distance in New York, and SBC has won the right in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, BellSouth and various rivals have slogged through
years of hearings before the state Public Service Commission since
the Telecommunications Act of 1996 set the rules for entering the
market. BellSouth's application in Georgia repeatedly has been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the request will come in mid-November at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Local phone companies are required to ``unbundle'' the pieces of
their network, leasing portions of the system to rivals at
reasonable prices. But Kennard said it had been jokingly suggested
to him that ``instead of unbundling monopoly networks for
competitors, we should unbundle some lawyers for them. You know,
there may be something to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, praised as ``a good friend'' by conference organizer
Jeff Pulver, said he opposes unnecessary Internet regulation,
including the trend toward using it for phone calls. ``I will
practice the high-tech Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Voice on the Net trade show and conference continues through
Thursday at the Cobb Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Arbogast, a Microsoft vice president, told the several
thousand attendees that the world is only starting to move into the
mobile era. He said that while there are phones, various digital
assistants and desktop computers, as well as a host of different
features from messaging to e-mail to conversation, ``The challenge
is to integrate all of them.''

WILLIAM A. NIERENBERG, 81, PHYSICIST AND MILITARY POLICY ADVISER
</HEADLINE>
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. William A. Nierenberg, a physicist with a passion for the
ocean who spent five decades striving to mesh science, technology
and policy as an adviser to presidents, military agencies and NATO,
died on Sept. 10 at his home in San Diego. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to a statement from the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, of which Nierenberg was
the director from 1965 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1950s until shortly before his death, he served on
dozens of National Academy of Sciences committees, presidential
commissions and panels examining issues such as what to do about
acid rain and where to hide ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg's mingling of science and politics and his
rapid-fire, straight-talking manner, sometimes put him at odds with
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But any differences of opinion did not erode lifelong
friendships, said Dr. Walter H. Munk, a research oceanographer at
Scripps who knew Nierenberg for 40 years and debated him on issues
like global warming, a theory that Nierenberg long held posed
little immediate threat to human affairs.
</P>
<P>
   When Nierenberg was appointed to run Scripps, Munk recalled,
``there was some concern as to whether a nonoceanographer would do
this job well.'' But, Munk added, ``he fought hard for the
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   While Nierenberg was director, Scripps pioneered several
research projects, including drilling surveys of the sea floor,
which revealed much about the history of the oceans and the
dynamics of the earth's crust, and studies of the interactions of
the oceans and the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   William Aaron Nierenberg was born in New York City on Feb. 13,
1919. According to the National Academy of Sciences, to which he
was elected in 1971, he received three degrees in physics _ his
bachelor's degree from City College of New York in 1939 and his
master's and doctorate from Columbia University in 1942 and 1947.
At Columbia, he studied under I.I. Rabi, winner of the 1944 Nobel
Prize in Physics. While pursuing his degrees, Nierenberg served as
a section leader on the Manhattan Project.
</P>
<P>
   He taught briefly at the University of Michigan, then at the the
University of California at Berkeley beginning in 1950, where he
established his credentials in experimental physics. While there,
he formed the Atomic Beam Laboratory and, from 1950 to 1965, his
work resulted in more than 100 academic papers.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, he took a break from physics and developed
expertise in sonar and antisubmarine warfare, which he put to use
advising government and military agencies on scientific questions
related to national security.
</P>
<P>
   From 1960 to 1962, he served as assistant secretary-general for
scientific affairs of NATO and from 1962 into the 1980s he was a
member of Jason, a group of scientists advising the Pentagon and
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg is survived by his wife, Edith; a son, Nicolas, of
San Diego; a daughter, Victoria Nierenberg Tschinkel, of
Tallahassee, Fla.; and three grandchildren.

EUROPEAN UNION LIFTS SANCTIONS ON AUSTRIA

 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The European Union lifted its sanctions against Austria
on Tuesday, seven months after hurriedly imposing a diplomatic
freeze on Vienna for bringing a rightist party into its ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But the Europeans said they remained deeply concerned about the
Freedom Party's role in the government and vowed to maintain a
``special vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to end the sanctions came four days after a panel of
experts issued a report on human rights and political life in
Austria, recommending an end to the sanctions, which had
increasingly become an embarrassment to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian officials quickly welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great success for Austria resulting from our
patience and firmness,'' Austria's chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel,
said on national television soon after the sanctions were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel said there had been efforts behind the scenes to
suspend the measures rather than lift them and to keep them in
place for a longer time or to set up a monitoring mechanism.
Ultimately, all those efforts were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sanctions were adopted unanimously by Austria's 14
European Union partners, enthusiasm for them waned quickly as they
threatened to strengthen opposition to the group and to a common
European currency, particularly in a crucial referendum on the euro
in Denmark this month.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions _ which included a boycott of cultural exchange
programs and military exercises _ did not amount to much more than
a crimp in the social life of Austria's ambassadors. But critics
said the sanctions went too far: they represented an unparalleled
intrusion into the internal affairs of a member country and they
infuriated the Austrians.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions that the boycott would affect tourism or the
Austrian economy never came to pass. But early on, the sanctions
did cause some awkward diplomatic moments as various officials did
their best to avoid their Austrian counterparts. At a summit
meeting of the European Union in Portugal, for instance, the usual
group picture was done away with because various leaders _
including France's president, Jacques Chirac _ did not want to be
seen standing next to Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Tuesday, a State Department official said that the
United States was examining the European Union report but would
maintain the modest diplomatic sanctions that it imposed in
February to ``limit'' contacts with Austrian officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy has not changed,'' the official said. ``We remain
concerned about the Freedom Party's participation in the Austrian
government.''
</P>
<P>
   ((Canada followed the Europeans' lead and on Tuesday lifted
sanctions it had imposed against Austria on the ground that it no
longer feared Vienna would adopt policies that infringed on human
rights.))
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, it seemed clear that many European Union
members were eager for the sanctions to be lifted immediately. But
France _ which had led the move to impose the freeze and which now
holds the group's rotating presidency _ refused to be rushed. Its
officials hinted that a monitoring system was still needed.
</P>
<P>
   But France was apparently forced to settle for the vague promise
of ``vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In lifting the sanctions, the 14 members issued a joint
statement in Paris Tuesday evening. ``The measures taken by the 14
were useful,'' the statement said. ``They can now be lifted.'' But
the statement added: ``The nature of the Freedom Party and its
uncertain evolution remains cause for serious worry. The 14
consider that a particular vigilance should be exercised with
regard to this party and the influence it exerts on the government
it is a part of.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the sanctions continued month after month, it became clear
that some of the smaller European member countries felt threatened
by what was happening to Austria. In Denmark, for instance, some
experts believe that lifting the sanctions could help make sure
that Danes vote to adopt the euro when the issue goes to a
referendum on Sept. 28. Even before the joint-statement was issued
Tuesday evening, Danish officials were promising that the sanctions
would be gone by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of summer, signs of a thaw were apparent. On
Bastille Day, July 14, the Austrian ambassador was among the
dignitaries sharing a reviewing stand with Chirac. The Belgium
extended a similar invitation to its Austrian ambassador.
Meanwhile, European Union officials _ trying to build a face-saving
way to wriggle out of the sanctions _ appointed a three-member
panel to assess human rights and political life in Austria before
making a recommendation on the lifting the freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The report was issued last Friday and found that the sanctions
had served a useful purpose by focusing attention on common values
in the European Union and increasing the Austrian government's
self-awareness. But the report said that prolonging the sanctions
would be counterproductive by creating ill-will from Austrians.
</P>
<P>
   The three experts _ Prof. Jochen Frowein, the director of the
Max Planck Institute in Germany; Martti Ahtisaari, the former
president of Finland; and Marcelino Oreja, a former Spanish
government minister _ also gave the Schuessel government high marks
for taking concrete steps to fight racism, xenophobia and
anti-semitism.
</P>
<P>
   But they called the Freedom Party, which was led by the
controversial Joerg Haider until he stepped aside in February, ``a
right-wing populist party with radical elements.'' Some of its
members continued to use xenophobic, even racist language and were
not reproached in any way, they said. Haider's party became part of
the current Austrian government when Schuessel and his People's
Party decided that a coalition was the only way to end months of a
political stalemate after the October elections.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sanctions were imposed, Haider has several times
lashed out at Chirac. This weekend, Haider stepped up his attacks,
calling Chirac ``a pocket-sized Napoleon'' who had just met his
Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac has not spoken on the issue, though other French
officials have scoffed at the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever decision is made by the 14, it is not a question of
giving absolution'' to the Freedom Party, said the French affairs
minister, Pierre Moscovi on Monday. ``I don't see how the party can
be exonerated.''

   An Insurrection At `Big Brother'
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Big Brother'' continues to drive the show's
producers batty. Last week, an effort to bribe one of the six
remaining contestants to leave the camera-filled house where they
have been confined for two months failed because they decided they
would present a united front to thwart the producers' main goal of
inserting a new participant.
</P>
<P>
   Then over the weekend the houseguests, as they are called,
became so inflamed by the notion that they were being trifled with
that they announced they would stage a mass walkout of the house
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   That revolt was short-lived. By Sunday the six had seen the
light. If they walked out no one would receive the $500,000 grand
prize.
</P>
<P>
   With the houseguests now apparently locked in for the long haul,
the producers went into this week still wishing they could find a
way to squeeze their new hope, a straightforward and outspoken
attractive young woman named Beth, into the house for the show's
last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One idea was to let one house member out into the world for one
night for a taste of the real word. So Curtis, a lawyer from
California, won a contest to leave the house and go to the Emmy
Awards show on Sunday in Los Angeles. He said he decided to go back
into the house, however, partly because he was cheered by fans at
the Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   That left the producers pondering further moves for Wednesday
night. Paul Romer, the executive producer, said Tuesday that the
show had all but resolved to offer a $50,000 prize again to anyone
who wanted to leave the show, an offer that would be made just
before the audience vote is revealed Thursday night, determining
which houseguest is banished. Cassandra, Curtis and Eddie have been
nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said he would still love to add Beth to the group, ``to
add that new impulse.'' And he admitted that the resistance to
taking the money baffled the producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same amount as the third prize, $50,000. Three of the
people left are going to walk away with no money.''

   Producers Walk Out
</P>
<P>
   After not developing any new comedy hits last year, NBC is still
struggling with the genre it rode to prominence in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with ``The Michael Richards Show,'' named for a former
``Seinfeld'' star, were reported this summer, when the pilot
episode for NBC was retooled.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bad news for the network came when Nat Bernstein and
Mitchel Katlin, executive producers and creators of ``Cursed'' _
one of four half-hour sitcoms that are to make their debuts on NBC
this fall _ left their posts on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said Tuesday that they hoped to complete a deal with
Adam Chase, a former co-executive producer of ``Friends,'' to take
over the executive producer duties on ``Cursed.''
</P>
<P>
   Network executives said they expected ``Cursed'' to make its
debut on Oct. 12, as expected, in the prime Thursday night time
slot at 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   Both the network and the former producers say they could not
agree on the show's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cursed'' is based on the misadventures of an advertising
executive, played by Steven Weber, whose life is turned upside down
after a curse is laid on him during a blind date with a woman who
practices black magic.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said he and Katlin were getting mixed signals from
network executives, who questioned the name of the show and at one
point even suggested doing away with the premise of the curse
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response was, `We love the pilot; maybe we should get rid
of the curse,''' he said. ``The fact of the matter is that from the
very, very beginning, there were many opinions and many cooks, and
there were many things that people would have liked to have seen.
It was a very difficult process.''
</P>
<P>
   Network executives said that they were not happy with the
scripts they were receiving from the producers but that they
expected to keep the main premise.
</P>
<P>
   News of trouble with the program was first reported in the
Hollywood trade papers ``Variety'' and the ``Hollywood Reporter.''
</P>

<P>
   A `Survivor' on MIR
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most daring reality show of all now looks as if it
will become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has bought the rights to a new show from Mark Burnett, the
producer of ``Survivor,'' who plans to take a group of American
contestants to Moscow to take part in a training program for a
rocket trip to the Russian space station MIR.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives said they paid more than $35 million for the
show, which will run 15 to 17 hours in the fall of 2001. It will,
like ``Survivor'' be a weekly elimination duel, but with MIR
officials making the weekly choice of who will be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the winner will be launched into space.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives expressed confidence in Burnett, who besides
``Survivor'' has also produced the series ``Eco-Challenge'' on
cable television.
</P>
<P>
   -BILL CARTER
</P>
<P>
   A Prize for the Emmys
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy Awards struck back this week against all those who have
denigrated the award as all but meaningless: with 21.8 million
viewers, the broadcast Sunday on ABC was the most watched Emmy
Awards show since the Nielsen company started using the
people-meter ratings system in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The show also added significant numbers of younger viewers,
bringing in the most young adult women since 1994 and the most
young adult men since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Many television executives said the big increase in ratings was
proof that television was having a revival of sorts with the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally the biggest evidence of that revival has been the
enormous number of people watching first ``Who Wants to be A
Millionaire'' on ABC and then ``Survivor'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But neither show was up for any Emmy Awards, though the show did
open with an elaborate comedy sketch based on ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   One difference this year was a change in the voting system,
which broke away from the blue-ribbon panels that previously
selected winners after watching nominees over one day in one room.
This year the winners were picked by a much broader group of voters
who watched tapes at home.
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable result was more Emmys for the shows
considered the hottest favorites of the season: five for ``The West
Wing'' and three for ``Will and Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting system was changed because last season's hot show,
``The Sopranos,'' was shortchanged under the old voting system,
winning only two awards. This year ``The Sopranos,'' not quite as
hot as it was last year, won only one award, for James Gandolfini
as best actor.

IN AKRON, THE TALK IS ABOUT TREADS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ When the International Tire Exhibition and
Conference opened here Tuesday, more than 2,500 people gathered in
small meeting rooms to listen to scientists deliver papers on
``Metallic Coagents for Bonding Rubber to Metal and Synthetic
Fibers'' or ``Tire Shearography.''
</P>
<P>
   But try as they might to focus on such topics, they couldn't
help talking about the Firestone controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Though scientists and industry officials are gathering for this
three-day conference to deliver papers that deal with tire failures
and ``tread separation,'' which is at the heart of the massive
recall, few will speculate about what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants said they were legally advised not to speak
about Bridgestone/Firestone and even to delete the term ``tread
separation'' from presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they had noticed a growing interest in X-ray and
laser equipment that might be used to detect problems.
</P>
<P>
   Several executives said tire makers use such equipment in plants
only sporadically because it is too expensive to test every tire.
But that may be changing, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truck industry X-rays 100 percent of their tires, but the
margins aren't in passenger tires to be able to X-ray each one,''
said Ted Neuhaus, a tire consultant at Laser Technology Inc. in
Norristown, Pa. ``Now, though, the fear is that if it happened to
one company, it could also happen to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference organizers held a news briefing this afternoon
calling for the creation of a commission made up of government and
industry officials to gather information about tire safety.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Simmons, publisher of Rubber &AMP; Plastics News, which
organized the conference with its parent company, Crain
Communications, said that creating such a commission would prevent
the need for greater government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that if the tire industry does not take quick,
responsible action, someone else will do it for us,'' Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Many here said the Firestone brand name has been irreparably
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about sooner or later this name will
disappear,'' said John Choi, who sells tire-making machinery in
Korea. ``People don't want tires made by Firestone.''
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested the problem could be poor maintenance of the
tires and the discrepancy between the inflation levels recommended
by Firestone and Ford, which equipped its Explorers with the tires.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry officials stressed how complicated the tire-making
process was and how sophisticated tires had become.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition hall, industry officials talked about how far
the industry has come from the days when a man named Charles
Goodyear invented the vulcanization process, which helped transform
Akron into the industry's birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have doubled the life of the tire and provided all-weather
traction,'' a Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber spokesman told a television
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Many at the conference _ not naming names _ pointed the finger
at automakers, which have pushed to keep tire prices low, and a
public unwilling to pay top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here buy tires that are cheaper than sneakers and then
drive 70 miles per hour on them,'' said Jorg Jetter, who manned the
exhibition booth of Jet Lasersysteme, which makes equipment for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Truck tires, many delegates said, are much more expensive and
largely better made because of the liabilities associated with the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Few, though, were willing to point too harshly at Firestone, at
least publicly. Several meetings, after all, were held in the
Harvey S. Firestone room, and the loudspeaker announced at noon
that a complimentary luncheon was sponsored by
Bridgestone/Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering a paper on the bonding of steel cords to rubber
_ the issue many investigators said may be the problem _ William J.
van Ooij, a professor at the University of Cincinnati and an expert
in rubber adhesion in tires, said he would not speculate about the
cause of tread separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's theoretically possible, but I think it's highly unlikely
that it was a design problem,'' he said. ``I know Firestone and it
wouldn't be design.''
</P>
<P>
   Suresh Sethi, an executive at Modi, a tire equipment company in
India, said that auto and tire makers around the world were overly
concerned about price and market share. Not enough thought had been
given to safety, he said. ``You buy a $30,000 vehicle,'' he said,
``and what does the tire cost? The companies were trying to save $1
per tire because $1 per tire adds up to a lot. That is responsible
for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunter Maass, an executive at Erhardt &AMP; Leimer, a tire equipment
company in Germany, said the recall is about technology. He said
this would not happen in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I understand, this is not the first time,'' he said,
referring to a 1978 Firestone recall.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: REPUBLICANS ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mich.)   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee began broadcasting a new
commercial, ``Let's See/Education,'' in Michigan and Pennsylvania
on Monday. The spot takes aim at the investigation into
fund-raising excesses by the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and then
offers a critical assessment of Vice President Al Gore's education
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Cold Harbor Films &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The 30-second commercial, like other Republican
spots, uses a small television screen on a kitchen counter to show
flickering images of Gore. The vice president is seen speaking to a
crowd, answering questions behind the lectern in the White House
briefing room (it appears to be his ``no controlling legal
authority'' news conference) and addressing the Democratic National
Convention last month. Text superimposed over the images cites the
number of people indicted and convicted and who took the Fifth
Amendment or fled the country in the fund-raising investigation. On
education, the text reads ``No real testing'' and ``No Testing No
Accountability.'' The final text refers viewers to the Republican
National Committee Web site, gorewillsayanything.com.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: A female announcer: ``Al Gore is promising campaign
finance reform. Can I believe him? Because of Gore's last
fund-raising campaign, 22 people have been indicted, 12 convicted,
70 took the Fifth Amendment and 18 witnesses fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Al Gore is promising more accountability in our schools.
And that sounds good. Until you find out he doesn't require any
real testing. And no testing means no accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just more politics, from Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The numbers of people cited in the campaign finance
investigation were taken from a television news broadcast and are
probably lower than the real figures, congressional officials say.
</P>
<P>
   On education, the advertisement is accurate in stating that Gore
would not require mandatory nationwide standardized testing for
students. But Gore does propose voluntary national tests for
fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math, and he encourages
states to participate in the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, an exam administered nationally to a sample of students.
Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, would
require states to participate in the national test and would demand
that they impose mandatory reading and math tests in third- through
eighth-grades.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The spot tries to use the 1996 campaign finance
scandal to undercut Gore's credibility on a wholly unrelated issue,
education reform. The mixed message leaves little time for a
meaningful contrast of the two candidates' positions on school
testing, an important policy difference that Bush hopes will
attract female voters.

HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CAMPAIGN-POLL) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted Saturday through Monday with 1,050 adults
throughout the United States. Of these, 843 said they were
registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either
direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all
American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of
questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

MORGAN DEAL IS CLIMAX OF DECADES OF CONCENTRATION IN BANK
INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (with CHASE-MORGAN, CHASE-MORGAN-HISTORY)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A generation ago, six major commercial banks
dominated the financial world in New York, which itself was the
financial capital of the world's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Now J.P. Morgan _ the last of those six to stay independent _ is
about to be bought, in the latest example of a trend toward
financial concentration. If the planned takeover by Chase Manhattan
is completed, it will bring together four of the six biggest banks
in New York, circa 1980. And yet the combination reflects weakness
as much as strength, as both institutions seek growth in areas
where their previous efforts have not been especially successful.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, the commercial banks were dominant because they
were the major financial intermediaries for both individuals and
companies. Investment banks and insurance companies had their own
niches, some quite profitable, but none of them seemed to be in a
position to challenge the big banks as financial powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Beginning in the 1970s, the commercial banks saw
the dominance of their franchise diminish as corporations
discovered they could save money by issuing securities rather than
borrowing from banks. As the stock market boomed for years,
investors' money flowed out of banks and into stocks and mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   And the commercial banks were hobbled by a series of loan
debacles that damaged some severely and hurt all to some extent,
whether in real estate or loans to Third World countries. It took
years for the banks to recover from those problems, and by then,
their competitors were ahead of them in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Depression-era laws aimed at protecting banks
from possible losses in securities made it difficult for them to
move into other financial products. By the time those laws were
largely repealed, it was the investment banks that were dominant.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of trading Tuesday, Chase Manhattan _ a company
that includes the former Chemical New York and Manufacturers
Hanover banks _ had a market capitalization of $66 billion, and
J.P. Morgan had shares valued at $29 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the investment banking
company descended from J.P. Morgan, had a market capitalization of
$121 billion. Morgan Stanley was split from Morgan after the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 required the separation of investment
banks and commercial banks. For decades, no one doubted that J.P.
Morgan itself had made the right decision by sticking to commercial
banking. Now it will be subsumed, while Morgan Stanley is a
dominant company.
</P>
<P>
   The trend of financial consolidation can be traced, said H.
Rodgin Cohen, a partner in Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell and a lawyer
involved in many bank mergers _ but not in the Chase-Morgan talks _
can be traced largely to three factors: ``convergence,
globalization and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   By convergence, he refers to the fact that many financial
institutions can now offer similar products, in contrast to the old
days of protected turf. Globalization has put a premium on gaining
strength in markets around the world, and the heavy costs of
installing new technology have made it much more difficult for
small players to compete.
</P>
<P>
   There are many areas where Chase and Morgan would seem to
complement each other. ``They can fill in each other's gaps,'' said
Ronald Mandle, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. Chase's
strongest position in equity securities is in technology stocks,
thanks to its acquisition of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. Morgan has a
broader equity business, but is not strong in technology. ``Morgan
is stronger in Europe and Chase is a leader in syndicating U.S.
loans.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the largest New York-based bank was Citibank. It still
holds that position, but it is now part of Citigroup, which was
formed by the merger of Citicorp, Citibank's parent, and Travelers,
the large insurance and investment banking company run by Sanford
I. Weill. While the Citi name survived, the bank is now part of a
much larger company mainly run by executives who came from outside.
</P>
<P>
   Chase ranked second among New York banks in 1980, followed by
Manufacturers Hanover, Morgan, Chemical and Bankers Trust. Chemical
and Manufacturers Hanover merged in 1991, and then acquired Chase
(and its name) in a 1995 deal. Bankers Trust was sold to Deutsche
Bank, a German institution, in a deal announced in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The two non-New York banks in the top eight, as compiled by
American Banker, a trade publication, in 1980, have not fared much
better. Bank of America, then No. 1, and Continental Illinois, then
No. 7, have joined and both been taken over by what was then known
as North Carolina National Bank, which ranked 26th in the nation.

LIEBERMAN TO JOIN HILLARY CLINTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   From the day last month that Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut was selected as the Democratic vice-presidential
candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton has said she would like to
campaign with him as she runs for a Senate seat in New York. On
Friday, she will get her chance. Lieberman will campaign with
Clinton in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   His aides say the events have not been determined, but this much
is known: Clinton and her strategists have said they hope that some
of Lieberman's popularity will rub off on her, particularly with
Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have Clinton, who is in a tight race with Rep. Rick Lazio,
leading among Jewish voters by a margin smaller than New York
Democrats usually need to win statewide races. But those same
surveys show Vice President Al Gore, helped by Lieberman, the first
Jewish candidate for national office from a major party, leading
Gov. George W. Bush by 20 points or more in New York. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Bush TV spot has Democrats yelling `RATS'
 &HT;    Experts say they doubt use of word in ad unintentional
 &HT;    
 &HT;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The word ``Republican'' contains the letters that spell
``pubic.'' The word ``experts'' contains the letters that spell
``sex.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts commenting on the controversy about a Republican
campaign commercial say that embedded words, subliminal advertising
or flashed messages have virtually no power to change how voters
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't work, and if they don't work why fool around
with it?'' advertising expert Jack Haberstroh of San Diego, Calif.,
said Tuesday. His 1994 book, ``Ice Cube Sex,'' aimed to debunk the
idea that subliminal advertising is used widely and has the desired
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the intrigue surrounding the use of the word ``RATS'' in a
Republican National Committee television commercial that promotes
Gov. George W. Bush's presidential candidacy and criticizes
opponent Al Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which was discontinued Tuesday after a two-week, $2.5
million run in 33 cities across the nation (none in Texas), said
that under Gore's plan to add prescription drugs benefits for
Medicare recipients, ``bureaucrats decide'' about health care for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   As an announcer pronounced the phrase, the word ``RATS,'' a
fragment from ``bureaucrats,'' appeared on the screen for a
fraction of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party operatives alerted The New York Times, whose
Tuesday article about the commercial started a rat-a-tat-tat
between the candidates for president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the suggestion that ``RATS'' was used to disparage
Gore is ``bizarre and weird.'' He said the appearance of the word
in the 30-second ad was unintentional. Alex Castellanos, who
produced the commercial, said the phrase was highlighted to make
letters on the screen visually captivating and that the use of
``rats'' was coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called the ad ``disappointing and strange'' and his running
mate, U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, said the Democrats want an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on advertising and business procedures doubted that
``RATS'' was an unintended feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying it was accidental? Oh my God, I find that hard
to believe,'' said Haberstroh, who taught college courses about
advertising for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   He said the word was not a subliminal message, because
``subliminal'' means below the line of conscious perception and
``RATS'' appears long enough to be seen and read by the conscious
mind.
</P>
<P>
   And because the word appears long enough to be perceived, its
inclusion had to be planned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Klein, a marketing professor at Rice University's Jones
Graduate School of Administration, said someone on the Republican
side must have been made aware of ``RATS'' before the ad ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody that runs a national ad will do it without testing it''
on sample viewers, she said. ``It would have shown up on research
they did to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the message is subliminal or another kind of suggestion,
it can backfire, according to Klein.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who are against Republicans or against `that kind'
of campaigning, this can have a negative effect,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For viewers supportive of Republican causes, the commercial can
introduce the idea that bureaucrats are rats, but not necessarily
inspire them to despise Democrats as rodents, Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   A professor of management and psychology at the Jones School,
Steven Currall, said he was surprised to hear Republicans say they
did not deploy ``RATS'' on purpose. Considering that such
commercials are pieced together rigorously, ``it is surprising that
something would slip by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Haberstroh said that regardless of whether ``RATS'' was
accidental, it will dent Bush's image as a candidate who promised
to run a civil campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine the people who put this commercial together
thinking it was going to produce some positive results for George
Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Haberstroh pointed out, subliminal advertising can get
TV stations in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the Federal Communications Commission declared that
subliminal advertising is against the public interest and therefore
in possible violation of the license agreements that stations make
to broadcast on the public airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The title and content of Haberstroh's ``Ice Cube Sex'' made fun
of the notion that subliminal advertising is used widely on
television or in newspapers and magazines, which are beyond the
reach of government regulations. Unless advertising addresses the
public plainly and directly it is doomed, according to Haberstroh.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite view has come from author Wilson Bryan Key, whose
1970s book, ``Subliminal Seduction,'' said that advertisers were
using sexual images and words on the subconscious level to sell
food products and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Key's work fed the idea that the populace is manipulated by
money-hungry media, and Bush chose in his comments about the ad
Tuesday to discuss conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``One frame out of 900 hardly in my judgment makes a
conspiracy,'' Bush said. ``I am convinced this is not intentional.
You don't need to play, you know, cute politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Subliminal advertising first got attention in 1957, when New
York market researcher James Vicary claimed that he increased
popcorn and cola sales at a movie theater by flashing promotional
messages at 1/60,000th of a second during a film. His research was
later discredited, but not before the National Association of
Broadcasters in 1958 adopted a self-imposed ban on such ads.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has shaken the persistent sense that he
is not particularly likable and is now as highly regarded as Gov.
George W. Bush on matters of character, leadership and overall
personal popularity, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Now that public opinion has settled somewhat since the
Democratic convention nearly four weeks ago, and voters say they
are far more interested in the race, the survey makes clear that
Gore's enhanced fortunes are deeper and more sustained than a
post-convention afterglow.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has achieved substantial gains among women, independent
voters and those from middle income groups. While Bush's support
has diminished somewhat overall, he still retains the overwhelming
support of men, Midwesterners and Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows that the presidential race is neck-and-neck, and
that Bush and Gore are facing off in the tightest competition just
after Labor Day in 20 years. If the election were held today, 42
percent of registered voters said they would back Gore and 39
percent said they would vote for Bush. Four percent said they would
back Ralph Nader, the Green party nominee, and 2 percent would
favor Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has gained on Bush in recent weeks, but not to a degree
that is statistically significant. The nationwide telephone poll,
conducted Saturday through Monday with 843 registered voters, has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   And there was some encouraging news for Bush in the numbers.
Forty-seven percent of Gore's supporters said they had reservations
about him; only 38 percent of Bush's backers registered concerns
about their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most pronounced shift in the survey is the marked
improvement in the public's perceptions of Gore. For months,
Americans said they found Gore's positions on a various issues more
appealing than Bush's, but the vice president's most persistent
problem was that voters said they had significant misgivings about
him on issues of character.
</P>
<P>
   Now, while Bush has held his own in retaining impressive
favorability ratings, Gore's favorability ratings have increased
substantially _ to the point where the two men are now equally
popular. Forty-four percent of voters say they have a favorable
view of Gore, while 29 percent have an unfavorable view. Gore has
not done that well by this measure for years. In recent months, the
public either had more negative views of Gore than positive ones,
or, more recently, given him positive ratings that equaled his
negatives.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking example of how perceptions have transformed,
voters no longer view Bush as the runaway winner in the November
election. They are now split on whether Gore or Bush will make it
to the White House. As recently as two months ago, Bush led Gore on
this question by more than 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are also more confident in Gore's ability to deal wisely
with an international crisis. Forty-nine percent said they were
confident in Gore, a gain from 43 percent in a Times/CBS poll in
July. Bush's standing on that issue has remained steady at 46
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While 63 percent of the public thinks Gore cares about the needs
and problems of ordinary people _ a figure that has not changed
since July _ Bush has shown some slippage. Forty-nine percent say
that of Bush cares about ordinary people, a decline from 55 percent
in July.
</P>
<P>
   It is not altogether clear what has prompted the more kindly
feelings toward Gore. But in follow-up interviews Tuesday, many
voters who now back Gore said they were impressed by what they saw
at the Democratic convention. Repeatedly, they said, Gore seemed to
be coming into his own _ and moving out of President Clinton's
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the convention, he did a better job of concealing anything
that was negative, if he had anything to begin with,'' said Wilma
Akins, 69, a retired office manager in Statesboro, Ga. ``He made me
feel hopeful and optimistic about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Taylor, 46, a grocery store manager in Philadelphia, said,
``He's become stronger and seems to be speaking out more since the
convention. He's becoming his own man now, and he's not as stiff as
he once was.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is still not a single overwhelming issue that
defines the race _ as the economy has in the past _ the survey
found that the closest contender this year was health care, and the
related matter of Medicare. Nearly two-thirds of voters said the
high cost of prescription drugs for the elderly was quite important
to them personally.
</P>
<P>
   Voters said they thought the government _ not insurance
companies _ would do a better job of providing coverage to the
elderly for prescription drugs. Gore was seen as more likely than
Bush to succeed in reducing the cost of prescription drugs for the
elderly. Bush has proposed allowing private insurance companies to
compete for Medicare clients, while Gore has proposed adding a
subsidy for prescription drug coverage to the current Medicare
plan.

</P>
<P>
   While Bush has recently accused the administration of presiding
over a weakening of the military, the issue did not register much
with voters. And many seemed confused about the state of the
nation's missile defense capability.
</P>
<P>
   Half the voters agreed with Bush's assertion that the military
has weakened under Clinton, and just under half said it had either
strengthened or stayed the same over the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But half the voters said they thought that the United States had
a missile defense system, although it does not; only 28 percent
knew that the country does not one. One explanation may be that
nearly seven in 10 respondents said they had not heard or read much
about the debate over proposals for a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, four in 10 voters said it was important that the United
States try to build a missile defense system; two-thirds said they
favored such an effort even though the government has already spent
$60 billion trying to develop one.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has repeatedly called upon Gore to elevate the
discourse and not sink to harsh commercials, voters gave the vice
president higher marks for his advertising campaign. Two thirds of
voters said Gore was spending more time explaining what he would do
as president than he was spending attacking Bush; half said the
same of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of voters have seen advertisements for Bush,
and they are divided over whether they mostly explain things about
Bush or attack Gore. About a third have seen advertisements for
Gore. But those viewers, decisively, say Gore's commercials explain
things about Gore rather than attack Bush.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the voter interviews, many said Gore's selection of Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut spiced up the ticket, especially
when Lieberman was compared with Dick Cheney, who even many
Republicans say has not been as beneficial to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move to choose Lieberman took a lot of guts and was
brilliant,'' said Nati Gottlieb, 53, an insurance salesman in
Philadelphia. ``That move stopped Bush dead in his tracks and
started his current momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such comments, the poll reinforced the accepted wisdom
that running mate choices do not matter much. Cheney and Lieberman
are each well liked _ and each are about twice as likely to be
viewed favorably as unfavorably. But most people still have no
opinion of them. And more than half of voters said the selections
did not make them any more, or less, inclined to vote for Bush or
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Voters did not sound exercised about the frequent references
that Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, has made to his faith. Voters said
it was perfectly appropriate for candidates to discuss their
religious beliefs, and a majority said none of the Democratic or
Republican candidates had used their religion improperly.
</P>
<P>
   On the topic of televised debates, a subject that has dominated
much of the campaign news in recent weeks, 49 percent said they
believed Gore and Bush want to debate; 21 percent said only Gore
wanted to debate and 10 percent said only Bush wanted to take part.
Eighty-six percent said the bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates should hold the events; the Bush campaign had earlier
sought other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This is only the third time in 40 years that a presidential
contest has been this close immediately after Labor Day, and that
may be why more voters _ 53 percent _ now say the race is
interesting; 39 percent say it is dull.
</P>
<P>
   A continuation of such interest could spur turnout in the range
of 50 percent to 55 percent, slightly higher than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the contest between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan was
a dead heat at this point, with Reagan pulling ahead only over the
final weekend. In 1960, the match-up between Richard M. Nixon and
John F. Kennedy was equally tight at this stage, and stayed that
way until Kennedy's narrow victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be one of the best horse races we've had in the
country since Kennedy and Nixon,'' said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald,
R-Ill. ``The Bush campaign is going to have to do most everything
right between now and November to win. And it will not be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster, put it this way: ``This race
is shaping up to be more like Kennedy-Nixon than anything else,
mostly because of the closeness but also because of the dynamics of
an incumbent hanging on with the country in pretty good shape but
against a tough challenger.''

U.S. RULES OUT FORCE OVER IRAQ INSPECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE with STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on
Tuesday that the United States would not use force to make Iraq
allow the resumption of international arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, speaking with reporters after a speech to the opening
session of the General Assembly, said there were still other ``red
lines'' that Iraq would risk attack by crossing. ``We do not want
to see them reconstitute their weapons of mass destruction,'' she
said, ``and we don't want them to take action against the Kurds,
and we don't want them to threaten the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But as for restarting arms inspections, Albright said, only
President Saddam Hussein ``can pick up the key to let himself out
of the sanctions box.'' She said Iraq had to allow a new inspection
commission under Hans Blix, a Swedish arms control expert, to start
work. Otherwise, she said, the sanctions imposed in 1990 after the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will never be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the General Assembly on Tuesday, Albright urged
member nations to ``stand up to the campaign launched by Baghdad
against the U.N.'s authority and international law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The regime's strategy is to ignore its U.N. Charter
obligations and seek to preserve at all costs its capacity to
produce the deadliest weapons humanity has ever known,'' she said.
``We must continue to do all we can to ease the hardships faced by
Iraq's people. But we must also defend the integrity of this
institution, our security and international law.''
</P>
<P>
   In answering questions from reporters as she was leaving the
United Nations, Albright said twice that force was not the answer
to getting cooperation from Saddam Hussein on arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   This signaled both to Iraq and other Council members that the
United States will not raise the possibility of American force as
the United Nations waits for the Iraqis to admit the new
inspectors, who have been trained and are ready to go. This could
come as a relief not only to Iraq but also to those nations who
conclude that American threats can only complicate dealings with
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that basically we have made it clear that it is
essential for Baghdad to live up to its obligations, and we are
opposed to it, using force,'' she said. ``We have our red lines,
and we have made those quite clear, and I think it is very
important that somehow Saddam Hussein gets the message that he is
the one out of step with the rest of the members of the United
Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's remarks underscored the evolution in the
administration's policy toward the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, the United States and Britain launched four
nights of air strikes to punish Hussein's government for its
refusal to cooperate with the previous team of inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the administration has grown increasingly reluctant
to consider force, even though there have been no meaningful
inspections in more than two years and some intelligence reports
have noted worrisome signs that Iraq's weapons programs have
continued.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials said the use of force _ even the threat
_ would undercut efforts to maintain an international consensus on
keeping sanctions in place as long as Hussein resists new
inspections. One official said the administration was prepared to
accept Iraq's continued intransigence because that supports the
American case.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have said is, we're not ready to use force to get the
inspectors into Iraq,'' an administration official said on Tuesday.
``That is not saying _ if we have any evidence he's trying to
reconstitute weapons of mass destructions _ that we're not prepared
to act.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there has been a heightened sense of concern at
the Pentagon and elsewhere in Washington that Iraq might be
preparing to cross one of the ``red lines'' that Albright spoke of
on Tuesday. Iraq's military has been conducting annual exercises,
and intelligence officials have warned that some of the activity
appeared to go beyond that of previous years, including unusual
movements of armored weapons and aircraft, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say there is just enough to warrant the extra level of
attention we're giving it,'' but not yet enough to prompt the
administration to act, a senior administration official said on
Friday. In 1996, similar exercises in Iraq culminated when Iraqi
troops stormed into the Kurdish enclave in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The latest activity has prompted the Pentagon to put its forces
on a heightened state of alert, including batteries of Patriot
missiles based in Germany, which have been ordered to be ready to
move quickly to Israel or other countries in the event of a
confrontation with Iraq, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's comments were not unexpected; diplomats at the United
Nations say they believe that the Clinton administration does not
want another confrontation in its waning months in office.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive economic embargo was imposed on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Last December the Security
Council, in creating the new Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission, gave Iraq a plan under which sanctions could
be suspended after a period of cooperation with inspectors on
solving key disarmament tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq says that the decade-long embargo has led to the deaths of
a million people because of scarcities of food, medicine and other
goods. Some American and European groups are campaigning to end
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While those groups may be well-meaning, they need to
understand who the villain is,'' Albright said on Tuesday. ``The
villain is Saddam Hussein. It is very, very simple.''

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Where is everybody?
</P>
<P>
   That is the feeling in Sydney right now. No chanting crowds. No
swarming hordes. No obvious rush of fresh money, newly arrived from
overseas. Just peaceful streets, comfortable trains, empty
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   This tranquillity is far preferable to the steamy days and tacky
nights of Atlanta 1996, when you couldn't walk on Peachtree Street
because of the glut of tourists having a block party. The Sydney
organizers looked at that unkempt scene and sniffed, ``Don't sweat
it, mate, this won't happen in Sydney.'' Up to now, this looks like
the anti-Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Summer Games are only two days away, but the feeling has not
reached critical mass. The Olympic Stadium will surely be jammed
with 110,000 people, watching the Olympic flame during the opening
ceremony on Friday night. Eighty percent of all tickets have been
sold, within a couple of percentage points of the great
record-setting glut in Atlanta four years ago. So far, Sydney is
calm. Too calm for some.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Luongo is getting antsy. He comes from Turin, owns the
Siena restaurant on Glebe Point Road, does a good business in
normal times. Right now he is hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see people from overseas,'' Luongo was saying Tuesday.
``The city is dead, and that is not just my opinion. We are
struggling. I have no idea what is the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   My source in the city reported Tuesday that the Meadowbank Ferry
was nearly empty and that the panoramic film of Sydney at the Imax
had maybe a dozen spectators.
</P>
<P>
   What Luongo and other merchants are discovering is normal for
every Summer Games or World Cup of soccer. People who go to sports
events do not necessarily patronize good restaurants or purchase
artifacts or visit museums. Many of them buy a T-shirt and a beer,
root and go home.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but sports hordes also scare away the locals. In
Los Angeles before the 1984 Summer Games, there was so much gloom
and doom that everybody who could vanished to Hawaii or Mammoth
Lake or London. The freeways have never been so easy to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome in 1990 for the World Cup, we rented an apartment in
Piazza Sforza Cesarini, just across the river from the Vatican. My
wife was regularly regaled with sad tales of deprivation by the
owners of trattorias and specialty shops: ``Signora, tell your
husband the reporter that there is nobody here. The soccer fans
come in, they look at St. Peter's and they go to the game. They
don't even buy a penne a la vodka or an insalata tricolore.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Monday night after the World Cup ended, every seat was
taken in our favorite trattoria. The locals had returned from
California or Greece or deep in the countryside where no soccer fan
could find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have beautiful customers,'' Luongo was saying Tuesday.
``Maybe they have taken their kids on holiday. Every day we have
two, four, six customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities will say that hotel rooms are booked, that
tickets are selling, but there have been empty seats on everybody's
flights into town. Tomorrow is supposed to be the biggest influx
for the Games _ perhaps 100,000 tourists from international
flights. Then we will find out if the trains will really deliver
the crowds to the new Olympic Park station. Some people are
dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the ghost-town feeling is a good reminder for all
cities that tinker with the idea of playing host to the Summer
Games. There are even rumors from New York that some naifs are
agitating for the city to be the host of a set of Summer Games
somewhat later in this century. A Summer Games spread all over that
fractious and balkanized region of bridges and tunnels? That will
be the year when everybody goes to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the cost for all this largesse. The Sydney Olympic
Park looks lovely at dusk, as the lights go on. Handsome new
stadiums sprawl all over the former dumping grounds at Homebush Bay
_ the Superdome, the Olympic Stadium, the Hockey Center, the Tennis
Center, the Aquatic Center, the Dome and Pavilions, the Baseball
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When the crowds arrive _ and they will arrive _ it will all look
good on NBC, two-thirds of a day later. But what is the cost for
the privilege of providing a studio audience for worldwide
television?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't wind up like poor Montreal,'' said one
Australian taxpayer Tuesday, referring to the city that is still
stuck with the bills from a party it gave 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mario Luongo has a table for you.

CHENEY REALIZES $20.6 MILLION PROFIT FROM SALE OF HALLIBURTON
HOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Cheney realized a profit of $20.6 million last month as he
cashed in most of his stake in the Halliburton Co., which he ran
until he left to become the Republican candidate for vice
president, he reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's sales, from Aug. 21 through Aug. 28, came before he
announced on Sept. 1 that he would forfeit some options in
Halliburton if the Republican ticket is elected. At that time, he
did not disclose that he had already sold a large part of his
holding in the energy company.
</P>
<P>
   The options that he said he would forfeit, worth $3.9 million at
the current price of Halliburton stock, cannot be exercised until
well after the new administration takes office. Critics had argued
that having a large stake in Halliburton, an energy services
company whose share price tends to rise and fall in line with oil
prices, would be a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Cheney, Juleanna Glover Weiss, declined to say
Tuesday if Cheney had made any additional sales since Aug. 28. She
described the sales as ``part of normal efforts he would take to
divest himself of the securities,'' but did not say why he had not
mentioned them in his Sept. 1 announcement.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing delivered to the SEC on Friday and released on
Tuesday, Cheney said he had exercised options on 650,000 shares of
Halliburton and sold the shares, earning a profit of $18.5 million
before taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he transferred 39,200 shares of Halliburton back to
the company at a price of $54 per share, for a total of $2.1
million. That money was used to pay withholding taxes on the value
of the shares he received from Halliburton as part of his
retirement package.
</P>
<P>
   Added to a profit of $3 million he earned in cashing in 100,000
options in May, before he joined the ticket, Cheney has realized
profits of $23.6 million on his Halliburton securities.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney still has 210,800 shares of Halliburton, all of which he
was given by the company, worth $11.5 million at Tuesday's closing
price of $54.38 per share.
</P>
<P>
   He has only 33,333 more options that he could cash in now, on
which he would have a profit of $875,000 at current prices. Options
now worth $3.5 million can be exercised in December, after the
election but before the inauguration. In addition, he has 100,000
options to buy shares at $54.50, slightly above the current price,
that could be exercised now. But there would be no profit from
those options unless the stock price rises.

UNITED STATES TO MOVE AGAINST JAPAN OVER WHALING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House plans to declare on Wednesday that
Japan has violated international whaling rules by expanding its
whale hunt this year, and will start a process that could lead to
economic sanctions against Japanese imports within two months,
administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting in New York on Monday between Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Japan's foreign minister, Yohei Kono, failed
to head off the start of the sanctions process, these officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Japan began hunting small numbers of Bryde's and sperm
whales in the North Pacific, saying the whales would be harpooned
for scientific research. Both species are protected under U.S. law,
but scientific whaling _ as opposed to commercial _ is permitted
under International Whaling Commission rules.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two months, the expanded hunt has turned into one
of the largest confrontations between Tokyo and Washington since
the trade disputes that marked President Clinton's first term.
Clinton has complained about the whaling in letters to Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori, and the United States has boycotted a U.N.
meeting in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials charge that the move toward sanctions in
Washington has been politically driven, reflecting an effort by
Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, to
rebuild strained relations with environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   But standing up to the United States on whaling is good politics
in Japan as well. Whale-meat is still a delicacy at small
restaurants dotting Tokyo's back streets, often marinated with talk
of how the United States is attempting to force Japan to adopt
Western environmental rules without regard to local tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is betting that Japan will back down
rather than risk sanctions in the midst of a presidential election.
It is already drawing up lists of goods that could be banned,
including many types of seafood. The hope is that publishing the
list will result in enough panic among Japan's food exporters that
whaling will be called off.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials say that if the United States proceeds to the
next step, the imposition of sanctions, it will take the case to
the World Trade Organization in Geneva. Trade lawyers say the
Japanese government might win the case, because the United States
imports no Japanese whale meat _ and thus may not be able, under
trade agreements, to impose sanctions for actions that take place
beyond U.S. borders.

STRAWBERRY SENTENCED TO HOUSE ARREST FOR PROBATION VIOLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry was at home in Tampa, Fla., Tuesday, which is
where he must remain for most of the next two years after being
sentenced to house arrest for violating his probation by admittedly
driving under the influence of medication and then leaving the
scene of an accident on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who is fighting colon cancer and whose career has
been marred by substance abuse suspensions, illnesses and criminal
charges, was driving to see his probation officer on Monday. But
Strawberry said that he blacked out from prescription medication
and hit a road sign, and then slammed into another vehicle.
Strawberry apologized for his behavior when Judge Florence Foster
sentenced him in court Tuesday in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used the wrong judgment taking medication because I didn't
feel well,'' Strawberry said in the courtroom. ``I just blacked
out. I didn't know if I hurt anybody. I feel really bad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's wife, Charisse, who was teary-eyed outside the
courthouse, said her husband was in a lot of pain because of his
ongoing battle with cancer and the removal of his kidney last
month. She added that he was relieved that the other driver was not
injured. In a telephone interview after the Strawberrys returned
home, Charisse Strawberry said that her husband is trying to cope
with his latest ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to pick himself up from this and go on,'' she said.
``Hopefully, there will be a light under this dark cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of house arrest, Strawberry can leave the house
only for doctor's appointments or to go to work. If Strawberry ever
wanted to return to baseball, said Robin Fuson, the assistant state
attorney, he would need the court's permission. Fuson added that
the 38-year-old Strawberry still faces misdemeanor charges for
driving under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident,
and he could receive additional punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years of house arrest is no day at the beach,'' Fuson told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Yankees seemed bewildered by the latest twist in
Strawberry's life. Dwight Gooden thought for about 30 seconds
before saying that he would not know what to say to Strawberry.
Derek Jeter, who plans to call Strawberry soon, likened the
developments of his friend's life to a soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you to say to him,'' Jeter said. ``I don't
have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams said it was ``obviously sad'' to see Strawberry
arrested and said how Strawberry's failure to ``maximize his
talent'' was sad for baseball. Williams spoke thoughtfully and
eloquently about Strawberry's uncertain future, a future that was
already clouded by a recurrence of his cancer and a one-year
suspension from baseball starting in April for drug and
solicitation charges and will now include two years of house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still a fairly young person,'' Williams said. ``Maybe, if
it's not baseball, he'll find his calling in society in some other
aspect of life. I wish him the best. He's one of those warriors who
won't give up. Hopefully, he'll be all right in those two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, who had prostate cancer and who declined to discuss
Strawberry on Monday, did not know of Strawberry's sentencing until
reporters told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sad,'' Torre said. ``You know he's not normal
because he's got all this stuff going on, chemically, in his body.
Unless we've experienced it, it's really tough to pass judgment.
It's unfortunate that he keeps running into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charisse Strawberry had told reporters at the courthouse that
her husband was experiencing ``mental difficulties'' but refused to
elaborate. During the phone interview, she explained that she
simply meant that her husband has not been himself because of the
pain from dealing with cancer and the derailing of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just really tough to not be able to continue his
career and then to have his second fight with cancer,'' Charisse
Strawberry said. ``At 38, to have his second bout with cancer,
that's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who tested negative for alcohol in his system,
volunteered a urine sample that will be tested for any
nonprescription drugs in his system. He was fined $265 and his case
will be reviewed in four months. If Strawberry abides by the
conditions of his house arrest for a year, law enforcement
officials said there is a chance the second year could be lessened
to probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is, it's like what one of the reporters at court
said to me today,'' Charisse Strawberry said. ``It was like Darryl
was trying to do the right thing and it went bad.'' &QL;

   Bush sees his most `bizarre' day in campaign yet
</P>
<P>
   By CLAY ROBISON
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ George W. Bush said it was ``bizarre'' and
``weird,'' and he wasn't even talking about Al Gore's health care
plan or his Democratic rival's association with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking instead about his own campaign day, one of the
strangest the Republican nominee has yet encountered in his race
for the presidency. It was enough to make a weaker candidate cry,
``Rats!``
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Tuesday tried mightily to stick to the message he wanted
to emphasize _ his plan to give the elderly new options for health
care and prescription drug coverage under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But he also found himself answering distractions about an
alleged subliminal message in a Republican television ad and
whether he suffers from a learning disorder.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles began with two published articles, which set back,
at least for a few hours, the governor's efforts to regain momentum
against his Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A story on the front page of the New York Times reported that
the word ``RATS'' flashed across the screen in one frame of a
30-second Republican television spot on health care. It was too
fast for most viewers to see clearly, but provided grist,
nevertheless, for political speculation because the commercial
attacked Gore's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that it obtained a copy of the
slowed-down version of the ad from the Gore campaign, which had
been alerted to it by a Democrat in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The second article, published in Vanity Fair, suggested that the
Texas governor sometimes jumbles or mispronounces words because he
is dyslexic. The condition can impede to various degrees the
ability to read, write or speak.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he is not dyslexic.
</P>
<P>
   And he denied the ``RATS'' ad was intended as a subliminal
characterization of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But the questions rained on his day, beginning with an
early-morning national television interview conducted before
millions of Americans had even crawled out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times article was one of the first pieces of news
to greet the governor on Tuesday morning as he prepared for a 7:05
a.m. live interview from his Palm Beach, Fla., hotel on ABC-TV's
Good Morning America.
</P>
<P>
   Although his campaign had learned of the article the previous
night and his chief media consultant, Mark McKinnon, had commented
on it, Bush wasn't informed until after he awoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first I heard of it is sitting here this morning,'' Bush
told interviewer Diane Sawyer. ``You know, campaigns take bizarre
twists. This has got to be one of the more bizarre accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm telling you I don't think there's a plot to try
to put subliminal messages in the people's minds. The most
important thing is to point up the differences between what I
believe and what the vice president believes when it comes to
important issues like prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the dyslexia question came up later in the interview,
Bush grinned self-consciously and replied: ``I'm not dyslexic.
That's all I can tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had to answer similar questions a couple of hours later at
a brief airport news conference in Orlando, where he went to tour
the Walt Disney Memorial Cancer Institute at Florida Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He said the commercial, which was sponsored by the Republican
National Committee, was scheduled to be pulled on Tuesday anyway
and replaced by another GOP ad.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox News Network reported on the ``RATS'' blip two weeks
ago, but that report didn't receive much attention. And Bush
spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor hadn't known about the
Fox report.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters he saw the ad displayed on a computer once
several weeks ago and did not notice the flashing word.
</P>
<P>
   At one point on Tuesday, Hughes passed a cheese tray around for
reporters on Bush's plane, explaining that she was ``just poking a
little fun at the story of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, Bush campaigned in St. Louis before flying
cross-country to Washington state for campaign appearances there
and in California today. (WEDNESDAY)

DISNEY TO RESTRICT ADS FOR R-RATED FILMS ON ABC 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co. announced Tuesday that it would no longer accept
advertising for R-rated movies on any programs on its ABC
television network that are broadcast before 9 p.m., Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in response to a report this week from the
Federal Trade Commission that criticized the entertainment industry
for marketing films with violent and sexual content to children.
</P>
<P>
   Movie advertising is one of the most lucrative sources of
revenue for television networks. According to figures from
Competitive Media Reports, which tracks television advertising,
movie studios spent $668 million on the four big broadcast networks
last year. For the first half of 2000, the figure has grown to $418
million. For ABC, the figures were $148 million from movie
advertising in 1999 and $115 million for the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Disney released comprehensive guidelines for the company in
regard to its marketing practices, many of which were restatements
of existing policies, said John Dreyer, the company's corporate
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on commercials for R-rated movies on the Disney-owned
ABC network is an extension of an existing policy, Dreyer said,
``but previously there had been exceptions.'' He added, ``From now
on, there will be no exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not expect the prohibition to result in a very
significant loss of revenue for the network.
</P>
<P>
   No other network has a prohibition tied to the first hour of
prime time, an hour that was once formally designated by the
networks as a ``family-viewing hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Fox network has an existing policy that prohibits
commercials for R-rated films in any show considered to be family
programming, a Fox spokesman, Jeff DeRome, said. Among that shows
included in that category are ``The Simpsons,'' ``Malcolm in the
Middle'' and ``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives declined to comment on that network's formal
policies, but in recent years CBS has had virtually no programs
with significant numbers of children watching. That changed
somewhat this summer when ``Survivor'' became a hit with almost
every age group, and not coincidentally, CBS began taking in far
more money from movie studios thanks to that program.
</P>
<P>
   NBC ties its own policy to the composition of its audience,
saying that it will not accept commercials for R-rated films in any
show whose audience is made up of more that 30 percent children.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalyn Weinman, a senior vice president of NBC, said that no
show on NBC reached that threshold last season. In recent years,
NBC has taken in more movie money than any other network largely on
the strength of its lineup of Thursday programs, one of which,
``Friends,'' is on at 8 p.m.

CONGRESSIONAL RACE IN WASHINGTON STATE HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ Democrats held the congressional seat here in
northwest Washington for 30 years until the Republican tide of 1994
brought in Jack Metcalf, a former high school history teacher and
state legislator who finally made it to the House of
Representatives some 26 years after his first attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Metcalf sticking to a pledge to leave Congress after
three terms, and with Democrats believing the vacancy offers a
prime opportunity to pick up a seat in the battle for control of
the House, the 2nd Congressional District race shows signs of
becoming one of the most tightly fought contests in the nation this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   And, though each major party candidate downplays the notion that
presidential coattails will be a major factor in their campaign,
some of the emerging themes in the race are strikingly similar to
those in the race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate, John Koster, a state representative
and third-generation dairy farmer, puts it simply in promising to
push for a big federal tax cut: ``Taxes are the first thing people
are talking about to me.''
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic foe, Rick Larsen, a Snohomish County councilman,
says he will push for paying down the national debt and shoring up
Social Security and Medicare first. ``What I hear from people in
this district is, they're more concerned about using the surplus to
pay down the debt. They want government to get its fiscal house in
order. They want schools to be safe, they want to be sure seniors
can get prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   While drawing considerable attention because it involves the
only open district in the state, the race here is one of at least
three congressional contests that are considered competitive this
fall in Washington, a state that proved to be an interesting
electoral bellwether last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Washington voters broadly backed Bill Clinton and congressional
Democrats in 1992, then turned with a fury to Republicans in 1994,
giving them a 7-2 margin in the House delegation and even throwing
out the speaker of the House, Thomas Foley, a Spokane Democrat. In
1996, they came back to Clinton and over the next two election
cycles, Democrats regained a 5-4 edge.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Democrats are hoping to win the seat in this
district, which stretches from the Seattle suburbs northward to the
Canadian border, and possibly even oust George Nethercutt, the
Republican who unseated Foley six years ago and is now reneging on
a term-limits pledge he made at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are hoping to hold on to both of those seats and
even regain an edge by knocking off the incumbent Democrat in the
neighboring 1st District, Jay Inslee, who holds a seat that has
already switched hands three times over the last 10 years.
(Overall, Republicans hold 222 seats in the House of
Representatives and Democrats 210, and two are held by
independents. That means that Democrats could regain control by
picking up seven additional seats in November.)
</P>
<P>
   The district here was once reliably, even staunchly Democratic.
It was represented in the 1940s by Henry M. Jackson of Everett, who
went on to become a Senator and a national political figure, and in
the years afterward, as the Boeing Co. became the ever more
dominant employer in the region, its thousands of union workers
tended to vote the Democratic line.
</P>
<P>
   Everett and surrounding Snohomish County still account for about
half the district's voters but, as Koster noted in an interview,
many of the suburban areas have leaned Republican in recent years,
and the more agricultural areas to the north also tend to vote
Republican. Both he and Larsen agreed that in very rough terms, the
district's electorate now is probably about one-third Democratic,
one-third Republican and one-third independent.
</P>
<P>
   In many important ways, the race here has yet to catch fire, but
will undoubtedly do so as Election Day grows nearer. The two
candidates have debated face-to-face only once so far, in a
relatively polite exchange in July at the Marysville Rotary. But
they have clashed more recently over each other's records in
office, and are expected to debate in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Both do not expect to run television advertising until next
month, because much of it must be done on Seattle stations, which
is expensive. And while next Tuesday's primary is critically
important in some races _ it will determine, for instance, whether
former Rep. Maria Cantwell or State Insurance Commissioner Deborah
Senn will earn the Democratic nomination to take on the incumbent
U.S. senator, Slade Gorton, a Republican _ it is not central to
this race. Both men are running unopposed for their party's
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, neither currently reports having a huge amount of cash
on hand _ $176,00 for Koster as of Aug. 31, compared to $212,000
for Larsen. But national leaders in both parties have said they
expect to pour significant amounts into the race.
</P>
<P>
   If moderate ``swing'' voters are the key to the election, Larsen
may have some advantages. He often casts himself as a ``fiscal
moderate,'' while Koster is an unabashed conservative. He said at
the July debate that he was proud to have voted against every state
budget since 1994, and he is staunchly anti-abortion, having
suggested in one fund-raising letter earlier this year that he
would ``support all efforts to defund the abortion industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with voters in the district suggested that many are
only beginning to focus on the race. Several said the tax
reductions advocated by Koster and other Republicans did not hold a
lot of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tax cut, that's not as important as knowing your Medicare
coverage will be there, knowing Social Security is sound,'' said
Sherry Andrews, 51, a human resources administrator at Boeing here
in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   But Kate Stannard, 63, a former schoolteacher from Mukilteo, a
town just south of here, echoed many voters who brought up cultural
issues that they said made them lean toward the Republicans and
could energize the turnout for Koster. ``I think children are being
brought up in an amoral world,'' she said. ``We need to teach
values in the schools. That's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor at play is Vice President Al Gore's rising
standing in some statewide polls, which, if it holds here, could
give Koster less of a bounce than some analysts were predicting
earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I've heard a lot of theories on this,'' said Koster.
``Of course, when Bush's numbers were much higher, everyone
expected there'd be coattails. But we're running this campaign like
it all depends on us. If there are coattails, that's fine and
dandy, but I'm not counting on it.''

HEWLETT-PACKARD PRESENTS A BIG NEW COMPUTER CALLED `SUPERDOME'
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Conn.) By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After months of buildup, the Hewlett-Packard Co. on
Tuesday rolled out the powerful computer it is counting on to lift
sales to e-commerce operations, multinational companies, and
Internet service providers that need systems capable of handling
vast amounts of data around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Carleton S. Fiorina, Hewlett-Packard's president and chief
executive, hailed the new server computer, called Superdome, as a
sign that the company has been ``reinvented'' as a more
customer-oriented vendor. At an event on Wall Street, the company
emphasized not only the new product but a revamping of its sales
force to provide extensive pre-purchase consulting and a pricing
system that allows customers to peg costs to their computing needs
instead of the machines' capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina did not mention the company's current negotiations to
acquire the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers for as much as
$18 billion, but analysts said that such a deal would be consistent
with the vision involved in designing and marketing the new server.
</P>
<P>
   Superdome appeared to have little impact on investor worries
that such a deal would dilute earnings. The company's stock fell
$1.44, to $112.56 in trading on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement by the computer maker, based in Palo
Alto, Calif., completes a two-year effort to revamp its line of
servers that run on Unix, an operating system that Hewlett-Packard
mistakenly believed was falling out of favor in the mid-1990s. Sun
Microsystems seized on that opening to become the leading vendor of
such servers, and Hewlett-Packard _ along with rivals like IBM and
Compaq _ has been struggling to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard said that 16 of the new servers had been
installed at customer sites and that 150 more were on order but
that volume production would not begin until next quarter. Basic
units will cost about $400,000, while more powerful configurations
with better support packages will cost several times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Several early customers on hand for the event said they had been
impressed by the speed and ease of installing the
refrigerator-sized server, which Hewlett-Packard said had been a
major design goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been remarkably stable,'' said Vincent McKoy, a
chemistry professor at the California Institute of Technology, who
has been using a Superdome to do mathematical analyses of the
properties of materials used by the semiconductor industry. Other
early users include Amazon.com and General Motors in the United
States and Mobilkom, the largest cellular phone company in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said it was too soon to predict whether
Hewlett-Packard could dent Sun's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``HP will have a six- to nine-month window of high-end
performance leadership,'' said Brian P. Richardson, an analyst at
META Group in Stamford, Conn. But the complicated pricing
strategies Hewlett-Packard is pursuing might keep some potential
customers from buying quickly, he said. Sun is expected to begin
upgrading its servers this fall, with substantial improvements in
its high-end system likely next summer, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   One clear indicator of Sun's strong position in the marketplace
has been the differing reaction of customers to pending new product
introductions, said Donald Young, who follows the server markets
for PaineWebber. Hewlett-Packard's sales of high-end servers sagged
while customers waited for Superdome. By contrast, Sun's sales of
such products have continued to soar even though its new line is
expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   Computer sales, including notebooks and personal computers as
well as servers, accounted for about $5.17 billion of
Hewlett-Packard's $11.82 billion in revenue in its most recent
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares fell 11 percent the day after the earnings report, a
decline attributed largely to disappointment with server sales.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the Superdome, Hewlett-Packard claimed that it
outperformed Sun's current offerings by 30 percent. But it conceded
that it would be several weeks before it had figures from
industry-standard testing to back up its claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while at the high end to show what these systems
really can do,'' said Jeffrey J. Hewitt, an analyst at Gartner
Dataquest in San Jose, Calif.

 &HT;    Making jobs work for women
 &HT;    By Stephanie Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At Cross Country TravCorps, a Boca Raton
medical staffing company, a woman not only heads the largest
division but works four days a week. Job sharing isn't limited by
geography _ women who live as far apart as Florida and Connecticut
split work.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Commission on the Status of Women named Cross
Country the state's top large employer for women during a news
conference Tuesday at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach. The
commission also announced top employers in the small and government
employer categories as part of its seventh annual Best Florida
Employers for Working Women competition.
</P>
<P>
   Large employers include companies with more than 50 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Winners were culled from 92 entries by industrial psychologist
Deborah Johnson, who as a pregnant mother of two, works from home.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second accolade Cross Country has received this month.
</P>
<P>
   The October issue of Working Mother magazine picked the company
as one of the top 100 employers nationally for moms. Cross Country
employs about 500, of which 80 percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   Cross Country's Chief Executive Joseph A. Boshart said strong
financial results and a family-friendly work environment have gone
hand-in-hand. Revenue has grown 25 percent a year, reaching $400
million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cross Country has offered employees flexible
work hours, six months' maternity leave, on-site personal trainers
and yoga classes and lactation rooms for nursing mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The measures also build employee loyalty. When he joined Cross
Country in 1993, turnover reached as high as 80 percent. Now, it's
about 10 percent, Boshart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of employers are reluctant to give employees
flexibility ... but our experience is people work harder to make it
work,'' Boshart said.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Anenberg, who works four days a week, heads a division
that pulls in 80 percent of the company's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Boshart said he would pit her productivity against any manager
who works a full work week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she said she wanted to work two days a week, I'd give it to
her because she'll just become that much more efficient,'' Boshart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also recognized 13 other Florida companies and
governmental agencies lauded for providing benefits that include
on-site schools and even an on-site day care staffed with nurses
for sick children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many companies out there doing the right thing by
women,'' said commission member Patricia Clements.

AS COSTS SOAR, BUSINESS TRAVEL DEPARTMENTS REVISE POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication notice: also sent with `t' code)  
 By JOE SHARKEY  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Lately, dealing with my corporate travel department is like
being pecked to death by a duck,'' said a senior executive I know
who travels more than 100,000 miles a year on business and feels
that he is being increasingly second-guessed by the bean counters
when he tries to exercise some personal choice in his airline and
hotel arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint is a common one. As business-travel costs soar,
many travel departments are revamping existing travel policies or
drafting new ones and insisting on more strict adherence to them.
The importance of compliance to these policies has increased
significantly, according to American Express Co.'s latest annual
survey on business travel costs.
</P>
<P>
   What used to be a simple matter of buying an airplane ticket or
booking a hotel room has become a complicated algorithm requiring
the manipulation of prices, discounts, rebates, supplies,
technologies, schedules, demands, preferences, procedures and
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   By necessity, travel departments are becoming increasingly
aggressive and creative in keeping costs under control, said Rusty
Carpenter, the vice president for American Express Consulting
Services, a unit of American Express Co. that helps corporations
manage travel and purchasing expenses.
</P>
<P>
   At many companies, travel departments now more than ever are
dictating who you fly, what you drive, when you leave, where you
stay and why you need to adhere to the rules.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to hear from readers describing their experiences n
good or bad n with new company travel policies. Meanwhile, let's
give the travel departments their due and look at what they're
facing.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in the United States spent about $185 billion on
business travel last year, according to the Institute of Business
Travel Management. That compares with $70 billion in 1982, when
such costs were first tracked. World-wide, about $396 billion is
spent annually on business travel, according to Marianne McInerney,
the executive director of the National Business Travel Association.
</P>
<P>
   The American Express survey, Trends and Forecasts for the
Business Travel Industry: Preview 2001, estimates that business air
fares, hotel rates and car rentals are all expected to rise by at
least 5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Business air fares, which American Express said rose 8 percent
in the second quarter compared with the same period last year, are
volatile. So it's difficult to predict that 5 percent is all they
will rise. Major carriers recently hiked fares, blaming fuel costs.
The survey noted that proposed and potential mergers among carriers
here and abroad can radically alter the competitive landscape of
the airline industry, possibly leading to even higher fares.
</P>
<P>
   The average booked price for hotels also rose 8 percent in the
second quarter and is expected to increase 6 percent next year
domestically (and 3 percent internationally), American Express
said. But prices are increasing more in high-demand business
cities. In the first quarter of this year, for example, average
room-rates booked in New York, Boston and Houston rose about 10
percent. In Miami, the rate hike was over 15 percent. In Europe,
increases averaged over 20 percent in cities such as Florence,
Paris, Rome and Athens.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every Thursday evening, Marilyn Robinson, executive director of
the Nashville Minority Business Center, drives from her office to
the Gore-Lieberman campaign headquarters and works the phones for
three hours, canvassing voters throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what I do at work is persuading others to fund and
support our various programs. It's no different with potential
voters,'' said Robinson, who also puts in a Saturday morning shift
at Gore headquarters. ``I like that I bring what I do best, selling
and speaking, into the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   And those aren't the only management skills she taps into. She
also enlists help from her network of friends and business
associates, including members of 100 Black Women, a local social
group.
</P>
<P>
   For all the frenzied fund-raising by Democrats and Republicans
this year, candidates for offices from the the White House to the
local school board know one thing is even more important than
money: volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   And while these unpaid armies are made up mostly of students and
retired people, it is business professionals who exhibit the
qualities that political candidates value most: nuts-and-bolts
organizational skills, management savvy and address books crammed
with contacts.
</P>
<P>
   To campaign managers, these executives are golden because they
can get things done. Consider Jose Forquet, a 34-year-old vice
president at Goldman, Sachs in New York, and Joe Bogosian, a
35-year-old lawyer at McGuire Woods Consulting in Washington. A
couple of years ago, Forquet, an independent, and Bogosian, a
Republican, each had a plan to promote George W. Bush for president
by creating advocacy groups _ of Hispanic executives in Forquet's
case, and of young professionals in Bogosian's.
</P>
<P>
   But then the men were introduced to each other in late 1998 by a
mutual friend who knew of their political activism, and before long
they had developed a more ambitious project. Working with a Bush
campaign official, they drafted a proposal for creating an e-mail
database to recruit corporate managers, lawyers and other young
professionals to take part in fund-raisers and other activities for
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, they traveled at their own expense to Bush's
campaign headquarters in Austin, Texas, to seek its official
endorsement. ``The exact same skills required of selling a start-up
firm to venture capitalists applied'' in winning over the Bush camp
to the idea, Bogosian said.
</P>
<P>
   They got the green light, and YP4W.com _ or Young Professionals
for George W. Bush _ was born, along with a national networking
organization of the same name with chapters in 30 cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from our research that there were many people out
there like us,'' Forquet said. ``A market clearly existed.''
</P>
<P>
   The site was so successful, in fact, that the Bush campaign took
it over and now runs it out of Austin as part of a coalition of Web
sites and voter groups. Forquet and Bogosian continue to head the
New York and Washington chapters of the networking organization.
</P>
<P>
   While few managers can boast of such influence on a national
scale, most can have a big impact on the state or local level.
Laura Dambier, a senior strategist for Lincoln Financial Group in
Hartford, Conn., for example, has no doubts that she is making a
difference in the re-election effort of state Rep. Jessie Stratton,
a Democrat. Dambier spent the greater part of Labor Day assigning
volunteers to task forces and revising calendars for the final
stretch of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely draw from a wide repertoire of skills,'' Dambier
said. She has been active in numerous political races in the past,
she said, and the two biggest tasks in almost every case were the
same ones that corporate managers face every day: setting
priorities and motivating people.
</P>
<P>
   `As you enter the final, crucial weeks, volunteers may begin to
lose interest and therefore need to be refocused on the mission of
our campaign beyond simply garnering votes,'' she said. ``In some
cases, you might reassign duties.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing presence of business professionals is not lost on
campaign managers and indeed presents them with something of a
challenge. ``Working volunteers come into a campaign motivated but
are extremely busy people themselves. They want their investment in
time and effort to pay off,'' said Catherine Shaw, the Democratic
mayor of Ashland, Ore., and the author of a how-to book on
conducting local campaigns. ``Campaign managers need to know what
competencies and connections they bring to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate her point, Shaw described how a volunteer, a
manager in the hospitality industry, recently pulled disparate
databases and segmented voters for follow-up direct-marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even political neophytes have high expectations of themselves if
they have a business background. Rochelle Pachtman, founder of the
public relations firm Pachtman Communications in Manhattan, says
she jumped into the fray just a few weeks ago to lend a hand to the
Gore campaign because the race was so tight and she thought she
might actually make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for my marching orders,'' Pachtman said. When she
gets them, she says, she believes she will be able to leverage her
communications skills as well as tap into her expertise in the
industries and issues she has researched over time on behalf of her
clients. For example, she says, she could coach campaign volunteers
on how to put their points across when they are making phone calls
or knocking on doors to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volunteers, especially inexperienced ones, want feedback on
how they are performing,'' Pachtman said, ``to know that they are
doing a good job and find ways to improve on it.'' &QL;

RENO TROUBLED BY DEATH-PENALTY STATISTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Wis.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying she was ``sorely troubled'' by stark racial
disparities in the federal death penalty, Attorney General Janet
Reno on Monday ordered U.S. attorneys to help explain why capital
punishment is not applied uniformly across ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must ensure that all defendants who come into our system
are treated in a fair and just manner,'' Reno said in announcing
the results of a survey that showed three-quarters of the
defendants considered for the federal death penalty were members of
minorities. ``We must do all we can in the federal government to
root out bias at every step.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the data compiled by the Justice Department raised no
questions about the innocence of defendants and therefore did not
merit a moratorium on the death penalty. But critics seized on the
data to buttress their calls for an immediate halt to federal
executions, the last of which was in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as we feared, the same serious flaws in the
administration of the death penalty that have plagued the states
also afflict the federal death penalty,'' said Sen. Russell D.
Feingold, D-Wis. ``Let's temporarily suspend federal executions and
let a thoughtfully chosen commission examine the system. American
ideals of justice demand that much.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Feingold said the senator would introduce legislation
this week calling for such a moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst sort of racial profiling with the worst
result,'' said Julian Bond, the chairman of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``This argues
strongly for a federal moratorium until there can be assurances
this can be applied fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, said the study required
follow-up. ``We've seen the numbers,'' he said. ``At first glance,
those numbers are troubling. We need to know more about exactly
what's behind the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistical survey examined the ethnicity of the defendants
in 713 capital punishment cases since the federal death penalty was
reinstated in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, when a formal review process was put in place, 80
percent of the 682 defendants who faced capital charges were
minorities. United States attorneys recommended the death penalty
for 183 defendants, 74 percent of whom were minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but be both personally and professionally
disturbed by the numbers that we discuss today,'' Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder said. ``To be sure, many factors have led to
the disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic minorities
throughout the federal death-penalty process. Nevertheless, no one
reading this report can help but be disturbed, troubled, by this
disparity.''
</P>
<P>
   States executed 4,400 people from 1930 to 1999, according to the
Justice Department, compared with 33 federal executions since 1930.
</P>
<P>
   As of the end of 1998, there were 3,433 people with death
sentences in the states, compared with 19 people with pending
federal executions, the study said. Legislation approved by
Congress in 1994 and 1996 added more than 40 new offenses to the
list of capital crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Reno imposed a tighter review of death cases in 1995, requiring
U.S. attorneys to submit to the Justice Department's headquarters
all cases for which the death penalty is an option. Capital
punishment can be pursued only with the approval of Reno and a
panel of senior officials. The data released on Tuesday, however,
showed that defendants from minorities make up the bulk of those
cases that appear on Reno's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said an even broader study was required to determine
whether ``bias'' played a role in the system. She called for a
study of the problem by outside experts, and said Holder would lead
a review of homicide cases handled by states versus those handled
by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The other findings in the study included these:
</P>
<P>
   _ U.S. attorneys in 49 of the country's 94 judicial districts
have submitted cases that were eligible for the death penalty to
the Justice Department since 1995. Ten of the 49 districts
submitted recommendations in favor of the death penalty. About 40
percent of the 682 death-penalty cases submitted for review came
from five of the U.S. attorney districts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The victims of those who faced the prospect of the federal
death penalty were more likely to be black than white. Of the 894
victims involved in cases where the death penalty was considered,
53 percent were black, 31 percent were white, 13 percent were
Hispanic and 3 percent were other groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blacks were more likely to face the death penalty for
interracial homicides than whites. Of the 177 defendants who faced
the death penalty for killing a victim of another race since 1955,
55 percent of them were black, 25 percent were Hispanic, 11 percent
were white and 8 percent were other.
</P>
<P>
   David Bruck of the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel
Project, a federally funded program to assist court-appointed
lawyers in federal death-penalty cases, praised Reno for collecting
the facts but said the system is clearly flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No state in America, not Mississippi, not Texas, not South
Carolina, has produced such a racially lop-sided death sentencing
record as has the federal government,'' Bruck said. ``It's obvious
that the time for a moratorium on the federal death penalty has
arrived.''

 &HT;    Subliminal debate out in the open again
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of Americans smoke Camel cigarettes. It has little to
do with nicotine, flavor _ or even the Joe Camel character, claims
Wilson Bryan Key.
</P>
<P>
   It has everything to do with a little man hidden in the shadows
of the picture of a camel on the pack of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a phallic symbol,'' Key maintains. ``And that's why Camel
has sold millions of cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Key, one of a handful of gurus in the field, is talking about
subliminal advertising. It's advertising you can't consciously
detect _ a word flashed too quickly to see, an image hidden within
another image, an imperceptible sound _ and it supposedly holds a
powerful sway over human behavior. And it's illegal on broadcast
TV, even though it's never been proven to work.
</P>
<P>
   Believers say it makes people smoke. It may even make them vote
Republican, judging by the furor that erupted Tuesday when it was
revealed that an anti-Gore campaign ad contains the word ``rats''
shown for a fraction of a second.
</P>
<P>
   The adman who created the commercial, Alex Castellanos, called
the insertion of the word ``purely accidental.'' Democratic
strategists howled that was not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the suggestion that the GOP was trying to plant a
secret message harks back to the Red Scare of the 1950s, when
so-called subliminal advertising was first perceived as a public
menace.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``subliminal advertising'' entered the language in
1957 when adman James Vicary was profiled in Vance Packard's expose
``The Hidden Persuaders,'' which darkly portrayed the motives of
Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Vicary supposedly had designed a ``subliminal projection
machine'' and successfully tested it at a movie theater in Fort
Lee, N.J. During a six-week period, Vicary claimed, he blipped the
words ``Hungry? Eat Popcorn'' and ``Drink Coca-Cola'' on the screen
every five minutes during the showing of the film ``Picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   The words flashed so quickly the audience didn't realize they
were there. Meantime, Coke sales jumped 18 percent and popcorn
sales 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a national sensation,'' says Texas professor John
Murphy, who has studied the history and effectiveness of subliminal
advertising. ``Unfortunately, it was all a hoax. Vicary recanted
his story years later. He made it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Vicary, a Maine TV station tested a subliminal
message _ ``If you have seen this message, write WTWO'' _ but
abandoned it after a few weeks when there was no increase in mail.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Congress got into the act, led by Rep. William Dawson, a
Utah Republican, who asked the Federal Communications Commission to
ban the advertising from TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contemplate, if you will,'' warned Dawson, ``the effect of an
invisible but effective appeal to `drink more beer' being poured
into the subconscious of teenage television viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC resisted a ban, saying it wasn't sure it had the
authority. Evidence continued to mount that subliminal ads didn't
work anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian broadcasters flashed the hidden message ``telephone
now'' 352 times during a half-hour show. Of 500 viewers surveyed
afterward, only one reported the urge to make a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the issue flared again when an announcer on the CBS
show ``To Tell The Truth'' joked that audience was being fed
subliminal ads during the program credits. In 1973, after
complaints of a TV station that inserted the subliminal message
``Get It'' at the end of a commercial, the FCC finally did make
subliminal broadcast advertising illegal _ ``whether effective or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was mainly Key who kept the issue alive in the
public mind, authoring five books on the subject. His best known,
now out of print, is ``Subliminal Seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff works with a vengeance,'' Key said Tuesday in a
telephone interview from his home near Reno, Nev. ``The only
mistake Castellanos made was he made it too obvious. You shouldn't
be able to see it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Key claims that advertisers still use the technique, inserting
images imperceptibly using digital technology. But he can't cite a
specific ad. ``I don't watch much TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of subliminal advertising is well enough known that
everybody got the joke when ``Saturday Night Live'' featured a
regular character, Subliminal Man, who uttered ``hot sex'' and
other come-ons under his breath while carrying on outwardly
innocent conversations.
</P>
<P>
   And earler this year, English advertising agency Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi was accused of inserting Satanic images into the
backgrounds of a Toyota commercial that aired in France. The agency
denied anything intentional, but edited the images out of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer psychologist Carol Moog, who does work for Nabisco and
Lever Brothers, says people already feel so manipulated by
advertising, especially political advertising, they want to believe
there are subliminal ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get asked about it all the time, as if it's a current
strategy in advertising,'' she says. ``They believe it exists
because it validates their worries about not being in control of
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Murphy says subliminal advertising is an ``urban
myth'' that won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that Vicary, the supposed originator of the
practice, disappeared long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's sure where Vicary is now,'' jokes Murphy. ``Maybe
he's working for the Republican National Committee.''

   Dresdner Bank in Talks to Buy Wasserstein Perella
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein Perella is in advanced talks to be acquired by
Dresdner Bank of Germany and, if the two can come to terms on
price, a deal could be announced in three to five days, a person
close to the talks said. If an agreement is reached, it would be
the symbolic end of the swachbuckling style of deal-making
celebrated in the 1980's, which has been replaced by a blander type
of investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Company Teaches Tax Avoidance
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials say that abusive corporate tax shelters are
the government's biggest tax enforcement problem, costing billions
of dollars annually. Now a company called the Tax People is
teaching similar tax avoidance techniques to middle-class Americans
and says it has already signed up 50,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett Rolls Out New Computer
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard rolled out the powerful computer it is counting
on to lift sales to companies that need systems capable of handling
huge amounts of data around the clock. Carly S. Fiorina,
Hewlett-Packard's chief executive, hailed the new computer, called
Superdome, as a symbol of the company's claim that it has been
``reinvented'' as a more customer-oriented vendor selling solutions
rather than products. Fiorina did not mention the company's talks
to acquire the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, but
analysts said that such a deal would be consistent with the vision
involved in Superdome. Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell $2.19, to
$112.56.
</P>
<P>
   Merger of Exchanges Abandoned
</P>
<P>
   The London Stock Exchange scrapped its proposal to merge with
the Frankfurt stock exchange, abandoning for now an effort to
create the first pan-European stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King Puts Account in Review
</P>
<P>
   Burger King placed the creative duties for its general market
advertising account, involving assignments with billings estimated
at $400 million, in review. The incumbent agency, the New York
office of Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners Worldwide, is being invited to
participate in the review, but the company said it would be
expected to offer a drastically new approach to the account.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq Declines, but Dow Edges Up
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks declined, but blue chips rose modestly, driven
by the surging shares of J.P. Morgan. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 46.84 points, or 1.2 percent, to 3,849.51. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 37.74 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,233.23.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was down 7.27 points, or 0.5
percent, to 1,481.99.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a Supportive Atmosphere
</P>
<P>
   Royal Farros, the chief executive of iPrint.com, an online
printing service, says managing a company involves a lot of the
same expectations and feelings as having pets. Creating a loving,
affectionate home for pets is similar to fostering an active
environment where employees feel important and influential.
Building such a culture is not just critical to the personality of
an organization, he says, but absolutely key to its livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Political Volunteers in White Collars
</P>
<P>
   For all the fund raising by Democrats and Republicans this year,
candidates for offices from the the White House to the local school
board know one thing is even more important than money: volunteers.
And while these unpaid armies are made up mostly of students and
retired people, it is business professionals who exhibit the
qualities that political candidates value most: nuts-and-bolts
organizational skills, management savvy and address books filled
with contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Travel Departments Toughen Limits
</P>
<P>
   With estimates that business air fares, hotel rates and car
rentals will rise by at least 5 percent next year, many travel
departments are revamping travel policies or drafting new ones _
and insisting on more strict adherence to them.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Transportation secretary seeks more power from Senate panel,
while Ford, Firestone point fingers
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JENNIFER HOYT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater asked
lawmakers Tuesday to expand his agency's authority to investigate
and penalize companies for violating vehicle and tire safety rules
as officials from Ford and Firestone tried to blame the other for a
series of fatal car crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like tying two cats by the tail and throwing them over
the clothesline and letting them claw each other,'' Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., said about the Ford and Firestone feud that was
aired during a hearing before Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel was the third in less than a week to summon
Transportation officials and executives from Firestone/Bridgestone
and Ford Motor Corp. to discuss the recall last month of 6.5
million Firestone tires. The recall was issued in the wake of
vehicle crashes in which 88 people have been killed and another 250
injured in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to fend off criticism that his agency was slow to
order the recall, Slater said the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration needs broader investigative authority to detect and
avoid hazards similar to the Firestone tire case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of no clearer case in which this message must be
heard,'' Slater said. ``We must look to the future and guard
against any repetition of tragedies caused by defective vehicles or
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Commerce Committee, said the
case points up the need to strengthen the transportation agency's
authority. ``Currently, NHTSA plays the role of a toothless and
declawed cat in a game of cat and mouse with automakers,'' said
McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Slater wants Congress to increase civil penalties for defective
products, require manufactures to provide free remedies to
consumers for a longer period of time, and require manufactures to
test their products as part of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation secretary also wants the agency to have the
authority to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Require companies to alert U.S. officials to defects in their
vehicles or equipment overseas if that information relates to
vehicles or equipment here.
</P>
<P>
   -- Collect from foreign governments and organizations
information relating to defective products that could be present
here.
</P>
<P>
   -- Get claims, warranty and adjustment data from manufacturers
and companies that produce original equipment, as well as claims
information from insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Slater also encouraged lawmakers to allow the agency to devise a
system for providing consumers with guidance on the possibility of
vehicle rollovers. The Senate's version of the transportation
spending bill for 2001 would bar the agency from developing a
rollover rating system.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's hearing, Ford President and CEO Jacques Nasser
blasted Bridgestone/Firestone for not sharing information about
tire defects sooner. Nasser said he was surprised last week when
Firestone officials testified that they had been aware of tread
separation problems two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the candid and frank dialogue that Ford expects in
its business relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bridgestone/Firestone Executive Vice President John Lampe
said tire and vehicle problems should be investigated together. He
suggested that Ford's recommended tire pressure of 26 pounds per
square inch may have led to the tire failure. Bridgestone/Firestone
recommends tire pressure of 30 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take full responsibility, senators, when a tire fails
because of a defect,'' Lampe said. ``We firmly believe, however,
that the tire is only part of the overall safety problem shown by
these tragic accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA Administrator Sue Bailey said she thought the problem was
with tires, but that the agency was still investigating the
vehicle-tire interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Herb
Kohl, D-Wis., announced they would introduce a bill to increase
civil penalties for withholding information from NHTSA. Their bill
also would set criminal penalties for companies that knowingly
allow defective vehicles or parts to be distributed if death or
injury results.
</P>
<P>
   The Feinstein-Kohl bill would increase civil penalties for
withholding information from NHTSA and for failing to recall
defective vehicles or parts from $1,000 per violation to $10,000
per violation. It also would eliminate the maximum penalty, now set
at $925,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When consumer health and safety are at issue, there cannot be
any question that the American public deserves full, open and
complete disclosure,'' Kohl said. ``Anything less endangers each
and every one of us, and our measure _ with its tough penalties _
will take defective products off the market.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bridgestone/Firestone, 2 million of the 6.5 million
P235/75R15-size ATX, ATX II and similarly sized Wilderness AT tires
recalled on Aug. 9 have been replaced.

DEAL PARTLY ROOTED IN MORGAN'S FAILURE TO CHANGE WITH THE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHASE-MORGAN, CHASE-BANKS-HISTORY) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly a century ago, the House of Morgan and its
founder, J. Pierpont Morgan, preserved the American financial
system in the midst of a widespread panic.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the best efforts of the bank that bears J.P.
Morgan's name, in recent years it could not preserve itself.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years J.P. Morgan has undergone a remarkable
renovation, infusing what had become a sleepy bank devoted simply
to lending money to big governments and corporations with the
pioneering spirit of the House of Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was the first modern American commercial bank to break
out of the restrictions imposed on banking in the 1930s during the
Depression, becoming a contender on Wall Street by underwriting
stock offerings and advising on gigantic mergers. But as much as
the company strained to reclaim its former glory, it was not able
to find a comfortable position in the modern financial world. So
Morgan put itself on the block, talking with a number of banks
around the world before closing in on a deal to be acquired by
Chase Manhattan for about $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, analysts said, Morgan's downfall may be that it
tried too hard to remain what its founder had built _ a
behind-the-scenes adviser to the richest and most powerful, with a
driven but insular culture. It shied away from the wave of banking
mergers so prevalent in recent years. And Morgan found it had
become an anachronism in a financial world dominated by mass rather
than class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody like them is succeeding,'' said Alden Toevs, an
executive vice president of First Manhattan Consulting Group. ``The
companies they are competing with are just much bigger in terms of
capital and product lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is not alone. In just the last two months, two other
midsized Wall Street firms _ Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and
PaineWebber _ also agreed to be bought, both by huge diversified
Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, J.P. Morgan is giving up its independence only a
year after its biggest regulatory burden _ the Glass-Steagall Act _
was lifted. Passed in 1933, the law separated commercial and
investment banking and forced the Morgan Stanley brokerage firm to
be split from J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1970s, the Morgan bank was content to lend money to
big governments and corporations and to manage the assets of the
heirs to the fortunes of the turn-of-the-century robber barons and
other wealthy individuals. But as its big corporate borrowers were
able to raise money directly by issuing stocks and bonds, the
company realized its traditional business was wasting away.
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice of changing its clients or changing its
products, declared former chairman Lewis Preston in the 1980s, J.P.
Morgan should offer its existing clients the ability to trade
securities and agree to underwrite their financial offerings. This
set in motion a game of cat and mouse with Congress and the banking
regulators as Morgan found more and more regulatory loopholes that
allowed it to act more and more like a brokerage firm. Indeed, when
Congress finally repealed Glass-Steagall last year, Morgan had
already become much more like its old partner, Morgan Stanley, than
a traditional commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
   But repeal freed Morgan's competitors to go after its business,
even as it accelerated the mergers among its rivals. Morgan
executives, in the bank's exhaustively deliberate style, studied
and stewed over myriad possible combinations, but never were
willing to dilute what they saw as the company's unique culture and
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the last bank on Wall Street that wanted to surrender
its independence, and in retrospect this proved to be a real
handicap,'' said Ron Chernow, the author of ``The House of
Morgan,'' the definitive history of the bank. ``The other
commercial banks weren't hampered by a sense of tradition and were
able to grow at greater speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Chernow noted, Morgan had the highest stock
market value of any bank in the country. Now its value is one tenth
of the biggest, Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   The financial world is increasingly dominated by two kinds of
institutions. On one side are investment banking powerhouses _
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch, perhaps
Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank _ that manage the raising of
capital, brokering of mergers and trading of anything with a price.
Competition in this business is so intense that even successful
second-tier players are choosing to sell to larger rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The second sort of giant that has evolved out of the commercial
banks are financial conglomerates that sell all manner of
investments, loans, deposits and insurance. The archetype of this
company is now Citigroup, which incorporates Morgan's longtime
rival Citibank, along with the Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney
brokerage firms and the Travelers insurance company. And the
corporate parent of the entire conglomerate is the antithesis of
everything Morgan: Commercial Credit Corp., which began by lending
money to lower income people before it was transformed into a
global leader by the driven deal making of its leader, Sanford I.
Weill.
</P>
<P>
   While Morgan has managed to crack the the Top 10 in annual score
cards of underwriting and advisory deals, it has never been able to
climb to the very top where the bulk of the profits are earned.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, in some ways was trapped by its earlier success doing
business with tycoons and the Fortune 500, Chernow said, and
couldn't take advantage of the burgeoning markets managing the
money of Main Street Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt their competitive advantage was to trade on the
romanticism and illustrious tradition that no one could match,''
Chernow said. ``But when the entire world of Wall Street was going
down market, they felt that by lessening their standards they would
water down their mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Morgan's focus on the very largest corporate
customers left it with little involvement in the most dynamic
sector of the economy in recent years, small technology firms.

</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Morgan has tried to address these flaws with
modest efforts. It started an Internet business meant to serve the
affluent rather than the truly wealthy. And it tried to get
involved in financing Internet companies. But the results have been
mixed. One of Morgan's most prominent Internet deals was the
financing of Boo.com, an ambitious attempt to create a global Web
site selling women's sportswear. Morgan helped Boo gain investments
from some of the most wealthy families in Europe, but after running
through $135 million, Boo was liquidated earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is now likely to see itself become a part of Chase, an
agglomeration of banks that had hardly been in its league. To be
sure, some of the ancestors of the current Chase bank have their
own storied histories. The Bank of Manhattan Co., after all, was
founded in 1799 as a water company. And Chase in the 1970s, run by
David Rockefeller, was a leading banker to the Arab world. But the
institution now using the Chase name was formed when two
underperforming New York banks _ Chemical Bank and Manufacturers
Hanover _ merged in 1991 as a way to preserve capital drained by a
decade of over indulgent lending. In 1995, what was then called
Chemical bought Chase, which itself was struggling to meet Wall
Street's profit goals. Chemical was clearly in control but took the
more prestigious name.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a history of making acquisitions and integrating
them successfully that is enviable in an industry that has not done
this well,'' Toevs said. Still, Chase, with its extensive branches
and its wide ranging clientele, relies on a corporate culture drawn
more from the streets of New York than of the rarified air breathed
by those at Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Morgan folks are always wearing their elite status on
their sleeves,'' Toevs said. ``That's got to help the Chase
franchise.''

   Gore, Lieberman ride school bus through Ohio talking about
education
</P>
<P>
   By PATTY REINERT
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore took a
campaign swing through southwestern Ohio on a yellow school bus
Tuesday to draw attention to his $170 billion education plan.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.,
Gore greeted students arriving for classes at Anna K. Wantz Middle
School in Miamisburg Tuesday morning. The vice president told them
that he and Republican opponent George W. Bush agree that decisions
involving schools should be made at the local level, and both
believe in making schools more accountable for their performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is the plan that Joe Lieberman and I are
putting out starts with accountability but doesn't end there,''
Gore said. ``What we're proposing is a comprehensive approach that
focuses first of all on the classroom,'' he said, rattling off his
proposals for recruiting 100,000 new teachers and paying and
training them better, reducing class sizes, fixing dilapidated
schools and hooking them to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, which would cost more than $170 billion over the
next decade, also calls for universal preschool for all 3- and
4-year-olds, making college tuition tax-deductible and providing
lifelong skills training to help workers keep up with rapidly
changing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would increase spending by $48 billion, focusing primarily
on literacy programs, scholarships and grants. He proposes stiffer
standards for accountability than Gore does. And he would offer
parents more flexibility in choosing schools _ including vouchers
for students of poor parents in failing schools, an idea Gore
rejects as harmful to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president noted that he is not proposing as extensive a
tax cut as Bush _ a cut Gore says benefits mostly the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one reason we will not go along with that is that it would
take away the chance we have now to use our prosperity to help lift
up the schools,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman then loaded a group of students, teachers and
parents onto a bus motorcade and held a rolling discussion on
school violence, class size and teacher salaries during the
50-minute ride to a high school in Middletown.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, they stopped to greet a marching band and other
supporters in Franklin, ate lunch with high schoolers in Middletown
and attended a rainy rally at a technical and community college in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Gore gave only slight mention to the day's big campaign flap,
over a Republican National Committee television ad in which the
word ``RATS'' flashes briefly in front of text on the screen
criticizing Gore's prescription drug plan for those on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a disappointing development,'' Gore said during a
quick stop along his route. ``I've never seen anything like it. I
think the ad speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the ad's producers denied any effort to send a
subliminal message.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Gore flew to Philadelphia for a fund-raising
concert featuring entertainers Cher and Michael Bolton, which was
expected to raise more than $800,000 for the Democratic National
Committee. Today, (WEDNESDAY) he will continue his education
campaign tour in Maine before attending a fund-raising concert by
singer James Taylor in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch in Middletown, Gore and Lieberman moved to the high
school's gymnasium where they were greeted by a band and a crowd of
students, faculty and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing Gore, Lieberman told the students that the election
``is not about us or our opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about you and your future _ what's good for you,''
Lieberman said. He gave Gore a hug as the crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all of you to be able to reach your full potential by
having access to the best education possible,'' Gore told the
students.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave his standard stump speech on prescription drugs,
health care, environment and balancing the budget, and he asked
students to ``think long and hard about what it means to be an
American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody here tells you it doesn't make any difference what
happens in elections, if anybody tells you that politics is
something you should stay way away from, don't listen to that,'' he
said, ``because for all the problems in government and politics, it
is what we make it, and it is going to be what you make it.''

TEXAS ADOPTS STRONGER RULES GOVERNING PIPELINES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By NEIL STRASSMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first in a series of tough new rules to protect Texans from
natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline disasters were adopted
Tuesday by state officials.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, approved by the Texas Railroad Commission, cover
plastic pipes used to transport natural gas _ the type of pipe that
ruptured in January, killing three people in the Dallas suburb of
Garland.
</P>
<P>
   More frequent and thorough inspections of intrastate lines and
stiffer penalties for failing to call the state for pipeline
locations before digging,
</P>
<P>
   are proposals expected to come before the commission later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   An Abilene police detective died Friday, one day after a
bulldozer ruptured a 12-inch steel pipeline sending a propane cloud
across a highway. Jay Hatcher, 42, suffered fatal burns after the
cloud ignited. A woman at a home destroyed by a wall of flames
barely escaped by diving into a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety must be our number one priority,'' Railroad Commission
Chairman Michael Williams said of the state's 250,000 miles of
pipelines. ``In light of what we found in Garland, we need an
inventory of information and materials so that we can direct
removal and replacement if there is a danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules adopted by the commission, natural gas
pipeline operators must:
</P>
<P>
   _ Note each failure of plastic pipe in an annual report to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disclose in a new construction report the type of pipe,
operating pressure and route, at least 30 days before building five
miles or more of pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inventory by 2005, the amount, type and location of all
plastic pipe being used to transport natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction with one type of pipe,''
Commissioner Tony Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of pipeline fatalities and injuries are
caused by breaks in natural gas lines, which make up 90 percent of
the nation's 2.2 million miles of pipeline, according to government
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the natural gas and propane explosions of the past 30
years have been traced to problems with cracking in early versions
of polyethylene pipe introduced in the late 1960s. As the pipe
ages, it becomes brittle and susceptible to damage from extreme
temperature changes and adjacent rocks.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, the crack-prone plastic pipe was banned,
replaced by more pliable, longer-lasting pipe made from modern
plastic resins, said Rich Gottwald, executive director of the
Plastics Pipe Institute, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the gas companies now use plastic,'' he said, adding
that some larger diameter high-pressure pipe is steel.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a 30-inch diameter steel natural gas pipeline owned
by the Houston-based El Paso Natural Gas Co. ruptured at the Pecos
River in rural southeastern New Mexico, killing 12 people in three
related families camping nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators discovered corrosion in the pipeline that
exploded and federal records show that the company has had 30
corrosion- related accidents since 1970, two of which claimed four
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The commission expects to adopt a ``risk-based'' testing program
of pipelines, Garza said. Pipeline age, accident records and
proximity to aquifers and population centers are factors that would
determine testing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply because a pipe is old doesn't mean it is a threat,''
Garza said. ``Let's just test them more thoroughly and more
often.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Explorer Pipeline carrying gasoline from Louisiana
to Chicago ruptured near Greenville in Northeast Texas, spilling
500,000 gallons into Lake Tawakoni, causing Dallas to lose
one-third of its water supply for six months. Federal investigators
have said outside damage was not a factor in the break.
</P>
<P>
   New rules may also require setbacks and easements to put a fixed
distance between pipelines and existing structures, and stiffer
penalties for ignoring the state's call-before-you dig ``One-call
System,'' that can help keep people from digging into pipelines,
the most frequent cause of pipeline accidents in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators of the Abilene accident have said that there are
no indications that the bulldozer company called for pipeline
locations before digging.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas fine of $50 for failing to make a call is among the
lowest in the nation, said Garza, who wants the penalty increased
to $1,000 for first-time offenders and from $2,500 to $10,000 for
repeat offenders, but that would require Legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Garza said pipeline issues would probably come
before the Legislature in the session that begins in January.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the U.S. Senate approved a bill to improve pipeline
safety, largely for interstate pipelines governed by the Department
of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety. The bill, which
awaits consideration in the House, calls for larger fines,
increased state oversight and greater disclosure of information by
pipeline operators.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scientists said on Tuesday that they had discovered
remnants of human habitation under the Black Sea that they believed
was the first proof that people thrived along an ancient shoreline
before it was inundated by a great flood thousands of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Ballard, the undersea explorer whose robotic devices
have resolved many underwater mysteries, including the resting
place of the Titanic, said an expedition he was leading had
discovered a well-preserved structure that might be thousands of
years old 12 miles off the coast of Turkey, near Sinop.
</P>
<P>
   An underwater robot, scouting about 300 feet below the surface
three days ago, found a rectangular area measuring about 12 by 45
feet on which there appeared to be a collapsed wood and clay
structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artifacts at the site are clearly well preserved, with carved
wooden beams, wooden branches and stone tools collapsed amongst the
mud matrix of the structure,'' Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition, sponsored by the National Geographic Society and
others, is part of a project to survey the coastal waters of
northern Turkey for signs of human settlement around the time of a
great flood. Some scholars believe that such a flood inspired the
biblical story of Noah; it may also be the source of the flood tale
in the Babylonian story of Gilgamesh.
</P>
<P>
   Using sonar equipment, the expedition has mapped large areas of
the coastline and found hundreds of potential targets to examine
more closely with the underwater robots operated from the research
ship Northern Horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from the ship, Ballard said this could
be the first of many such sites in the area that could answer
questions about the habits and lifestyles of a little-known ancient
culture suddenly uprooted and forced to flee by flooding water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we know what these sites look like on sonar, now that
we recognize their signatures, we're regrouping to continue the
search,'' he said, noting that the target area was about 200 square
miles of what would have been livable terrain before the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have already identified a second site seven miles
away. Pieces of ceramics suggest that it, too, may have been an
inhabited area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fredrik T. Hiebert of the University of Pennsylvania, chief
archaeologist on the project, also was enthusiastic about the find,
occurring two weeks into the five-week mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a discovery of world importance,'' Hiebert said from
the ship. ``We have the first site with direct evidence of human
occupation on the old coast. Now we can say there were people
living around the Black Sea when it was a fresh-water lake before
it was flooded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiebert said the underwater structure closely resembles the wood
and clay ``wattle and daub'' buildings still common in the area.
``This style is distinctively Black Sea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discovery will begin to rewrite the history of cultures
in this key area between Europe, Asia and the ancient Middle
East,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard said earlier studies of sea shells from the area help
date the underwater coastline. Shells from an extinct type of
freshwater creature are all 7,000 years old or older, and shells
from saltwater shellfish date from 6,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there was a sudden and dramatic change from a
freshwater lake to a saltwater sea 7,000 years ago,'' he said,
``And we know that as a result of that flood a vast amount of land
went underwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William B.F. Ryan and Dr. Walter C. Pitman III, two
geologists at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., speculated in their 1997 book,
``Noah's Flood'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), that melting European glaciers
at the end of an ice age unleashed a great flood that changed a
small freshwater lake into the saltwater Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, melting glaciers raised the level of the
Mediterranean, causing water to break through the narrow Bosporus
and rapidly flood the lake. Water poured in so rapidly, the
Columbia researchers said, it would have widened the surface of the
lake by as much as a mile a day, submerging the original shoreline
and causing any population to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said in an interview that he was thrilled to hear of
Ballard's discovery and was surprised that evidence of human
habitation on the old shore was found so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan likened the discovery to finding Pompeii, the ancient city
buried by Mount Vesuvius. ``Peel away the ash of Vesuvius and you
see life on the day of the eruption,'' he said, ``Here you have
Neolithic life on the day of the flood.''

SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES NOTHING NEW IN ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Jef Richards in 4th graf is cq; p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the flashes of ``Buy Coke'' that had moviegoers stampeding to
concession stands, the hidden images of genitalia in liquor ads,
and the word `SEX' secretly emblazoned on Ritz cracker ads, now can
be added George W. Bush's ``RATS.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, only the last example, the latest presidential
campaign flap, actually appeared in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   But fears of subliminal advertising _ nanosecond flashes of
words on TV or carefully embedded images in print _ have flitted in
and out of popular consciousness for four decades. Despite repeated
debunking, the idea has slowly and surely taken root, and the Bush
gaffe, whatever its political consequences, will probably further
the belief that manipulative ad makers are secretly controlling
viewers and readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love conspiracy theories, and people love to hate
advertising. The idea of someone else manipulating you without you
knowing it seems to explain so much,'' said Jef Richards, chair of
the advertising department at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   This latest chapter in American paranoia was uncovered by a
sharp-eyed engineer in Seattle who noticed that a Bush TV ad
slamming Democrat Al Gore's prescription drug plan flashed the word
``RATS,'' as part of the word ``bureaucrats.'' He videotaped it
and, using slow motion, confirmed that the potential epithet
appeared for about one-thirtieth of a second. The registered
Democrat forwarded his findings to the Gore campaign, which alerted
the media.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that subliminal ads have any impact on
viewers' decision making, according to psychologists. Ad makers
have never confessed to using such techniques and the majority
dismiss them as quackery, according to advertising specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign Tuesday vigorously denied that use of ``RATS''
was intentional, but the bizarre lapse broke new ground in the
annals of political advertising. Analysts said they couldn't recall
another example in politics; all research on subliminal ads have
focused on commercial campaigns. Tuesday, psychologists said that
political opinions were even less likely to be swayed by quickly
flashed words than buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As to how ``RATS'' got into the ad in the first place, those
interviewed offered speculation interspersed with chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intentional on somebody's part. You don't miss this
sort of thing,'' said Richards. ``I think maybe it was
tongue-in-cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a time when academics and politicians took
subliminal advertising far more seriously. It started in 1957, at
the height of Sputnik-era paranoia, when ad man James Vicary
boasted publicly that he had done a six-week test at a Ft. Lee,
N.J., movie theater where the messages ``Eat Popcorn'' and ``Drink
Coke'' were flashed every five seconds during movies. He claimed
popcorn sales jumped by 58 percent and coke sales by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The public reacted immediately and Congress called for hearings.
Vicary refused to offer hard data to back his claim, but he did
reassure Congress that his powerful new technique could be used to
benefit humanity by flashing messages like ``Fight Polio.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Vicary was more candid, telling the public his
New Jersey study had relied on a ``small amount of data _ too small
to be meaningful.'' But it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Public fears were stoked, and advertisers' interests piqued.
Several television stations, beginning with one in Bangor, Maine,
used subliminal flashes to simply see if they provoked a response.
In every case, they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists began testing the phenomenon. The notion
that indirect images or suggestions could influence people was
well-known. But researchers have been unable to make the jump from
there to proving that words flashed on a screen could influence
behavior in any significant way.
</P>
<P>
   Most psychologists agree that a person exposed to a visual flash
of a single word can sometimes be steered, immediately afterward,
to pick a similar word from a list of words. The effect lasts
seconds, and only single-word flashes work.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was revived in the 1980s through a book by a
journalist that claimed print ads frequently contained veiled
sexual images used to seduce consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And there was another piece of alleged evidence: a psychoanalyst
published a study in 1982 allegedly showing that some
schizophrenics could be calmed by flashing the phrase, ``Mommy and
I are one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally ridiculous,'' said Robert Fudin, a professor of
psychology at Long Island University in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Fudin has spent part of his career debunking these ideas and, in
one indication of their staying power, published his most recent
attack in an academic journal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subliminal advertising is a joke, wishful thinking at best,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the issue has surfaced regularly, and Congress has
held several hearings over the years.
</P>
<P>
   At one hearing, in 1984, former Congressman Dan Glickman of
Kansas, who is now US Agriculture Secretary, asked aloud: ``How do
you know if subliminal messages are or are not being used during
television and radio commercials?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one of the strange parts of this, it is a Catch-22, of
course,'' replied a Federal Communications Commission official.
``If you know it is there, it is not subliminal.''

   MIAMISBURG, Ohio _ Vice President Al Gore Tuesday promised to
make the plight of the nation's schools his No. 1 priority, as he
visited three Miami Valley schools with a rolling caravan of school
buses and an entourage of students, teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, and his vice
presidential running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., boarded
a yellow school bus in the early morning hours in downtown Dayton
and rode to Miamisburg's Wantz Middle School, where they greeted
hundreds of cheering students before classes started, then met in a
classroom with a small group of teachers, students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   From Miamisburg, the candidates made a brief stop at Franklin
High School, then went to Middletown High, where Gore and Lieberman
again met with students in classrooms and ate lunch at the school
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, they were interviewed on the bus by student
journalists from around the state. They finished the day with a
rally in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   At every stop, Gore said the nation's schools needed ``dramatic
and revolutionary change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The same kind of debate you've been having in Dayton is going
on all over the United States,'' Gore told a group of 15 Wantz
students. ``It's hard to come up with the funding for all the new
students and to modernize schools that were built a long time ago
and to build new schools so you don't have to cover up playgrounds
with portable classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his school proposals are similar to those of his
Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in that they both
want to hold schools and teachers more accountable for student
performance. Gore said his plan is pledging $170 billion over 10
years on education while the Bush proposals would not be able to
afford that because Republicans are proposing income tax cuts
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that Gore has had eight years as vice
president to address the ills of the nation's schools and has
failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years ago the vice president promised to close the
achievement gap in education between disadvantaged students and
their peers, but he hasn't delivered,'' said Lisa Graham Keegan, a
Republican and Arizona's superintendent of public instruction who
visited a Middletown elementary school Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's education proposals include money to help school
districts recruit 100,000 new teachers, including $10,000 signing
bonuses to attract teachers to some high-demand districts, and a
$10,000 annual tax deduction for college tuition expenses.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposes national proficiency tests for new teachers,
continued support for charter schools, and a national program in
which consistently poor-performing public schools are shuttered and
reopened under new staff.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said both he and Bush ``believe there should be new
accountability to encourage better performance. The difference is
the plan Joe Lieberman and I are putting out starts with
accountability but it doesn't end there.''
</P>
<P>
   A wave of teacher hiring would allow average class sizes to
shrink to 18 to 20 students, Gore claimed. He is also proposing $50
billion to make pre-school available for all 4-year-olds, $20
billion in special education spending, and $8 billion in school
construction bond subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it a national priority to help local
communities modernize and improve their schools,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign defended its positions and said its proposal
to spend $47.6 billion over 10 years on everything from Head Start
to college assistance would do more for learning than Gore's $170
billion plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear from some of the proposals Al Gore is laying out
now that he wants to be the national superintendent,'' said Bush
spokesman Bob Hopkins. ``It's probably worse than the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, however, said a Gore-Lieberman administration would
support leaving control of schools at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with aging school buildings were in evidence during
the Democrats' tour. Gore and Lieberman had to dodge a trash can
set in a hallway at Middletown High School to catch dripping
rainwater. At Wantz Middle School, with nearly 800 students, Gore
sweated through his shirt during his morning speech because the
sweltering classroom where he spoke was not air conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   During the bus ride from Miamisburg to Middletown, Lieberman _
making his first visit to the area as a national candidate _ held
court with a dozen high school journalism students and teachers
from around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Mississiniwa Valley High School senior Misty Moehl asked
Lieberman how his Jewish faith might effect the U.S.'s role in the
Middle East peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman praised Moehl for asking a good question and said his
first responsibility as vice president would be upholding U.S. laws
and policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's peace in the Middle East, it is good for the
United States,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   The caravan caused near chaos wherever it went. At a brief visit
to the front of Franklin High School, a stop just scheduled on
Sunday, Lieberman marched up the front lawn of neighboring homes
and high-fived 3-year-old Cory Aleksin and spoke briefly with
Cory's mother, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, Gore and Lieberman spoke to about 2,000 people at
a rally at the Cincinnati State Technical and Community College.
There, Gore left the education theme and ran through his
traditional stump speech, pledging to act on prescription drug
coverage in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I won't be the most exciting politician, but I will
work hard for you everyday,'' Gore said.

GORE SAYS HE WANTS BOSTON DEBATE WITH BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Ohio _ Vice President Al Gore Tuesday said he still
wants the first presidential debate to be held in Boston and
ridiculed reports that George W. Bush's campaign is concerned the
event has a tie to the John F. Kennedy Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far away from President Kennedy's legacy does he feel
comfortable?'' Gore said in an interview, just before delivering an
education address. ``Does he have to be 100 miles, 1,000 miles, how
far? What is his minimum requirement?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his comments in advance of his arrival Wednesday in
Boston, where he is slated to address a downtown rally and attend a
fund-raiser featuring the singer James Taylor. The vice president
said his campaign team would meet Thursday with Bush aides to try
to work out an agreement on holding the debates. A deal might be
announced later that day, said officials of the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in addition to increasing the pressure on Bush to debate
in Boston, apparently also is hoping to tie Bush's reservations
about the Boston session to the Kennedy legacy, hoping to score a
larger political point with voters in both parties and independents
who have fond memories of the late president. Bush has sought to
portray himself as a ``compassionate conservative'' who appeals to
members of both parties, but his aides have said it would be unfair
to hold a debate in a setting with Democratic ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand what their problem is having the debate
near the Kennedy Library,'' Gore said. ``I don't think most
Republicans would mind it. President Kennedy is honored in both
political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate negotiations begin, Gore stressed he has not
agreed to Bush's request to drop Boston. ``I'm in favor of having
the debate in Boston,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston debate has been set for Oct. 3 by the commission as
the first of three 90-minute meetings between the candidates. The
first debate is typically the most heavily watched and most
influential one. The other debates are slated for Oct. 11 at Wake
Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Oct. 17, at
Washington University in St. Louis. In addition, an Oct. 5 vice
presidential debate is slated for Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials have said for weeks they don't like the
idea of having the debate in Boston, and Bush himself recently
alluded to the event's tie to the John F. Kennedy Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were at the George Bush Library (in Houston), it'd be
helpful,'' Bush said, while denying that he was afraid to set foot
in an area that is traditionally Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, executive director of the Commission on
Presidential Debates, stressed in a telephone interview that the
John F. Kennedy Library is not cosponsoring the Boston debate and
is only playing an indirect role by providing community forums
scheduled around the session. The debate will be held near the
library on the campus of the University of Massachusetts, where the
huge media entourage is also to be situated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush aides have said privately Boston is their least
favorite location of the three proposed sites, and have expressed
concern that the commission did not designate a debate site west of
the Mississippi. Just a week ago, Bush campaign chairman Don Evans
said the Texas governor would not back down from his insistence on
one debate and two television appearances, which would eliminate
the Boston session. Evans said there was no room for negotiation.
``This is our final answer,'' he said. ``This is it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Bush spokesman Ken Lisaius said that the campaign
has decided not to rule out any potential debate. Asked whether
there was now a possibility a debate would be in Boston, Lisaius
responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is in or out. It is more of a question of that we want
to have debates held around the country and the initial round of
cities lacked a city on the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that, despite the delay in forging an agreement
acceptable to both campaigns, ``it is not too late'' to hold the
Boston debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Library, she said, ``has nothing to do with hosting
the debate or the media filing center and there is no relationship
between the library and UMass.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush last month tried to alter the agenda of the Commission on
Presidential Debates, proposing that the first two sessions occur
on television on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and CNN's ``Larry King
Live.'' But Gore, who had said he would debate Bush ``anytime,
anywhere,'' said he would not agree to such sessions unless Bush
first agreed to the three commission debates. Then Bush ran an ad
that chided Gore for not keeping his word on the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by attacking the Bush campaign's disenchantment with
Boston, apparently thinks he has found an effective way to strike
back at Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a great city,'' Gore said ``We ought not to scratch
it off the list for petty partisan purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's weeks-long refusal to agree to the debate has irked some
Republicans who feared it was sending a message that he was afraid
to debate Gore _ a frustration that grew as Gore and Bush have
drawn even in the polls. Bush aides, after initially insisting that
they would not modify their proposal, have said recently that they
were ready to negotiate as many as three prime-time debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore Tuesday made his comments on a day devoted to highlighting
his emphasis on education. Temporarily putting aside Air Force Two
and his black limousine, Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph
I. Lieberman of Connecticut, traveled across this politically
critical state in a pair of yellow school buses _ although they
were followed by a lengthy motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We refuse to go along with a giant tax cut to the wealthy at
the expense of the middle class that would stop our prosperity and
progress, that would take away the chance we have now to use our
prosperity to help lift up the schools,'' Gore said at a middle
school in Miamisburg, Ohio, bringing up a subject that is likely to
be a focus of debates, where ever they are held.

BUCHANAN'S CLAIM TO $12.6 MILLION IS RECOGNIZED BY ELECTION
COMMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Offering a moral victory but no immediate cash, the
Federal Election Commission on Tuesday upheld Pat Buchanan's claim
to $12.6 million in disputed federal campaign funds earmarked for
the Reform Party's presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In an ``initial determination'' of a heated Reform Party
dispute, the commission voted 5-1 that Buchanan is the legitimate
nominee and entitled to the money. But the actual awarding of the
funds from the treasury must await the commission's final
determination at some later date, with a federal court fight
threatened after that.
</P>
<P>
   The commission rejected the rival claim of John Hagelin, an Iowa
physicist who was nominated by a Reform faction that staged a
walkout at the party convention last month rather than take part in
Buchanan's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan camp hailed the decision by the commission and
signaled Buchanan's emphatic return to the national hustings after
a month's recuperation for gall bladder surgery. He is to deliver
an address on Monday at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C.
The Bob Jones campus became an issue for the Republicans during the
primaries when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas spoke there, despite
critics' complaints that the university banned interracial dating
and had a history of anti-Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in pretty good shape, as long as the money comes in this
week,'' said Bay Buchanan, the sister and campaign strategist of
the candidate, who bolted the Republican Party last October when
his presidential quest flagged.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, the fiery conservative polemicist whose standing has
plummeted to 1 percent in recent national opinion polls, has been
bedeviled by the challenge of the Hagelin faction. Hagelin has
already said he will try to continue the challenge to Buchanan's
legitimacy beyond the commission with a federal court suit.
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining eight weeks of the campaign, Buchanan has said
his goal is to tap into the federal financing to begin television
ads and to win his own court fight to gain entry into the televised
presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which meets again on Thursday, set no date for
its final determination, said Ian Stirton, a spokesman. A petition
from an anti-Buchanan faction in New York remains to be dealt with
before the final determination.
</P>
<P>
   The petition includes an affidavit from Ross Perot, the founder
of the Reform Party, siding with Hagelin as ``the only proper
candidate to receive public funding, based on the votes I received
in the 1996 election.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission majority found otherwise in its initial
determination, after investigating the extent of the rivals'
support in state Reform organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt here that Buchanan is the party's nominee,
and there is no reason to delay the certification,'' Bradley Smith,
a commission member, said.
</P>
<P>
   The one dissenting commissioner, Karl Sandstrom, insisted that
the decision was hasty and should be left for the courts to settle.
``The law requires more of us than of officials at a track meet,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's final determination, which could be made within
days, then would be followed by its certification to the treasury
that the money can flow to the Buchanan campaign's cash-starved
coffers. Whether Hagelin can block this through the courts remains
an open question.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has been sorely counting on the federal funds, which
come from taxpayers' nonpartisan voluntary check-off on federal
income tax returns. The amount of money is calculated using the 8
percent share of the vote won by Perot in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now move forward with our campaign and go after Al Gore
and George W. Bush and take our issues to the American public,''
declared Tim Haley, Buchanan's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan contends that the drawn-out challenge to his
candidacy's legitimacy, which includes continuing ballot challenges
in state courts, is ultimately being financed by Perot. But Russell
Varney, a Perot associate, declared, ``That is not true, and
Buchanan knows it.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Spreading protests over high fuel prices all but halted
gasoline deliveries across Britain on Tuesday, forcing most service
stations to close for lack of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   As panicked motorists set out on frantic, often fruitless, hunts
for gasoline, ambulance companies and fire departments began
cutting back services. Many hospitals canceled all but essential
procedures, and some scheduled diesel trains were canceled
altogether. The Royal Mail said many of its delivery trucks had
just a day's worth of fuel left.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair struggled to contain his worst
domestic crisis as similar protests continued to spread through
Western Europe, where truck drivers, farmers and small businessmen
have formed impromptu coalitions to protest cripplingly high fuel
prices. In Belgium, truck drivers kept traffic at a standstill in
Brussels for the third day in a row and blockaded three fuel depots
in the south. In the Netherlands, protesters blocked two major
tunnels on roads near Amsterdam and Rotterdam at the height of the
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, a convoy of 100 buses, trucks and taxicabs drove
from the French border to the state Parliament Building in
Saarbruecken to demand that the government lower fuel prices.
Farmers and truck drivers in Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain
threatened to mount actions within the week if their price-cutting
demands were not met.
</P>
<P>
   But as discontent spread around the Continent, Britain held the
dubious honor of being the country most flattened by the protests.
Although its refineries and storage depots are full of fuel,
blockades have prevented the fuel from being delivered to service
stations.
</P>
<P>
   People waited for hours Tuesday to buy gasoline, and those
unable to buy it said they might have to stay home from work on
Wednesday. The shortages struck so quickly because people rushed to
the pumps in an effort to refuel before it was too late. Around the
country, there were scattered reports of people stealing fuel from
parked cars.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In South Wales, the Spar supermarket chain said there had been a
300 percent increase in purchases of staples like bread, milk and
canned goods by people worried that supplies would run out or that
they would be unable to drive to the store.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Petrol Retailers' Association, Roy Holloway,
warned that there might be no fuel left for sale anywhere by
Wednesday. ``In the next 24 hours,'' Holloway said, ``it is
unlikely that we will see any retail fuel sales in the UK.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Blair sought to appease an increasingly restive electorate by
promising that essential services would continue and saying that he
expected deliveries of fuel to start again ``in the next 24
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   He also firmly ruled out capitulating to the protesters' demands
that he lower the 76.2 percent fuel tax, the highest in Europe and
the main reason that gasoline in Britain costs $4.37 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Queen Elizabeth II met a representative of the
Privy Council _ a panel of senior politicians, judges and church
leaders _ and granted the government ``exceptional powers'' under a
law from 1976 to force oil companies to provide fuel to services
like hospitals and schools. It was unclear whether the government
would move to invoke such powers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After emergency meetings with his Cabinet and with Britain's
largest oil companies Tuesday, Blair said that the companies had
pledged to do all that they could to start deliveries moving from
their blockaded depots and refineries, provided that their drivers
were guaranteed police protection. But though there were signs that
small numbers of oil trucks were carrying fuel from depots late
Tuesday night, and though there has been no violence, many
companies seemed reluctant to order drivers to cross the
protesters' informal picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the issue has always been the safety of our drivers,''
a spokesman for Shell Oil said. ``They have said they don't feel
comfortable, that they don't feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The protesters are a mixture of truck, bus and taxicab drivers,
farmers and small-business owners, all of whom say the increasing
cost of fuel threatens their livelihoods. Not organized by a union
or any one group, they have joined together out of a common
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll come down every day if I have to, until I run out of fuel
myself,'' Derek Wood, a hauling contractor who was protesting at
the gasoline depot for the Total oil company in Leeds, told the
BBC. ``Our lads have nothing to lose.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Public opinion about the protesters, their tactics and the
government's responsibility to resolve the problem is sharply
polarized. Many Britons appear inclined to agree with William
Hague, the leader of the Conservative opposition, who said he did
not think that Blair ``has got a grip on the situation or
understands how angry people are about taxes being loaded on and on
to fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the unhappy mood, The Mirror published an enormous
photograph of the prime minister as he passed a line of cars at a
service station on Monday on his way to a meeting under the
headline, ``I'm All Right Jag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Blair glides past petrol-starved drivers in his Jaguar,''
the newspaper said, noting that the prime minister ``will always
have a full tank,'' no matter who else is waiting for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's car was pummeled by protesters later, the paper noted
with some glee, and a blockade by trucks, trailers and taxicabs
prevented him from attending a dinner on Monday night for his
deputy, John Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   Such images resonate with people like Colin Palmer, a taxicab
driver in London who said that fuel was prohibitively expensive and
that it was the government's fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job is getting unviable,'' Palmer, 45, said. ``If Blair
doesn't listen to people protesting about the price of fuel, we're
going to be worse off than we were under the Conservative
government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blair made clear Tuesday _ as did Germany and the
Netherlands _ that Britain would not capitulate to protesters'
demands that it lower gasoline taxes. Last week, after widespread
protests in France, the government there agreed to lower its fuel
tax 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that whatever the rights and wrongs of the argument
over fuel duty, we cannot accept as a government or as a nation
that policy should be dictated by illegal blockades, pickets or
direct action,'' Blair told a news conference late Tuesday
afternoon. ``Whatever the strength of the feeling, there can be no
excuse whatever for this type of action, which is hurting our
people, businesses and emergency services severely.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers agreed, saying they supported the protesters'
goals, but could not countenance their methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, people are queuing for a half-hour to get
fuel,'' said Brian Shapiro, another London cabdriver, who said he
had enough fuel to keep running through Wednesday. ``Tomorrow,''
Shapiro said, ``when there's no fuel, when people are struggling to
get to work, to get their kids to school, you'll see how quickly
public opinion shifts.''

BREAKING THROUGH ANIMATION'S BOY BARRIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 17) 
Ted Loos is a Manhattan-based free-lance writer specializing in
film and the visual arts. 
 By TED LOOS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Hale was developing an animated television show that
looked as if it had potential. ``Generation O!,'' about an
8-year-old who just happened to be an international rock star, had
a funny concept, catchy music and a punchy visual style.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem: The 8-year-old star was a girl named
Molly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were banging our heads against a wall,'' Hale recalled of
the meetings he and his partners, Jim Proimos and Tim Newman, had
with the networks. ``It was the old cliche: Girls will watch boys,
but boys don't watch girls. We had many people tell us, `If you
turn this character into a boy, this is a hit show.'''
</P>
<P>
   They stuck by their idea, and five years after their initial
brainstorm, ``Generation O!'' made its debut, on Aug. 26 on WB,
with the lead character intact. ``To us, it's a girl empowerment
show,'' Hale said. ``And being a rock star is a thing that every
kid aspires to.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly arrives during a season of extraordinary girl power in
animation: At least eight shows having their premieres in 2000 have
female leads, radically altering the landscape of television for
children. ABC is even turning a popular live star into a younger
animated version in ``Sabrina, the Animated Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The new programs range from two of Nickolodeon's programs for
preschoolers _ ``Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' and ``Dora the
Explorer,'' both featuring little girls who navigate unknown lands
while imparting lessons about life _ to three fantasy-adventure
imports from the realm of Japanese-style anime.
</P>
<P>
   One of these, Fox's ``CyberSix,'' puts the most unusual twist on
gender. The lead is a female cyber-mutant who wears a tight black
cat suit and stiletto heels at night, but disguises herself as a
male literature teacher by day.
</P>
<P>
   These new shows fortify the ranks of those that have broken the
animated ``boy barrier'' in the past few seasons, ``Pepper Ann,''
``Daria'' and ``The Wild Thornberrys'' among them.
</P>
<P>
   The change couldn't be more stark. ``Ten years ago, it was
pretty much unheard of to have a female lead in an animation
show,'' said Linda Simensky, president of original animation for
the Cartoon Network. ``There was a great enlightenment in the early
'90s, spurred by `The Simpsons.' Lisa Simpson was such a good
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she wasn't the lead, Lisa _ an ironic teen-age
commentator on the world who's a good bit smarter than those around
her _ set the mold for one type of brainy cartoon girl, epitomized
by the sarcastic lead of ``Daria.''
</P>
<P>
   Simensky, who started her career at Nickelodeon, now presides
over the year-old ``Mike, Lu &AMP; Og,'' whose main character is a girl
named Mike, and ``The Powerpuff Girls,'' now in its third season,
which has been an unqualified hit for the Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Powerpuff' is great because we never said, `OK, now give
them three best friends who are boys,''' Simensky said. ``If we
were concentrating on our jobs, we might have said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubbles, Buttercup and Blossom are ``the world's cutest
superheroes,'' three bug-eyed, pint-size sisters who battle
assorted mutant villains in their native Townsville. The program's
action sequences entice children, while adults are attracted by its
superhero satire: The girls were created when their dad, Professor
Utonium, mistakenly mixed sugar, spice and everything nice with the
mysterious and potent Chemical X.
</P>
<P>
   Craig McCracken, who created ``The Powerpuff Girls'' when he was
still an animation student at the California Institute of the Arts,
suspected that the knowing humor would attract some older viewers,
and he was right: The show has become a pop phenomenon, with
licensed merchandise appearing everywhere and a feature film in the
works. What he didn't expect was that in a TV landscape with
relatively few options, young viewers would see the Powerpuff Girls
as role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of girls saying that they look up to them,'' said
McCracken, who professes surprise at the reaction to his show. ``It
developed into a whole subculture. There are girls who say, `My
best friend's a Buttercup, but I'm a Bubbles.' They identify with
the different personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Powerpuff Girls'' and ``Generation O!'' are part of a trend
within the trend _ many of the new shows were created exclusively
by men. ``The real story is how three old guys have created the
hottest girls' property,'' joked Hale, 49, a musician and former
advertising executive. The character of Molly O! was inspired by
his daughter, Isabel, who is now 10.
</P>
<P>
   Historical precedent partly explains the initial resistance to
``Generation O!'' and other shows that struggled to get airtime. In
the heyday of the Warner Brothers cartoons, there were almost no
female animators and hence few female characters; Bugs Bunny in
drag was as girlish as it got.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the years went on, cartoon girls were eye candy or
dispensable plot points; exceptions like ``Josie and the
Pussycats'' were rare. And despite the recent influx, they're still
heavily outnumbered by boy-oriented shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What attracted us to having a strong female character like
Daria is that back in '97, we hadn't seen it before on
television,'' said Abby Terkuhle, president of MTV animation and
executive producer of ``Daria.''
</P>
<P>
   The character Daria Morgendorffer, an expressionless high
schooler with big black glasses, was spun off from MTV's ``Beavis
and Butthead.'' Now entering her fourth season of dispensing wry
witticisms, she has solidified her appeal with viewers enough to
merit her own TV movie, which was broadcast in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started in this business, there were few women in
animation at all,'' said Chuck Swenson, co-creator and executive
producer of ``Mike, Lu &AMP; Og.'' ``Now it's getting closer to equal
proportions. And as more women are coming to the fore on the
network side, you'll see even more girls in the shows.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    NASA extends Atlantis shuttle mission from 11 to 12 days
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By MARK CARREAU
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after astronauts from the shuttle Atlantis swung open
the hatches to the international space station on Tuesday, NASA
extended their flight.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching the mission from 11 to 12 days will give the
shuttle's five American astronauts and two Russian cosmonauts more
time to equip the orbital outpost for the arrival of its first
resident crew in November, the space agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven fliers began their difficult housework chores late
Tuesday. They planned to move more than 3 tons of equipment and
supplies into the station, including hardware to generate and
recycle breathing air, a toilet, exercise equipment and a laptop
computer network. Most will be installed in the station's latest
addition, the Zvezda crew module.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out by planning 11 days of activity, but we had a
shopping list of tasks that exceeded what we could do in 11 days by
quite a large margin,'' said NASA's Phil Engelhauf, the mission's
lead flight director. ``(Now) we think we will complete all the
tasks on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they had hoped for the longer mission all along, managers
could not count on Atlantis having enough electrical power and fuel
until Tuesday's decision. The shuttle will remain linked to the
station until Sunday night and return to Earth early Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The July arrival of the station's Zvezda module rendered the
orbital outpost habitable for the first time, providing living and
working space for a resident crew of three. But with a mass of
42,000 pounds, Zvezda was too heavy to be launched fully equipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis crew reached the station early Sunday. With
Atlantis skipper Terry Wilcutt leading the way, the shuttle crew
began boarding the station late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the astronauts and cosmonauts worked ahead of schedule,
the boarding activities stretched well into the next day as the
fliers made their way through a dozen airtight hatches.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the outpost consists of a 143-foot-long collection of
three large modules and a temporarily docked Russian Progress cargo
capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome aboard,'' greeted mission control as Wilcutt and his
colleagues flipped on the lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge station right now, having all that space, up to
150 feet, it's really amazing,'' said Atlantis pilot Scott Altman,
pleased to leave the much less spacious shuttle behind.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors donned surgical masks and safety glasses as they
entered each of the modules for the first time, a precaution to
protect them from dust and small debris suspended in the station's
weightless confines.
</P>
<P>
   Their final destination was Zvezda. Delayed more than two years
by Russian economic problems, Zvezda's arrival promises to greatly
accelerate the pace of the station's assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely beautiful,'' said Wilcutt as he and cosmonaut
Yuri Malenchenko became the first to inspect the Russian-crafted
module from orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Experiencing no ill effects, the visiting astronauts soon
discarded the masks and protective eye ware.
</P>
<P>
   While Atlantis is docked to the station, the shuttle's
life-support system will recycle and cool the breathing air
throughout the outpost. The shuttle crew strung long flexible
ventilation ducts and portable air circulation fans as they made
their way through the station, where temperatures were in the upper
70s and the humidity low.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, shuttle astronauts focused their efforts on the
installation of five large power storage batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The batteries are charged by the station's solar power arrays.
They discharge electricity when the station circles regions of the
Earth that are in darkness.

 &HT;    Alfonseca gets saves, raves as Marlins closer
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best closer in the National League is hardly a strikeout
artist and gives up nearly a .300 batting average. Only eighteen
months ago, he was riding a career to nowhere, just a set-up man
for the worst team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   He fought a weight problem. All people wanted to know was
whether having 12 fingers made it harder to pitch. This was not the
Goose Gossage way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens sometimes,'' Antonio Alfonseca said.
``Sometimes they give you the job and you just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the synopsis. On July 9, 1999, the Florida Marlins traded
closer Matt Mantei to Arizona, declared the closer job would go to
a committee and then gave Alfonseca, a 28-year-old Dominican, the
first try. That committee was never convened.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonseca went into the Braves series having converted 60 of the
66 save opportunities he's had since Mantei left. His 39 saves this
season, which are tied for the NL lead with San Diego's Trevor
Hoffman, are more than 23 of the 29 major-league teams. He leads
the league's Rolaids Relief Man standings by three points over New
York's Armando Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really started to take himself extremely seriously,''
Florida manager John Boles said. ``It was like when he was named
the closer, he was a whole different guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That process had actually begun before the 1999 season, when
Alfonseca dropped 35 pounds to his current 235. Always owning an
outstanding fastball that tops out at 97 mph, he needed a second
pitch and began to develop a wicked two-seam fastball with a hard
sinking motion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those improvements, he remains hittable: 76 hits in 62
1/3 innings with a 4.48 ERA, while striking out just 44. Alfonseca
offsets that vulnerability with ground balls off his two-seamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a strikeout pitcher,'' Boles said. ``He'll throw it
over the plate and he has tremendous action on his fastball. It can
really get in on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonseca has gotten on some people's nerves lately because of
the gyrations he goes through on the mound after a strikeout.
Sunday in Miami, he and Arizona's Greg Colbrunn, a former teammate,
exchanged obscenities and had to be restrained after Alfonseca's
demonstration for striking out Colbrunn.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Will Clark also mocked him after driving in a
go-ahead run Aug. 30. Anfonseca's defense: Benitez and Houston's
Jose Lima do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why me?'' he asked. ``Why can't I do it?''
</P>
<P>
   This might also be a residual of a changed demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it was hard when he was a set-up guy and didn't have a
lot of pride in that role,'' Boles said. ``And when we gave him a
chance to be closer, it opened up a whole new attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins will take that. Alfonseca is a critical component to
a young pitching staff that Florida believes will make the team a
contender as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy right now with what I'm doing,'' he said. ``I'm
happy for the team, too.''

 UNDATED: the shows.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swenson has worked in the business for 30 years, most recently
overseeing ``Rugrats,'' the popular Nickelodeon program whose
toughest character is the fearsome cousin Angelica, who bosses
around a motley crew of toddlers. For ``Mike, Lu &AMP; Og,'' he
developed the tomboy character of Mike with her two Russian
creators, Mikhail Aldashin and Mikhail Shindel.
</P>
<P>
   On the show, the 11-year-old Mike _ short for Michelanne _ is a
girl from the Bronx who interacts with a strange bunch of natives
on a desert island where she has chosen to live as an exchange
student.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's smart, one of those kids who's got it all together in
her own mind,'' said Swenson, who joins Hale in crediting his
daughters as models for his animated creation. ``But she's thrown
up against people who seem like they're from another planet.''
</P>
<P>
   As the series took shape, however, Swenson realized that a
critical perspective was missing. ``Once the show was sold, I
consciously sought out female writers,'' he said. ``There really is
a difference in their stories.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited an episode in which Mike changes her friendly
allegiances from one girl to another. ``The male writers made jokes
about their separation and hurt feelings, but the women in the room
stopped us cold,'' Swenson said. ``They told us very pointedly that
that kind of situation was really serious for a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the episodes center on the rivalry between Mike, a
tomboy, and Lu, a more traditionally girly girl. That basic
conflict also animates one of the most successful programs
introduced last year, Fox's ``Angela Anaconda.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela, a third-grader at Tapwater Springs Elementary, isn't
really a brainiac or a tomboy _ she just wants to enjoy herself, a
goal constantly foiled by the poodle-toting rich girl Nanette
Manoir. (It's also the rare cartoon that dares to tackle issues of
class, though it does so in a lighthearted way.) Much of the show
is devoted to Angela's fantasy life, in which she wreaks revenge on
Nanette.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the other characters, Angela comes from the
imagination of two women. ``That's the kind of kid I was,'' said
Joanna Ferrone, the co-creator of the show. ``I was really a
dreamer. I couldn't help but observe that although we're all told
that everybody is created equal and has an equal shot at things,
that wasn't really how life was.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela resembles ``Pepper Ann,'' which is now in its fourth
season on ABC, because the leads don't always master every
situation, as a superhero girl might. ``In both shows, sometimes
the main character does the wrong thing,'' said Sue Rose, who
created both characters. ``That's a much more valuable way to teach
a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rose hears reactions to ``Angela,'' one theme stands out.
``The most frequent feedback we get is from parents of boys,'' she
said. ``They say: `My boys watch it and they love it. I never
thought they would.' These are not just girls' shows, they're kids
shows. And whether you're a girl or a boy, you're going to exhibit
many of these same feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of its popularity undoubtedly comes from the humor that
leavens the show's message _ which is, as Rose puts it, ``You are
what you are, and it's cool to be you.'' Angela often ends up in
comic situations that Lucy Ricardo might have found familiar, as
when she enters a pogo contest despite not knowing how to pogo. The
look of the show _ a two-dimensional, cut-and-paste collage with
black-and-white faces _ enhances the feeling of retro comedy.
</P>
<P>
   According to Simensky of the Cartoon Network, even as the tide
turned for girl characters, a certain amount of political
correctness kept them from being the butt of jokes _ and laughs are
still the most prized currency in a cartoon. ``You can roll over a
male character with a steamroller,'' she said, ``but if you do that
to a girl or a minority character, people might get up in arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny or not, animated characters tend to attract an unusual
devotion from their creators, since they spring whole from the mind
and are not diluted by casting. Rose, who may have the record for
successful girl-led cartoons, even lends her own voice for the
character of Angela Anaconda.
</P>
<P>
   But she also faces a year of separation anxiety. This is the
last season of new episodes for the groundbreaking ``Pepper Ann,''
and the shows are already completed. (The 12-year-old-girl-angst
slot may be taken over by Nickelodeon's ``As Told to Ginger,''
which makes its debut in October.)
</P>
<P>
   Though animated characters never get any older, they do move
into syndication. ``I miss Pepper Ann, I really do,'' Rose said
with a maternal sigh. ``I want to know more about what's going on
with her.''

 &HT;    Johnson a tiger in Auburn's backfield in the backfield
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Auburn's offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone went to Kansas
looking for a quarterback. He came back with a running back who
could become a late entry into the Heisman Trophy race.
</P>
<P>
   While Mazzone was recruiting former Harrison High quarterback
Daniel Cobb, he also noticed running back Rudi Johnson, a bruising
runner from Ettrick, Va. Both players were enrolled at Butler
County (Kan.) Community College, which won the past two junior
college national championships.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Cobb, Mazzone persuaded Johnson to enroll at
Auburn in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auburn was looking at Daniel before they started recruiting
me,'' Johnson said. ``I was looking at Colorado, but I was keeping
my options open. Auburn showed up late, but from Day One they told
me I'd get an opportunity to play immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers desperately needed a running back after they ranked
last in the SEC _ and 112th out of 114 teams nationally _ in
rushing last season. Auburn averaged only 68 rushing yards per game
in 1999, and the school hasn't had a 1,000-yard rusher since
Stephen Davis gained 1,068 yards five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 5 feet 10, 228 pounds, should change that this year. He
had more rushing yards as a sophomore _ 2,224 on 306 carries _ than
Auburn had the previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the JUCO championship Johnson rushed for 375 yards and scored
seven touchdowns in Butler's 49-35 victory over Dixie College of
Utah. In comparison, Auburn's leading rusher last season, fullback
Heath Evans, had 330 yards in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody coming out of junior college wants to go somewhere
where you can make an immediate impact,'' Johnson said. ``Auburn's
coaches told me I was going to play as soon as I got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been as good as advertised in the Tigers' first two
games. In victories over Wyoming and Mississippi, he rushed for 339
yards and five touchdowns. In last week's 35-27 victory over the
Rebels, Auburn had 261 rushing yards, its highest total since
gaining 292 yards in a 62-0 victory over Fresno State in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you how far the running game's come, I'm getting all
kinds of e-mails now from alumni and fans (asking), `What's
happening to our passing game?''' Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville
said. ``It's a whole different attitude from everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's emergence couldn't have come at a better time for the
Tigers. Quarterback Ben Leard has struggled in throwing downfield
and has two touchdown passes. Receiver Ronney Daniels, who had 56
catches as a freshman, has three in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Tigers scored 70 points in those two games, and
they're ranked No. 24 going into Saturday's home game against LSU.
It's the first time Auburn has been ranked since Sept. 3, 1998, a
span of 723 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudi Johnson gave us a lot of trouble,'' Mississippi coach
David Cutcliffe said, after Johnson gained 165 yards against the
Rebels. ``I have a feeling he's going to give a lot of teams
fits.''

 &HT;    Suggs moves in as Tennessee's starting quarterback
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Those who know A.J. Suggs best aren't
surprised he will be the starting quarterback for Tennessee in
Saturday's big SEC game against Florida. More than anything, Aaron
Joseph Suggs is a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of five, Suggs nearly was killed in an accident on
his grandfather's farm. He fell from a moving truck and a trailer
fully loaded with hay ran over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wheel (of the trailer) ran right over my stomach,'' said
Suggs. ``If it's a few inches higher and goes over my chest, I'm
probably dead.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 14, Suggs was a baby-faced freshman at Cobb
County's McEachern High School who had the audacity to compete for
the starting quarterback's job. The job seemingly belonged to
senior Chris Caldwell, who had won 12 games the season before.
Suggs' friends told him he had no shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as he walked on the field, there was just
something special about him,'' McEachern coach Jimmy Dorsey said.
``The coaches would get together after practice, and we'd sort of
look at each other and say, `Is this really happening? Is this kid
really that good?' Then one day, I told them that A.J. was our guy.
I just had a gut instinct that he was special.''
</P>
<P>
   When McEachern opened the 1995 season, freshman A.J. Suggs was
the starting quarterback. Four years later, he left with a 46-7
record as a starter, including a 14-1 mark in 1998, when he led the
Indians to the state AAAA championship game against Valdosta.
</P>
<P>
   Suggs was 17 when when he verbally committed to play at
Tennessee. When Chris Simms, the nation's No. 1 high school
quarterback, also said he would sign with the Vols, Suggs' friends
warned him that he'd never play in Knoxville. Suggs never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought it was no big deal,'' Dorsey said. ``He figured if
he went to a place like Tennessee, he'd have to beat out somebody
pretty good to play. He just said `Fine. Bring it on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Simms never showed in Knoxville; he changed his mind and signed
with Texas. As a freshman in 1999, Suggs roomed with UT senior Tee
Martin on the road and learned the ropes of being a college
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in October, Suggs suddenly began to feel severe stomach
pains. He lost 20 pounds in less than a month and began to feel an
arthritic-type pain in his throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis was Crohn's Disease, an inflammation of the lower
intestine. Some people suggested that his college football career
might be over. Instead, Suggs finally got the proper medication,
and the symptoms subsided. He regained the weight but by then, the
decision was made to redshirt him.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Suggs again was written off as a college
quarterback. Sophomore Joey Mathews was the heir apparent to
Martin, and Tennessee had just signed two of the nation's top high
school quarterbacks Casey Clausen and John Rattay. Both would
enroll in time for spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first game of the season, against Southern Miss, it
was Suggs who came off the bench to spell a struggling Mathews.
Clausen couldn't play because of a sore shoulder, but Suggs
performed solidly and completed four of nine passes, including a
51-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   So, last week, with Mathews (knee) and Clausen (shoulder) still
dealing with aches and pains, Tennessee head coach Phillip Fulmer
announced that Suggs would get his first college career start
against the No. 6 Gators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt it was important for A.J. to know and for the guys
to be able to rally around him,'' Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   They have.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.J. is cool. Nothing bothers him,'' wide receiver Cedric
Wilson said. ``He's not going to be intimidated by his
surroundings. That's what you want from a quarterback.'' ``When I
told A.J. last week that he was going to start against Florida, he
just said, 'OK, cool,' '' said Randy Sanders, Tennessee's offensive
coordinator. ``Nothing really fazes him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little shocked that they would announce it so early,
but I was excited because it gave me a chance to work a lot with
the first team,'' Suggs said. ``I guess I've just kept plugging and
hanging around, and now I'm going to get my chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey will be watching Saturday's Tennessee-Florida game from
Athens, Ohio, where his son, Andy, will be punting for Tennessee
Tech against Ohio University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he's going to do, but I do know this: He's
not going to do anything to get his team beat,'' Dorsey said about
Suggs. ``He is just a solid guy, real down to earth. You see the
same kid every single day, and that is a great personality trait.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim, Suggs' older brother who lives with him in Knoxville and
maintains a Web site (ajsuggs.com) of his football exploits,
certainly will be at Neyland Stadium on Saturday. His parents, Mike
and Judy, have a problem because Suggs' little brother, Andrew, 12,
has a junior-high game in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may try to do both,'' A.J. Suggs said. ``I wish I could
see Andrew play, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people here think that Suggs' reign as Tennessee's
starting quarterback will be short. They think that, when Clausen's
arm is well, he will be Tennessee's quarterback of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive A.J. Suggs if he doesn't worry about it. He has heard it
all before.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've ever wanted was an opportunity and now it's up to me
to take advantage of it,'' Suggs said. ``I've been through a lot, I
know. But, hey, I'm still here.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, HILL LEADERS FAR APART ON BUDGET DETAILS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican congressional leaders challenged
President Clinton on Tuesday to set aside 90 percent of next year's
budget surplus to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to take at least 90 percent of the non-Social
Security and Medicare surplus and lock it away and make sure that
we pay down the debt with it,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., told reporters as Clinton opened a meeting in the White
House Cabinet Room with congressional leaders from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters after
the meeting, though, that the commitment did not extend beyond the
2001 budget year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a one-year deal,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP proposals on debt reduction contradicted
their insistence on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes me wonder, from where will the money come?''
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters after
the meeting. ``What tax cuts come off the table?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Daschle, ``We smell a rat.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting set the stage for a contentious partisan
battle in the weeks remaining until the clock runs out on
congressional debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for a fair middle ground,'' Lott told reporters
after the session. ``I think it was a positive meeting, and he
indicated he would get back to us on a number of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cast the meeting in far gloomier terms, saying
compromise appeared unlikely in a number of key areas.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress aiming to adjourn by Oct. 6, leaders from both
parties said hopes had dimmed for a number of Clinton's
high-priority initiatives, including a so-called patients bill of
rights or a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come away from the meeting with a lot of confidence
that we're going to be able to find an agreement that will be
effective'' in those two areas, said House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is projected to take in roughly $2
trillion more than it spends over the coming decade, not counting
payments made into the Social Security or Medicare systems.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have passed or proposed tax cuts, heavily weighted
in favor of upper-income earners, that White House analysts contend
would eat up most of the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed $360 billion worth of tax cuts _ mostly
targeted toward lower-income or middle-class workers _ over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also called for $460 billion in spending hikes,
mostly to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and to extend
health care coverage to low-income workers. He has said another
$500 billion should be set aside as a hedge against unmet
expectations. His Republicans regard that, though, as a potential
bank for funding Democratic priorities, such as hiring additional
teachers and police and repairing worn-out schools.
</P>
<P>
   Time for compromise is fast running out.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal 2001 begins Oct. 1. Congress has so far sent Clinton only
two of the 13 massive appropriations bills that direct some $600
billion in so-called discretionary spending, about one-third of the
total federal budget for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is mandatory spending, including Social Security and
Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The White House projects that next year's surplus not including
Social Security and Medicare _ will be $49 billion. Clinton has
proposed using $31 billion of that for debt reduction, $3 billion
for prescription drug benefits and another $1 billion to extend
health care coverage to low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders signaled that another measure Clinton has
fought for _ strengthening federal hate crimes legislation _ was
dead for this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton scheduled an event Wednesday to press for passage in
the House of a hate crimes bill already approved in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed'' over the House posture, Daschle told
reporters. ``We've got to see if we can find a way to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appeal for a dollar-an-hour hike in the minimum wage _
it's $5.15 an hour now _ also seemed a long shot, though neither
party shut the door on further talks.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point was Republican insistence that any such
increase be accompanied by a tax cut for small businesses amounting
to $76 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do that,'' said Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made clear at the outset of the White House meeting,
though, that he remained hopeful for ``a minimum wage agreement
that will have some small business tax relief in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton told reporters his aim was a budget
compromise resting ``on the basis of good policy, not politics or
partisanship.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    After 73 days, rain falls in North Texas
 &HT;    Despite thunderstorms, dry conditions continue
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JIM HENDERSON
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Thunderstorms swirled across North Texas on Tuesday,
dumping 2 to 4 inches of rain on some counties and setting off
warnings of large hail and flash floods, but officially the drought
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Through one of those atmospheric quirks for which the region is
legendary, no precipitation touched Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, where the National Weather Service gauges are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officially, the dry streak stretches to 74 days,'' said Gary
Woodall, a meteorologist in Fort Worth, who spoke as a heavy rain
pounded downtown Dallas, 16 miles from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the heaviest rains fell west and northwest of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Copeland at the Wise County office of the Texas
Agricultural Extension Service in Decatur, said that area's dry
spell was broken by nearly three hours of rainfall that deposited
as much as 2 inches in some locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so wonderful,'' she said. ``It was great. People were
running outside and celebrating.''
</P>
<P>
   As rains were falling to the west, dark clouds, the likes of
which had not been seen here since June 30, gathered over Dallas.
At 12:43 p.m., lightning split the sky and a loud thunderclap shook
the windows of St. Pete's Dancing Marlin cafe in Deep Ellum.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd broke out in cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that thunder?'' a woman asked her luncheon companion.
``I'd forgotten what it sounds like.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later the rains began and continued for about 20
minutes _ just enough to slake the thirst of the city's lawns and
slicken the oil-stained streets that have not been bathed for 2-1/2
months.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Dallas police warned motorists that when the rains
finally came, hazardous driving conditions would be the first
consequence.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Tuesday, that prediction had come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is we're pretty busy right now,'' said Sgt.
Jerry Sanchez of the police department's traffic division.
</P>
<P>
   While city and suburban dwellers have suffered through a summer
of brittle lawns and soaring water bills, the surrounding farms
have taken the biggest hit from the longest dry spell in North
Texas history (the previous streak was 58 days in 1934 and 1950).
</P>
<P>
   Gary Clayton, the Wise County extension agent, said that while
some areas west of Dallas/Fort Worth received generous rainfall
Tuesday, the storms were spotty and skimpy for some farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not enough to really do any good,'' he said. ``It cools
us off and makes us feel good, but as far as agriculture production
goes, it was just enough to make you mad. We've still got a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, drought conditions in Texas have cost farmers and
ranchers more than $5 billion in lost production.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's storms brought cooling relief, but farmers will have
to wait for full deliverance.
</P>
<P>
   Skies cleared late in the afternoon and, according to forecasts,
will remain clear at least through Thursday.

ASTRONOMERS FIND A NEW SIZE OF BLACK HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers announced on Tuesday that they had convincing
evidence for a new class of black hole _ bigger than those formed
from collapsed stars but much smaller than the gargantuan
gravitational sinkholes found at the centers of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, black holes _ objects that have collapsed so tightly
that not even light can escape their gravitational pull _ have come
in two varieties: collapsed stars that have at most 10 times the
mass of the Sun, and the supermassive black holes that are believed
to exist at the core of every galaxy, with masses up to that of a
billion Suns.
</P>
<P>
   As in a Goldilocks-like tale, the new black hole is nicely
though inexplicably between those ranges: its mass is at least 500
Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after pinning down the existence of midsize black holes,
astrophysicists have a new puzzle: explaining how the universe
creates them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way this object could form'' from the collapse of
one star, because it is too big for that, said a member of the
research team, Dr. Philip Kaaret, an astrophysicist at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to be a very lively subject of future
study,'' added Dr. Douglas Richstone, a professor of astronomy at
the University of Michigan, who was not connected with the work but
attended the Washington news conference where the findings were
announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers estimated the size of the black hole from
measurements of X-rays, which shoot out as matter falls into the
abyss. A team of American and Japanese astronomers using NASA's
Chandra X-Ray Observatory had spotted a bright X-ray beacon in the
galaxy M82, about 12 million light-years from Earth. They observed
that the brightness of the beacon varied about 10 percent every 10
minutes. Such fluctuations are believed to result from vibrations
in the disk of gas and dust swirling around black holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same as a bell,'' Kaaret said. ``These oscillations
are particularly interesting, because black holes in our own galaxy
make similar but faster oscillations.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as lower-pitch rings emanate out of larger bells, the
slower X-ray oscillations, combined with their brightness, indicate
a larger black hole, somewhere between several hundred and 100,000
solar masses.
</P>
<P>
   The laws of physics do not rule out midsize black holes, and in
the 1980s Dr. Giuseppina Fabbiano of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
for Astrophysics observed moderately bright sources of X-rays in
distant galaxies and suggested that they might come from such
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year at a meeting of the American Astronomical
Society's High Energy Astrophysics Division, two astrophysicists
from Carnegie Mellon University reported observations that they
said indicated a midsize black hole in M82. Separately, two
astronomers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said they had
spotted three other midsize black holes in other galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   But all those claims were based on data from earlier satellites,
which could not pinpoint where the X-rays were coming from or
distinguish one midsize black hole from a group of star-size black
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra's sharper observations show five beacons of X-rays, not
one, within M82. Four appear unextraordinary, possibly remnants of
exploded stars or smaller black holes.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth, the brightest one, is the midsize black hole.

SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES NOTHING NEW IN ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Jef Richards in 4th graf is cq; p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the flashes of ``Buy Coke'' that had moviegoers stampeding to
concession stands, the hidden images of genitalia in liquor ads,
and the word `SEX' secretly emblazoned on Ritz cracker ads, now can
be added George W. Bush's ``RATS.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, only the last example, the latest presidential
campaign flap, actually appeared in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   But fears of subliminal advertising _ nanosecond flashes of
words on TV or carefully embedded images in print _ have flitted in
and out of popular consciousness for four decades. Despite repeated
debunking, the idea has slowly and surely taken root, and the Bush
gaffe, whatever its political consequences, will probably further
the belief that manipulative ad makers are secretly controlling
viewers and readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love conspiracy theories, and people love to hate
advertising. The idea of someone else manipulating you without you
knowing it seems to explain so much,'' said Jef Richards, chair of
the advertising department at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   This latest chapter in American paranoia was uncovered by a
sharp-eyed engineer in Seattle who noticed that a Bush TV ad
slamming Democrat Al Gore's prescription drug plan flashed the word
``RATS,'' as part of the word ``bureaucrats.'' He videotaped it
and, using slow motion, confirmed that the potential epithet
appeared for about one-thirtieth of a second. The registered
Democrat forwarded his findings to the Gore campaign, which alerted
the media.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that subliminal ads have any impact on
viewers' decision making, according to psychologists. Ad makers
have never confessed to using such techniques and the majority
dismiss them as quackery, according to advertising specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign Tuesday vigorously denied that use of ``RATS''
was intentional, but the bizarre lapse broke new ground in the
annals of political advertising. Analysts said they couldn't recall
another example in politics; all research on subliminal ads have
focused on commercial campaigns. Tuesday, psychologists said that
political opinions were even less likely to be swayed by quickly
flashed words than buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As to how ``RATS'' got into the ad in the first place, those
interviewed offered speculation interspersed with chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intentional on somebody's part. You don't miss this
sort of thing,'' said Richards. ``I think maybe it was
tongue-in-cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a time when academics and politicians took
subliminal advertising far more seriously. It started in 1957, at
the height of Sputnik-era paranoia, when ad man James Vicary
boasted publicly that he had done a six-week test at a Ft. Lee,
N.J., movie theater where the messages ``Eat Popcorn'' and ``Drink
Coke'' were flashed every five seconds during movies. He claimed
popcorn sales jumped by 58 percent and coke sales by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The public reacted immediately and Congress called for hearings.
Vicary refused to offer hard data to back his claim, but he did
reassure Congress that his powerful new technique could be used to
benefit humanity by flashing messages like ``Fight Polio.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Vicary was more candid, telling the public his
New Jersey study had relied on a ``small amount of data _ too small
to be meaningful.'' But it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Public fears were stoked, and advertisers' interests piqued.
Several television stations, beginning with one in Bangor, Maine,
used subliminal flashes to simply see if they provoked a response.
In every case, they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists began testing the phenomenon. The notion
that indirect images or suggestions could influence people was
well-known. But researchers have been unable to make the jump from
there to proving that words flashed on a screen could influence
behavior in any significant way.
</P>
<P>
   Most psychologists agree that a person exposed to a visual flash
of a single word can sometimes be steered, immediately afterward,
to pick a similar word from a list of words. The effect lasts
seconds, and only single-word flashes work.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was revived in the 1980s through a book by a
journalist that claimed print ads frequently contained veiled
sexual images used to seduce consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And there was another piece of alleged evidence: a psychoanalyst
published a study in 1982 allegedly showing that some
schizophrenics could be calmed by flashing the phrase, ``Mommy and
I are one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally ridiculous,'' said Robert Fudin, a professor of
psychology at Long Island University in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Fudin has spent part of his career debunking these ideas and, in
one indication of their staying power, published his most recent
attack in an academic journal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subliminal advertising is a joke, wishful thinking at best,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the issue has surfaced regularly, and Congress has
held several hearings over the years.
</P>
<P>
   At one hearing, in 1984, former Congressman Dan Glickman of
Kansas, who is now US Agriculture Secretary, asked aloud: ``How do
you know if subliminal messages are or are not being used during
television and radio commercials?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one of the strange parts of this, it is a Catch-22, of
course,'' replied a Federal Communications Commission official.
``If you know it is there, it is not subliminal.''

 &HT;    U.S. men to kick off coverage
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canberra, Australia _ Members of the men's soccer team will be
the first U.S. athletes Americans can see compete in the 2000
Olympic Games today.
</P>
<P>
   But when the U.S. men headed Down Under, they had not been sure
where they would be playing their first match.
</P>
<P>
   An embarrassed Sydney organizing committee had to order the new
playing surface at Bruce Stadium torn up last week because it did
not meet FIFA specifications after failing to take hold.
Unseasonably cold winter weather in the Australian capital city was
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight's match between the United States and the Czech
Republic, and the women's opener between Australia and Germany
before it, will go as scheduled after FIFA approved the second
resodding job Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven matches will be played, including the United States'
second Saturday against Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to play this thing on a parking lot, then we'll
play it on a parking lot,'' U.S. coach Clive Charles said before
leaving for Australia. ``I've just learned not to worry about
controlling things I can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a wise approach for his Olympic
preparations. Unlike the women's team, which has played 33 times
this year, Charles' men have been together only twice, the last
time on Sept. 4 in a 2-0 victory over the San Diego Flash of the
A-League. Landon Donovan, the 19-year-old scoring phenom, had both
goals after coming from Bayer Leverkusen, his German Bundesliga
club.
</P>
<P>
   With 14 players on the 18-man roster busy during the peak of the
Major League Soccer season this summer, Charles conducted
mini-camps when possible and traveled to MLS games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every camp I've had, we've seen a majority of the people
we're taking to Australia,'' Charles said. ``We have a pretty good
idea what they can do. They're professionals. They haven't
forgotten how to play soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles coaches the men's and women's teams at the University of
Portland, where he was responsible for grooming U.S. national team
fixtures Kasey Keller for the men and Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon
MacMillan.
</P>
<P>
   A week before leaving for the Olympics, he was in the Midwest,
where his Portland men upset preseason No. 1 Indiana on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The men's Olympic objective is to nurture a professional team _
only Charles' current star forward at Portland, Conor Casey, is an
amateur _ as the next generation of U.S. national team members. The
other objective is to accomplish something no American men's
Olympic team has done: advance out of group play.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan; Atlanta's Josh Wolff, who plays for the Chicago Fire;
Ajax Amsterdam midfielder John O'Brien; and D.C. United flankman
Ben Olsen are among those young talents viewing the Olympics as
something of a finishing school. But Charles has taken advantage of
the limit of three over-23 players to give his defensive-oriented
unit some World Cup experience.
</P>
<P>
   Keller's national-team backup, Brad Friedel, was added late
after starting Olympic keeper Adin Brown suffered a leg injury. So
were defenders Jeff Agoos, at 32 one of the oldest players in the
tournament, and Frankie Hejduk, recently out of favor with the
senior team.
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Brazil have been tipped as the gold-medal favorites,
with defending Olympic champion Nigeria and Spain also contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Even the teams the U.S. will face have players with world-class
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite happy with the way this team has formed,'' Charles
said. ``We may be sending our strongest (Olympic) team ever this
time, but we're still playing against some pretty big
professionals.''

CLINTON MULLING TRIP TO IRELAND AFTER ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is eyeing a post-election visit
to Ireland, taking a ``victory lap'' trip to bask in the new, if
uneasy peace in Belfast, someone familiar with the negotiaions told
the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government is already preparing for a December visit
by Clinton, the source close to the Irish Embassy who asked not to
be identified said, and the two governments are still working out
the dates. It would be Clinton's third visit to Ireland as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern invited Clinton to visit when
the two men were in New York last week for the United Nations
Millennium Summit, and the US president very much wants to go, a
senior White House official said. But the White House, concerned
about what developments could occur between now and December, is
not likely to announce a travel date for at least a month, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will meet Wednesday with the two men who head Northern
Ireland's new, power-sharing government, Protestant First Minister
David Trimble and Roman Catholic Deputy First Minister Seamus
Mallon. The two are expected to thank Clinton for his work toward
peace in Ireland and reiterate the invitation to visit.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will mark Trimble's and Mallon's first joint visit
to the White House since Northern Ireland gained home rule last
November.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential trip would be complicated, since it would
demand diplomatically that Clinton visit both Ireland and Northern
Ireland, perhaps with a side trip to see Clinton friend Tony Blair,
the British prime minister. That's a lot to arrange, even for a
globe-trotter like the president, in the last days of the Clinton
presidency, the White House official said.

REPORT FAULTS FEDERAL WEB SITES ON PRIVACY
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most federal Web sites do not meet the commercial
standards for Internet privacy set by the Federal Trade Commission,
including the commission's own site, a new government report has
found.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers, led by Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House
majority leader, and Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican
who is the chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer
Protection, requested that the General Accounting Office assess the
privacy standards of government Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The study released on Tuesday by the accounting office, the
investigative agency of Congress, found that virtually all of the
federal sites, including those of the Internal Revenue Service,
Postal Service and every cabinet-level agency, failed to meet the
four major privacy standards set by the government. Only 3 percent
of the sites met the four standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration rejected the study's findings. Sally
Katzen, the deputy director for management at the White House
Office of Management and Budget, called the report ``seriously
misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies, Katzen wrote in a letter to investigators
dated Sept. 7, had been directed to follow the Privacy Act of 1974
and internal rules on Web site policies rather than the
commission's standards.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a ``longstanding practice,'' Katzen wrote in a
letter that was released with the report, ``to tailor privacy laws
and policies to the needs of the particular sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office measured the government Web sites
against each of the four federal standards for privacy on the
Internet: that a site disclose its information practices before
personal information is collected from consumers; that sites allow
consumers to decide if their personal information may be used for
secondary purposes, like having their names placed on marketing
lists; that consumers have access to personal information, with the
option to change the data if it is incorrect or incomplete, and
that the site protects against unauthorized access to personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said that government agencies like the Internal Revenue
Service and the Department of Health and Human Services, which
``has access to many of your personal medical records,'' should be
held to clear and strict standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are required to give this information to the government _
you have no choice,'' Armey said. ``You don't have to use a
commercial Web site if you feel it has a bad privacy policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in July and August, found that 85 percent
of federal sites posted a privacy notice of some kind and tha 69
percent of the sites provided enough information about how personal
data is used to meet the federal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But in the other categories, the report found, the government
Web sites lacked rigid privacy and security standards. Forty-five
percent of the sites met the commission's criteria for providing
consumers with the option to block outside use of their personal
information; 24 percent provided ample protection against
unauthorized access; and 17 percent permitted consumers to view and
change data.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Chase Manhattan Corp., the third-biggest banking
company in the United States, is in the final stages of
negotiations to acquire J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., one of the most storied
banks in the world, executives close to the talks said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chase was considering paying about $30.9 billion in stock, or
nearly $195 a share, to acquire J.P. Morgan, according to people
close to the banks. An agreement could be announced as early as
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new firm would be called J.P. Morgan Chase, the executives
said. William B. Harrison, chairman and chief executive officer of
Chase, would be chief executive of the combined institution.
Douglas A. Warner III, chairman and chief executive of Morgan,
would be chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase.
</P>
<P>
   While the firms have released no details on the likely deal,
executives close to the negotiations said that job cuts were
expected. Some analysts speculated that several thousand jobs could
be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has been striving to transform itself into a global
financial powerhouse, and acquiring Morgan could sharply accelerate
the process. For well over a decade, Morgan has been changing from
a commercial bank with a blue chip list of clients into a firm
focused on investment banking. Acquiring Morgan could catapult
Chase into the big leagues of investment banking, the business of
raising money for large corporations and advising them on mergers
and acquisitions. It would also continue the consolidation among
the nation's largest banks, leaving only a handful of massive
institutions at the top of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the deal that should have been done a year ago,'' said
Michael Mayo, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``It's a
logical progression.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Chase's banking customers would probably not notice much
immediate change as a result of the merger. With the exception of
underwriting and trading corporate bonds and loans, there is little
overlap between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Chase is one of the biggest credit-card issuers in the country
and a major lender to individuals to buy houses and cars. In
contrast, even as it has labored to reinvent itself, Morgan has
continued to focus largely on serving the financing needs of
blue-chip clients, both corporate and individual. Still, both firms
have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of the leading
investment banks, which are in businesses that have been far more
lucrative than the lending business at the core of commercial
banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resulting organization would clearly be powerful because
both firms are both bank and investment bank,'' said Robert
Albertson, president of Pilot Financial, an investment firm in New
York. ``The old Chase and the old Morgan a decade ago would have
been oil and water but now they're made of the same liquid. They've
grown closer rather than further apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if it is completed, would end months of speculation
about who might acquire the 150-year-old Morgan. Several firms,
including Deutsche Bank of Germany, have recently considered buying
Morgan as consolidation has picked up speed on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, there have been several high-priced
acquisitions of mid-sized American financial companies, including
PaineWebber Group, the brokerage firm, and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, a midsized investment bank. The commercial banking
industry has been consolidating as well. But none of those deals
involved two firms with the heritage and clout of Chase and J.P.
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, which was founded in 1799, has grown rapidly in recent
years through mergers with some of New York's biggest banks,
including Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover. More recently,
it has been buying up smaller investment banking firms. To
strengthen its position as an underwriter of technology companies,
it acquired Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, a San Francisco-based firm, last
year.
</P>
<P>
   This spring it bought Beacon Group, a merger boutique run by
Geoff Boisi, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs Group who
is now overseeing Chase's investment banking operations. In June,
Chase added Robert Fleming Holdings Ltd., an investment banking and
money-management firm in Europe for $7.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even with those purchases, Chase faced the prospect of
losing ground as competitors made even bigger acquisitions. UBS,
the giant Swiss bank, agreed to pay more than $12 billion to buy
PaineWebber earlier this year. Last month, Credit Suisse Group,
another Swiss bank, agreed to pay $12.8 billion to buy Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette from Axa, a French financial conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals nearly wiped out the ranks of independent,
middle-tier securities firms, increasing the pressure on would-be
buyers to rush in. At the beginning of this week, only three
remained: Morgan, Lehman Brothers Holdings and Bear Stearns Cos.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Morgan has worked for years to transform itself
into a firm focused on investment banking but has stayed away from
mergers and major acquisitions. But according to one adviser who
had talked with J.P. Morgan, Warner has been shopping the company
to prospective buyers for several months. That person said that
J.P. Morgan was asking for a premium of 15 percent to 20 percent
over the current stock price, a sum some investment banks thought
was too rich.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern was J.P. Morgan's fixed income trading
business which competitors say made up too much of their business..
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank was one suitor interested in J.P. Morgan, but that
bank would have to register shares in the United States before it
could complete any transaction, and that would take more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Morgan's chief financial officer, Peter Hancock,
quit suddenly, adding more fuel to the speculation. Then, Tuesday
morning, Douglas Warner, the chairman and chief executive of
Morgan, set the rumors flying when he canceled an appearance at a
banking conference hosted by Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's stock shot up $16.13 to close at $185.44 on the New
York Stock Exchange Tuesday. Chase's shares fell $4.88 to $52.50.

DEAL LIKELY TO ELIMINATE FEW JOBS AND FREE UP TIGHT OFFICE SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHASE-MORGAN, CHASE-BANKS-HISTORY, CHASE-MORGAN-HISTORY) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A union between Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
would likely mean the elimination of only a few jobs and free
much-needed real estate space, industry observers contend.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ending the independence of J.P. Morgan, a storied New
York firm that has built a strong reputation as an investment bank.
It would also likely mean the elimination of the jobs of some
employees in similar positions at both companies.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to government officials in New York who had
limited knowledge of the plans, the impact would be minimal, and
the acquisition was likely to have a positive impact on New York's
already tight real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the consolidation will be at the higher levels, and
that banking talent will be redeployed, because those people are
quite resilient and skilled,'' said Mitchell Moss, a business
professor at New York University, echoing the sentiments of
government officials. ``And it will be very good for the New York
real estate market, because it will open up space in a very tight
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that they were publicly taking a
wait-and-see approach to the mergers of the two New York companies.
But, privately, they said it would help strengthen the financial
services industry in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said that the two companies have ``complimentary
strengths'' that will help a new company at a time when ``the
financial services industry is increasingly one that is becoming
more integrated'' and the lines between ``investment banks, retail
banks and other banks'' were slowly being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Moss added that, in the end, New York will ``benefit from being
home of the merged banks.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall impacts of any acquisition on the economy, job
market and the real estate industry are still unclear, but local
leaders seem to be taking a positive attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Weisbrod, the president of the Downtown Alliance of New
York, a group that represents businesses in the Wall Street area,
said that the strength of a combined bank would help Manhattan
solidify its international dominance in the financial services
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consolidation in today's economic climate does not have as
much of an impact as it would have several years ago,'' Weisbrod
said. ``In a way, anything that is going to strengthen New York's
role as the financial capital of the world is going to be
encouraged, especially in this era of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisbrod said that the areas of Manhattan where both companies
have their offices are in dire need of available commercial real
estate and that any job loses would be offset quickly in this
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1980s, the consolidation of commercial banking
did have an impact on occupancy rates on commercial real estate
space and did contribute to the depression on Wall Street,'' he
said. ``But Lower Manhattan's economy is going extremely well,
people can find jobs, the growth of Silicon Alley has really
diversified things.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, the NYU business professor, said that while some may worry
about losing their jobs, few will be in a position where they have
to truly worry about finding employment. ``The important thing is
that no matter what happens in any merger, New York is going to be
the home of one of the largest banks in the world,'' Moss said.
``There will be a stronger, better bank in New York, as opposed to
having two weaker ones.''  &QL;

LIEBERMAN, BY GORE'S SIDE, LIGHTENS THE CAMPAIGN LOAD 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Before Vice President Al Gore set foot on the stage
Tuesday afternoon before a raucous crowd of 2,000 supporters at
Cincinnati Technical and Community College, there came The
Testimonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been a friend of mine for almost 15 years, and
he's a man of family and faith,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman told the
already enthusiastic mass. ``Al Gore is a man of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   This scene has quickly become a chestnut for the Democrats'
national ticket, repeated with slight variations from city to city
and likely to be heard again Wednesday when the two men travel to
Boston. More than any other presidential and vice-presidential
nominee in recent memory _ with the possible exception of Gore and
President Clinton in 1992 _ Gore and Lieberman have made a habit of
appearing in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   The practice defies the conventional wisdom that running mates
should split up to cover as many bases as possible. But campaign
officials say it will continue through November, reflecting the
benefits they believe Lieberman has brought to the ticket, benefits
that Gore aides say have exceeded their hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats see tactical advantages in joint campaigning, but
the most compelling factor may be the one Gore aides are least
comfortable addressing openly: It is clear, they agree, that
Lieberman loosens up the famously stiff vice president, making him
a more effective candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good friends, and campaigning is a stressful
experience that's easier when it's shared with someone,'' said Tad
Devine, a senior strategist for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Brazile, Gore's campaign manager, said, ``They just enjoy
each other. You may even see some foursomes out there, with the
spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   His aides say that Gore may not be adept at whipping up a crowd,
but that he performs best before groups that are already
enthusiastic. Lieberman, they say, effectively gets audiences ready
for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's easy manner and constant joking leaven Gore's
tendency toward seriousness, and the vice president, like others on
the campaign, has not escaped his teasing. At a recent forum in
Portland, Ore., Gore, noting his wife's training as a psychologist,
said that in recent years, ``Her psychology practice is almost
entirely devoted to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For which she is not adequately reimbursed, I might add,''
Lieberman shot back.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the candidates rolled merrily through Ohio aboard a
pair of yellow school buses to highlight their plans for improving
education in this critical swing state. The day was largely
dedicated to stagecraft, as the candidates visited schools and took
questions from students, basked in the adulation of cheerleaders
and band members, and spoke at a rally here. They were followed by
the campaign's own television crew, filming them together for
possible use in future television ads.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Democratic convention last month, Lieberman has made
campaign appearances on 19 days. On 12 of those days, including the
four-day boat tour he and Gore took down the Mississippi River, he
has made at least one appearance with the vice president, and often
two or three per day. By contrast, in the same period, Dick Cheney,
the Republican vice presidential nominee, has campaigned with Gov.
George W. Bush on four days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``A lot of people still have this feeling that Gore isn't quite
sincere, that he's too serious,'' said Theodore J. Lowi, a
professor of political science at Cornell University. ``Lieberman
brings that Hubert Humphrey-like joy to the experience of
campaigning, and he sounds like he really believes what he's
saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's a living reminder to people that Gore can make a very
bold, very well-received move,'' Lowi said. ``That is, picking
Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's main role in their joint appearances has been to
introduce the vice president with boasts about his accomplishments.
And he is performing an important service for a a presidential
candidate whose own bragging _ like his claim to having a hand in
creating the Internet _ has sometimes been clumsy and, however
accurate, widely mocked. Lieberman reminds audiences that Gore
volunteered for service in Vietnam, that he supported an overhaul
of welfare, that he voted for United States entry into the Persian
Gulf war, and that he helped preside over a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody who is fair would disagree with this
comment,'' Lieberman said on Tuesday, ``that Al Gore has been the
most effective and successful vice president in the history of the
United States of America.''

   SELMA, Ala. _ In the fertile crescent of the civil rights
movement, where a white mayor named Joe T. Smitherman has held
power for 36 years despite a former life as a segregationist, the
slogan echoed through the summer: Joe Gotta Go!
</P>
<P>
   Well, Joe's gone.
</P>
<P>
   Forced into his first runoff in 10 mayoral elections, the
70-year-old Smitherman lost Tuesday night to computer consultant
James Perkins, who becomes Selma's first black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Just 26 minutes after the polls closed, word spread on radio and
quickly to the streets that Perkins _ twice before a loser to
Smitherman _ had won 57 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Horns blared from an impromptu parade of cars up and down the
main street, just blocks from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, a symbol of
the fight for black voting rights from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the world. We've been blessed,'' said Brenda Carter,
a 50-year-old black woman who baby-sits for white families in town.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins' winning percentage nearly matches the black percentage
of the population of the city, which had 300 black voters to 10,000
white ones when Smitherman first won election in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In conceding the election at his headquarters, where workers had
just started dining on fried chicken, fluffy biscuits and potato
salad yellow from egg yolks, Smitherman praised Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the new mayor, the mayor-elect, I offer my
congratulations,'' Smitherman said. ``I love Selma. I'm sure he
loves it. And anything I can do to help him, he can ask for it. I
won't interfere.'' Perkins supporters canvassed the polls
throughout the day Tuesday. The 47-year-old Selma native worked
hard to ensure the vote was strong enough to neutralize the
controversial absentee ballots that Smitherman has used to win past
elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the polls, some locations reported nearly an 80 percent
turnout.

COMMENTARY: THE BIGGEST RAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)  (EDS: Note that beginning with the 10th graf, specific letters in
this column are boldfaced, to give a `subliminal message.') 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's the year of the rat.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS's ``Survivor,'' rats were a leitmotif. The contestants
ate grilled rat while competing to see who was the biggest rat.
</P>
<P>
   In our political reality drama, rats have also scurried center
stage. The presidential race, which seems doomed to stay on a
tatty, ratty low road, has fallen into another kerfuffle over a
sneaky epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign aides went nuts when they figured out that a
Republican ad lacing into the vice president on prescription drugs
had one frame that flashed the word ``RATS'' in big white letters,
as a Cubist fragment of the word ``bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   W. dismissed the charges, saying ``conspiracy theories abound
... '' Just as his father used to parrot the tactical talk of his
handlers, W. spouted insider jargon. ``This ad is coming out of
rotation'' anyway, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied over and over that there was any subliminal intent.
Well, actually, he denied over and over that there was any
``subliminable'' intent.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters pounced on that superfluous syllable, taking off
after the Republican for not being able to pronounce the crime he
was accused of. Soon we had an abominable subliminable flapdoodle.
</P>
<P>
   The hullabaloo, I think, is preposterous. One RATS, and Bush is
a SNAKE?
</P>
<P>
   Experts tell me that animation and graphics are done by
computer, frame by frame. So if the word RATS appeared on the
screen, even for a thirtieth of a second, it could only happen if
somebody told a computer he wanted the word RATS to appear in a
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Poppycock. When it comes to  &UR; Republicans &LR; , reporters  &UR; are &LR;  just
too -fin &UR; icky &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; W &LR; hiny and baby &UR; is &LR; h Gore aides are  &UR; blowing it &LR;  out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A &LR; ll those  &UR; big &LR; feet at  &UR; Time &LR;  and other publications who keep
saying that W. is too jejune to run for president have  &UR; goof &LR; ed &UR; ! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; no &LR; tion that W. is so  &UR; ad &LR; dled by Al Gore that he has
resorted to being crypto &UR; graphic &LR;  in going after h &UR; is &LR;  critics is
utterly  &UR; without &LR;  merit. It was surely un &UR; intent &LR; ional.
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; gop &LR; her couldn't dig a bigger hole than Al Gore does when he
makes these  &UR; ad &LR;  hominem &UR; attacks &LR;  with his supercilious
sound &UR; bite &LR; s about how he's ``never seen anything like'' the RATS.
Autumn should be  &UR; big &LR;  picture  &UR; time &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; W &LR; hy  &UR; is &LR;  everyone piling on poor Governor Bush, never
than &UR; king &LR;  him for bringing a new tone to politics, always treating
him as a f &UR; rat &LR;  boy?
</P>
<P>
   To suggest  &UR; that &LR;   &UR; man &LR; iacal desperation d &UR; rove  &LR; those fine Bush
professionals in Austin to  &UR; has &LR; tily approve a brainwashing ad is a
c &UR; an &LR; ard  &UR; out of control &LR;  _ b &UR; ego &LR; ne, pundits &UR; ! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; This was &LR;  just more evidence that the Gore camp is packed with
re &UR; no &LR; wned  &UR; slip &LR; pery strategists who will get their come &UR; up &LR; pance
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gore  &UR; of &LR; ficials continue this misguided  &UR; course &LR;  of
railing against the  &UR; Republicans &LR; , they should remember that most
TV viewers are not re &UR; play &LR; ing the ad in slow motion, frame by
frame, in some Paul McCartney-is-dead moment. So why go  &UR; ball &LR; istic
at  &UR; that  &LR; one little  &UR; way &LR; ward syllable? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; The &LR;  truth is, it's  &UR; Bush &LR;  league that the Gore  &UR; team turns &LR; 
to de &UR; mean &LR; ing its rival  &UR; when it falls back &LR;  on snitching and
peddling gaffes to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Remember &LR;  that Al Gore may be leading now, but he is still
struggling to claim any votes in the  &UR; South &LR;  from the mountains of
North  &UR; Carolina &LR;  to the beaches of Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   What about the real issues Americans care about, like your drug
pr &UR; ice &LR; s and  &UR; your &LR;  pressing questions about school  &UR; staff &LR; ing? The
Gore cabal should stop be &UR; rat &LR; ing the Bushies because,  &UR; boy &LR; , do
they look silly.
</P>
<P>
   wouldn't it be better to discuss the merits of the Bush plan to
secure  &UR; low &LR; er-cost drugs for our aging -pa &UR; rent &LR; s?
</P>
<P>
   Should a man like George W.  &UR; Bush  &LR; suffer such in &UR; dignity &LR;  at
the h &UR; and &LR; s of dis &UR; honor &LR; able Democrats and biased, liberal
journalists &UR; ? Ha &LR; rdly.  &UR; Ha &LR; nds off, you vultures.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply a Gore c &UR; al &LR; umny. The Democrats should learn to stop
whining and tattling and play by the  &UR; rules &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   W.,  &UR; don't &LR;  pay any heed to the media sharks circling, to the
frenzy of bluefish. As your dad always liked to say before he cast
his line, ``Those bluefish are dead meat.'' I be &UR; lie &LR; ve there was
no subliminal or subliminable message in your ad.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Remember, it's  &LR; only  &UR; the &LR;  middle of September. It's not too
late to re &UR; cover  &LR; your lead. Chin  &UR; up,  &LR; Mr. Bush, your critics are
just  &UR; stupid! &LR;

 &HT;    You can bet Knight will surface again, because he wins
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - So, do you want Bobby Knight coaching at
your school?
</P>
<P>
   During an hourlong ESPN interview Tuesday night, Knight said he
wants to coach again. Even said he would start tomorrow if the
situation were right. So this morning, this is the question: Would
you hire him?
</P>
<P>
   Before you answer, know this: Someone will.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, don't be surprised if schools end up fighting over him,
tossing out reasons why their situation would indeed be right.
Aerodynamic chairs! Shatterproof vases! Instant expulsion for any
student who doesn't put the ``Mister'' before ``Knight''!
</P>
<P>
   Because for all the flaws, Knight can do two things that every
athletic director craves. Win games. Fill seats.
</P>
<P>
   OK, he also has been known to toss the latter. But someone is
going to overlook that and every other incident during 29 years at
Indiana University. Someone is going to hire him. And until they
do, every other athletic director with an opening is going to face
The Bobby Question.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine he wasn't fired Sunday. Imagine IU president Myles Brand
went ahead and did it back in May a few weeks before Leonard
Hamilton told the University of Miami he was headed to the NBA, a
couple months before UM hired Tulane's Perry Clark.
</P>
<P>
   You're UM athletic director Paul Dee. You're looking for someone
who can make sure your rising basketball program doesn't suddenly
disappear from the national spotlight. Someone who can win. Someone
who can sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Do you call Knight?
</P>
<P>
   Or suppose you're Tom Cargill, athletic director at Florida
Atlantic University. Your basketball team isn't just coming off a
2-28 season. It lost every non-conference game by at least 18
points. It finished at the bottom of the RPI ratings for Division I
schools.
</P>
<P>
   You've already gone the big-name route in football, hiring
Howard Schnellenberger.
</P>
<P>
   Would you be interested in Knight?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already been asked that,'' Cargill said Tuesday, adding
with a chuckle. ``Several people have called me to talk about him.
The wheels are turning.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't elaborate on who these people are. But he makes it
clear that it's a moot point, that he and FAU are quite happy with
second-year coach Sidney Green.
</P>
<P>
   But if he were in the market for a coach ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule Bobby Knight out,'' he said. ``He's a proven
winner. He graduates athletes. And he would most definitely bring
attention to any program. ... That attention is important as long
as it's positive.''
</P>
<P>
   With Knight, it won't always be.
</P>
<P>
   The past 29 years proved that. The past four months emphasized
it and, in the process, vividly illustrated why you shouldn't want
Knight at your school.
</P>
<P>
   It would be one thing if you got a sense that at age 59, he
might change. Or, perhaps more important, a sense that he thinks he
should change. Maybe then you could cling to all that is good about
Knight and, yes, there is plenty of that.
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment in May when he gave a written apology that
included one wonderfully telling sentence ``I've always been too
confrontational, especially when I know I'm right'' it has been
clear Knight believes that if you have a problem with anything he
has done, well, then that's your problem.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a world of twisted logic a place where a man who has
berated an elderly secretary, choked players and used soiled toilet
paper as a coaching tool, can hold a press conference and, in all
seriousness, point to a 19-year-old not calling him ``Mister''
Knight or ``Coach'' Knight as an example of the decline of civility
in today's society.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. Bobby Knight on manners. What's next, Jerry
Springer lamenting all this violence in wrestling?
</P>
<P>
   That absurd press conference should have been his odd, but
fitting farewell. But it won't be. Isiah Thomas already has said he
would offer his former coach a chance to be an assistant with the
Indiana Pacers. Not that Knight would ever go for that scenario.
He's not the boss? He's surrounded by a dozen millionaire NBA
players, their cell phones, agents and entourages?
</P>
<P>
   No, he will wait for a college to offer ``the right situation.''
And you can bet one will.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of zero-tolerance? Check out our hero-tolerance policy!

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Reno says unfair society to blame for ethnic disparity in
federal death cases
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By STEVE LASH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying ``our society is not fair,'' Attorney
General Janet Reno on Tuesday blamed poverty and drugs for an
overwhelming ethnic disparity in the percentage of federal
defendants on trial for crimes punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   Reno added that the criminal justice system is ill-equipped to
fight these societal ills and called for the public's help. The
attorney general downplayed accusations that racially biased
prosecutors are to blame for racial inequities in death-penalty
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime is often the product of social ills and harsh
conditions, such as poverty, drug abuse and lack of opportunity
that disproportionately affect minorities,'' Reno said. ``The
federal criminal justice system is not designed to remedy these
systemic problems by itself. We must ensure, however, that all
defendants who come into our system are treated in a fair and just
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's comments followed the release Tuesday of a Justice
Department report that showed minorities accounted for 80.4 percent
of the 682 federal criminal defendants accused of committing a
capital crime between 1995 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The study, however, also showed that federal prosecutors were
ultimately more likely to seek the death penalty against a
defendant who is white than one of another race.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Justice Department sought the death penalty in
38.3 percent of the cases involving a white defendant but in only
24.7 percent of the cases involving a black defendant and 20
percent of the cases involving a Hispanic defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she was ``sorely troubled'' but not surprised by the
racial disparity among criminal defendants on trial in potential
death-penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minorities are overrepresented in the federal death penalty
system as both victims and defendants, relative to the general
population,'' she said. ``Sadly, the same is true of the entire
criminal justice system, both state and federal. This should be of
concern to us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen people are on federal death row, including 13 blacks,
four whites, one Hispanic and one from an unspecified ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted South Texas killer Juan Raul Garza, whose execution is
scheduled for Dec. 12, would be the first federal prisoner put to
death since 1963 and the first since Congress reinstated the death
penalty in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, a former leader of a drug ring who killed three
associates to further his illegal business, is urging President
Clinton to grant him clemency that would reduce his sentence to
life in prison without a chance for parole. &UR;  &LR; Garza's attorney, Greg
Wiercioch of Houston, has said he might press Clinton to approve
clemency based on the racial disparity argument. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Clinton, who has yet to act on Garza's clemency plea, declined
to comment specifically on the Justice Department report but said a
defendant's race should be irrelevant when prosecutors seek the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone like me, who supports capital punishment and has
actually presided over executions, I think, has an extra strong
responsibility to make sure there's nothing wrong with the
process,'' Clinton said, recalling his tenure as Arkansas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 400-page study racially classifies criminal
defendants as white, black, Hispanic or ``other,'' which is defined
as Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Aleut, Indian or
unknown. The report, a statistical compilation, makes no
recommendations on ending the disparity.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in discussing the data, said further studies must be
performed to examine more specific questions addressing racial
inequities in criminal justice. These questions must address not
only inequities at trial but at all stages of the criminal justice
system from the time a police officer decides to stop a suspect,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department began its study shortly after Illinois
Gov. George Ryan issued a moratorium on capital punishment in his
state in January. Ryan put a temporary end to executions after
discovering that 13 death-row inmates had been exonerated in his
state since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, however, said no need exists for a similar federal
moratorium because the system, though imperfect, has procedural
``safeguards'' to ensure innocent people are not executed.
</P>
<P>
   These federal protections include the requirement that criminal
defendants on trial for their lives be represented by an attorney
experienced in capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also allows death-row inmates, like
Garza, to seek presidential clemency, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Justice Department's internal guidelines also
reduce the possibility that a defendant's race plays any role in
whether the death penalty is sought, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under agency rules, U.S. attorneys must notify the department's
death-penalty review committee whenever a defendant faces trial for
a capital crime. The committee, which is not told the defendant's
race, then reviews the case and makes its recommendation to the
attorney general, who ultimately decides.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general is not apprised by subordinates of the race
of the defendant. However, Reno conceded that she can readily
determine the defendant's race in some cases by his or her name.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., called these protections
insufficient and urged Clinton to call for a halt to executions
pending an independent evaluation of the federal criminal justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the right thing to do given the troubling racial ...
disparities in the administration of the federal death penalty,''
Feingold said.

REVISED HOUSE BILL RENEWS   PUSH FOR PATIENT'S RIGHTS BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Mich., Wash., Mo., Mont., Ga., Iowa)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional supporters of a patient's bill of
rights said Tuesday that they had revised the legislation passed by
the House last year, in a bid to win the votes of a few more Senate
Republicans needed to enact the measure this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The House and the Senate have passed different versions of the
bill to define patients' rights, but efforts to negotiate a
compromise have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation said they had given up on trying
to reach an agreement with Senate Republican leaders. Instead, they
are trying to revise the House-passed legislation to address the
concerns of individual Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republican senators have previously voted with Democrats on
patients' rights. The 46 Senate Democrats hope they can pick up the
votes of a few more Republicans in view of the fact that Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, and
Democratic candidates for Congress hammer the issue almost every
day.
</P>
<P>
   The new effort is being led by three House champions of
patients' rights _ Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.; John D. Dingell,
D-Mich., and Greg Ganske, R-Iowa _ and by a leading Senate critic
of managed care, Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise is supported by the American Medical Association,
whose members complain that their professional judgments are often
overridden by health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The four lawmakers and the doctors' association are trying to
woo Republican senators running for re-election, including Sens.
Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Spencer Abraham of Michigan, Slade
Gorton of Washington, John Ashcroft of Missouri, and Conrad Burns
of Montana. Democrats reckon that they have picked up a vote with
the arrival of a Democrat, Zell Miller, to replace Sen. Paul
Coverdell of Georgia, a Republican who died in July.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill would set standards for all private health
insurance, protecting at least 160 million Americans, or more than
three times as many as would be covered by the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise measure tries to address the concerns of Senate
Republicans who want to protect states' rights _ notably, the right
of states to regulate health insurance. If a state could show that
its insurance laws were ``at least substantially equivalent'' to
the new federal standards, the state law would remain in effect,
and state officials could enforce the patient protections of state
law.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, the compromise bill would allow some lawsuits
to be filed against health plans in state court, but would require
others to be filed in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   This would codify the emerging consensus of many judges, who
have suggested in decisions over the past five years that injured
patients can sue HMOs in state court in disputes over the quality
of medical care _ traditional malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise bill, a patient could sue in state court if
a health plan denied a claim for benefits on the ground that a
service was not medically necessary or that a treatment was
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Patients would have to sue in federal court if they wanted to
challenge an administrative decision to deny benefits _ a decision
involving no question of medical judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the compromise bill seeks to allay Republican concerns
that employers might be saddled with immense new costs if patients
could sue them for damages arising from care provided through an
employer-sponsored health plan.
</P>
<P>
   The revised legislation says employers may not be held liable
unless they directly participated in a decision to deny benefits,
as a result of which a patient was injured or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, defendants could not be required to pay punitive
damages unless they showed ``willful or wanton disregard for the
rights or safety'' of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. D. Ted Lewers, chairman of the American Medical Association,
said: ``The AMA strongly supports the revised version of the
bipartisan patient's bill of rights. It covers all Americans and
holds health plans accountable for actions that harm patients.''
</P>
<P>
   John E. Stone, a spokesman for Norwood, said the congressman had
presented the proposed compromise to the speaker, J. Dennis
Hastert, to the White House and to ``a number of Republicans'' in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to hold together the coalition we have in favor of the
Norwood-Dingell bill, while doing what we can to bring in some
reluctant Senate supporters,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill includes several tax incentives to make
health insurance more available and affordable. To win Republican
votes, Democrats said they would consider allowing an expansion of
a pilot program that lets people set aside money for medical
expenses in tax-sheltered accounts known as medical savings
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee, said the encouragement of such accounts
was one of his top legislative priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a Republican version of the patient's bill of
rights in July 1999, and the House passed the Norwood-Dingell bill,
with bipartisan support, in October 1999. Negotiators from the two
chambers met for the first time on March 2 and later reached
agreement on a few issues.
</P>
<P>
   In drafting the new compromise bill, lawmakers borrowed language
developed in the conference committee, headed by Sen. Don Nickles
of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   They accepted language suggested by Nickles to establish an
administrative appeals process for patients denied benefits by
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise also adopts legislative language similar to that
proposed by Republicans to ensure that patients have timely access
to medical specialists and that doctors can prescribe ``medically
necessary'' drugs, regardless of restrictions imposed by HMOs.

ERVIN STEPS INTO BIG TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ A few days after Anthony Ervin stunned the
U.S. swimming community, he walked to a 25-yard community pool
across the street from his family's Valencia, Calif., home and swam
lap after uninterrupted lap.
</P>
<P>
   If the lifeguard on duty knew he was eyeballing the
second-swiftest swimmer in U.S. history, he hid his awe well.
Indeed, none of the pool's patrons gave the slightest indication
they were aware the Kobe Bryant of freestyle sprinting _ ie: The
Future _ was in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   For that, Ervin was enormously grateful. He found it a relief to
be regarded as just another lanky teen-ager trying to escape the
Santa Clarita Valley heat.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight has been beating down on Ervin, 19, since he
earned an Olympic berth at the U.S. Trials in Indianapolis in
August. The pride of Hart High will have his first chance to make
America proud Saturday when he swims a leg of the 400-meter
freestyle relay on the opening session of the swimming competition
at the International Aquatic Centre.
</P>
<P>
   The relay race is loaded with enough symbolism to sink an
oversized island. The principal players figure to be the U.S.,
which has never lost the sprint freestyle relay in the Olympics,
and the Australians, who are desperate to turn the swimming
competition into a backyard pool party.
</P>
<P>
   Aussies ruled the pool the last time the Olympics was held in
their swimming-crazed country, in 1956. They won 14 medals in
Melbourne, eight of them gold, to the United States' two golds,
four silvers and five bronzes. In 1960 the tide started to turn in
favor of the U.S. and the Aussies have been chasing the Americans
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The host country has been gearing its top swimmers for this week
since the U.S. won 24 Olympic medals to Australia's 12 in Atlanta
in 1996. Not so Ervin, who never dreamed until this spring that he
might be drafted this summer to fight for U.S. swimming supremacy
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the summer of 1999 selling men's clothing at a local
department store instead of honing his swimming skills. So when
Ervin made the U.S. team in the relay and then clocked the
third-fastest time in history in the 50-meter freestyle to earn an
individual Olympic berth, he caught more than the Australians off
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin's father is three-quarters African American, which made
Ervin the first U.S. Olympic swimmer of African-American heritage
and reduced him to a flash point in the smoldering brushfire that
is race in this country. In a matter of seconds, he found himself
U.S. Swimming's answer to Australia's star runner Cathy Freeman,
the standard bearer for her country's Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   Squirming in his seat during a recent media session, Ervin
acknowledged he is ``sort of baffled'' by the intense interest in
his ancestry. ``My dream since I was a little kid was to make the
Olympic team,'' Ervin said. ``In my own mind, I never felt like
there was anything stopping me.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no stopping Ervin since he enrolled at Cal as a
freshman last fall and resumed training after taking most of the
summer off to work in the men's casual-clothing department at
Robinsons-May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my last summer to be with my friends,'' said Ervin, a
two-time CIF champion in 1999. ``I didn't want to put that much
time into swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time Ervin had balked at the commitment
swimming demands of its suitors. When he was in junior high, he
told his parents Jack and Sherry he wanted to quit the sport and
take up archery. His parents discouraged the idea and so Ervin
stuck it out.

   When Ervin got to high school and came under the influence of
Hart coach Steve Neale, his swimming career took off like an arrow
shot from a bow. It's no wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   The way he glides through the water, one's first inclination is
to check him for gills. Ervin is as comfortable in the water as a
dolphin (as playful, too).
</P>
<P>
   He is comfortable in the classroom, too, which afforded him his
pick of colleges. Ervin chose Berkeley after bonding with the
Bears' sprint coach, Mike Bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Cal was where Matt Biondi developed into the swimmer who set the
world standard of excellence in the sprints in the 1980s. It is a
perennial powerhouse, attracting top swimmers from around the
world. In Ervin's tightknit circle, there was some concern how he
would fit in at such a melting pot of a place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I thought it would be the best thing for him to go
out and experience that kind of competition,'' Neale said. ``You
can get stale being the big fish in a small fishbowl. But another
part of me worried that the intensity of a program like Cal's would
be too much for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin went in with his eyes wide open. ``I knew it'd be
different being in college, that my best times before weren't going
to cut it,'' he said. ``I wouldn't say it was intimidating. It was
just a lot more intense than high school swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Ervin long to adjust. At the spring NCAA
Championships, he won the 50 and 100 freestyles in a 25-meter pool.
He set a world record for the short-course 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Biondi had gotten out of the blocks that quickly in
college, begging the question: Can Ervin afford to stick around to
finish what he has started?
</P>
<P>
   Ervin trained this summer in Phoenix alongside America's top
sprinter, Gary Hall Jr., who dropped out of college so he could
accept money for racing. Hall, 25, has been trying to drum up
interest in a series of cash match races that would pit him against
another sprinter. Ervin, his closest competitor stateside in the
one-lap race, looms as the most logical opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is Ervin cannot chase Hall for money and more
NCAA titles, too. His parents are adamant about him getting his
college degree and Ervin doesn't disagree with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary and I've talked about it a little bit,'' Ervin said.
``It's just kind of in the brainstorming phase. Until it's
finalized, I'm not going to take it seriously, especially not until
I'm done with school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have to be vast, vast sums of money for me to give
up my college education. Getting my degree is foremost in my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not entirely true. For the next two weeks, getting an
Olympic medal is uppermost in Ervin's thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a medal would be a huge accomplishment,'' he said.
``Winning a gold medal would be a climax.''
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful, way-out truth? It could be just the beginning. &QL;

 &HT;    Approaching your doctor
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you would like to pray with your doctors as a way to help the
healing process, how do you let your physicians know?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't be afraid to approach them. Ask them if they practice a
certain faith and how comfortable they are bringing those beliefs
into the examining room. Doctors say there is usually a time _
after they have discussed treatment options and explanations _ for
the patient to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Explain your faith and what aspects are important to you. Tell
them if you would like to pray and when. If you are having surgery
a week from the appointment, tell the doctor you would like to have
a short time of prayer or meditation. That way, you can find a
place in the surgery schedule before you are medicated or too sick
to follow through.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you meet resistance or a high level of discomfort, consider
taking your requests for prayers to someone else _ the nurses, a
hospital chaplain or your family. However, if you believe this is
very important and you are shaken by your doctor's lack of
enthusiasm, perhaps you should think about finding a different
doctor.

volunteers. Jose Forquet, 34, of Goldman, Sachs is a co-founder of
a database used by the Republican Party to recruit corporate

-- A good measure of what the Wright brothers accomplished with the

million dollars, use NASA research facilities, and tap the talents
of historians and engineers in an effort to build and fly a replica
of the Wright Flyer on Dec. 17, 2003, the 100th anniversary of
powered flight. Orville Wright is at the controls of the ``Wright

NEW AWARDS GET COMPLAINTS ABOUT SLIGHTING A MEXICAN GENRE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIREYA NAVARRO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first Latin Grammy Awards show, Wednesday night on CBS, will
be the first multilingual broadcast on a major American network:
the talk will be mostly in English and Spanish, the singing in
Spanish and Portuguese. It is also the first time the National
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences has allowed recordings
released outside the United States to be Grammy nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled on the national academy's annual Grammy Awards, the
Latin Grammys are decidedly international. Their debut at the
Staples Center in Los Angeles is intended to celebrate the Latin
music explosion in the United States and expose American viewers to
the music of the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the Latin Grammys a touring event every
year,'' said Mauricio Abaroa, senior vice president and executive
director of the 2,600-member Latin Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences, an arm of the national group. The Latin academy, formed
in 1997, is made up of voting members from 15 countries. ``This is
an international project that will be a showcase for the music of
the different countries,'' Abaroa said.
</P>
<P>
   In the future the show will be as likely to be staged in Buenos
Aires or Rio de Janeiro as in the United States, the Latin academy
said. Michael Greene, president of the national academy, said that
Latin music was so diverse that he could envision separate Grammys
for Mexico, Brazil and other Latin countries someday. ``The
possibilities are endless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to represent musical styles from Cuba to Argentina,
the Latin Grammys have not made everyone happy. One record
executive complained that separating the Latin Grammys from the
regular awards would result in marginalizing them. There has also
been criticism that regional Mexican music, one of the best-selling
Latin styles in the United States, receives short shrift in terms
of performances and presenters.
</P>
<P>
   In development for more than 10 years, the Latin Grammys were
born of a sense that the eight Latin categories among the regular
Grammys fell short of recognizing the growth and the diversity of
Latin genres, national academy officials said. Latin music now
represents about 5 percent of the overall United States music
market, Recording Industry Association of America figures show, and
in recent years has become one of its fastest-growing segments of
that industry.
</P>
<P>
   The main Grammy awards are given in 98 categories; the Latin
Grammys have 40, from record of the year and best new artist to
best tango album and best Portuguese-language rock album. Some
recording executives noted that unlike the regular Grammys, which
sometimes resulted in odd choices for the Latin categories because
voters included members unfamiliar with Latin genres, the Latin
Grammy winners were voted on by industry professionals who know
their music.
</P>
<P>
   With Jennifer Lopez, Jimmy Smits, Gloria Estefan and Andy Garcia
as hosts, the banter on the show is expected to be bilingual, and
winners may switch completely to their native language in
acceptance speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a risk? Sure,'' said Jack Sussman, vice president for
specials at CBS, which also broadcasts the Grammys. But Sussman, a
former programming chief for MTV Latin America, said that the
talent involved in the show and the potential for building a new
annual franchise on the network outweighed concerns that
English-speaking viewers would tune out. The Latin Grammy show,
which will will be seen in about 120 countries, is being produced
by the same team that stages the Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Grammys are giving a platform to many of the Hispanic
artists who have become household names in the United States
singing in English. The scheduled performers include Ricky Martin
and Christina Aguilera as well as non-Latin guests like 'N Sync,
which will sing with Son by Four, a Puerto Rican group.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism over marginalization and lack of Mexican
representation became public when Gilberto Moreno, general manager
of Fonovisa, a California company that releases regional Mexican
recordings, said in an interview with the Los Angeles
Spanish-language daily La Opinion that the performers to be
featured in the show did not represent the Latin music movement in
the United States and that the awards themselves separated Latin
artists from the mainstream awards.
</P>
<P>
   If the national academy wants to recognize Latin music, Moreno
said, it should expand the Latin categories in the main Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno, who did not return telephone calls to his office in Van
Nuys, Calif., called the Latin Grammys ``a party between Emilio
Estefan and Sony.'' Emilio Estefan Jr., the Miami producer and Sony
executive, led the Latin Grammy field with six nominations and was
honored on Monday as the Latin Academy's person of the year.
Estefan has produced million-selling albums for the Miami Sound
Machine and Gloria Estefan, his wife. Fonovisa artists got a
handful of nominations and none of them are scheduled to perform on
the show.
</P>
<P>
   But the criticism underscored a wider sentiment among
Mexican-Americans that regional Mexican music does not get the
respect it deserves. Based in traditional music, it has roots on
both sides of the border and extends from the brass-band bounce of
banda music to accordion-driven norteno music, sometimes known as
Tex-Mex in the United States. Guillermo Hernandez, director of the
Chicano Studies Research Center at the University of California at
Los Angeles, said that regional Mexican music was generally looked
down upon in Mexico and the United States because it is associated
with rural working-class people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican folk music, aside from being a curious, cute type of
thing in some circles, has not really being recognized for its
value,'' said Hernandez, whose center received $500,000 this year
from Los Tigres del Norte, a norteno band, to promote the study and
appreciation of the music. ``It's mostly ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   But music critics note that the genre is hugely popular,
reflecting the rapid growth of the Hispanic population in the
United States. More than 60 percent of that population is of
Mexican descent, and many are immigrants. While Latin pop artists
have gotten most of the attention across the United States,
regional Mexican music represents a large chunk of total Latin
sales, half or more by some estimates, and in areas of California
and the Southwest it is as prevalent on Spanish-language radio as
salsa is on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of Los Tigres del Norte, Jorge Hernandez, said that
his band, which won a Grammy in 1988 and is nominated for a Latin
Grammy, would not attend the ceremony because it would be
performing in Colombia. But he said he supported the stance of
Moreno and Fonovisa, his band's label for the last 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that our music should be respected and given
its due,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the complaints is also a widespread feeling
among Mexican-Americans that, even though they form a majority
among Latinos in the United States, they are often underrepresented
on Hispanic television and in other entertainment media in the
country. Abraham Quintanilla Jr., a recording producer in Corpus
Christi, Texas, and the father of the Tejano star Selena, said that
Mexican-Americans were slighted both by ``the Caribbean people''
who predominate in entertainment centers like Miami and New York
and the people of Mexico, many of whom resent Mexican-Americans for
their Americanized ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're treated like orphans,'' said Quintanilla, who said he
planned to attend the Latin Grammys because his son, A.B.
Quintanilla, and his band, Los Kumbia Kings, received a nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with a Tejano artist performing at the Latin
Grammys?'' the elder Quintanilla asked. ``What does 'N Sync have to
do with the Latin world? I don't understand that. That's my only
gripe. I don't think it's balanced out.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one regional Mexican music performer, Alejandro Fernandez,
who sings rancheras, is included among Wednesday night's scheduled
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Abaroa of the Latin academy said that the criticism was
unwarranted. He said that nominees were voted on by Latin academy
members on the basis of excellence, not of recording sales or
popularity. He noted that regional Mexican music had six Latin
Grammy categories; only Brazilian music, with seven, had more.
``I'm Mexican, and I'm the first one to defend my music,'' he said.
``But this is not the Mexican Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences. This is an international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has left a sour taste among some Latin Grammy
supporters. Sandra Guzman, editor in chief of Soloella.com, a Web
site for Latinas, said she would be watching the show at a private
party sponsored by El Diario-La Prensa, the New York newspaper; the
magazine Urban Latino; and HBO Latino at the Copacabana in
Manhattan. But she lamented: ``It shows we're not as inclusive as
we should be as a community. It's not a Mexican issue, it's a Latin
music issue. We should be better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some music critics said that the Latin Academy needed to reach
out to the regional Mexican field to maintain its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden is on the organization to get a fair
representation,'' said Ramiro Burr, a music critic for The San
Antonio Express-News and author of ``The Billboard Guide to Tejano
and Regional Mexican Music,'' published by Billboard Books. ``The
truth of the matter is that the regional Mexican market is
enormous, and it's beginning to overpower Latin pop and tropical
salsa.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first bump the Latin Grammys have run into.
Organizers had wanted to stage the show at the American Airlines
Arena in Miami, where many of the Latin artists and music labels
are based. But a local law prohibited Miami-Dade County from
dealing with companies and organizations that do business with
Cuba, and the Latin Grammys include Cuban nominees like Los Van Van
and members of the Buena Vista Social Club. (The law was rendered
moot in July after a Supreme Court decision struck down a similar
law in Massachusetts aimed at Myanmar and human rights abuses
there.)
</P>
<P>
   Estefan, a Cuban exile, said that music and politics should not
mix and that he would like the Latin Grammys to be held in Miami
next year. As for his numerous Latin Grammy nominations as
songwriter and producer, he said this was his lucky year, so much
so that he doubted that such a showing could be replicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of thing you can't plan,'' said Estefan, who has
won seven Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   Estefan, who has his own record label in a joint venture with
Sony Music Entertainment and is president of artist development
worldwide for Sony, said that the Latin Grammy Awards would be a
special moment for him mostly because they confirm how far Latin
music has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that people didn't want to hear Latin music or
wanted you to change your last name,'' he said. The Latin Grammys
offer proof, he said, that ``in order to be successful you have to
be yourself.''

U.S. AND LAWYERS FOR SCIENTIST BATTLE OVER PLEA DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 By   JAMES STERNGOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The government and defense lawyers continued their
11th-hour battle on Tuesday over how to interpret a plea agreement
in which Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos scientist, has admitted
to one count of improperly downloading nuclear secrets in return
for his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, officials began rounds of finger-pointing for
the virtual collapse of the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   John Kelly, the former U.S. attorney in Albuquerque who indicted
Lee, and then left government to run for Congress, said in an
interview that the indictment, which has been all but abandoned,
had been a ``team decision,'' approved not just by him but also by
senior officials at the Justice and Energy Departments.
</P>
<P>
   Some government officials blamed the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for providing false testimony at pretrial hearings,
which ultimately hurt the government's case. And one government
lawyer said the Los Alamos National Laboratory had harmed the case
by giving deeply conflicting views of the value of the weapons
information Lee improperly downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, the focus remained on negotiations over Lee's
plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the case said several questions were still
being debated: Can the investigators ask about any efforts by China
to steal nuclear secrets? And can Lee be prosecuted for any other
crime that comes to light in discussions with investigators?
</P>
<P>
   The two sides in the case had made a surprise announcement on
Sunday that the government was dropping 58 of its 59 charges
against Lee in return for his agreement to plead guilty to the one
felony charge of having illegally gathered and retained nuclear
weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Lee would be sentenced to the time he had
already served in prison, nine months since he was arrested, but
would serve no probation. He also agreed that he would cooperate
with investigators and explain why he downloaded a huge amount of
nuclear data and what he did with seven computer tapes of the
information that have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James A. Parker set a hearing for 2 p.m. Monday in Federal
District Court in Albuquerque, during which Lee had been expected
to enter his plea and then walk free. But this routine hearing was
twice delayed and then postponed until Wednesday morning because,
the lawyers said, more details needed to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides have refused to comment on their
unexpected battle, but people with knowledge of the problem say it
relates not to the terms of the actual agreement, which was already
signed on Sunday, but to competing views of what Lee would tell the
government investigators and what legal risks he might face for
those disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   In making the plea agreement final, Lee's attorneys made what is
called a proffer, a description of what, in general terms, he would
tell the investigators. Several people said the disagreement
holding up Lee's release related to how far afield the government
could go in its questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers have sought the narrowest interpretation of the
deal, and have sought to protect him against additional
prosecution, people with knowledge of the talks said. From the
defense perspective, they said, it appeared that the government was
trying to stiffen the terms of the deal at the last minute in order
to avoid criticism that it gained little from this long and
divisive case.
</P>
<P>
   The government has insisted that Lee has to answer all questions
and should be vulnerable to prosecution if he admits crimes outside
of the downloading charge he is pleading guilty to, people close to
the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Parker hinted on Monday that if the two sides could
not close this gap, he might simply order the government to live up
to the signed plea deal, allow Lee to make his plea in court, and
then free him.
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, Kelly, the former United States attorney, showed
up in court on Monday to watch Lee's hearing and offered his own
defense.
</P>
<P>
   He described the plea deal as an ``excellent outcome'' because
it forced Lee to answer questions about what he was doing with the
secret data. But, he added, ``It was a very painful prosecution in
a lot of ways,'' and he insisted that the decision to initiate it
was shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to point a finger,'' said Kelly, who is now
running for office in part on his record as the United States
attorney. ``I accept responsibility, but it was a team decision to
move ahead on this.''

PLAN FOR SWISS TO PAY NAZI VICTIMS IS PROPOSED 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a significant step for thousands of Holocaust victims who
have fought for decades to recover their savings from Swiss banks,
a special master appointed by a federal judge overseeing a class
action lawsuit submitted a complex plan on Tuesday for distributing
$1.25 billion in settlement payments from the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, $800 million from the settlement would be set
aside to repay Holocaust survivors or heirs who can show that they
held accounts in Swiss banks during the World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   Where account balances can be proven, the money would be
refunded in full with interest and adjusted for inflation. Where
balances are not known, victims or their heirs would get at least
35 percent of amounts recommended case-by-case by an independent
tribunal in Zurich. To date, 26,000 Swiss accounts have been
identified as probably belonging to victims of Nazi persecution.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $450 million would be divided among survivors _
but not their heirs _ from four other classes of Holocaust victims.
An estimated 200,000 slave laborers who worked for German companies
and a smaller number who worked for Swiss companies would be paid
up to $1,000 each. About 17,000 refugees who were denied entrance
to Switzerland during the war would get up to $2,500 each, while
3,000 refugees detained in Switzerland under abusive conditions
would be entitled to $500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Another $100 million would be set aside to help compensate those
whose assets were looted by the Nazis and then deposited in Swiss
accounts. But rather than distribute it to individual survivors,
most of the money would be given to organizations that provide aid
to elderly and destitute Holocaust survivors in the former Soviet
Union. A final $10 million would be used to compile a list of all
who were the target of persecution under the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Edward R. Korman, who is overseeing the
case, will hold a public hearing on the proposal on Nov. 20. He
could adopt the proposal, reject it or modify it.

SENSE OF RANCOR GROWING   BETWEEN FORD AND FIRESTONE 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Updates and rewrites throughout; no pickup; note byline

   WASHINGTON _ Ford and Firestone, partners for a century, fell
into bitter sniping before a Senate committee Tuesday, with top
executives trading accusations about how the companies should
divide responsibility for the dozens of deaths in roll-over crashes
involving Ford Explorers and Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was ``like tying two cats by the tail and throwing
them over the clothesline and letting them claw each other,'' said
Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Each company has been seeking to put blame upon the other since
early August, when Firestone recalled 6.5 million tires because of
deadly failures on some sport utility vehicles, mostly Explorers.
But Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee showed
how profound the rift between the two automotive pioneers had
become.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, faulted the way John
Lampe, a Firestone vice president, and others had handled warranty
claims and other evidence of a problem. Nasser said that when he
attended a House subcommittee hearing last Wednesday on tires: ``I
listened in disbelief as senior Firestone executives not only
acknowledged that Firestone had analyzed its claims data, but also
identified significant patterns of tread separations as early as
1998. Yet Firestone said nothing to anyone, including Ford Motor
Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was also unhappy with Firestone's estimate that it would
take well into next year to replace all the tires being recalled,
Nasser said. ``We went berserk when we heard that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the American subsidiary of the Japanese-owned tire
company, Masatoshi Ono, made a brief opening statement, saying he
took ``full and personal responsibility'' for the events that led
to the hearing. But he also said his limited command of English had
reduced the company's ability to get its points across.
</P>
<P>
   Lampe, however, sought to focus attention on the design of the
Explorer. He said that there had been 16,000 Explorer roll-overs
and that ``tire failure was involved in only a very, very small
portion'' of them. His written testimony put it at less than 10
percent. In remarks to reporters later, he said that the stability
of the Explorer would have to be analyzed as ``part of the puzzle''
of the crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Lampe also said that the company might have found the source of
the flaw that made some of its tires throw off their treads. The
company now believes that the problem involves a ``unique design
specification'' of the tires, combined with human error and machine
problems at the company's Decatur, Ill., factory, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to reporters after the hearing, Lampe said he
would not be specific because the problem involved a trade secret,
saying only that the bad tires had resulted from ``an aspect of the
design combined with a process variability.'' The design feature
involved a belt, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone is bringing in an expert from the University of
California at Berkeley to evaluate the hypothesis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the testimony Tuesday focused on the federal highway
safety agency and what even top transportation officials
acknowledge is its ineffectiveness in spotting and monitoring
safety problems like the tire flaw. The secretary of transportation
and his subordinate, the head of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, asked for powers to compel tire and auto
companies to turn over data on quality.
</P>
<P>
   But they acknowledged that they lacked the ability to pick up
safety trends from the varied sources of information they already
had. For example, they receive complaints from consumers, reports
on fatal accidents and information from insurers, but have trouble
linking them to expose serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   The safety official, Sue Bailey, dodged a question from Sen.
Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who asked how her agency would evaluate
information ``qualitatively,'' looking at the significance of
reports of problems rather than their number. Bailey, a doctor of
osteopathy, referred to Frist, who is a surgeon, as a ``fellow
scientist'' and said that a mathematical system was needed to
determine when an issue reached a threshold at which investigation
was required.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee repeatedly asked if the highway agency
needed more money to analyze safety trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never once has any of you come to me and said, `look, we've
got to increase this budget, be our advocate here,''' the committee
chairman, John McCain, R-Ariz., said pointedly to Bailey and
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. The two witnesses agreed
with him, but said they were planning to take $1.8 million from
other safety programs and spend it on investigating Firestone
tires. They did not specify what programs would be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said his department wanted the authority to require auto
makers and related companies to report on foreign recalls. But he
acknowledged under questioning that the information could also be
obtained from foreign governments, though the United States does
not normally trade information with highway safety regulators in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, is a lack of a protocol by which
governments could swap proprietary information without fear of
public release.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings expressed surprise that commercial attaches in American
embassies in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Malaysia, three countries
where Ford replaced Firestone tires on Explorers, had not informed
the highway safety agency. Bailey said that if her office had known
of those actions, combined with the reports of problems in the
United States, it would have triggered an investigation sooner.
Instead, the tip-off for the federal government came from consumer
complaints generated by news reports from a Houston television
station, KHOU, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee members voiced enthusiasm for giving the
highway agency greater powers to demand information, including data
on services provided under warranty, which is the type of data that
Ford eventually used to expose the problem with Firestone tires.
Several also called for enacting criminal penalties for companies
that failed to report safety problems, a position even Ford and
Firestone endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   Lampe, of Firestone, said that in hindsight his company had not
looked at its own data properly. He added that the root of the
problem might be Ford's recommendation to inflate the tires on
Explorers to a relatively low range of 26 to 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone approved that range when the large, heavy vehicle
first went on the market a decade ago. But looking back, he said,
Firestone should probably have considered that more carefully,
because under-inflated tires heat up rapidly and heat can cause
damage. Consumers also often run their tires at pressures lower
than what is recommended, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee members also favored raising or eliminating
the ceiling on fines to companies for failing to turn over
information. Joan Claybrook, a former administrator of the highway
safety agency and now president of Public Citizen, the consumer
advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader, derided the existing
limits as ``a joke.'' The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration is one of the few such federal agencies with no
criminal statutes to back it up.

REPUBLICANS' REQUEST TO REDUCE DEBT SURPRISES DEMOCRATS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the demise of their large-scale tax cut,
Republican leaders in Congress met Tuesday with President Clinton
at the White House to discuss unfinished legislation and request
that he set aside 90 percent of this year's surplus to pay down the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're down here to find a fair middle ground and try
to start to have some productivity and finish up the season,'' said
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic leaders who attended the meeting quickly seized
on the Republican request to set aside 90 percent of the surplus
for this year, saying they were puzzled by the last-minute
proposal. For two years, Republicans have made tax cuts their
showcase issue, although they have often mentioned debt reduction
and protecting Social Security and Medicare in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed their two most popular tax-cutting bills in
August as too expensive and too skewed toward the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans spent their entire two years trying to pass these
tax cuts and now they say they really want to pay down the debt,''
said House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt. ``It's either a gimmick
designed to get them out of town or a break from where they have
been in the past, if you play it out over 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Republicans he viewed paying down the debt as a
priority, but said he was not sure it could be done in the 2001
fiscal budget, which is set to kick in on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Spending requests are also piling up, Clinton said. The
government must send emergency money to states recovering from
wildfires in the West, and lawmakers want increases for military
spending and to help farmers. ``Whether we can do it this year or
not depends upon what the various spending commitments are,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   As the discussion veered off to other matters, Clinton said he
hoped Congress would pass bills to overhaul managed care and
classify violence against gays as hate crimes, an issue the House
is expected to take up on Wednesday. Clinton said he hoped to reach
a compromise on raising the minimum wage and providing some tax
relief to small businesses, which Republicans want to see linked in
the same bill.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Tuesday's discussion revolved around the Republican
proposal to reduce the debt.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the shift in emphasis away from tax cuts and
toward reducing the debt is an effort to take the money off the
table, rein in spending and protect them from Clinton's attacks on
their tax cuts. It is also a move to put Clinton in an awkward
position, since he and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
presidential nominee, both support paying down the debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lock in the debt reduction, you don't spend it,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said a proposal to set aside 90 percent of the
surplus for only one year would do nothing to pay down the debt. As
it stands, they said, that figure is not so different from what
already exists in the budget requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's budget more than meets the 90 percent
marker,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's top economic policy
adviser. ``But the real test is not a potentially artificial
one-year number but whether or not there is a 10-year commitment to
debt reduction and paying off the debt over exploding tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats portrayed the request as an effort to jump on a more
popular bandwagon and as a split from the direction Gov. George W.
Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, is headed in with his
large tax-cut package.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the surplus next
year will total $268 billion. By setting aside 90 percent, nearly
$30 billion would be available for extra spending and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We smell a rat,'' said Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle.
``If it's a one-year plan, it's a gimmick. If it's a 12-year plan,
they're divorcing themselves from their presidential candidate,
George Bush, because George Bush has committed all of that surplus
to a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleisher, said the Bush plan would
eliminate the debt by 2016. The Gore plan would eliminate it by
2012.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said their proposal was no gimmick, simply a
bid to make Clinton choose between increasing spending or reducing
the debt. Michele Davis, press secretary for House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, said: ``It's saying, `OK, Mr. President, you vetoed the
marriage penalty. Fine. That money is going to debt reduction. You
vetoed the death tax. That money goes to debt reduction and you
don't get to spend it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, said the meeting was
most productive in that Republicans established a direct line to
Clinton, without interference from Democratic leaders, to discuss
issues that would come up in the waning weeks of the session. ``We
were straightforward with him,'' DeLay said. ``We didn't pull any
punches.''

BUSH SAYS `RATS' REFERENCE IN AD WAS UNINTENTIONAL

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As yet another of his campaign days skidded onto
unexpected ground, Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday defended a
Republican television commercial that, in attacking Vice President
Al Gore's plans for health care, includes a fleeting, almost
undetectable image of the word ``rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that the word, which is on screen for one-thirtieth of
a second and can be seen with clarity only by freezing a videotape
of the advertisement, was a fluke, not a deliberate subliminal
message to voters about his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conspiracy theories abound in American politics,'' Bush said
early Tuesday morning at an airport news conference in Orlando,
Fla., trying to make light of the situation. But, he added, ``I am
convinced that this is not intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized his belief that because the word appeared for
only the tiniest fraction of the 30-second commercial, it could not
have had any great purpose or impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``One frame out of 900 is hardly a conspiracy, it seems like to
me,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   His aides later elaborated that the commercial, produced and
released several weeks ago by the Republican National Committee,
incorporated a computer editing device that makes portions of words
pop onto or skitter across the screen, a kind of visual spice.
``Rats'' simply happened to be the last four letters of
``bureaucrats,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides also sought to turn the tables on the Gore
campaign, which alerted The New York Times about the ``rats''
reference, by pointing to a Democratic advertisement released a
week ago that they considered misleading. That advertisement, which
criticized Bush over health care in Texas, used a headline from The
New York Daily News in such a way that made it look as if it was on
the front page when in fact the article ran inside the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that this is a case of somebody doing something
that was (a) deliberate and (b) clearly designed to mislead,'' said
Bush's chief media adviser, Mark McKinnon. ``Because of that the
DNC ad should be subject to much greater scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hess, a spokesman for the Democratic Party, insisted that
the commercial was fair because Bush's photograph and a smaller
headline about the article did appear on the cover of The Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and his aides dismissed the ``rats'' detail of the
Republican commercial as unintentional and unimportant, their need
to explain it underscored the difficulties he has faced in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Every several days, with uncanny regularity, Bush has found
himself dealing with surprises, errors or distractions, sometimes
of his own making, that throw his campaign off course and threaten
to blunt his efforts to regain some of the ground he seems to have
lost to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last week with the debate over presidential debates
and with an incident in which Bush, unaware that a nearby
microphone was working, uttered a vulgarity about a reporter whose
coverage he deemed unfair.
</P>
<P>
   It happened the week before that when the Republican National
Committee released a commercial, with the Bush campaign's
permission, that challenged Gore's truthfulness and political
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush woke up Tuesday morning with the intention of focusing on
his health-care proposals at events in Orlando and St. Louis. Both
Florida and Missouri are crucial battlegrounds in the presidential
election, and Bush's onetime lead in polls in those states has
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   But almost instantly, he was entangled in questions about the
commercial, first on the ABC News program ``Good Morning, America''
and then at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond that topic lay another that had nothing to do with
the issues that Bush wanted to discuss. A profile of him in Vanity
Fair suggests that he mixes up words from time to time because he
has dyslexia.
</P>
<P>
   The first dozen or so questions at his news conference were
about the Republican commercial. The next several were about the
magazine article. Bush said that he does not have dyslexia.
``Amazing what happens when you run for president,'' Bush said,
reflecting on the questions coming his way.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached his next event on Tuesday, a panel
discussion with doctors at a medical center in Orlando, it was
almost as if he had consigned himself to the eclipsing of the day's
theme. The discussion lasted all of 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But later, at a town-hall-style meeting in St. Louis, Bush
seemed buoyant as he talked for a full hour about a variety of
issues. It provided a marked contrast to his demeanor earlier, when
he at times showed signs of shakiness.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Good Morning, America,'' he first told Diane Sawyer that he
had not known about the controversy over the word ``rats'' in the
advertisement until that moment. Then, when she expressed
skepticism, he clarified that he meant he had not known about it
until waking up to the news on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, he said the word ``subliminal'' four
times and each time garbled it, giving it an extra syllable in the
form of the suffix ``able.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides, barely able to contain their delight over the
latest distraction to bedevil the Bush campaign, jumped on the news
about the commercial, which broke Tuesday morning in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, they criticized Bush for not issuing a direct
apology for the commercial. One senior aide said he was convinced
that the fleeting reference to rats was not accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning in Ohio with his running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., told reporters, ``I think it's a disappointing
development.''
</P>
<P>
   In Orlando, Bush said he did not condone subliminal advertising,
but did not think it was the aim of this commercial and would not
order the commercial pulled because it was already scheduled to
conclude its run on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had seen the commercial several weeks ago and had
not noticed the word rats.

   ``We don't need to play cute politics,'' Bush said, seeming to
mean both that the party did not have to and that it should not.
``I'm going to win this election based upon issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nevertheless, in order to put people's minds at ease, I
will say loud and clear this kind of practice is not accepted,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He later reiterated, ``I want to make clear to people that the
idea of putting subliminal messages into ads is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed to be commenting not just on the theoretical
practice of such a device but on any insinuation that he and other
Republicans were using it. In West Palm Beach, Fla., where he began
his day, a woman in a diner that he visited mentioned the brewing
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They read everything into anything, don't they?'' Bush told
her, apparently referring to reporters.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: PATRIOTS GET A LESSON ON HOW TO GET IT DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besides the muddled rivalry, the verbal war, the mutual respect
mixed with envy that color nearly every facet of the Jets-Patriots
relationship, their meeting Monday night was more about which team
would gain the jump on its new course.
</P>
<P>
   With new head coaches, new coordinators, new assistants, new
schemes and new players on both sides, the Jets and the Patriots
are in the same boat: to produce while learning on the run, to curb
the learning process. To coalesce. To act as one even though the
identity and chemistry are still being created.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage Jets. So far they are better at putting this thing
together than the Patriots are.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Jets can brag.
</P>
<P>
   In a rivalry like this one, the winner realizes it has gained a
quicker track toward the ultimate goals: a divisional championship,
a playoff berth and Super Bowl possibilities. The loser is
confronted with the nagging notion that the other guys are better
at pulling the package together. Better at the free-agent game, the
draft, the preparation, the desire, the performance. Better at the
entire game.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2-0 Jets, it is an exhilarating feeling. For the
Patriots (0-2), it hurts. It is exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of Monday night's game _ Jets 20, Patriots 19, a
thriller, a shocker, a high-strung victory _ can be lasting. The
Jets now enjoy a wonderful opportunity to propel themselves toward
something great. Their confidence is soaring. The Patriots,
however, are full of questions and doubt and are forced to shake a
mountain of the wrong momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are in excellent shape to continue their trend, playing
at home against Buffalo next and then traveling to Tampa Bay where,
against Keyshawn Johnson, they can stare down another old ghost and
prepare for a remarkable ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots _ at home next against Minnesota followed by road
games at Miami and Denver and then home again against Indianapolis
_ have all of the makings for an 0-6 start before seeing the Jets
again Oct. 15. Losing this game that they should have won could
very well spiral the Patriots into a mental and physical funk.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and the Patriots are two franchises that scrutinize and
compare each others' every move. Let's make some comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   THE COACHES: Al Groh's start is as good as two opening victories
get. Close victories. Fourth-quarter victories. They indicate
resolve in adversity and that his message and leadership are clear.
</P>
<P>
   Groh talks a good game. His handling of questions regarding the
Bill Parcells-Bill Belichick relationship before the Patriots game
was smooth. He complimented them both and kept the focus on the
opportunity for his team and for himself. In two games he and his
staff have made enough of the right moves _ especially in the
waning moments _ to begin to distinguish Groh.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Belichick saw his team fight itself as much as Tampa Bay in
an opening loss at home and then lose a 19-7 fourth-quarter lead
Monday night. After playing much of the game in press coverage and
throwing the Jets' offense out of sync, the Patriots' defense could
not keep pace when the Jets opted for an empty backfield and for
running back Richie Anderson spread wide as a receiver. That
exposed the Patriots' weakness of too few cover guys at linebacker,
and the Patriots failed to respond with a solution such as a safety
covering Anderson instead of linebackers. Of the Jets' touchdown
drives of 85 yards and 72 yards, the latter one was comical: a
two-play drive.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has to be alarmed that the strength of his team and
his game _ defense _ did not win versus the Jets when called upon.
When your team's strength becomes its liability, you are in
trouble. Belichick has plenty to correct, but how he handles the
mental state of his team right now will determine the Patriots'
season.
</P>
<P>
   THE QUARTERBACKS: Vinny Testaverde is 14-2 as the Jets' starter.
He struggled all night against the Patriots but then when they
backed off, he took control. He showed experience and
determination. To make the kind of game-ending throws he did under
that kind of pressure shows that Testaverde is not only back from a
season lost because of injury but that he remains one of the game's
top five quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe has been sacked 12 times in two games (six sacks in
each game). On his last play of the game against the Jets, he was
sacked. His team traveled six times inside the Jets' 20-yard line
and gained only one touchdown. His mobility is being questioned,
but the bottom line with Bledsoe is pass protection. With it, he
can flourish. Without it, he cannot improvise.
</P>
<P>
   THE RECEIVERS: With no pass protection, Patriots receiver Terry
Glenn, so talented, is becoming a nonentity.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward in two games are on their way
to answering the Keyshawn question. Do the Jets have a go-to
receiver without Keyshawn? Chrebet and Ward are answering yes and
yes. Their plays in the winning touchdown drives were far from
routine. Ward's one-handed, 44-yard catch and Chrebet's two scoring
catches that showed athleticism and concentration were Pro
Bowl-like plays.
</P>
<P>
   Neither receiver has grabbed a microphone or pounded his chest
and proclaimed why he could take over for Johnson. Both, instead,
took the high road, walked and spoke softly, and let performance
speak loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis nationally and locally about both players crept toward
them (too small, too little, not good enough even as a duo to
replace Keyshawn). Both used the Monday night football platform to
give America and their peers a response. That is impressive in
production, personality and style.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots look toward the long haul. They know that the
coming, rugged divisional games for both teams could change
everything. They know that the season is a 16-game foray determined
by what you have, what you do with it and with how much heart.
Their stories are unfolding. But two games in, the Jets have
barrels more of what the Patriots desire.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence. Promise. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE LATEST OIL SHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 13:
</P>
<P>
   The high price of oil is both a testament to the current global
economic boom and a threat to its continuation. The heartening news
is that the oil-producing nations themselves seem to realize this,
and are intent on trying to drive prices lower. Whether there is
enough unused production capacity to accomplish this in the short
run remains to be seen, but the political will to try is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil surged past the $35-a-barrel mark on Monday, its
highest level in a decade. Protesters in Britain blockaded
refineries, threatening to bring the nation to a standstill. They
demanded that the government reduce fuel taxes. Images of panicked
drivers seeking to hoard fuel before most service stations closed
brought back painful memories of the 1970s oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair refused to follow the lead of the
French government, which reduced its fuel taxes by 15 percent last
week, but instead sought contingency powers to control the
distribution of fuel. Largely because of high taxes, European
consumers typically pay more than twice what Americans do to fill
up their cars.
</P>
<P>
   This week's rise in oil prices came despite a decision by the
OPEC over the weekend to increase output by 800,000 barrels a day,
or 3 percent. The group's shaky credibility partly accounts for the
market's skeptical reaction. Some of the cartel nations already
produce more than their quota, and it is unclear how much
additional oil will actually be pumped. The overheated global
economy has left little production capacity underused outside of
Saudi Arabia. As a result the OPEC president, Ali Rodriguez, who is
also Venezuela's oil minister, warned Tuesday that the world may be
facing a severe energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who will soon play host to a
meeting of heads of state from the OPEC nations, has been
aggressively pushing for a target price band between $22 and $28 a
barrel. The idea is to have the cartel automatically adjust
production when the price of crude oil moves above or below the
band. Such a mechanism would require an unprecedented degree of
coordination among OPEC members, and is not likely to work as
smoothly as Chavez suggests. But it could help stem the volatility
in oil pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation in the United States is showing signs of revival in
response to higher oil prices, the one cloud in an otherwise rosy
economic outlook. The promised increase in crude production from
OPEC and an increase in global production capacity expected late
this year may not be timely enough to alleviate what is expected to
be a sharp rise in domestic heating oil prices this winter.
President Clinton said Tuesday the government would seek to counter
rising heating costs.
</P>
<P>
   The high crude oil prices seem all the more serious because the
world enjoyed unusually low fuel prices for much of the past
decade. But in real terms the price of oil is a third lower than it
was in 1990, though that may prove of little comfort to European
drivers forced to pay about $4 a gallon at the pump, or to those
struggling developing nations that must import oil.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting movements in oil prices is impossible, but there is
reason to be hopeful the world is not confronting an oil crisis
akin to that of the early 1970s. The industrialized world is less
vulnerable to an oil shock, and retains some options to counter
persistently high oil prices, at least temporarily. Europe could
lower tax rates on fuel. America could draw oil from its strategic
reserve. The best solution would be a steep increase in production
by oil producers, especially Saudi Arabia.

EDITORIAL: SUBLIMINAL HEADACHE FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 13:
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the Bush campaign team: Can you spell backfire?
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, at least, it is spelled RATS, and Gov. George W.
Bush must be seething despite his labored attempt to shrug off
``conspiracy theories'' about his campaign's latest fiasco. That,
of course, was the insertion of the word RATS in capital letters
into a television ad attacking Vice President Al Gore over the
issue of prescription drugs for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   News of the ad, coming after Bush's embarrassing problems with
an open microphone 10 days ago, launched a new round of jokes and
questions about his technologically challenged campaign. Even a
studiously somber Vice President Al Gore expressed puzzlement over
the strangeness of the episode. Other Democrats were predictably
gleeful, and Paul Begala, a party strategist, questioned whether an
organization that cannot handle the rewind button can be entrusted
with the nuclear button.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Republicans know that, all kidding aside, this is a
fraught moment for the Bush campaign. The governor's malapropisms
are becoming standard comic fare. Tuesday he referred four times to
``subliminable'' techniques. Meanwhile, a conservative publication,
The Weekly Standard, features on its cover a worried-looking Bush
beside the slightly panicky-sounding headline ``How Bush Can Win.''
Being an object of doubt and ridicule can quickly become a serious
problem for a presidential candidate. Just ask Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Forceful damage control would be Bush's smartest move. He has
already removed the ad. But since subliminal messages are regarded
as unethical by the ad industry and unfairly deceptive by the
Federal Communications Commission, Bush should go further. He needs
to find out how it got on the air in the first place, especially
since Alex Castellanos, who produced the commercial for the
Republican National Committee, has not kept his story straight.
</P>
<P>
   Castellanos originally told Richard Berke of The New York Times
that the use of the word was ``purely accidental.'' Tuesday he said
he was using a ``visual drumbeat designed to make you look at the
word bureaucrats.'' That sounds to us like a declaration of intent
to use subliminal techniques by Castellanos, who is known as a
creator of attack ads. If Bush really means that such techniques
are not acceptable to his campaign, perhaps he should sever his
connection with Castellanos.
</P>
<P>
   When a presidential campaign has the stumbles, such decisive
action by the nominee can be a step toward getting back on message,
a place Bush has hardly visited in the last two weeks.

A FIRST IMPRESSION OF SYDNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 c.2000 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Think Seattle with more sun. ... Or Los
Angeles with more water. And 4 million or so people friendlier than
either place.
</P>
<P>
   They really do call each other ``mate,'' here. Such as the bus
driver who said of an upcoming trip, ``It's not far, mate, but it's
not fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney may not be quite ready for prime time, but it's bloody
cheery in the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Lines for buses. Lines for security screenings. Lines for
accommodations. An airport nearly overwhelmed by traffic. A traffic
grid thoroughly overwhelmed by traffic. Nothing is far, mate, but
absolutely nothing is fast.
</P>
<P>
   Our first glimpse of Sydney was off the left side of an Air New
Zealand 767, and as initial impressions go, it had the gut-level
impact of wandering into Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Miles of green peninsulas lined with white-sand beaches. Deep
bays reaching far into the interior, creating enough waterfront
property to shame Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The air approach to Sydney takes you right over the city, and
then back around it in a spiraling descent. Not quite the intimate
perspective of a helicopter ride, but almost.
</P>
<P>
   Even the dullest tourist can pick out the Sydney Opera House
from the air. And that must be Harbour Bridge. The skyscrapers
downtown. And enormous swaths of green open space and athletic
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, spectacular views do not an Olympics make (or we'd be
doing this at Niagara Falls every fourth year), and the Aussies
seem to be having a rough go of the rest of the show.
</P>
<P>
   They have owned up to the fact they fibbed _ OK, lied like dogs
_ about how long it takes to get around town. The national
newspaper ``The Australian,'' conceded in Wednesday's editions,
``The timetables in the (Olympic) bid document read like science
fiction, or a manual for weekend drag racers. They assume no
traffic lights and no traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   A particular trip, from downtown Sydney to Darling Harbour,
advertised as a 180-second jaunt, is now known as ``the myth of the
three-minute cab ride.'' It's more like a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   At times Tuesday, the transport system was so spotty it almost
made a bloke nostalgic for Atlanta. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sydney has attributes Atlanta can never match. Great
weather being high on the list. It is the tail end of winter in the
Southern Hemisphere, and it's 70 degrees most days. Like March in
the Inland Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney really is rather like SoCal, which Sydneysiders concede
with a mixture of enthusiasm and terror.
</P>
<P>
   Climate and commuter horror stories are just part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The newest housing could be plucked right out of tracts going up
in Santa Clarita, south Orange County or Calimesa. Split-level
homes with multicar garages marching into the distance on hills
that were grass and scrub a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The older housing stock, squat square little single-family
bungalows, could be Long Beach's east side, or El Monte, or San
Bernardino north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the people, increasingly diverse and world-wise,
just like SoCal.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century ago, Sydney was an outpost of the British Empire,
with High Tea and scones and English reserve overlaying Celtic
exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   As we open the new millennium, Sydney is multi-ethnic and
multilingual. It is Thai food, Chinese immigrants and a leading
role in Southeast Asian and Polynesian affairs. Overlaying a Celtic
exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, we begin to discover how well Sydney, and Australia,
have prepared for the real thing, with soccer matches in Melbourne
and Canberra two days ahead of Opening Ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Getting crabby journalists from Point A to Point B (and into
their village, a former insane asylum) four days before competition
is one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Getting athletes to the venues and fans into the stands, and
back home at a reasonable time, are the real tests.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney will give this its best shot, but even if it comes to
logistical meltdown, it's hard to imagine all those eager Aussies
crying in their Foster's lager.
</P>
<P>
   Regret is for other blokes, mate. &QL;

POSTCARD FROM SYDNEY: ONE OF A KIND LODGING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Staying at the Olympic Media Village, I feel
like I've died and gone to summer camp. There are 5,883 reporters
ensconced in 664 buildings, 21 of which once housed a psychiatric
facility. Call me crazy but I feel sorry for the other 10,000
credentialed media who are scattered in hotels in downtown Sydney.
Like the athletes who chose to stay outside the Athletes' Village,
they're missing out on the quintessential Olympic experience.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't trade a harbor view for the chance to crack onto
(Aussie slang for chat up) journalists from all over the world.
Reporters like the distinguished gentleman from Luxembourg who
proudly ticked off the names and sports of the eight athletes from
his country who are competing here.
</P>
<P>
   And the man with the bored look on the shuttle bus who turned
out to be from Perth. He grew slightly more animated as he
explained that western Australia isn't happy as a dog with two
tails to have the Olympics in its country because it is, after all,
taking place on the _ ahem _ other coast. Apparently the West
Coast-East Coast rivalry is not as pronounced as is it in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   It's also pretty cool to be greeted every morning at the Media
Village entrance by curious kangaroos and wallabies. Alas, an
electric fence keeps our contact with them to a minimum. &QL;

EDITORIAL: CONGRESS' OBLIGATION TO NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Alaska, N.M., N.H., Calif.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 13:
</P>
<P>
   Before adjourning next month, Congress should approve two of the
most important conservation bills in many years. One bill, the
Conservation and Reinvestment Act, would guarantee $45 billion over
15 years for a range of environmental purposes, including
wilderness protection. The other could save the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills have made it through most of the hazardous committee
process. Some fear they will not survive a floor vote because the
Republicans may not want to give President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore two big election-year victories on the
environmental front. In truth, these would be big victories for
everyone, Republicans included, not least because several powerful
Republican committee chairmen have been crucial to their progress
so far. The biggest enemy now is inertia on the part of the
Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATION AND REINVESTMENT: The Conservation and Reinvestment
Act passed the House in May by a resounding margin. It would
authorize nearly $3 billion a year for 15 years to acquire
wilderness, restore damaged coastlines and estuaries and protect
endangered species. The bill will not impose new taxes. It relies
on the same mechanism that has long underwritten the government's
main land acquisition program, the Land and Water Conservation Fund
_ royalties from offshore oil production.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill was drafted largely by two members who rarely
agree on anything _ Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., a staunch
conservationist, and Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, who has been
fighting environmentalists for most of his career but who, nearing
retirement, has done a surprising about-face.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the Senate the conservative Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska, and the liberal Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., steered the bill
past property rights advocates on Murkowski's Natural Resources
Committee. They also improved it along the way, earmarking more
money for coastal restoration.
</P>
<P>
   THE EVERGLADES: In early July, a Senate committee approved a
blueprint for the most ambitious restoration project ever attempted
in this country. The heart of the project is a vast new system of
canals, levees and reservoirs designed to store and deliver
Florida's copious rainwater to the Everglades, which is slowly
dying for lack of fresh water. This undertaking will cost an
estimated $8 billion over 20 years, shared by the federal
government and Florida, and will also include land acquisition to
provide buffer zones between the Everglades and Florida's expanding
coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
   The bill before Congress authorizes $1 billion for the first
wave of projects. Gov. Jeb Bush has already promised $200 million,
Florida's share of the first-year costs. The ball is now in
Congress' court. The measure that emerged from committee in July,
thanks largely to Sen. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., is now ready for a
floor vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But a big push will be needed in the House, where no action has
been taken. Fortunately for friends of the Everglades, the key
house subcommittee is headed by Sherwood Boehlert, the upstate New
Yorker who is one of his party's most committed environmentalists.
But a surer route to success may be for the House to proceed
directly to a floor vote on the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the session, the appropriations committees in
both houses must act so that the actual projects, especially those
in the Everglades, can begin to move forward. But the crucial first
step is to get the projects authorized. Years of work have gone
into these measures. It would be a shame to waste this effort.

KNIGHT DEFENDS BEHAVIOR AS INDIANA NAMES COACH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indiana University tried to look to the future Tuesday, naming
Mike Davis as the interim head basketball coach of the Hoosiers.
</P>
<P>
   While Davis accepted his ascension from assistant to Bob Knight
to successor to the controversial coach, it was clear from the
remarks at Davis' news conference and from a nationally televised
interview with Knight, that it will take a while to chip away at
the Knight legacy in Bloomington.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who was fired on Sunday after 28 years as head coach at
Indiana, spoke on ESPN Tuesday night, defending his behavior at the
school, particularly since the administration put him on ``zero
tolerance'' notice on May 15, and admitting that he had overstayed
his welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would stay here and coach until I was done
coaching, which I'm certainly not now,'' Knight said in the
interview. ``I'm not done coaching. But in recent years things have
changed, the administration changed, the athletic department
changed. For some people that may be good. For me, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``As recently as July I gave serious consideration to another
job, and have in the last couple of years. I don't think that my
thinking about another job quite overrode the feeling that I had
for Indiana University and the kids we had here, the kids we had
coming, what we had built. I wanted more than anything to see us
get back. We've never been mediocre, always been really good or
pretty good. I wanted to see us get back to really good. I kind of
hung onto that thought for four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight added: ``Probably I should have gone somewhere else.
There's someone who's a better fit for these people and
administration as a basketball coach. And there would be a place
somewhere that's a better fit for me as a basketball coach than
Indiana is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not embarrassed to leave Indiana the way he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Knight insisted. ``What I am is proud, proud of
what our basketball program turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight denied committing any of the violations that were
detailed on Sunday by the university's president, Myles Brand.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he would definitely coach somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent all summer with an offensive set in my mind while I'm
fishing or traveling, thinking who's going to be here or there,''
he said. ``Now I won't be able to do that with these kids. But I'm
looking for kids that I can do it with. I haven't retired. I'm an
unemployed teacher now, looking for a place to teach. There are too
many things I have yet to explore about game of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had already received calls inquiring about his
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was an assistant to Knight for three seasons, serving as
the lead recruiter for this year's prize class and the man who
recruited most of the players he inherits. He now steps into the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   While Knight no longer holds the entire state of Indiana in sway
as he once did, he still had enough stature to prompt protests on
campus and a threatened walkout by nearly the entire team if Davis
were not named as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 39, who played at Alabama, then professionally in Europe
and in the Continental Basketball Association, was named as interim
head coach while another assistant, John Treloar, was named as
interim associate head coach. The team stood behind Davis on the
podium and expressed satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Knight is the reason I'm here, but Indiana basketball is
bigger than anyone,'' Davis said. ``The players stood up for Coach
Treloar and myself. I discussed the situation with their parents,
and my son yesterday when I was leaving said, `I hope you get the
job.' I've gone to these kids' homes and recruited them, convinced
them to come here. They stood up for me, so there's no way I could
turn it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The junior Dane Fife, who on Monday had said he had already
decided to leave, said Tuesday: ``We definitely have something to
prove. We've been through a lot, and we have to come out and beat
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Knight, Fife said: ``We owe it to him. This is his
team. We're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said: ``I don't think there was pressure from the players.
For Mike Davis to be head coach at Indiana University is a miracle.
If it wasn't September, this program could go out and get a
big-time coach.''

DNA TEST LEADS TO ARREST IN 1985 TEXAS DOUBLE-SLAYING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HANSON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSENBERG, Texas _ Because of new DNA testing on old evidence, a
suspect was charged Tuesday in connection with the vicious slayings
of a young woman and her mother.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 15 years, detectives have been chasing down leads
in the deaths of Cathy Keith, 20, and Peggie Keith 44, who were
found slain in their apartment on the morning of Jan. 11, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, authorities collected DNA evidence. But it was
only recently that their patience and persistence paid off.
</P>
<P>
   New DNA testing was able to link the evidence to a Florida man
who had been a suspect since the early days of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Charles Tonn, 36, a grocery store meat-cutter, was
arrested by Rosenberg police and charged with murder in Cathy
Keith's death. He is being held in the Fort Bend County Jail,
southeast of Houston, in lieu of $100,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Although the DNA evidence only connected him to the younger
victim's death, authorities believe he acted alone and is also
responsible for the mother's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the killings, Tonn was married to Cathy Keith's
older sister, Susan. He worked as a maintenance man and lived in
the same apartment complex as the victims. The younger woman was a
clerk at a construction company.
</P>
<P>
   The savagery of the killings shocked police.
</P>
<P>
   The younger woman's throat was so severely slashed that she was
nearly decapitated. She had also been dealt a strong blow to the
face, said Rosenberg police Lt. Brad Rollins.
</P>
<P>
   He said her clothing was removed and her body was draped over a
bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   Police theorize that her mother, who worked at a snack-food
plant in Rosenberg, arrived home about half an hour later. She was
attacked in the living room and stabbed numerous times. Her
clothing was also removed and she was left in a bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Neither woman was sexually assaulted, but detectives found their
bodies had been positioned in sexual poses after death.
</P>
<P>
   There was no forced entry at the apartment and Tonn quickly
became the main focus of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not eliminate him as a suspect. He was right there at
the top of our list, '' Rollins said. ``His alibi was horrendous.
And he fit to a T the FBI profile of the killer.''
</P>
<P>
   That profile, he said, included such details as the killer
probably having a military background and the likelihood he would
go on a heavy drug binge after the crime. He said Tonn did indeed
serve in the military and was known to use drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Police found one of Tonn's fingerprints in the apartment, but it
was considered useless as evidence because he worked there and, as
an in-law of both victims, he had also visited them at the
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Purses belonging to the women were missing, as was a pistol, but
police did not believe robbery was the motive behind the killings.
</P>
<P>
   There was one piece of evidence that police recovered that they
hoped would one day lead them to the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Some saliva was found on Cathy Keith's body, and detectives
carefully collected and froze it _ the practice of the time for
processing bodily fluids to be analyzed in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was January 1985, and the first DNA court case was in
England that year,'' Rollins noted. ``We weren't even conducting
DNA testing in the United States. We didn't have any knowledge of
DNA at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   DNA testing began in this country about two years later, and
police submitted the sample to a laboratory for testing. However,
they were told it had degraded because of being frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins said the slide was sent back, but police were advised to
hold on to it because, the lab said, ``As technology grows, we may
be able to do something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a little less than a year ago, Rosenberg Detective Jeff
Johnson asked if he could submit the sample again for DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that was an excellent idea, and we did,'' Rollins said.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, police were told the saliva taken from
Cathy Keith's body matched a blood sample from Tonn.
</P>
<P>
   Police began working to locate witnesses and Tonn himself.
</P>
<P>
   They learned that he and his wife had been divorced about a year
ago and that he had been working recently in Destin, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were already seeking him for failure to make
child-support payments. He and his former wife had two children.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ex-wife who suggested to detectives that they should
go to Enterprise, Ala., because Tonn's mother had died and he might
show up for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Tonn was arrested there after the services. He waived
extradition and was brought back to Rosenberg early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He has told detectives nothing about the killings, Rollins said.
Police do not really have a firm idea of why the women were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will have to ask behavioral scientists. This is beyond my
comprehension,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins was with Rosenberg police at the time of the killings
but did not become involved in the case until a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels good, but it feels scary because we have a lot of
work still to do,'' he said of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Keith, the father of Cathy and former husband of Peggie,
said Tuesday that he was stunned to learn of Tonn's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest thing I felt was relief that this finally
happened,'' Keith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go like the normal justice system goes, we may have
another 10 years of this garbage to go through,'' Keith added.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins said that because items were stolen from the apartment,
it is possible that the murder charge could be upgraded to capital
murder, which carries a penalty of life in prison or death by
injection.

RETAIL SALES BREAK RECORD &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAM PARK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Retail sales for the upcoming holiday season have
a high mark to match if they are to surpass ``stunning'' figures
just released by the State Board of Equalization.
</P>
<P>
   California and Los Angeles County's fourth quarter 1999 taxable
retail sales broke records going back to the mid-1980s, rising 13.2
percent statewide and 12.1 percent in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County tallied $26.7 billion in taxable sales in
fourth quarter 1999 - $17.6 billion of that in traditional retail.
In 1998 the total was $24.2 billion, with $15.7 billion in
traditional retail sales, said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the
Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of stunning. It has been a long time since we've
seen strength like this,'' Kyser said. ``(Last year) will go down
as one of the all-time great years. I suspect 2000 won't match
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holiday season momentum carried over into the first quarter of
2000, with preliminary reports showing an increase of 13.4 percent,
but then came higher gasoline prices and the prospect of higher
natural gas prices and rising electric rates in some areas. Those
factors may cause householders to budget for less disposable income
this winter, Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, fourth quarter 1999 showed the largest quarterly
increase in taxable retail sales since second quarter 1984, when
the increase was 16.7 percent, said Dave Hayes, research manager at
the State Board of Equalization.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 number was a huge increase, especially since the
inflation rate, at 1.1 percent, was so low, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Low inflation indicates the increased sales dollars came from
more sales rather than from higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase is attributable to the fact that the economy is
doing so well,'' Hayes said. ``It's not centered in any one type of
commodity. This is across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Durable goods purchases are an indicator of how people perceive
the economy, and last year's fourth quarter sales of durable goods
increased 16.9 percent as a category, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Automobile purchases were up 22.1 percent over the previous
year; furniture and appliances were up 15.5 percent; jewelry
purchases rose 25.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes also has his eye on the cost of gasoline. Continued high
gas prices could choke this holiday season's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gas situation is the one kicker that might change
things,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Higher gas prices nudge up airline fares and truck
transportation costs, and as inflation increases, people may cut
back on spending, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on gas prices,'' Hayes said. ``Whatever
is causing California to have the highest gas prices in the nation:
Is that going to get cleared up?''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the retail groups the report included, apparel had the
smallest increases over the previous year. Men's apparel actually
showed a loss of 42.7 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes attributes the men's store decline to a decreasing number
of stores devoted exclusively to men's apparel. Many of them have
now branched out to offer clothing for the whole family, or general
merchandise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kyser cited consumer boredom with apparel
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're facing is a consumer who has bought a lot of stuff
and is looking for something new. And there's nothing new -
particularly in the apparel sector,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could blindfold you and take you to any major city, and you
could not guess where you were, the goods are so homogenized.''

 &HT;    Spiritual side of healing edges into doctor's office
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dr. Robert Cowgill was a disbeliever.
</P>
<P>
   A man of science and surgical precision, the Atlanta physician
believed in the power of a scalpel and a practiced hand _ not in
spirituality and a healing touch.
</P>
<P>
   But after attending a weekend seminar on holistic approaches to
treatment, the oncology surgeon changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of his cancer patients come to his office not to learn
merely about their medical options, but to share a moment of
meditation. ``I'm trying to be open to all possibilities; I'm
trying not to disbelieve too much,'' said Pat Waldo, a Brookhaven
resident who had a mastectomy last year to treat breast cancer.
``Dr. Cowgill helps me with this. This is his gift to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowgill, however, may be the exception to the rule. Many doctors
regard the mixture of church and science as taboo as integrating
church and state. Only 10 percent of physicians say they have
prayed with their patients or discussed spiritual issues with them,
according to a 1996 survey _ one of the scant pieces of research on
the subject. Yet almost 65 percent of people believe doctors should
join them in prayer if requested, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing body of research has suggested that prayer,
meditation and other mind-body approaches appear to be beneficial
in the healing process, although scientists are still baffled on
why. Some research, including a controversial study recently in the
Archives of Internal Medicine, has suggested that even patients who
are prayed for by a third party tend to fare better than those who
aren't the subject of prayer. Others indicate that the faithful
recover better from such procedures as open heart surgery and that,
among the elderly, blood pressure rates are lower.
</P>
<P>
   Still, approaching your physician _ if you believe the spiritual
aspect should be part of your treatment _ can be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors are trained not to focus on the metaphysical side
of healing, says Dr. David Hilton, a former family physician who
works with Emory University's dean of religious life and often
``hangs out'' at the anatomy labs to discuss any spiritual issues
medical students have as they work on cadavers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical education is focused almost exclusively on the
physical side; they are taught to stick to that,'' said Hilton, a
lifelong Methodist. ``And yet, there's definitely a need to address
more fully the other aspects of being human and being healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who do pray with their patients believe the best
approach is for patients to be honest about the importance of the
spiritual side of their own healing. They advise telling your
physicians about your own faith and gauging their comfort level
with prayer and other spiritual practices. And if you sense
resistance _ and the issue is important enough _ it might be better
to seek someone who is more in line with your own spiritual
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also don't want to offend or disappoint some patients.
And people who don't believe in God aren't going to want to hear
their physician bringing up spiritual issues. And some patients are
a lot more interested in fixing the problem _ whether it be a
blocked artery or a tumor _ than praying about it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some patients and even a few doctors feel a need to do
something beyond IVs, stitches and pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure more patients probably wished that we did (pray) with
them more than we do,'' said Dr. Kenneth McGrath, a cardiologist
and director of non-invasive cardiology at Saint Joseph's Hospital.
``But I think it's something we're just not accustomed to.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the doctor is motivated, a deeper relationship can be
forged between healers and those in their care. For example,
Cowgill and Waldo still meet occasionally for special spiritual
sessions. They'll relax in Cowgill's examination room, dimmed for
the purpose. He will loosen his tie, they will both remove their
shoes and Cowgill will beseech what he calls ``the source'' to help
Waldo heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To limit yourself to being a body mechanic, well, it's like
applying handcuffs to yourself,'' Cowgill said. ``But if you can
work with the right patients and provide care on a mental,
emotional and spiritual plane, it's much more satisfying _ for both
me and the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dale A. Matthews, author of ``The Faith Factor: Proof of the
Healing Power of Prayer'' (Penguin, $13.95 paperback), says such
experiences are common among physicians who delve into a spiritual
realm with their patients. Matthews, a Washington internist and
speaker at a recent Harvard seminar on the subject, said he became
a convert after he was cajoled into praying with an elderly patient
experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure. He wanted her to
go to the hospital immediately, but she refused.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they held hands and prayed together for healing, with
his patient clutching her rosary. She then said she would take the
fistful of prescriptions he gave her and would go home and pray
some more. A week later, she returned. She had lost 25 pounds _
much of it fluid that had built up in her body tissues _ and her
heart, once twice its size, was back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the question is, was it the medicine or the
prayer?'' Matthews said. ``Was it a miracle? I don't know, but it
sure was a dramatic

 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - FedEx and the French post office announced an alliance
Tuesday in which FedEx will transport French international
shipments in its aircraft, and the French postal service will
deliver FedEx packages across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is similar to an arrangement that FedEx and the U.S.
Postal Service are negotiating domestically.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx's new strategy of forming partnerships with national
postal services is designed to instantly give the Memphis-based air
cargo carrier broad ground delivery capabilities. It also
intensifies competition with Sandy Springs-based United Parcel
Service Inc., which uses its own people, airplanes and trucks to
perform almost all of its 13 million daily deliveries around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumers and markets will ultimately tell us which
strategy they prefer,'' said Michael L. Ducker, FedEx executive
vice president for international operations. ``We feel very
strongly that the synergies between our international air network
and the (French postal service's) ground network will benefit our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between FedEx and Chronopost Internationale, a
subsidiary of the French post office that handles international
shipments, is scheduled to begin Jan. 1. Terms of the deal were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   UPS officials said Tuesday they will wait to learn details of
the proposed alliance before deciding whether to challenge it in
court. UPS successfully sued the German post office in 1994,
claiming it used its monopoly on first-class mail to illegally
subsidize competition against private carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But John Flick, a UPS spokesman in Atlanta, said FedEx's sudden
willingness to enter far-reaching partnerships shows desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``FedEx is rushing to imitate the integrated air/ground network
we already have in place in Europe,'' Flick said. ``We've always
taken a long-term approach _ not a quick hit.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS began deliveries in Germany in 1976, and the company has
steadily expanded across Europe. UPS now has more than 23,000
workers there.
</P>
<P>
   The company's international operations were consistent money
losers until 1998 when the company recorded its first international
profit. Since then, profits have grown steadily as e-commerce and
globalization have led to a surge in premium-priced, cross-border
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx made its first foray into Europe in the late 1980s when it
tried to duplicate its U.S. overnight delivery system there. The
effort was doomed, however, by cumbersome regulations, high costs
and competition from efficient road and rail networks. FedEx pulled
out of the intra-European delivery market in 1992 but maintained
intercontinental cargo flights among Europe, North America and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx has 6,000 employees in Europe and 198 weekly flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been driving toward a comprehensive global network for
years,'' said FedEx's Ducker. ``This alliance advances that goal by
leveraging two powerful networks for the benefit of our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   FedEx shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed Tuesday at
$39.36, up 66 cents. UPS shares finished the day at $53.56, up
$1.19.

SPORTS COLUMN: GAZE WILL CARRY FLAG AND HOPES OF AUSTRALIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Tuesday evening, in the heart of the Olympic
Village, a thousand well-wishers stood in the grand lobby of the
Super Dome for an emotional send-off for the Australian Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   This was an evening drenched in history: Australia was one of
only five countries to play host to at least two Games, and the
athletes were part of the largest team Australia (628) has ever
fielded.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes, wearing smart olive green blazers, stood with team
officials and family members as John Coates, president of the
Australian Olympic Committee, talked about the continent's unbroken
history of Olympic participation. They watched as previous
flagbearers were introduced and came down a steep escalator. They
watched a film of the country's flagbearers, from 1924 to 1996,
making the famous walk around Olympic stadiums. Coates reminded the
audience that athletes were the soul of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the moment that everyone was waiting for: who would
carry the Australian flag?
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Gaze.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd erupted in cheers, his basketball teammates slapped
him on the back. Finally, after nearly three minutes of applause,
Gaze, the captain of the basketball team, leaped onto the podium,
hugging and kissing everyone on the dais.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very humbling experience,'' Gaze said. ``When
you walk around and see all the volunteers and you see the flag
raised, you see what it means to them and see how passionate they
are and how revved they are just to see you and say, `G'day.' That
makes you feel very welcome and very proud to be an Australian.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaze may have clinched the honor three days earlier during
Australia's warm-up game against the heavily favored United States,
when he got into a scuffle with Vince Carter, the young American
superstar. Officials would chastise both players, but the truth is
that the audience at Melbourne Park indoor stadium for the game
against the Americans appreciated Gaze's show of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Gaze's life is a basketball life, representing a combination of
team, country, family and a sense of national pride that is
difficult to understand in the United States, where profit consumes
and defines right and wrong, loyalty and motivation.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, Gaze, a five-time Olympian, is a national
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, he has a different image.
</P>
<P>
   For many critics in 1989, Gaze became a symbol of a
win-at-all-costs hypocrisy that defines big-time collegiate sports.
He went to Seton Hall University in October 1988, after having
played for Australia in the Seoul Olympics. He averaged 13.6 points
for the Pirates, who lost the national championship game to
Michigan, 80-79, in overtime. Four days later, Gaze left Seton Hall
to return to Australia, prompting critics _ I was one of them _ to
call him and Seton Hall partners in a mercenary alliance to win a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   His short stay and the circumstances of his participation in an
Australian professional league raised questions about amateur and
professional distinctions and the recruitment of top international
talent by major American universities.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gaze said he had decided to leave school when he
learned he would be ineligible at Seton Hall if he played another
season for the Melbourne Tigers, the team coached by his father,
Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, no one in the States understood _ or particularly
cared _ about Melbourne. Last night, as Gaze emotionally accepted
the honor, talked to teammates about responsibility, playing hard
and working hard, the deep roots of loyalty became much clearer.
</P>
<P>
   After he left Seton Hall, Gaze went home, joined the Australian
national league season and resumed his career with Melbourne. He
averaged 34 points for the Tigers in 1989. Then his life took a
sharp turn, which in many ways led to yesterday's emotional honor.
Nearly 10 years to the day, Sept. 11, 1990, Gaze became seriously
ill and was hospitalized with a blood clot in his right shoulder
just before the finals of the 1990 Australian season. He missed a
tryout with the Portland Trail Blazers and missed his league's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Gaze began to rearrange his priorities. Winning
and losing was not the motivation; he no longer felt the need to
prove himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are lying in bed wondering what is going to happen,''
Gaze said, ``you rethink things. Yes, basketball is very, very
important, but it's a game. The world is not going to fall in, and
you are not going to die tomorrow if you don't win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Gaze earned more than $130,000 in Italy. But he turned
down a lucrative offer to return to Australia to play for
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   His father coached the Tigers for nothing, he had always played
for or coached the club. Andrew was a Tiger since he could dribble
a ball. Loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   He explained to journalists that playing for more money in Italy
would have meant missing the last half of the Tigers' National
Basketball League campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as Gaze, age 35, accepted the Australian flag, he
smiled, held back tears and dedicated the honor to the blood of his
country, the blood of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a bit of an imposter up here,'' Gaze said. ``My
dad played in the 1960, '64, '68 Olympics and coached in the '72,
'76, '80 and '84 Olympics. If anyone deserves an honor like this,
it would be him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaze stopped, composed himself and blushed. ``I'll certainly be
carrying this flag for my dad,'' he said. &QL;

ECONOMIC FORECASTERS EXPECT CONTINUED EXPANSION &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOSEPH GIORDONO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   VENTURA COUNTY - Ventura County's agricultural business will
continue to enjoy the longest peacetime economic expansion in
history - just not at the same high rate of growth, a leading
economic forecaster said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we expect? We expect a soft landing,'' said Bill
Watkins, director of the University of California, Santa Barbara
Economic Forecast Project, speaking at a meeting of the Pacific
Agribusiness Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A soft landing is when the rate of growth of the economy slows
down. It still keeps on growing. People aren't being laid off, jobs
are still being created - it just goes up at a slower rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said he was more concerned about risks a few months ago
``when the (Federal Reserve Board of Governors) was going on a
rampage changing interest rates every time they got together.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they have now started taking some time to see what is
happening with the economy before they make their rate decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, previously an economist for the Federal Reserve
System's Banking Analysis Section, spoke about the county's
economic forecast before a few dozen participants of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Among other topics, Watkins addressed concerns about the effect
of slow- growth SOAR initiatives on Ventura County's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Though his staff has not yet done a comprehensive report on the
subject - they plan to begin one in December - he said the effects
of the Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources initiatives
passed by voters in 1998 were smaller than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you were supposed to have was a direct wealth transfer
from the people who own ag land to the people who own already
developed land. We did not see it,'' Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Projections of a drop in prices for agricultural land deemed off
limits under SOAR and an increase in prices for existing
developments within SOAR boundaries did not come true, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins speculated that the existence of a large supply of new
housing has kept price pressures down and led people to view the
growth control measures as something far down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe nobody believes the growth controls,'' he said. ``Times
are good, everybody is doing well, so you pass a law protecting
parks and farms. Maybe when there's a recession and you've lost a
job, you're going to change your mind.''

NEW TREATMENT SHRINKS KIDNEY TUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An experimental treatment for advanced kidney cancer has shrunk
tumors or wiped them out completely and prolonged life in some
patients for whom conventional therapy failed, doctors are
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Although the doctors are reporting only the first test of the
procedure, and although their findings are considered preliminary,
researchers not connected with the work say the results are
encouraging enough to warrant testing the treatment in more
patients with kidney cancer or certain other types of tumors.
</P>
<P>
   There are 30,000 cases of kidney cancer a year in the United
States, a third of them attributed to smoking, and 12,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The new procedure, a modified version of bone-marrow
transplantation, was developed at the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute by a team led by Dr. Richard W. Childs. In a paper
to be published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, he
and his colleagues describe the first 19 patients they treated,
from one to three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before treatment, few of the 19 patients were expected to live
more than a year, Childs said. But nine, all of whom got their
treatment more than a year ago, are still alive, including four in
whom all traces of the cancer have disappeared. In the five others
still alive, tumors have shrunk by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   Eight patients died of their cancer, and two died of
complications from the treatment. The tumors had shrunk in one of
these two patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken the worst of the worst kidney-cancer patients, who
had no other treatment option available, and cancers regressed in a
majority,'' Childs said in a telephone interview. ``We're making
tumors shrink, and making people live longer.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, it is impossible to tell how long the remissions
will last. ``We don't want to use the word `cure' until it's five
years,'' he said, adding that cancer patients sometimes relapsed
even after 10-year remissions.
</P>
<P>
   All the patients in the study had advanced kidney cancer that
had spread to other organs and that had not improved after
conventional treatment with interleukin-2 or interferon alfa, drugs
meant to stimulate the patient's immune system to fight the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Those drugs help only about 19 percent of patients. And standard
chemotherapy with drugs meant to kill tumor cells outright is
ineffective against kidney cancer, in part because the kidneys are
designed to remove harmful substances from the body without being
affected by them.
</P>
<P>
   Once kidney cancer has begun to spread, half of patients die in
less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow transplantation, in which cells from a donor are
given to a cancer patient, has not previously been used to treat
kidney cancer. It is most often used to treat leukemia and other
cancers that affect the blood and the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In those diseases, the patient is given huge doses of
chemotherapy and radiation to kill the cancer. But that treatment
also destroys the patient's immune system and blood-forming cells,
and if they are not reconstituted, the patient will die. So the
donor's bone marrow, which contains stem cells that can multiply
and create a whole new blood supply and immune system, is used to
``rescue'' the patient from the chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   In the patients with kidney cancer, Childs and his colleagues
used the donor cells in a radically different way. Rather than
using them to rescue the patient from chemotherapy, they reasoned
that the donor cells themselves could fight the patient's cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Since chemotherapy does not fight kidney cancer, the patients in
the study were not given big doses of it, or radiation. But they
were given drugs to destroy their immune systems, so that their
bodies would not reject the stem cells that they then received from
donors.
</P>
<P>
   The donors were siblings who had matching cell types; patients
whose siblings did not match could not enter the study. The stem
cells were collected from the donors' bloodstream, with no need for
painful bone punctures used in the past to harvest stem cells from
marrow.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest risk of the procedure was that the donor cells
would attack not just the tumors but also the patient's own
tissues, in a potentially fatal reaction called graft-versus-host
disease. Two patients did die as a result of that disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The team used immunosuppressive drugs to try to prevent the
disorder, but also began withdrawing the drugs as quickly as
possible in order to allow the donors' marrow to fight the cancer
cells.

BUSH FINDS A MINUS TO COZINESS WITH REPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The presidential race may be neck and neck, but
there is one place Gov. George W. Bush has cut back on his
campaigning. The rear of his own plane.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few days ago, the Republican nominee would stroll the
aisle of the campaign's chartered Boeing 757 to chat with reporters
traveling with him. But the visits became fewer and farther between
after Bush's aides found that the networks preferred those informal
moments to the staged events of the day. And reporters, in turn,
began to object when the campaign insisted that the governor's
conversations at 30,000 feet had to be off the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered they were using shots from the plane on the
evening news,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications
director. ``And because Gore wasn't doing `avails' like that, the
networks were using shots from his events.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of romancing the media, the Bush campaign is
learning about the downside of courtship. Unlike the campaign of
Vice President Al Gore, which has strictly limited the candidate's
access, Bush and his advisers have provided a steady diet of the
kind of ``availabilities'' that reporters crave.
</P>
<P>
   Even on days when he can anticipate tough encounters _ as on the
morning last week when articles appeared quoting prominent
Republicans expressing worries about the state of the Bush campaign
_ the governor met with reporters. ``He took questions for 20
minutes,'' said Walter Shapiro, a columnist for USA Today, ``and
the consensus of the reporters I talked to was that this was a
gutsy performance.''
</P>
<P>
   In providing the access, Bush's aides have also learned how
piercing the double-edged sword can be, for making the governor
available almost every day has given reporters and camera crews a
greater degree of autonomy within the highly controlled confines of
a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, was for weeks this summer virtually
unavailable for daily questions from reporters, a practice that may
have irritated the reporters but certainly gave him tighter control
over the ideas and images the campaign sought to convey.
</P>
<P>
   As the experience of the photo opportunities on the Bush plane
demonstrated, access does not guarantee cooperative coverage. In
fact, Bush appears at times to grant the news media license to
knock him completely off his message.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, Bush surprised reporters last month with an
admission aboard the campaign plane that he had to do a better job
of making clear his plan for a tax cut, some reporters used his
candor as the foundation for stories about a campaign in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern continued on Tuesday, as Bush appeared on the tarmac
of Orlando International Airport and faced several questions about
a report in The New York Times that the word ``rats'' shows up for
a split second in an anti-Gore commercial by the Republican
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   CNN led its midafternoon newscast today with its follow-up to
the report. ``No detail is too small or too fleeting to cause a
controversy,'' a CNN anchor noted. In its piece about Bush's tarmac
appearance, the network also pointed out that Bush mispronounced
``subliminal'' four times.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Warfield, who was Bob Dole's press secretary during the
1996 presidential campaign, said: ``Another day of message lost for
a guy in a neck-and-neck race. The Bush campaign is a highly
disciplined operation, and I think they are convinced their message
will penetrate. He doesn't want to become a bumbler and he isn't
yet. But this is not a helpful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In what sometimes can sound like an echo of his former rival,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the governor often speaks of his
respect for reporters as if he genuinely likes them. In a
question-and-answer session Bush held with workers at a
high-technology company in Warrendale, Pa., on Friday, the first
two questioners were critical of what they saw as the way the press
distorted Bush's campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an interesting relationship between me and the
media,'' Bush told the employees at the company, Marconi
Communications. ``I need them to get my message out, and sometimes
it comes out fairly and sometimes, frankly, I don't care for the
coverage. But that's OK. Sometimes I answer the question, they
think it's OK. sometimes I answer the questions, they don't like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, it was Bush and his staff who did not like the
questions. As the plane headed to St. Louis, Hughes served
reporters cubes of cheese as she called the article about the rats
reference ``the cheesiest story'' she had ever read.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since his loss in the New Hampshire primary,
Bush has had to endure a sustained period of bad news, reported by
many of the people he says he respects. The recent events range in
significance from his failed effort to impose his own plan for
debates to smaller gaffes and strategic miscues that have become
frequent distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign and the reporters who follow it say there has been
no perceptible deterioration in their relationship. Indeed, some in
the traveling press corps report a kind of admiration for Bush's
resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can get pummeled by reporters,'' said David Gregory, a
correspondent for NBC News assigned to the campaign. ``And 10
minutes later, he'll come back and shake hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some political professionals wonder whether the trouble
Bush has faced recently will force a shift in the relationship
between the governor and the journalists.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The press is the most jealous mistress of all,'' Warfield
said. ``And Bush has been very smart in recognizing the demands of
the care and feeding of the press. The question is how he continues
that, now that he's hit a rough patch.''
</P>
<P>
   Warfield said that Dole, who as a senator was known for his
quick wit, found the tenor of the coverage in the presidential race
frustrating. ``He enjoyed bantering with reporters, but his dry
sense of humor didn't always translate into ink,'' Warfield said.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, Warfield recalled that Dole was asked the
fairly innocuous question, ``What was the one thing he wanted
Americans to know about him?'' ``Senator Dole sort of scratched his
head and said `Beats me,' in a funny way.'' The resulting story?
``Dole can't come up with a single thing he wants America to know
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There came a certain reluctance to step on your message of the
day by taking the high risk of shooting the breeze with
reporters,'' Warfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters following Bush say that on some days, the themes
and issues the campaign emphasizes _ especially health care and
education _ are retreads that force them to pursue other story
lines. And ever more often, the story of the day is what the latest
polls are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision to visit this state, previously thought to be
safely in his column, itself became the dominant story on Monday,
when the governor was in Clearwater and West Palm Beach, talking
about health care. For example, the lead paragraph in The Palm
Beach Post's front page story on Bush's noted that Bush's campaign
here was ``nowhere near the sure thing he hoped it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether all the ``avails'' are to any avail may be incalculable.
Much of what happens is beyond the control of a campaign, anyway,
said Shapiro of USA Today, who traveled with the campaign last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A drop in the polls is something that nothing can cushion,''
he said. ``An embarrassing admission is something that nothing can
cushion. So all these things are at the margins.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mr. Shapiro said he thought the campaign and the press had
reached an acceptable equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not chummy `We're all in this together' nor is it `You're
all part of an evil media conspiracy,' '' Shapiro said. ``It's much
more `You have your job to do, and we'll help you.' Anything
closer, you'd get suspicious.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Republicans say they'll concede big tax cuts, if Democrats put
surplus toward debt relief
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By KAREN MASTERSON
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans offered to back down Tuesday on their
demand for major tax cuts if Democrats would agree to use the
budget surplus for debt relief, not for more spending on government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to take 90 percent of our surplus ... and pay down the
debt,'' House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said yesterday
after a late afternoon meeting with President Clinton and
Democratic congressional leaders at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good discussion'' and found ``a fair middle ground''
on some issues, Hastert said. Among them was a likely compromise to
increase the $5.15 hourly minimum wage by $1 in exchange for
limited tax breaks for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Having all but lost the battle over the repeal of the estate tax
and marriage penalty tax, Republicans switched strategies. Instead,
they want to prevent Democrats from significantly increasing
spending on domestic programs by proposing to put most of the
estimated $264 billion surplus in fiscal year 2001 in a ``locked
box'' for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Republican efforts to override the president's veto
of the estate tax failed. Today the House is scheduled to vote on
an override of the president's veto of the marriage penalty tax
repeal. That vote is expected to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats called the GOP's debt-reduction proposal a
``gimmick,`` indicating that the two parties remain far apart on
spending issues. Meanwhile, the clock is running out for lawmakers
to reach an agreement before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We smell a rat,'' said Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota. Following Tuesday's White House meeting, Daschle and
other Democrats said they want to see more money go toward debt
reduction, but not as prescribed by the Republicans. Instead of
putting nearly all of this year's surplus toward the national debt,
Democrats want to spread the debt-reduction payments over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also agreed generally about the need for a
prescription drug plan for the elderly and a patients' bill of
rights. But on details, the two sides remained too far apart to
predict the passage of any new legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come away from the meeting with confidence'' on these
two issues, Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, both sides will have to compromise on
fundamental differences over government spending. Only two of 13
spending bills needed to keep the government running into the next
fiscal year have been signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the spending bills have cleared at least the House and
some have been approved by the Senate. But Clinton has threatened
to veto several of them because he said they fall short of funding
important programs, like school construction, by roughly $25
billion.
</P>
<P>
   If the two sides fail to reach an agreement, few options remain.
The government could shut down, although that proved to be
political suicide for Republicans when they challenged the
president in 1995, forcing a partial shutdown of government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   With continued control over the House at stake, Republicans are
more likely to bend so they can get home to campaign, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are now talking about passing a temporary spending
bill that would keep the government running beyond Oct. 1 and,
possibly, keep them in Washington later than they want.
</P>
<P>
   Holding out for a series of modest tax reductions is House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land.
</P>
<P>
   What DeLay and others want are tax cuts and other concessions
that would cost roughly $16 billion in 2001 and would include an
increases in the amount of tax-free contributions to retirement
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Also being pushed is an increase in the amount taxpayers can
contributed to their individual retirement accounts, a proposal by
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Houston, that would cost between $4 billion and
$5 billion. That proposal is expected to be included in a budget
reconciliation bill, which the Ways and Means Committee _ chaired
by Archer _ is scheduled to finish on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also want to increase Medicare reimbursements to
hospitals, nursing homes and other Medicare providers, at a cost of
roughly $4 billion; provide roughly $4 billion in tax cuts to small
businesses to offset the cost of raising the minimum wage; and
repeal the federal telephone excise tax, at a cost of roughly $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates a $264 billion surplus
for next year, about $200 billion from taxes collected on Social
Security and Medicare in excess of what is paid out.
</P>
<P>
   Of the non-Social Security and Medicare funds available for
discretionary programs _ about $64 billion _ Republicans say there
is about $10 billion available for additional spending on programs
favored by Clinton, which is about $15 billion short.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats conceded that yesterday's meeting at
the White House brought them closer to understanding what the other
side wants, but not much closer on what each side is willing to
give.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans this year have pushed for hundreds of billions in
tax reductions after Clinton a year ago vetoed a $792 billion tax
package. Instead of funding all the tax measures into one bill, GOP
lawmakers repackage their tax-cut proposals in a series of separate
bills hoping to make it more difficult for Democrats and the White
House to oppose.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If a perpetrator on the Upper East Side of Manhattan
were to track a woman home late one night, follow her past the
Pookie &AMP; Sebastian Clothing Boutique on 77th Street and pounce just
as she enters her building, then that perpetrator could be in for
an unpleasant evening of crime.
</P>
<P>
   A thumb-detonated electronic alarm attached to the victim's key
chain would trigger the following wake-the-dead chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   From the top of a nearby building, a loudspeaker _ loud enough
to ruin the sleep of everyone on the block _ would proclaim:
``Intruder on the block! Call the police!''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a police siren would go off and a series of
strobe lights would begin to flash. A central alarm would alert the
local police station house to the address and name of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors would move to their windows, having been instructed by
their block association to pay careful attention to how the suspect
is dressed. Then they would call 911.
</P>
<P>
   This device, the first of its kind to be tested in New York, is
soon to be part of the crime-stopping arsenal of about 100
residents on East 77th Street between Second and Third Avenues. The
block where the Safe-Block security technology is soon to be
activated is nestled inside the 19th Precinct, already one of the
safest in the city. Serious crime there, never very high by city
standards, is down 66 percent in the last seven years, according to
Lt. Stephen Biegel, a Police Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There had not been a single shooting this year, he said, until
Monday, when a landlord in the East 60s was charged with killing
one of his tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood is pretty darn safe, neighborhood activists
agree, but not safe enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the block itself may not be a high-crime block, it is
indicative of a block where a perpetrator might have some easy
activity,'' said Nikki Henkin, the founder of the 77th Street Block
Association, which last night showed off the crime-busting
technology to local residents. ``Hopefully, this is going to scare
the hell out of a perpetrator and he is going to take off. This is
a deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   On 77th Street on Tuesday afternoon, other East Side residents
were not so confident that a cacophonous medley of recorded shouts
about an intruder, screaming sirens and flashing lights _ which
could be turned on by any neighbor with a twitchy thumb _ was a
perfect solution for big-city peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard enough with the car alarms,'' said Natalia Kissel,
50, who lives on nearby 80th Street and is a researcher for an
investment bank. ``You could end up with a bunch of elderly women
who claim they are being accosted and have nervous trigger fingers.
I wouldn't want to have it on my block.''
</P>
<P>
   The alarm system found its way to the Upper East Side courtesy
of Richard Soloway, chief executive of Napco Security Systems, a
company in Amityville, N.Y., that makes panic buttons for banks,
electronic sirens and other alarm systems.
</P>
<P>
   Soloway approached Assemblyman John A. Ravitz, a Republican who
represents the Upper East Side, and offered the key-chain alarm
system as a way of addressing longstanding fears among many
neighborhood residents about stalkers and rapists. Ravitz put him
in touch with the block association.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, an unidentified suspect who has come to be known as
the Upper East Side rapist has committed at least 16 rapes and
assaults _ four of them on East 78th Street, a block away from the
test zone.
</P>
<P>
   Soloway said that he was offering his alarm to residents on the
block without charge. He said he hoped they would use it for
several months and offer suggestion about how it might be improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend on putting up signage to let the predators know this
is a safe block, that everything on the block will be protected by
the panic button,'' Soloway said. ``You want to create commotion.
These predators like it when it is quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   After the test period, Soloway said, he will market his
key-chain panic button citywide for $69.95, plus a monthly charge
of $5.95. He said that to pay for the block-by-block installation
of receiving equipment _ the large gray panel housing a
loudspeaker, siren and flashing lights _ his company would need at
least 50 customers per block.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll market it to whoever has the need,'' said Soloway, who
lives in Manhattan. ``There are a lot of areas all over the city
that could use a device like this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Police officials have looked at the alarm and shown some support
for it, Soloway said.
</P>
<P>
   A police official familiar with the neighborhood said on Tuesday
that the alarm system could prove useful in giving residents an
easy way to alert the police to crime. But the official, who spoke
only on the condition of anonymity because he feared that he might
annoy the city's new police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, said
that there were two significant downsides to the alarm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be like the boy who cried wolf,'' he said. ``If you
get nervous nellies pressing the button whenever they see a guy
drinking beer on the street, then you will have annoyed neighbors
who do not spring to the windows to see the perpetrator. They will
say, `This is the 12th time this week. I'm watching my TV show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the police official said, while the alarm system quickly
alerts the police to the address of a possible crime, it does not
give them any specific description of the nature of the crime or
the appearance of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be very useful, but you do get crank 911 calls,'' the
police official said.

BRUINS' ANDERSON TURNING THINGS AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This could have gone a couple of very different
ways. Everyone admits that. And its last chapter is still far from
written.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no denying the direction in which Marques Anderson
is now headed. The UCLA junior strong safety is off to an
impressive start to the Bruins' 2000 campaign, quickly emerging as
an impact player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a chance, if he continues to grow, to play in that
league on Sundays,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``He's that
talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions have changed since last year, when Anderson was forced
not only to sit out the season for disciplinary reasons, but was
suspended from UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a player who had always had things come easily was
banished from his team and school. He spent last fall taking
courses at Compton College. He spent it re-evaluating where he was
going with his career, and his life.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson already had been in serious trouble with the dean of
students when he was discovered as one of the Bruins involved in
the handicapped-parking-placard scandal. Others missed games, but
for Anderson, it was one mistake too many. He was out.
</P>
<P>
   His previous mistakes have been kept confidential. He attributes
them to immaturity, saying he did ``stupid things'' and was
``taking shortcuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe things came a little too easily for Anderson early. The
latest talented defensive back out of Long Beach Poly High, he
started five games as a freshman at cornerback. He had three
interceptions. He seemed headed for football greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you start taking things for granted,'' Anderson
said. ``Then you kind of forget what got you there, and that's hard
work and dedication.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that suspension, it kind of put everything into
perspective. It was a real humbling experience. Since I came back
to school, I just dedicated myself to working hard and devoting my
time to football.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no certainty he would even come back to UCLA. While
attending Compton, he could have spurned the Bruins and headed to
another campus. But before he left, he spoke with Toledo, who
assured him if he got his life together, a scholarship would be
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to go anywhere else,'' he said. ``I love my
Bruin family.''
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo also told Anderson one other thing: There was no room
for even one more mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him if he did something wrong, he was going to be
gone,'' Toledo said. ``He's on probation. The next major mistake he
makes, he won't be with us anymore. He knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   So Anderson returned during the winter quarter, having
rededicated himself to his sport and to getting things done the
right way.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA cornerback Jason Bell, who also missed most of last season
with a heel injury and is his closest friend on the team, said it
was obvious early something good had developed out of a bad
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sitting out was probably the best thing that could
ever have happened to him,'' Bell said. ``He realized how much he
loved the sport and how much he missed not playing it. When he came
back, he worked harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could just tell he was taking the game seriously. Usually
Marques is kind of passive. He's so talented he's kind of like,
`Let's go. Whatever, whatever.' But this time he was a different
person about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely saw that things aren't going to work out for you
just because you're Marques Anderson. He kind of realized he had to
take care of his business and do things right.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he trained harder than ever. Already one of the
strongest players on the team despite his 6-foot, 208-pound frame,
he increased his bench press to 350 pounds. Anderson said he
improved his time in the 40-yard dash to 4.31 seconds, a remarkable
improvement from his previous best of 4.5.
</P>
<P>
   Others noticed his new attitude. Anderson had been away for only
one quarter, but had returned a seemingly different young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big maturing process,'' Toledo said. ``He played as a
true freshman and he had a lot of success. All of a sudden he
thought, `This is pretty easy.' And it wasn't that easy. He became
a little lackadaisical, he became a little lazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when his problem hit, he realized how badly he missed it
and how important it was to be out there performing. I think he
reassessed what he had done and his goals. Now he's living up to
those goals.''
</P>
<P>
   When the college football world last saw Anderson, it was in the
two final losses of the 1998 season _ the infamous poor-tackling
games against Miami and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I most definitely was one of the guilty parties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a year away, he had been moved to a new position to
open against third-ranked Alabama. Knowing how he had prepared,
Anderson said he felt nothing but confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year away there was a lot of built-up tension,'' he said.
``It was a lot of mixed feelings. Sadness that I couldn't be with
the team. Frustration. All these things that kind of built up
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 20 months away from football, I was ready. The excitement
was building up. All of these things I was thinking for such a long
time were just ready to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and an unexpectedly strong secondary helped to give
Alabama fits in the 35-24 upset. Against Fresno State last week,
Anderson was again all over the field _ recovering the fumbled snap
in the closing minutes to preserve the 24-21 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Through two games, he is tied for second in tackles (nine) and
for first in passes defensed (four), and he has a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's just beginning to reach his full potential,''
Bell said. ``I think free safety is his natural position. He's an
outstanding player this year, but we haven't seen the best he's
going to do.'' &QL;

ACCUSATIONS OF MISCONDUCT IN TWO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS
</HEADLINE>
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top Justice Department officials responsible for
teaching foreigners about American-style justice and democracy
engaged in ``egregious misconduct,'' including a visa-fraud scheme
to slip Russian girlfriends into the United States, according to a
report by the department's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released to Congress on Tuesday, the inspector
general recommended discipline against several managers of the
overseas training programs for abuse of visa procedures,
mishandling classified documents, traveling by business class
without authorization and practicing favoritism in hiring and
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations span several years of the mid-1990s at the two
programs: the International Criminal Investigative Training
Assistance Program, which trains foreign police agencies in newly
democratic nations, and the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial
Development, Assistance and Training, which instructs foreign
prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs are part of the Justice Department's criminal
division, though they are financed through the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who has pressed Attorney General
Janet Reno to crack down on the police training program, called the
report ``merely the latest example of how the Justice Department is
a real mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to say
what action, if any, would be taken against the managers criticized
by the inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the accusations involve Robert K. Bratt, a senior
Justice Department official who enjoyed the confidence of Reno to
the extent that she subsequently tapped him to help overhaul the
Immigration and Naturalization Service in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bratt, who served in various management roles over the two
training programs beginning in 1992, made four trips to Russia in
1996 and 1997, the report said. During those visits, he met two
women, one or both of whom became his ``Russian girlfriends,'' the
inspector general said.
</P>
<P>
   The report asserted that Bratt and an associate, Joseph R. Lake
Jr., who retired in 1997, used Bratt's authority to bypass the
normal procedures to get U.S. visas for the women. They were
granted visas in April 1997, through a process reserved for special
humanitarian cases or those involving an American government
interest, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Bratt issued a statement Tuesday denying any abuse of his
position. He portrayed himself as the target of an inspector
general, whom he called ``out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended several current Justice Department
managers for discipline, including Joseph Trincellito, the
associate director of the police training program, for mishandling
classified documents; Janice Stromsem, a former director of the
program, for violating security regulations and personnel rules;
and Cary Hoover, a special assistant, for sharing classified
material with uncleared parties.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the inspector general would have recommended
``significant discipline'' for Bratt including ``possible
termination,'' but noted that he retired last month. Senator
Grassley insisted that Bratt should face criminal charges.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Chase Manhattan Corp., the third-biggest banking
company in the United States, is expected to announce Wednesday
that it has agreed to acquire J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., one of the most
storied banks, for $30.9 billion in stock, executives close to the
talks said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has been striving to transform itself into a global
financial powerhouse, and acquiring Morgan could sharply accelerate
the process. Since the early 1980s, Morgan has changed from a
commercial bank with a blue-chip list of clients into a firm
focused on investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Morgan could catapult Chase into the big leagues of
investment banking, the business of raising money for large
corporations and advising them on mergers and acquisitions. It
would also continue the consolidation among the nation's largest
banks, leaving only a handful of massive institutions at the top of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the deal that should have been done a year ago,'' said
Michael Mayo, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``It's a
logical progression.''
</P>
<P>
   While the firms have released no details on the likely deal,
executives close to the negotiations said that job cuts were
expected. Some analysts speculated that several thousand jobs could
be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Chase's banking customers would probably not notice much
immediate change as a result of the merger. With the exception of
underwriting and trading corporate bonds and loans, there is little
overlap between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Chase is one of the biggest credit-card issuers in the country
and a major lender to individuals to buy houses and cars. In
contrast, even as it has labored to reinvent itself, Morgan has
continued to focus largely on serving the financing needs of
blue-chip clients, both corporate and individual.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both firms have struggled to keep pace with the rapid
growth of the leading investment banks, which are in businesses
that have been far more lucrative than the lending business at the
core of commercial banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resulting organization would clearly be powerful because
both firms are both bank and investment bank,'' said Robert
Albertson, president of Pilot Financial, an investment firm in New
York. ``The old Chase and the old Morgan a decade ago would have
been oil and water but now they're made of the same liquid. They've
grown closer rather than further apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The new firm would be called J.P. Morgan Chase, the executives
said. William B. Harrison, chairman and chief executive officer of
Chase, would be chief executive of the combined institution.
Douglas A. Warner III, chairman and chief executive of Morgan,
would be chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has total assets of $396 billion, compared with $266
billion for Morgan. While both firms are among the five biggest
banks in the nation, neither has been able to crack the top tier of
investment banks on Wall Street. Chase ranks ninth and Morgan 10th
this year among advisers to corporations on mergers and
acquisitions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has operations in 65 countries and nearly 80,000
employees. J.P. Morgan has about 16,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if it is completed, would end months of speculation
about who might acquire the 150-year-old Morgan. Several firms,
including Deutsche Bank of Germany, have recently considered buying
Morgan as consolidation has picked up speed on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, there have been several high-priced
acquisitions of mid-sized American financial companies, including
PaineWebber Group, the brokerage firm, and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, a midsized investment bank. The commercial banking
industry has been consolidating as well. But none of those deals
involved two firms with the heritage and clout of Chase and J.P.
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, which was founded in 1799, has grown rapidly in recent
years through mergers with some of New York's biggest banks,
including Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover. More recently,
it has been buying up smaller investment banking firms. To
strengthen its position as an underwriter of technology companies,
it acquired Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, a San Francisco-based firm, last
year.
</P>
<P>
   This spring it bought Beacon Group, a merger boutique run by
Geoff Boisi, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs Group who
is now overseeing Chase's investment banking operations. In June,
Chase added Robert Fleming Holdings Ltd., an investment banking and
money-management firm in Europe for $7.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even with those purchases, Chase faced the prospect of
losing ground as competitors made even bigger acquisitions. UBS,
the giant Swiss bank, agreed to pay more than $12 billion to buy
PaineWebber earlier this year. Last month, Credit Suisse Group,
another Swiss bank, agreed to pay $12.8 billion to buy Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette from Axa, a French financial conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals nearly wiped out the ranks of independent,
middle-tier securities firms, increasing the pressure on would-be
buyers to rush in. At the beginning of this week, only three
remained: Morgan, Lehman Brothers Holdings and Bear Stearns Cos.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Morgan has worked for years to transform itself
into a firm focused on investment banking but has stayed away from
mergers and major acquisitions. But according to one adviser who
had talked with J.P. Morgan, Warner has been shopping the company
to prospective buyers for several months. That person said that
J.P. Morgan was asking for a premium of 15 percent to 20 percent
over the current stock price, a sum some investment banks thought
was too rich.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern was J.P. Morgan's fixed income trading
business which competitors say made up too much of their business..
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank was one suitor interested in J.P. Morgan, but that
bank would have to register shares in the United States before it
could complete any transaction, and that would take more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Morgan's chief financial officer, Peter Hancock,
quit suddenly, adding more fuel to the speculation. Then, Tuesday
morning, Douglas Warner, the chairman and chief executive of
Morgan, set the rumors flying when he canceled an appearance at a
banking conference hosted by Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's stock shot up $16.13 to close at $185.44 on the New
York Stock Exchange Tuesday. Chase's shares fell $4.88 to $52.50.

JOSEPH H. LEWIS, 93, DIRECTOR WHO TURNED B-MOVIES INTO ART
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.) By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph H. Lewis, whose gritty, fast-paced low-budget films so
transcended the conventions of the B-movie that filmmakers and
screenwriters like Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Jay Cocks
were moved to elevate him to the pantheon of auteurs, died on Aug.
30. He was 93 and lived in Marina del Rey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   From 1937 to 1958, Lewis directed nearly 40 films with titles
like ``Singing Outlaw'' (1937), ``Two-Fisted Rangers'' (1940),
``The Invisible Ghost'' (1941), ``Bombs Over Burma'' (1942), ``The
Falcon in San Francisco'' (1945), ``Retreat, Hell!'' (1952), ``Cry
of the Hunted'' (1953), ``The Seventh Cavalry'' (1956) and ``Terror
in a Texas Town'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   His versatility and skill were also manifest in the musical
numbers he directed in the 1946 hit ``The Jolson Story.'' And many
film aficionados found him at the peak of his form in ``Gun
Crazy,'' shot on a $400,000 budget in 30 days in 1949. Released in
1950, this film noir starred Peggy Cummins as a hard-boiled
carnival markswoman who teams up with John Dall as a confused war
veteran in a tale of banditry on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   After pronouncing the proceedings ``basically on a par with the
most humdrum pulp fiction,'' Howard Thompson wrote in The New York
Times, ``In fact, director Joseph H. Lewis has kept the whole thing
zipping along at a colorful tempo which deserves a much better
outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after the heyday of Lewis' career, which he slowed after he
had a major heart attack at 46, did connoisseurs of film begin to
trumpet his virtues as a master of his craft notable for the pacing
of his movies and the handling of his actors.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times in 1991 on the occasion of a
tribute to Lewis at the Public Theater, Scorsese and Cocks said,
``Low budgets and tight schedules didn't cramp his style; it seems
as if they invigorated and helped invent it.''
</P>
<P>
   They summed up ``Gun Crazy'' as ``a great movie that never set
out to be one.'' In particular, they cited a scene shot from the
back seat of a Cadillac that followed the leading characters as
they drove into town to commit a bank robbery. Describing it as
unrelenting and involving, Scorsese and Cocks wrote: ``There's no
more audience. There are only accomplices.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Lewis received the Los Angeles Critics Association
Lifetime Achievement Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed my name to every foot of film,'' he told Bogdanovich
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also directed episodes of ``The Rifleman,'' ``Gunsmoke''
and ``The Defenders,'' among other television series.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he was much in demand to deliver lectures to
aspiring filmmakers and to appear at retrospectives that honored
him in places like Germany, France and Telluride, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as five weeks before his death, he appeared at a
screening of ``Gun Crazy'' at the University of California at Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, an optometrist's son who was born in Brooklyn and studied
at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, followed a brother to
Hollywood in the 1920's in hopes of becoming an actor. Ben, his
brother, helped him find work as a camera assistant before Lewis
also took up editing as films were converting to sound.
</P>
<P>
   After an apprenticeship as a second unit director, he began
making films for Republic Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Lewis enjoyed duck hunting and trout and
deep-sea fishing, especially aboard his 50-foot trawler, Buena
Vista, named for his wife of more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Lewis is survived by a daughter, Candy
Sangster of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Gale Reingold, a Jungian analyst in Los Angeles who was Lewis'
friend and fishing companion for 40 years, said Lewis once told
him: ``In every film I ever directed, I had the sense I could see
something beyond the script and beyond the story. It's as if I'm
pulling up something out of a place I really don't know anything
about.''

NET QUALITY GETTING BETTER FOR VINTAGE CINEMA LIBRARY &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND

<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - By putting 375 movies, short films and TV episodes
on the Internet for instant viewing, a group of Hollywood outsiders
has already succeeded where Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and
their deep-pocketed friends have failed.
</P>
<P>
   But CinemaPop.com, based in Los Angeles, still faces the same
challenges that led Spielberg and his DreamWorks SKG partners to
pull the plug on their Internet entertainment site last week -
before it even debuted.
</P>
<P>
   For most Internet users, video over the Internet is still blurry
- even at its best, when it fills just a quarter of the screen -
and the selection of titles is limited enough to keep them going to
video stores for rentals.
</P>
<P>
   For now at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw the number of people who could be reached by the
Internet, it occurred to me that this had the potential to replace
home video as the No. 1 source of revenue for the movie industry,''
said Alex Kanakaris, chief executive of CinemaPop.com's parent
company, Kanakaris Wireless. ``I also knew enough about technology
to know it would evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, improved software and high speed Internet
connections have made it possible to view high-quality video over
the computer - at any time and from anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this niche of the Internet has seen some notable failures in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The much-hyped Digital Entertainment Network went out of
business. Shockwave.com spent millions to tap top Hollywood talent
for original programming, only to announce last week that it was
laying off staff and shifting focus to interactive gaming.
</P>
<P>
   And Pop.com no longer wanted to struggle in what its founders
called a less viable market.
</P>
<P>
   That has led analysts to take a dim view of Web companies that
simply distribute content like pictures, words or images, while
drawing revenue from on-site advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is we're not quite ready for that type of product
to be consumed by millions of people,'' said Vernon Keenan, an
Internet analyst with Keenan Vision Inc. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Charging people for such fare can be equally difficult since
most Web users are used to getting what they want for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not do content subscriptions on the Internet with
two exceptions: the Wall Street Journal and porno sites,'' Keenan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kanakaris hopes a combination of subscriptions, fees and
advertising on his site will prove successful.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Kanakaris and his employees, including a
former video rental chain owner and engineer who developed a
command and control system for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, have been focusing on simply getting video out on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Kanakaris put ``The Perfect Gift,'' a B movie, online.
Because of the extremely slow connections then, the average viewer
saw images that streamed onto the screen at about the size of a
postage stamp, when they appeared at all.
</P>
<P>
   The technical challenges were so daunting that Kanakaris largely
switched to finding ways to distribute books online, which is far
easier through regular, dial-up connections.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is possible to get quality video images out, the
focus for Kanakaris and others has been on finding an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Most of CinemaPop.com's films - none of them recent
blockbusters, many decades old - are free to watch. Some require a
$5 per monthly membership for unlimited viewing, and a handful of
the films are pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can also select a video feed that is optimized for the
speed of their connection, from 56K modems to high-speed corporate
T1 lines.
</P>
<P>
   In an Internet niche that has seen some spectacular failures in
recent months, Kanakaris is also hoping to stay a step ahead of the
competition by optimizing the movies available on his site for
viewing on small, hand-held computers, even those that are
wireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to the next step, having succeeded at what some of
Hollywood's big boys have failed at,'' he said.!dlim!!end! &QL;

SEATTLE MAN SPOTS ``RATS'' IN GOP TELEVISION AD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On Tuesday, Gary Greenup was America's man in the
news. Today, he's on his way to becoming history's footnote.
</P>
<P>
   All because Greenup, a Seattle technical writer and college
instructor, can't just smell a rat. He can spot one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Greenup created the political hubbub du jour after identifying,
then recording, the word ``RATS'' in a Republican television
advertisement praising George W. Bush's plan for prescription drugs
and belittling Vice President Al Gore's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple-rodent identifier flashes by most viewers too
quickly to notice _ in one-thirtieth of a second. But Tuesday,
Greenup's find became news fit to print and the focus of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent much of his day answering questions about the
advertisement after The New York Times told all on Page One. The
Republican National Committee canceled the ad. The man responsible
for it said it was all a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats enjoyed their opponent's embarrassment and spoke
darkly of subliminal advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Back at his Ballard home, Greenup fielded at least a dozen
interviews, including a spot on CNN. So great was the media crush
that the state Democratic Party dispatched a staff member to help
Greenup cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can rest on my laurels now. I've made it in The New York
Times,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I didn't set out to be the avenging angel. I just
thought it might be something interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   For Greenup, it all started around Labor Day when he noticed the
Republican ad that blasted Gore's plan to provide senior citizens
with prescription-drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old Greenup may understand the way the candidates
and their parties communicate better than most citizens.
</P>
<P>
   He is a retired technical writer for Boeing who writes on a
variety of subjects. He also teaches business communications and
English at community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Greenup follows politics with a passing interest. A Democrat, he
regularly gives a small amount to the national party.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, he worked on Democrat Mike Lowry's campaign for
governor. But he said his campaign work didn't amount to much more
than ``sweeping out the office at night.''
</P>
<P>
   When Greenup first saw the Bush ad, he thought he spotted
something. He watched it a second time. The third time the ad ran,
he had his VCR ready. He watched the commercial frame by frame, and
sure enough, ``RATS'' appears in capital letters. Then the ad
states: ``The Gore prescription plan: Bureaucrats decide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just kind of intrigued by what I saw. It's pretty
interesting that they are taking a risk to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He called King County Democrats, who shuffled him to the state
party. Greenup left a voice-mail message for Paul Berendt, party
chairman. But Berendt didn't exactly leap to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, when I heard the message, I didn't think there would
be anything to this,'' Berendt said Tuesday. ``I just didn't think
subliminal advertising was in the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Berendt and his wife, Beth, saw the ad as they
were having breakfast. There was a quick flash on the screen that
made him suspicious. He sent a staff member to Greenup's home, who
watched the ad frame by frame in the writer's living room.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Berendt's wife recorded the ad, did her own analysis
and came up with the same conclusion as Greenup.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the ad was soon on its way to Gore headquarters
in Nashville, then to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Greenup hopes the controversy he sparked does some good. Just
maybe, he said, people who create political ads ``will be more
responsive to the good sense of the electorate'' the next time they
try to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making too much out of this,'' he said of his sudden
fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be in, then I'll be out.''

N.J. BLACK BEAR HUNT IS CANCELED AFTER THE GOVERNOR INTERVENES
</HEADLINE>
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ New Jersey's first black bear hunt since 1970
was canceled on Tuesday as the state agency that sets hunting rules
acceded, with some unwillingness, to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's
wishes and voted narrowly to ban it.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman asked the agency, the Fish and Game Council, for the
cancellation on Friday, and she prevailed on Tuesday, but not
before dissidents on the council who favored the hunt nearly
inflicted a blow to her powers of persuasion. The vote for
cancellation was 6-4, the minimum needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it more as a political decision than a wildlife
management decision,'' one of the four dissenters, George P.
Howard, said after the vote. He said the council traditionally
drafted hunting regulations based on scientific analysis of the
need to control the growth of various species. This time, he said,
growing opposition to hunting in the state prompted the council to
cancel the bear hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bear problem is just going to get worse,'' he said.
``Until we reduce them, we're going to have more and more
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the vote suggested that the dissidents took a dim
view of the governor's request. Over the years, the council _ an
obscure, part-time panel with unpaid members _ has enacted the
state's hunting regulations with little political interference. But
a coalition opposed to hunting mounted a campaign after the council
first proposed the bear hunt in March.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman finally asked the council on Friday to acknowledge the
opposition and ban the hunt. The council, at her request, had
already unanimously voted to cut the number of bears to be killed
from 350 to 175.
</P>
<P>
   The split vote on Tuesday also suggested that the council's
dissenters saw little wisdom in Whitman's counterproposal for a
bear-control plan aimed only at killing bears that break into
homes, attack pets, kill livestock or threaten people. Eliminating
the most aggressive bears, Whitman said on Friday, was a better
public-safety measure than a random hunt.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, the council's chairman, John W. Bradway, one
of the six members voting for the ban, issued a statement
expressing hope that the governor's new plan ``will help address
bear safety problems in the near future.'' But Bradway said it was
too early to know if the plan would be sufficient to address the
steadily increasing numbers of conflicts between humans and bears.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement, the governor thanked the council for
changing its position on the hunt, which was to start Monday. One
element of her plan requires state wildlife agents to teach local
police how to euthanize the most dangerous bears. Routinely, as the
state's black bear population has grown from near extinction in
1971 to an estimated 1,000 now, local police have done little more
than refer complaints to wildlife agents.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Tuesday
that the new plan called for spending $1 million in coming months
to double the size of the state's bear-control unit to 14 agents
and provide extra equipment for euthanizing.
</P>
<P>
   Although leaders of the anti-hunt coalition were overjoyed by
the cancellation on Tuesday, some residents questioned whether the
governor's plan would work.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Goldsworthy of Lafayette, a small Sussex County town,
whose two pet goats were killed by bears in March 1999, said she
doubted that local police would be effective against bears. ``All
my attacks happened at night,'' she said. ``By the time you call
the police and they get out here, the bears are gone.''

LINDA GREY, 54, PUBLISHER WHO LED BALLANTINE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Linda Grey, a top publishing executive who rose from
editorial assistant to president and publisher of Ballantine
Publishing Group, died on Aug. 30. She was 54 and lived in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Alun Davies,
a friend of Grey's.
</P>
<P>
   Grey resigned from her position at Ballantine last February
during a reorganization of the company that came more than a year
after the media conglomerate Bertelsmann moved to acquire
Ballantine's parent, Random House.
</P>
<P>
   She got her start in publishing in 1970 as an editorial
assistant at Coward McCann &AMP; Geoghegan. Later she rose to become
managing editor there and then took executive positions at Dell
Publishing Co., where she was its editor in chief. In 1981 she
moved to Bantam Books as an editorial director and became its
publisher and editor in chief in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   She left that position in 1992 to start her own short-lived
imprint for the company, Linda Grey Books, which published just one
book, ``It Doesn't Take a Hero: The Autobiography of General Norman
H. Schwarzkopf.'' The imprint was dissolved the same year after the
announcement that Grey was resigning to become president and
publisher of Ballantine Publishing Group.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her career Grey worked with best-selling authors like
Schwarzkopf, Lee Iacocca, , Shirley MacLaine, Judith Krantz and
Robert Ludlum and the suspense writers Michael Palmer and John
Saul. Alberto Vitale, her longtime boss as the chief executive at
Bantam Doubleday Dell and later Random House, often described Grey
as a ``tremendously good editor.''
</P>
<P>
   After her resignation from Ballantine Publishing Group, Grey,
who was unmarried, essentially retired from the publishing
industry, although she continued to counsel authors who were her
close friends.

SUPERDOME UNIX SERVERS CRUCIAL TO HP 
 &HT;     BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Hoping to expand its share of the lucrative and
fast-growing market for e-business hardware, Hewlett-Packard rolled
out a new line of high-end Unix servers Tuesday that it says
leapfrogs the best available from rivals like Sun Microsystems and
IBM.
<P>
   Known as the HP 9000 Superdome series, the new machines are
designed for large dot-com businesses and service providers, as
well as conventional corporate data processing.
</P>
<P>
   The new models won't come cheap: Prices start at $1 million, not
counting the software packages HP, and its partners will offer for
such applications as e-commerce, billing and ``customer
relationship management.''
</P>
<P>
   But HP, calling Superdome, without qualification, ``the fastest
server in the Unix market,'' said it will be a bargain compared
with the mainframes customers would previously have needed to get
equivalent performance, reliability and flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The first Superdome systems will run HP's version of the Unix
operating system, HP-UX, on the PA-RISC 8600, the latest in its
line of proprietary processors for servers and workstations.
Initial configurations, offering twice the performance of HP's
previous high-end servers, will have 32 of the high-performance
chips; a 64-chip version will be offered later.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's 4-year-old E10000 line doesn't deliver the performance
that many of today's e-business customers would like, said Lee
Kroon, an analyst for the Andrews Consulting Group of Cheshire,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Kroon said IBM's S80, a high-end server series introduced last
year, did ``incredibly well,'' with sales topping 1,000 systems
during the first 90 days after the introduction. ``I expect a
similar experience with Superdome,'' Kroon said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kurt King, an analyst at Banc of America Securities in San
Francisco, was less impressed with HP's performance claims. ``It
would be shocking if a major server vendor introduced new products
that didn't outperform their competitors' old products. Everybody
always outperforms everybody else when they set the standard of
measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   HP is generally ranked second in revenues from Unix servers,
after Sun and ahead of IBM. New models from Sun have been delayed
pending release of the UltraSPARC III, the company's
next-generation processor, which is nearly a year behind schedule.
But the new chip is expected to appear in low-end and midrange
servers this fall and in new high-end models early next year.
</P>
<P>
   During the second half of 2002, HP will offer Superdome users
the option of switching to Intel's impending ``IA-64'' or Itanium
processors, which HP helped design. The timetable implies that HP
will pass on the first IA-64 chip, known by the code name Merced,
and wait for its successor, code-named McKinley, which according to
Intel will deliver higher performance.
</P>
<P>
   By switching to IA-64, users will get additional
operating-system options. Superdome machines with the new Intel
chips will support Windows and Linux as well as HP-UX _ or even all
three simultaneously, via mainframe-style schemes that enable users
to partition the machine into separate hardware and software
environments.
</P>
<P>
   King, however, called the IA-64 option ``more an insurance
policy for their customers than anything else.'' There has been
concern among many HP server customers, he said, that the company
will eventually ``pull the plug'' on its proprietary RISC chips.
</P>
<P>
   Kroon also warned that switching processors ``won't be a walk in
the park'' for customers, even though HP says IA-64 chips will be
compatible with many applications written for the older HP chip
family. ``There's a lot of marketing hype in these claims,'' he
said. ``Whenever you change CPUs, there are always a lot of caveats
and considerations. If I were an HP customer, I'd be asking some
very pointed questions about how this transition is supposed to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Banc of America's King last month lowered his rating on HP
shares from ``strong buy'' to ``buy,'' primarily, he said, because
of the ``lack of momentum'' in the company's Unix sales.
</P>
<P>
   HP disputes that assessment of its current market position, but
it is clearly counting on Superdome to erase all doubts. In
addition to the new machines' performance, the Palo Alto giant is
emphasizing its commitment to service and support, including
assignment of an HP ``solution manager'' to each Superdome
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street responded coolly to HP's announcement: The company's
shares were off $1.44 to close at $112.56.
</P>
<P>
   HP will also offer ``utilitylike'' pricing plans, under which
customers will pay only for the computing capacity they actually
use. That option, according to analyst Kroon, ``will have very
significant appeal to anyone in e-business, because capacity needs
are very unpredictable for businesses that are open to the world
7/24.''
</P>
<P>
   King agreed that ``HP is doing the things that customers in the
e-business market want to see,'' but added that ``the bad news is
that there's not a lot here that competitors can't easily
replicate.'' Both Sun and IBM have already promised similarly
flexible pricing plans.

FERRY FIRM, STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL AGREE ON COMPLAINT SETTLEMENT  &HT;     BY PETER SINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ The California attorney general Tuesday disclosed
the settlement of an antitrust and unfair-competition complaint
against the Blue &AMP; Gold Fleet.
<P>
   The San Francisco cruise and ferry service was charged in San
Francisco Superior Court with allegedly tying the sale of popular
tickets to Alcatraz Island to purchases of other San Francisco Bay
cruises operated by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Blue &AMP; Gold denied any wrongdoing, saying it never engaged in
the alleged activities. However, it agreed to a permanent
injunction against so-called ``unlawful tie-in sales'' and will
offer specific training to sales staff to avoid future problems.
</P>
<P>
   Blue &AMP; Gold also agreed to send a copy of the complaint and
judgment to its tour operator customers and pay $10,000 to the
state Department of Justice to cover the attorney general's
investigation and attorney fees.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement, Blue &AMP; Gold President Ron Duckhorn said
the allegations were off-base. ``This has never been our practice
or policy nor have we operated our business in any inappropriate
way.'' He added that the goal of settling this suit ``quickly and
efficiently'' was to ``put to rest these questions'' and to get on
with business.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BLUEGOLD () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Deputy Attorney General John Donhoff Jr. had a different take on
the settlement. ``We have evidence that firms that wanted good
blocks of tickets for resale to Alcatraz were required to buy
(other) bay cruises from Blue &AMP; Gold, or things would change for
them in an adverse way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that the state attorney general's
office has acted to preserve competition on the bay. Three years
ago, it objected when Crowley Maritime Corp. decided to sell its 11
Red &AMP; White tour boats, ferry service license, bay cruise routes,
Alcatraz service contract and packaged-bus-tour business to Blue &AMP;
Gold.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a consent decree to prevent a monopoly, Blue &AMP; Gold
agreed to sell the Red &AMP; White name and three of its ferryboats to
Tom Escher, grandson of the Crowley Maritime founder.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the latest dispute are high. Each year, Alcatraz
attracts more than 1 million visitors. Because walk-up sales for
same-day departures to the former federal prison are often
impossible to obtain, visitors frequently pay three or more times
the $12.25 fixed price of the Alcatraz trip and self-guided audio
tour to companies who package the Alcatraz visit with other tours.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of BLUEGOLD () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Despite the attorney general's latest action, Blue &AMP; Gold's legal
troubles involving access to Alcatraz are not finished. Two small
Fisherman's Wharf tour operators last year accused Blue &AMP; Gold of
violating equal-access provisions of its park service contract by
giving more-favorable treatment to big tour companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Sears' A American Tours and Elric Leano's San Francisco
Magical Mystery Tours charge that Blue &AMP; Gold repeatedly gave
preferential treatment to their biggest wholesale customers,
including advance ticket allocations, the most-popular departure
times and, in the case of Tower Tours, exclusive permission to
return unsold tickets. A mediation meeting is set for Nov. 6 with a
trial scheduled for Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Blue &AMP; Gold competitor Red &AMP; White Fleet was pleased
with Tuesday's legal action. ``The judgment speaks for itself,''
said Red &AMP; White President Tom Escher. ``All we're looking for is a
level playing field.''

PG&AMP;E CHIEF WANTS RATE INCREASES 
 &HT;     BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In an invitation-only meeting with Wall Street analysts, the chief
executive of PG&AMP;E Corp. said he wants to raise electricity rates as
quickly as possible to pass along billions of dollars in extra
power costs to ratepayers, participants told The Chronicle.
<P>
   It was the most explicit declaration to date of the company's
intentions as California lawmakers, regulators and utility
customers grapple with the increasingly murky outlook for
deregulation of the state's energy market.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E Chief Executive Officer Robert Glynn told analysts in New
York on Monday that the company will attempt to pass along more
than $2 billion in unforeseen costs when a current freeze on
electricity rates is lifted in early 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While PG&AMP;E's meeting with financial analysts was intended to
focus on a wide range of issues, recent developments in California
prompted Glynn to devote almost an hour to explaining his company's
goals for the state.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's PG&AMP;E Corp. is the parent company of Pacific Gas
and Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glynn said the company is entitled to recover all the money it
spent buying power for customers,'' said Peggy Jones, an analyst at
Prudential Securities who attended the briefing. ``He said it would
be best to raise electricity rates and to do so very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   A rate increase is precisely what California utility customers
were told would not happen as a result of a deregulated power
market. Increased competition, it was said, would result in rate
cuts for most customers.
</P>
<P>
   But surging wholesale electricity prices have caused utilities
like PG&AMP;E to swallow hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses by
not being able to pass along their costs to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The one California utility that has had its rate freeze lifted,
San Diego Gas &AMP; Electric, was the target of widespread protests
after average customer bills more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to calls for relief from San Diego politicians and
ratepayers, the state Public Utilities Commission last week
approved an emergency rate cap for the city, effectively halting
deregulation in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, PG&AMP;E officials told The Chronicle that their
costs under the rate freeze continue to grow by about $700 million
a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glynn's position is that he would favor raising rates as
quickly as possible, above where they are today,'' Jones said.
``The message I heard is that the company intends to strike the
best deal it can to recover costs from customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer activists were dismayed to learn that PG&AMP;E's top
executive has come out so strongly on the issue of passing along
costs to ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Jacobson, consumer program director for the California
Public Interest Research Group in Sacramento, noted that PG&AMP;E was
one of the prime architects of the state's deregulation blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be PG&AMP;E that eats the costs because they made the
initial promise that rates would go down,'' he said. ``Consumers
are being ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San
Francisco, agreed that PG&AMP;E took its chances with deregulation and
should not be allowed to subsequently stick customers with the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loaded the dice and, unfortunately, it didn't work,'' she
said. ``But it's not consumers' fault it didn't work. It's not
consumers' responsibility to bail them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn's trip to New York was intended in large part to reassure
heavyweight institutional investors that PG&AMP;E will not be left
holding the bag for the more than $2 billion in unforeseen
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which slipped 69 cents Tuesday to $30.94,
is hovering near its 52-week high. Glynn wants to prevent investors
from growing nervous about PG&AMP;E's prospects.

   ``His message to Wall Street was that they've got $2 billion to
recover and they're going to recover it, which was the right thing
to say to investors,'' said Greg Gordon, an analyst with Goldman
Sachs who also attended Monday's briefing.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts still expect PG&AMP;E to seek a compromise whereby
it would share its financial burden with customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to persuade shareholders and customers that they
will come up with a middle-of-the-road solution that will be good
for everyone,'' said Danielle Seitz, an analyst with UBS Warburg.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E spokesman Greg Pruett said Glynn hinted to the analysts
that such a settlement could be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reiterated that the main thing we're focused on is working
with regulators to find a solution that's fair to all parties,''
Pruett said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Glynn had been scheduled to speak today at an
energy-industry conference in New York sponsored by Merrill Lynch,
Pruett said the PG&AMP;E chief decided to skip the event and fly back
to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He said Glynn had returned to work on the deregulation issue,
but could not say whether any meetings are scheduled for this week
with regulators or legislators.

THE GREAT RESTAURANT EXODUS 
 &HT;     BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ The dot-com revolution is drawing hordes of new
office workers to San Francisco's Financial District _ but where
are they going to eat?
<P>
   Several big-name restaurants in the neighborhood have either
shut down or are about to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason: A space squeeze caused in large part by
cash-rich dot-com companies competing for elbowroom in one of the
tightest real-estate markets in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues, a lot of dot-com millionaires could be
forced to prepare brown-bag lunches each morning before leaving
their luxury penthouses on Nob Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Among the popular, flourishing Financial District restaurants
that have closed or soon will:
</P>
<P>
   _ Occidental Grill, which occupies the first floor of a building
at 453 Pine St. and is being evicted next month by the owner,
Shorenstein Co. The building _ along with others on the block _ is
being torn down and will be replaced by an office tower.
</P>
<P>
   _ Murphy's Exchange, which occupies the second floor of the
building housing the Occidental Grill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barcelona, at 7 Spring St., which couldn't afford a huge rent
increase. It is closing its doors forever at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jack's, at 615 Sacramento St. Owner John Konstin succumbed to
an exorbitant $5 million offer from a real-estate developer for the
three-story building. The restaurant will close during December.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Post, owner of the 113-seat Occidental Grill, which has
occupied the Pine Street location for seven years, says he has a
deal in the works to reopen at an undisclosed site in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He had been paying a relatively modest $7,000 monthly rent for
the 2,400-square-foot premises, but he won't disclose his rent on
the new place.
</P>
<P>
   Post is bitter about his eviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter Shorenstein simply doesn't have enough money,'' he
exclaimed sarcastically. ``This has to do with greed.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Shorenstein Co. said the company bought the
building early this year, and that both the Occidental Grill and
Murphy's Exchange had provisions in their leases allowing a new
owner to terminate the leases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has allowed them some slack, given them time to
wind up their affairs,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the 5-year-old, 245-seat Barcelona is ``sad _ we
put so much energy into the place,'' said the flamboyant owner,
Giovanni, who doesn't use his last name. ``I am known as Giovanni
the Margarita King,'' he said, ``even on my driver's license.''
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni said the restaurant is a magnet for celebrities _
notably rock-and-roller Bruce Springsteen and basketball immortal
Magic Johnson. It is ``so well known that you can't get a
reservation for Friday and Saturday nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni said Calfox, managing agent for the owners of the
building _ reportedly the Cahill family _ offered to renew the
lease, but at several times the current rent. (Giovanni declined to
disclose either figure.)
</P>
<P>
   Rather than open a restaurant elsewhere, Giovanni plans to start
a new business, marketing his patented margarita and tequila
recipes to other restaurants and to supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Aljoe, chief operating officer of Calfox, said that the
landlord's relationship with the Barcelona was very good, and that
the rent increase was ``strictly an economic decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial office space commands higher rents than retail space,
Aljoe said, so the restaurant probably will be converted to an
office. Several prospective tenants have expressed interest, he
remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Another restaurant in the area, the 300-seat Scott's Seafood
Grill and Bar, at 3 Embarcadero Center, almost had to pull up
stakes. But that tale has a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lease was up, and the new rent was so high we were going
to move to a site South of Market,'' said owner Paul Albert. But
some other major restaurants already had vacated the Embarcadero
complex, and ``the owner, Boston Properties, wanted us to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties negotiated a rent lower than the first offer, and
Scott's signed a new lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got lucky,'' Albert says.

MICROSOFT GETS MONGOMUSIC 
 &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Moving to bolster its reach into Internet music,
software giant Microsoft is buying MongoMusic Inc., a Redwood City
company that has developed music search and recommendation
technologies.
<P>
   In a deal that will be formally announced Wednesday, Microsoft
plans to make MongoMusic part of an evolving strategy to infuse
more music and digital entertainment content into sites like
MSN.com and WindowsMedia.com., said Bob Visse of MSN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Visse would not comment on
published reports that Microsoft is paying $65 million in stock for
the year-old MongoMusic.
</P>
<P>
   MongoMusic will move to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond,
Wash., and all 65 employees have agreed to move with the company,
said spokeswoman Colleen Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   Using programs like RadioMongo and the IntuitiveMusicSearch
System, MongoMusic users can find and listen to new music that fits
their taste.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Aram Sinnreich of Jupiter Communications Inc. said music
search and recommendation technology such as MongoMusic's is
becoming more valuable as the market for Internet music continues
to grow to a projected $1.5 billion by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft would very much like to have a major role as a
digital music service provider,'' Sinnreich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``MongoMusic has some very interesting technologies that can be
used as part of the backbone for an online music initiative,'' he
said. ``Typically, when Microsoft encounters technology like this
in a market that's growing, they buy it.''

BAY AREA'S ARTISAN BREAD RISING ACROSS THE NATION  &HT;     BY CAROL EMERT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ The Bay Area is rolling in artisan breads _ those
crusty, European-style loaves preferred by consumers who would
rather go hungry than eat presliced bread from a plastic bag.
<P>
   But not all Americans are so fortunate in their access to
crusty, paper-wrapped loaves. Even in large markets such as Los
Angeles, there are often only three or so artisan bakers, compared
with about a dozen in greater San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, even the most ambitious bakers have been confined to
trade areas no larger than 100 miles. That's because artisan breads
are too temperamental to travel far afield; after 24 hours or so,
the crust becomes overly chewy and the spongy interior begins to
dry out.
</P>
<P>
   But all that is changing, thanks to new applications of old
technologies (ovens and freezers) and an increasingly sophisticated
American palate that has boosted demand for good bread.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of artisan bakers around the country, including Bay
Area market leader Grace Baking, have begun shipping frozen,
slightly undercooked loaves to faraway restaurants and
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the line, these ``parbaked'' loaves are thawed and
``baked off'' for 10 to 15 minutes, producing loaves that even
purists admit can rival local breads in taste and texture.
</P>
<P>
   All this has sparked a hot debate in the insular and
serious-minded world of artisan bakers, many of whom consider
themselves more artists than businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, parbaking has created a vast market for
entrepreneurial bakers like Grace, which has recently begun
shipping frozen, parbaked bread to Monterey, Mendocino and
Sacramento as well as Reno and  &LR;   &LR; Hawaii. Grace will enter Los
Angeles later this month and is scouting out Portland, Ore.
(Grace's breads and pastries sold in the Bay Area are still baked
and delivered fresh daily.)
</P>
<P>
   A couple of ambitious artisan bakeries, including Los Angeles'
La Brea Baking, which pioneered parbaking, are shipping frozen
loaves across the country. La Brea's parbaked sourdough baguette
won a Chronicle Food section taste test three years ago against
five local competitors, including Grace, whose bread was fresh
baked.  &LR;   &LR; Brave New World
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a brave new world that we're into now,'' said Peter
Franklin, owner of PeterBread Consulting in Marblehead, Mass.
``There's a market out there (for parbaked bread) and a very viable
business model as well. But will it replace the corner bakery? For
the fabric of the country, I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace's foray into parbaking began about two years ago, when it
started selling its  &LR; pugliese &LR; , a rustic, Italian-style loaf, to
Sacramento's Corti Bros. grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   While most retailers buy a steady amount of fresh bread every
day, Corti was picking up huge shipments twice a month. An inquiry
by Grace revealed that Corti was freezing the pugliese, reheating
it in the store and selling the bread warm to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't work with most bread, but pugliese (which is
particularly durable) does fine,'' says Fred Doar, Grace's chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the opportunities in far-flung markets, Grace's
founder and head baker, Glenn Mitchell, developed a technique for
parbaking and freezing his breads. In April, Grace moved from its
small Albany headquarters into a mammoth new Richmond facility,
where it is gearing up for major expansion into parbaked goods.
</P>
<P>
   Doar, who worked for Nestle SA and Andersen Consulting earlier
in his career, expects Grace's sales to jump from $10 million in
1999 to more than $11 million this year and $30 million in 2005 as
the company spreads across the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to Doar's forecast, parbaked product will account for
60 &UR;  &LR; percent of Grace's total in five years. Today, parbaked goods
represent only 1 percent of Grace's sales, with 69 percent coming
from fresh-baked wholesale to retailers such as Whole Foods, Trader
Joe's and Costco, and 30 percent generated at four retail locations
in Albany, Corte Madera, Oakland and San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is also experimenting with parbaked breads that can be
sold directly to consumers from supermarket freezer sections,
without being baked by retailers first.
</P>
<P>
   The company is even contemplating a step previously unheard of
in artisan baking: a public stock offering. If Grace continues to
meet its growth forecasts, Doar foresees an IPO in two years.
</P>
<P>
   While traditionalists argue that parbaked breads lack the
specialness of their fresh counterparts, Mitchell contends that
parbaked quality can actually exceed that of fresh goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're baking better breads than ever before,'' said Mitchell,
a former pastry chef at San Francisco's Hotel Meridien who founded
Grace in Oakland's Rockridge district in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   That's because parbaked goods are sold in large orders that can
be made with high-capacity, automated equipment. While it may seem
counterintuitive, Mitchell, Franklin and others agree that
state-of-the-art automation can be gentler and more reliable than
human bakers, resulting in lighter and more-consistent loaves.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Better-Shaped Loaves
</P>
<P>
   Grace, for example, uses an 80-foot-long Italian oven for its
parbaked products. As many as 3,000 loaves at a time sit on a
conveyor belt and move through compartments where baking and
steaming times are programmed (steam helps produce a nice crust).
</P>
<P>
   The automated oven largely eliminates over- and undercooking, a
danger when humans are responsible for pulling the bread out at
just the right time, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace also uses a dough-shaping machine to turn out same-size
loaves
</P>
<P>
   but maintain the irregular appearance prized by lovers of
artisan bread. The machine was imported from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get 10 people to hand roll 10 baguettes exactly the
same,'' said Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's expansion has helped make the entrepreneurial bakery a
better business partner, said Adriano Paganini, who sells Grace's
pugliese at his 14 local Pasta Pomodoro restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to be difficult to deal with because they were
small,'' said Paganini. ``You had to order well in advance and they
couldn't always fill orders. Now it's totally different,'' with
Grace even developing a special pugliese for Pasta Pomodoro to use
as sandwich bread.
</P>
<P>
   Paganini, a native of Italy, said he may ship Grace's parbaked
pugliese to restaurants in other markets as Pasta Pomodoro expands
beyond the Bay Area. ``To me, it's one of the best (artisan breads)
around,'' he said. ``I eat it at home all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Paganini dismissed criticism that progressive ideas such as
expansion and parbaking can take the magic out of artisan bread. He
has heard the same doubts as he moves Pasta Pomodoro toward a
national expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to identify the values that allowed you
to be successful in the first place and be able to preserve
those,'' Paganini said.
</P>
<P>
   But to traditionalists, parbaking is, if not sacrilege, at least
something of a shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, (parbaking) departs conceptually from the notion of
somebody who is devoted to his or her craft expressing, to the best
of his or her ability, the results of that craft,'' said Steve
Sullivan, co-founder of Berkeley's Acme Bread Co.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan acknowledges that parbaked breads can be very good and
in some cases may even taste fresher than fresh-baked bread. For
example, fresh bread is typically baked during the middle of the
night, many hours before it is served, whereas parbaked bread can
be thawed and reheated at a restaurant just in time for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But parbaking has its drawbacks, including bread drying out more
quickly than bread that hasn't been frozen and reheated, Sullivan
said. Also, if a shipment winds up thawing on a loading dock and is
later refrozen, the quality suffers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tasted (La Brea's) parbaked lines at trade shows,'' said
Sullivan. ``With Nancy (founder Nancy Silverton) standing there and
taking the bread out of the oven at just the right moment, it can
be wonderful. But that's not going to happen in every
circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Opportunities are Rising
</P>
<P>
   Doar acknowledged that Grace has experienced some
disappointments, such as supermarket customers overcooking the
parbaked breads. But all in all, the quality is quite good, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for growth-oriented artisan bakers are rising
every day, said Ed Lee, editor of Modern Baking magazine.
</P>
<P>
   While there are too many small bakeries to make an accurate
tally of sales for the sector, crusty breads are believed to be the
fastest-growing category of baked goods, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, particularly those who are well traveled, are
increasingly interested in European-style bread, he said. ``And
certainly more discretionary income over the last 15 years hasn't
hurt, either. People are willing to spend $2.50 to $5 for a loaf of
bread.''
</P>
<P>
   One question on the minds of bread bakers is whether the new
breed of artisan bakers like Grace will put smaller local guys out
of business.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, whose bakery generated about $8 million in sales last
year, doesn't think so. He sees parallels with another alleged
threat to bakers back in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out in 1983 and bread machines came out the next
year,'' Sullivan said. ``I thought, `Oh great, we just spent all
this money and people are going to be doing their own.' But that
just didn't happen.''

SUPER BOWL FUMBLE BY DOT-COM COULD TURN INTO OLYMPIC GOLD  &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Blowing your advertising wad on the Super Bowl was a winning
strategy for dot-com companies in 1999, but a bad call in 2000.
<P>
   A study by Thomas Weisel Partners shows that none of the
publicly held Internet-related companies that advertised on this
year's Super Bowl has seen its stock price increase since the NFL
championship aired Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The most ``successful'' was E-Trade, whose shares had slumped
only 13 percent as of Friday. E-Trade aired three spots, including
one of the funniest with a man being rushed through the emergency
room because he had money coming out the wazoo.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in three Super Bowl advertisers _ Healtheon/WebMD,
Kforce.com and MicroStrategy _ are down more than 70 percent.
During the same period, the Dow Jones composite Internet index was
off 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 private companies that advertised, two managed to go
public, but their stocks have fallen like a bad punt _ Pets.com is
down 91 percent since its first-day close, Netpliance is down 82
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the private companies are still private and one _
Epidemic.com _ failed to secure a second round of financing and
threw in the towel in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, only two dot-com ads appeared on the Super Bowl _
Monster.com and Hotjobs.com. Those are the two major online
recruiting sites today,'' says Weisel analyst Perry Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, nearly 20 percent of the 61 television spots
were gobbled up by Net companies, which paid $2.2 million on
average for a 30-second spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was clutter,'' Boyle says. But he doesn't call it
an unmitigated disaster. Although all of the advertisers' stocks
are down, some aren't down nearly as much as their peers.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade stock has outperformed Ameritrade, TD Waterhouse, Schwab
and DLJdirect.
</P>
<P>
   EDS, the information-technology consulting firm that ran the
humorous ``herding cats,'' commercial, has done better than
competitors Scient and Viant, but worse than Sapient.
</P>
<P>
   Hotjobs.com, down 31 percent, ``has definitely outperformed
Kforce (another Super Bowl advertiser) Topjobs.net and
Headhunter.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com, which advertised again this year, is part of TMP
Worldwide. It's reportedly searching for a new advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   MINDING THE OLYMPICS: Ironically, Boyle says the company that
has done the best, relative to its peers, is LifeMinders.com. This
company aired the self-proclaimed ``Worst Ad on the Super Bowl.''
And it was, according to some surveys.
</P>
<P>
   It advertised ``highly personalized e-mail'' in typewriter
script against a yellow background while ``Chopsticks'' played in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   LifeMinders stock is down 38 percent, but Boyle thinks it could
get a big boost from the Sydney Olympics, which start Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company does what is known as ``permission marketing'' or
``opt-in e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   It has about 18 million members who have registered to receive
weekly e-mails with content personalized to their interests, such
as gardening, movies or pets. The e-mails, which look like Web
pages, are free, but they're surrounded by (surprise!) paid
advertising. It sends simpler messages to wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer games, the Herndon, Va., company will send
daily, personalized e-mail updates to users who register through
the official Olympic Web site,  &LR; www.olympics.com.  &LR; Users can choose
which events, athletes or teams they want to read about.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which runs the official Olympic site, ``has estimated that
10 million to 30 million people will sign up for these e-mails,''
Boyle says.
</P>
<P>
   These people won't automatically become LifeMinders members, but
they can choose to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're estimating that 1 million to 2 million will stick,''
says Lisa Haas, an analyst with Wit Soundview.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're at 18 million members now. We estimate they'll have
19.5 million'' at the end of the third quarter. ``That's slightly
ahead of (company) guidance. If they come out at the end of the
third quarter and greatly exceed membership estimates, that'll be a
positive'' for the stock, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle points out that America Online has only 23 million
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   LifeMinders doesn't get any subscription revenues, like AOL
does. But it does get about $4 per member per year in advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle estimates that the company will generate $60 million in
revenue this year and break even during the first quarter of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he says, the company can generate $10 or more in
revenue per customer by selling its own products such as credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Its biggest challenge is the same one facing all e-media
companies, ``bringing traditional advertisers into the new-media
world.''
</P>
<P>
   A slowdown in the growth of Internet advertising has hurt all
dot-com stocks lately, even the big ones like Yahoo and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``But LifeMinders has an advantage,'' Boyle says. ``It has a
very demonstrable superior response rates at a lower cost than the
portals.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas agrees. ``We like the fact that LifeMinders has scale. It
has permission or consent from 18 million members. A lot of
companies are having weakness in online advertising. We think
e-mail is a better platform long term.''
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER WEB-AD WARNING? Internet bulls are quick to point out
that the absolute level of Internet advertising is not declining,
merely the rate of growth. But a report issued this week calls that
into question.
</P>
<P>
   AdZone Interactive reported that U.S. Internet advertising
during August fell 7.6 percent, to $1.41 billion, from $1.54
billion during July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first month-to-month decline this year. The dip
could be seasonal; August is generally a weak advertising month.
There's no comparison because AdZone only started tracking Web
advertising in January.
</P>
<P>
   AdZone Chief Executive Officer Charles Cardona points out that
July was a particularly strong month: estimated Web ad revenues
jumped 21 percent from June.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, which he says is a couple of years behind the United
States, Internet advertising continued to grow during August,
reaching $109 million, up 11 percent from July.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say AdZone's survey is flawed because it doesn't measure
actual ad expenditures. It monitors Web site advertising and uses
standard rate cards to estimate revenues. Even so, it's worth
noting.

CHARITY BEGINS ON THE NET 
 &HT;     BY PETER SINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Charity has been in the headlines lately.
<P>
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney got some heat
for giving just 1 percent of his $20.7 million income over the past
decade to charity. Conversely, the graduate business program of the
University of California at Berkeley got kudos for saying it would
offer an innovative class on ``Contemporary Philanthropy'' to MBA
students this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are naturally more intent on earning money and
investing it than on giving it away.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts say entrepreneurs and others can well afford to
pay more attention to philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, several new tools and Web services can help you
assess how much you can afford to give and make the process
simpler.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's NewTithing Group unveiled its online
philanthropic budgeting tool last week at a ``Sharing the Wealth''
summit in St. Paul, Minn., organized by Minnesota Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Using NewTitheCalc, users can securely and quickly enter
financial data such as investment income, investment assets, earned
income and living expenses and quickly explore affordable giving
levels and check how changes in their finances can affect their
giving wherewithal. (For information on the conference and the
interactive calculator, visit  &LR; access.mpr.org/civicj/giving &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   ``This tool can change the way people think about affordable
giving by helping them budget for charity each year instead of
simply reacting to solicitations,'' says former money manager
Claude Rosenberg, who founded the nonprofit NewTithing Group to
inspire Americans to think more, and differently, about
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Many people consider giving based on their income. Some churches
ask members to tithe a fixed percentage, sometimes 10 percent, of
their annual income. But Rosenberg argues that excluding asset
wealth from investments and inheritance is ``outdated, outmoded and
basically unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley alone, approximately 64 new millionaires are
created every business day. If each of them gave 1 percent of that
wealth to charity, there would be $3.2 million going into
philanthropic endeavors each week. Rosenberg figures that Americans
can afford to be far more generous if they base their giving on
their wealth rather than their income.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, total giving by individuals in the United States was
more than $143 billion a year. But NewTithing estimates the total
could go up additional $244 billion, with all but $27 billion of
that coming from individuals in the three highest tax brackets who
receive more than $200,000 in annual income.
</P>
<P>
   NewTithing Executive Vice President Tim Stone says that the 1.4
million American tax filers with income of $200,000 to $499,000 who
now donate an average of $7,251 a year could afford to give an
average of $30,500 without deviating from their financial goals or
lowering living standards.
</P>
<P>
   If appreciated assets are involved, he notes the net cost could
be as little as $13,630, given the benefits of deducting charitable
contributions from state and federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is worth $13 trillion or more,'' says
Rosenberg, ``and high-net-worth individuals own a great deal of
that.'' Indeed, the approximately 110,000 Americans who earn more
than $800,000 a year have average investment assets of about $21
million.
</P>
<P>
   GIVING THROUGH WORK: San Francisco's CoreMatter, formerly called
AllCharities, is on the verge of announcing the first four Fortune
1,000 companies that will offer Internet-based ``e-Giving'' service
to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some employee-giving programs, CoreMatter guarantees that
100 percent of donated funds reach the designated charities, and
its online service lets employees choose from 670,000 nonprofit
organizations. Donors can contribute appreciated securities as well
as cash. They can also use their credit cards to make onetime or
regular donations or set up a contributions plan through payroll
deductions.
</P>
<P>
   David Scholtz, founder and CEO of the year-old startup, says
American households give an average of about $1,200, or 1.8 percent
of income, to charities each year. The goal of CoreMatter
 &LR; (www.all &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR; charities.com &LR; ) is to make it easier for employees of large
organizations to contribute and expand their choices and payment
options. It also lets companies and employees track matching
contributions and time spent on volunteer activities.
</P>
<P>
   CoreMatter's clients, including high-tech, consumer product and
financial service companies, will pay for these new employee
services.
</P>

and  &LR; www.matchgift.com &LR; .

<TEXT>
<P>
   Herbert Friedman, a pioneer in X-ray astronomy who received some
of the country's top scientific honors over a 60-year career, died
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was 84 and lived in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific scientist who published about 300 papers, Friedman
conducted his earliest research after World War II, putting
experiments aboard V-2 rockets sent into the upper atmosphere,
where instruments could record X-rays and other radiation emanating
from the sun. Later measurements were done on satellites. His work
resulted in the discovery of the first X-ray sources outside the
solar system, and was used to study aspects of the theory of black
holes and neutron stars.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in
1960, and was awarded the National Science Medal, the nation's top
scientific prize, in 1968. In 1987, with Bruno Rossi and Riccardo
Gianconi, he received the Wolf Prize in Physics, one of the most
prestigious, for his ``important contributions to the rapidly
growing field of extrasolar X-ray astronomy.''
</P>
<P>
   He owned 50 patents and wrote several books, including ``The
Amazing Universe'' (National Geographic Society, 1975).
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Friedman was born in 1916 in Brooklyn. His passion
during childhood was painting and sketching, and it was his plan to
major in art when he enrolled at Brooklyn College in 1932. But in
his junior year, inspired by a professor, he switched to physics.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a doctorate in physics from Johns Hopkins
University in 1940, Friedman joined the Naval Research Laboratory
in Washington, where he began studying the crystal structure of
metals using X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   A mentor, E.O. Hulburt, encouraged him to apply his interest in
X-rays to astronomy. By the early 1950s, using X-ray detectors on
rockets, Friedman was making seminal contributions to solar
astronomy, discovering, for example, that X-rays, and not
ultraviolet rays, were the principal cause of communications
disturbances during solar flares.
</P>
<P>
   He later studied X-ray sources outside the solar system. In
1964, he discovered X-rays from the Crab Nebula, the remains of a
supernova explosion in Earth's galaxy, a measurement that Freeman
J. Dyson, a theoretical physicist at the Institute for Advanced
Studies in Princeton, N.J., called ``the most brilliant achievement
of the sounding-rocket era.'' In 1968, he obtained the first
evidence of X-ray pulses from a neutron star, or pulsar, in the
Crab Nebula.
</P>
<P>
   According to Frederick Seitz, past president of the National
Academy of Sciences, Friedman's first paper on X-ray stars was
accepted with great reluctance by Physical Review, the top physics
journal.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists soon came around to recognizing Friedman's
contributions, Seitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman is survived by his wife of 60 years, Gertrude; two
sons, Jon, of Manhattan and Paul, of Washington; and three
grandchildren.

<P>
   Malcolm K. Hughes, a former editor in chief of United Press
International, died on Monday in Arlington, Va. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, known as Mike, had stomach cancer, UPI reported.
</P>
<P>
   Born of British parents in India, he served in the Royal Air
Force and was hired by what is now UPI in London as a teletype
operator in 1956. He rose through the agency's ranks as a sports
writer and editor, becoming executive sports editor in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes went to Washington as vice president and general manager
of UPI's international division. He was executive vice president
and editor in chief from 1984 to 1986, when he resigned in a
dispute with UPI's owners over administration of the financially
troubled agency.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes became an associate director of the American Press
Institute in Reston, Va., and retired in 1992 because of ill
health.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Morfydd, known as Nicky; a daughter,
Christine Dian of London; a brother; and a sister.

$45 MILLION PRICE TAG TO REFORM LAPD &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - After six months of closed-door negotiations and
briefings, the Los Angeles City Council publicly debated the
proposed federal court consent decree for LAPD for the first time
Tuesday - and its potential $45 million a year in added costs.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney James Hahn, a key negotiator, strongly recommended
that the city submit to oversight of the police by a federal judge
and monitor, arguing the Los Angeles Police Department cannot be
successfully defended against charges of systematic violation of
civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what has happened in the Rampart Division, I don't
believe we would stand a chance of winning a federal lawsuit,''
said Hahn, a candidate for mayor. ``And the Department of Justice
has made it clear that without us agreeing to this, they are
prepared to file in federal court.''
</P>
<P>
   A bare council majority voiced support for agreeing to the
consent decree, but with four members opposed and Council President
John Ferraro ill, the decision could depend on Valley Councilmen
Joel Wachs and Alex Padilla. They are undecided and both votes
would be needed to override a veto by Mayor Richard Riordan, who
opposes the consent decree as undermining city authority over the
LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   The council scheduled only one public hearing on the consent
decree and could push for a vote as early as next week. Wachs and
others called for a series of hearings around the city despite
federal threats to sue if the city failed to accept the consent
decree oversight by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Some council members questioned the rush to sign the consent
decree and Hahn's unwillingness to defend LAPD in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win if you don't try,'' said Councilman Hal Bernson,
who voiced concerns over agreeing to a consent decree as he cited
his experience as a member of the board of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, which is under such a court order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, you don't want a consent decree. If you agree to
this, you will regret it the rest of your lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the key concerns about the consent decree are the scope of
authority of the federal monitor, the duration of federal
oversight, how complaints against officers are investigated and the
reporting requirements to prevent officers from engaging in racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton said the consent decree
would cost $20 million to $35 million to implement, and $30 million
to $45 million annually to carry out - about half the cost of
operating the city's libraries, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Key expenses would be for a new computer system to track
complaints, an expanded internal affairs unit, a new audit office
under the chief of police as well as the costs of the federal
monitor and that staff.
</P>
<P>
   The council did not take action on the 84-page proposal, instead
scheduling a single public hearing at 10 a.m. Monday to begin going
through the specifics of the proposal. The council also put the
topic on its agenda for today, when it expects to hear from Bill
Lann Lee, the Los Angeles civil rights attorney who heads the
Justice Department's civil rights division.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs said more hearings are needed around the city to get more
public input, but no action was taken with members saying they
wanted to see how the proceedings developed.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly two-hour session, however, did show where council
members stand on the need for a consent decree - which has been
opposed by Riordan and Chief Bernard C. Parks, who prefer a
contract or memorandum of understanding that would not give the
federal government an ongoing role.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting a consent decree are council members Laura Chick,
Mike Feuer, Ruth Galanter, Jackie Goldberg, Mike Hernandez, Cindy
Miscikowski, Mark Ridley-Thomas and Rita Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing it are Bernson, Nate Holden, Nick Pacheco and Rudy
Svorinich. Wachs and Padilla are undecided. Council President
Ferraro has been ill and the date of his return to work is
uncertain, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said he was troubled by the costs of the reforms being
proposed and how they would affect other city programs. ``I know we
have to have some way to make sure the reforms are carried out, but
I don't know if we need to spend all this money and I want to know
the impact on other programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Svorinich said he felt the city had to maintain control of the
LAPD. ``When I was elected in 1993, it was to turn Los Angeles
around. Now, I'm being asked to turn over the LAPD. It doesn't seem
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden also questioned what the Justice Department was alleging.
``They say they've been looking at the LAPD for four years. Well,
why didn't they find out the problems in Rampart Division and
(former Officer Rafael) Perez. What are they doing about problems
in the FBI and INS? They should clean their own house first.''
</P>
<P>
   Miscikowski, who chairs the council's Public Safety Committee,
said what matters is to finally reform the LAPD. ``All of us carry
the responsibility for not seeing the reforms proposed in the past
were not put in place. The only reason not to do this is the sin of
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said deadlines for reforms are needed. ``This is like
when you were in college. If you didn't have a deadline, your term
papers would never have been turned in.''
</P>
<P>
   She argued that the city had repeatedly failed to deal with the
internal LAPD problems. ``It's the culture. It's the culture. It's
the culture. We have been trying to deal for years with the problem
of retaliation against those who report wrongdoing. Until we deal
with that, we will continue to have a code of silence.''

U.S. PROSECUTORS DENY SINGLING OUT MUSLIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The office of the chief federal prosecutor in
Manhattan strongly denounced criticism this week that it had
unfairly singled out Muslims during its broad investigation of
Osama bin Laden, whom the authorities believe masterminded the
bombings of two American embassies in East Africa in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Writing to a federal judge on Monday, the office of Mary Jo
White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York,
offered a blistering response to a defense lawyer's complaint that
the civil and political rights of Muslims were being chilled, and
that they were being ``relentlessly hounded by the unfettered
investigations'' by White's office and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand that those participating in the investigation and
prosecution never tarnish Muslims as a group with the sins of a
select few, and make prosecutive decisions based upon the conduct
of persons, not their religion,'' White's office wrote in a letter
to U.S. District Court Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The letter came as White's office filed a new indictment in the
terrorism case. The indictment charged a former taxi driver from
Orlando, Fla., with perjury and criminal contempt for refusing to
testify before a grand jury. The defendant, Ihab M. Ali, 38, had
been held on civil contempt charges for 16 months at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan for his refusal
to testify in May 1999. He has defended his position on religious
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing held last year, Ali said that the Koran taught
Muslims to do nothing that ``will cause harm to innocents.'' He
said testifying would be regarded as ``a betrayal of our beliefs as
Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to Patterson, White's office described Ali, a
naturalized American citizen, as a sworn member of al Qaeda, which
it says is a terrorist group led by bin Laden ``responsible for the
deaths of hundreds of innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Ronald L. Ellis
ordered Ali held without bail pending further proceedings. In the
brief hearing, Ali entered no plea. One of his lawyers, Ashraf W.
Nubani, said by phone that his client denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Sept. 4 letter from Nubani to Patterson, who had
originally ordered Ali sent to jail for civil contempt, that
prompted the reply from White's office.
</P>
<P>
   Nubani claimed that by imprisoning his client, the government
``has succeeded in making him a martyr to the Muslim community,''
and was harassing other Muslims who were ``peripheral and
irrelevant'' to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nubani also said that ``under the pretext'' of trying to solve
the embassy bombings, the government ``continues to stigmatize the
Muslim community, and chills members of that community from
enjoying their political and civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The response from White's office was written by Patrick J.
Fitzgerald, the lead prosecutor in the bin Laden investigation. He
said that Ali was questioned ``as a witness in an effort to solicit
truthful testimony from him to bring others to justice.''

REINPRECHT HELPING KINGS EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Steven Reinprecht was a finalist last
spring for the Hobey Baker Award, which is given to the top player
in college hockey. In his first NHL training camp, that gets him a
lot more hip checks than handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   What has gotten the attention of the Kings has been his work on
a line of Nelson Emerson and Jason Blake during the first five days
of camp. As a center on a team without its best center, Jozef
Stumpel, who is holding out in a contract dispute, that is a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a situation where a key player is missing, it is
critical to have the young guys perform right away,'' coach Andy
Murray said. ``You want the team to keep moving forward and don't
have time for a kid to make the transition from the college game.
Reinprecht has given us that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is particularly impressed with Reinprecht's speed and
instincts, but durability and consistency will be the ingredients
that help him make the team. Reinprecht will not replace Stumpel on
the first unit, but there is room in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, moving up another level, you have to push yourself
really hard,'' said Reinprecht, signed as a free agent last March
from the University of Wisconsin. ``They are bigger, stronger,
faster than in college. We worked hard there, but there wasn't as
much skating or weight training as here. I'll be in that weight
room a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinprecht, 24, did not reach the NHL in the conventional way.
He was scheduled to be drafted in 1996 but broke his right leg that
year. He wasn't drafted and played four years for Wisconsin before
coming to terms with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it worked out better for me this way,'' Reinprecht
said. ``Guys get drafted and often they aren't a good fit with
their new team. I had the chance to pick and choose where I wanted
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 26 goals and 66 points in 37 games for the Badgers
last year, Reinprecht played one game for the Kings. His real
education about the rigors ahead began with a two-month
conditioning camp here from late May to late July.
</P>
<P>
   In August, he and teammates Brad Chartrand, Joe Corvo and Joe
Rullier were sent to Prague in the Czech Republic to work out with
one of the top teams. For a kid who grew up in Edmonton watching
the great Oilers teams of Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier, it was a
different experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of speed and skill over there was incredible,''
Reinprecht said. ``Petr Nedved and Jan Hlavat (New York Rangers)
were there. They were very quick with great puck movement. We got
to skate hard for a couple of weeks and now we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinprecht knows there are no guarantees. Last year, when
Mattias Norstrom missed all of camp in a holdout, Jaroslav Modry
stepped in and was arguably the Kings' best defenseman. But
Norstrom signed the day before the regular season began and Modry
rarely played again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what my status is,'' Reinprecht said. ``All I can
do is keep working hard and see what happens.'' &QL;

METS BEAT BREWERS AND HOPE THEY`VE LEFT SLUMP BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It isn't easy to identify the moment a team shakes a
slump, New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine said Tuesday. Such
clarity usually comes a week later, when things have been going
well for a while. ``Sometimes it's a late-inning home run,''
Valentine said. ``Sometimes it's a first-inning bloop.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, perhaps, it's a bizarre series of misplays by a
hapless opponent. The Mets may not have stopped their slide by
punishing the Milwaukee Brewers last night, 10-2, but they did a
lot of things they had not done in a long time. The sight of Benny
Agbayani circling the bases in the second inning _ despite stopping
at first and sliding into second _ seemed to loosen a team that had
been uptight in losing 8 of 10 to start September.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored their first run when Brewers catcher Tyler
Houston threw away a sacrifice bunt by the Mets' starter, Bobby J.
Jones. With two runners on and one out, Agbayani laced a single to
center. Two runs scored, and the throw from Brewers center fielder
Lou Collier was well up the third base line.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani had stopped for a moment at first, and he chugged for
second as Houston fired to the bag. Agbayani slid as Houston's
throw sailed into center, where Collier picked it up as Agbayani
raced for home. He made it safely, beating Collier's throw and
Richie Sexson's relay, and the Mets had a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, meanwhile, was excellent, improving to 9-5 by allowing
two runs on seven hits and two walks in eight innings. The Mets'
offense, which had slumbered for 10 games, piled up runs for him
all night.
</P>
<P>
   Since a 13-3 victory over Arizona on Aug. 25, the Mets had
batted .200. They had 10 hits on Tuesday night for the first time
since then, and when Agbayani and Edgardo Alfonzo hit bases-empty
homers in the late innings, it made this the Mets' first game since
then with double-digit runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pratt and Kurt Abbott, making spot starts for the
struggling Mike Piazza and Mike Bordick, respectively, started the
Mets' second-inning rally. Pratt walked against John Snyder (3-9)
and advanced to second on a single by Abbott, his first hit since
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Jones pushed a bunt in front of home plate, and catcher Houston
hesitated before realizing that his only play was at first. He
fired the ball, but it soared wide of the bag and Pratt scored,
Abbott moving to third. The game was tied, and the Mets were about
to surge ahead on Agbayani's unlikely romp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one inning, the Mets scored more runs than they had in 8 of
their first 10 games this month.

WHERE FILMS MADE IN ENGLISH CAN SEEM A CULTURAL BETRAYAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;    Murray Whyte is deputy arts editor at The National Post, a
national Canadian newspaper based in Toronto. 
 By MURRAY WHYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ When Denys Arcand stepped onto the red carpet outside
Roy Thomson Hall here earlier this month, he had reached the end of
a long road. His first major film in seven years, ``Stardom,'' was
the opening-night offering at the Toronto International Film
Festival, and Arcand, 59, a French-Canadian Montrealer, was
enjoying a welcome reserved for native sons. Local newspapers had
plastered photographs of Arcand and interviews with him all over
their arts sections, heralding the film's arrival, and on the red
carpet Arcand himself seemed to glow amid adulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the premiere of ``Stardom,'' a film that tracks the fickle
gaze of fame as it falls on a small-town girl (Jessica Pare) and
transports her to the world of fashion modeling, signaled more than
a jubilant return for the director. It put him even more firmly in
the camp of prominent French-speaking directors who have turned to
English for their films _ a sore point for some in a place where
language is an emotional gauge of cultural health.
</P>
<P>
   Among these directors, Lea Pool, whose French-language film
``Emporte-Moi'' (``Set Me Free'') was a modest success in the
United States last year, and the internationally known theater
director Robert Lepage, whose play ``The Far Side of the Moon''
opened in New York earlier this month, are only two of the most
conspicuous. Beyond them, a host of filmmakers seasoned by years of
French production are entering the vast English-language market,
lured by larger budgets and the promise of escape from the subtitle
ghetto. For these directors, English production is a financial
necessity. As the director Richard Roy put it in the
French-language Montreal daily newspaper Le Devoir recently: ``I
have projects in French, but I have to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a phenomenon doesn't sit well in Quebec, a province of
roughly seven million people, 80 percent of whom are
French-speaking. Fervently protective of its language and culture,
the province is fond of referring to itself as a ``distinct
society.'' It has held two referendums in the last 25 years in
which Quebecers were asked to vote on whether they wanted to
separate from Canada. (They said no both times, but not by much:
the most recent referendum, in 1995, failed by one percentage
point.)
</P>
<P>
   The distinction, nonetheless, is clear: on both the big and
small screens, an entire star system has evolved, unique to the
province and entirely outside the North American mass-culture
orbit. For some, the thought of Franco-Quebec filmmakers working
outside this sphere reeks of betrayal _ particularly now, when
Quebec, like most of the world, is facing an ever-larger influx of
films from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Odile Tremblay, the film critic for Le Devoir, wrote about the
phenomenon recently, and the undertone of crisis was apparent:
``The danger is that we'll lose our best Francophone players in the
ocean of the language of the other. There's also the danger of
choosing English and sweeping our national realities under the
carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   For Franco-Quebecers, the notion of national reality _ of a
distinctive culture _ has been so closely tied to language that the
two are almost inseparable, says Peter Wintonick, the Montreal
documentary filmmaker who made ``Manufacturing Consent'' and, most
recently, ``Cinema Verite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Language certainly is the touchstone,'' Wintonick says.
``There's disappearing species, flora and fauna, but the
disappearance of language is a major crisis. There is this
struggle, for people whose culture is identified with language, to
preserve it. It's really sort of sad, because cinema is really an
expression of your culture, and in this case, the language is such
a large part of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tremblay, the struggle is palpable: ``We have a small film
community. We are a small society. So there is always a fear. There
will always be French films in Quebec. But if all the important
filmmakers turn to English, the loss will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of loss is rooted deep in the province's cinematic
history. Through the 1960s and '70s, the National Film Board of
Canada was based in Montreal, and its presence generated an entire
generation of documentary filmmakers, among them Claude Jutra, who
directed ``Mon Oncle Antoine'' (1971), still considered one of the
finest Canadian films ever produced. From the documentary tradition
sprang a method of narrative filmmaking that echoed the cinema
verite movement in France; it came to be known in Quebec as ``Le
Direct'' _ a sincere, often bleak portrait of Quebecois daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Arcand, too, is a member of this school, his skills honed on
documentaries at the film board in the late '60s. He went on to
establish himself as an auteur _ a visionary director who could
draw an international audience by virtue of his name alone _ with
French-language films like ``The Decline of the American Empire''
(1987) and ``Jesus of Montreal''(1989), both of which received
Academy Award nominations for best foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, he says, his filmmaking owes a debt to those formative
years. For ``Stardom,'' which opens in New York on Oct. 27, Arcand
spent years interviewing former models, photographers and stylists,
passing hours backstage at fashion shows, recording every detail:
``I just amassed tons and tons of documents and information before
beginning, which is the way a documentary filmmaker works. And I've
kept that. All my films are done like that, are part of that
tradition, in a sense. That's where I come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, through his 30-year career, Arcand has moved on from the
priorities that shaped his early work, priorities that were, in the
early years, necessarily focused on French-speaking Quebec. Even
for films like ``The Decline and Fall of the American Empire'' and
``Jesus of Montreal'' _ both in French _ the language was
incidental, in service of broader themes. `` `Decline' could have
taken place anywhere _ it was a universal subject,'' he says of the
film, which examined the dynamics of marriage and infidelity among
four couples in Quebec. ``The same is true of `Jesus' _ or
`Stardom.' It's a very personal film, like all my films. It's not a
Quebecois film anymore. It's a film by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Arcand's statement speaks of ambition and aspiration, qualities
both essential and expected in an artist pursuing international
success. But what is a natural yearning for most can easily be
politicized for a talented Franco-Quebec artist. When Arcand made
his first English-language film, ``Love and Human Remains'' (1993),
he had no political motive; he was simply drawn to a play about
sexual frustration and failed ambitions wrapped around a murder
mystery by Brad Fraser, an English-Canadian playwright.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the time he was roundly criticized in the French-language
press for it. Even before the film was released, Tremblay, writing
in Le Devoir, was looking for weaknesses: `` `Love and Human
Remains' doesn't correspond to our Quebecois sensibilities,'' she
wrote. ``Some accuse Arcand of having adopted American methods by
calling on focus groups and betraying the cause of auteur
filmmaking by flirting with producer-driven cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty and betrayal are common themes among Quebecois
filmmakers whose priorities lie on different sides of the debate.
Pierre Falardeau, a Montreal director known for his politically
charged work, makes no secret of his allegiance. ``When you're an
artist, you have a responsibility,'' he says. ``The reason I make
films is this: when I was young, the only films I saw were John
Wayne movies, and stupid Elvis Presley films. And when I was 17,
18, I discovered that there were guys on the screen dressed like my
father, who spoke like my father, or my neighbors. And I realized
film does not have to be stupid. It can say something about our
culture.''
nn
</P>
<P>
   The culture Falardeau refers to is unmistakably Quebec's. He
speaks fondly of early Quebecois directors like Pierre Perrault,
who made films about daily life among the French-speaking residents
in the province's eastern regions. His own films crystallize his
priorities: ``Octobre'' centers on the October crisis of 1974, in
which the Quebec politician Pierre Laporte was kidnapped and
murdered by members of the radical separatist group the Front de
Liberation de Quebec. His next film, set for release early next
year, is called ``15 Fevrier 1839,'' the date that a revolution by
the French failed in English-speaking Lower Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Falardeau's position is hardly a new one. In the '70s, Jutra, a
devout separatist, deliberately skirted political issues in his
work, and suffered criticism for it. When ``Mon Oncle Antoine''
became a success outside of Quebec, some rejected it as a
non-Quebecois film. ``He was often accused by the more ideological
separatists of betraying the cause because he didn't make films
about the issue,'' said Jim Leach, who recently published a
biography of Jutra. ``It's something like Spike Lee working in
Hollywood. You're not just Spike Lee making a film, you're
representing the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepage, whose ``Possible Worlds'' had its debut at the Venice
Film Festival before screening in Toronto, says, ``That pressure,
both then and now, is the product of the insecurity of a young
culture, but one that Quebec is slowly outgrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Denys Arcand very well, and I know that, for a while,
he felt that there was a bit of animosity in Quebec because he
started doing things in English a few years ago. And I said `No,
Denys, that's a false debate now.''' He adds, ``I think Quebec is
ready to be like other countries that still try to conserve their
culture, but recognize that the market is in English.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pool, a 50-year-old director who came to Quebec from
Switzerland 25 years ago, the liberation of which Lepage speaks has
been a long time coming. Having made films in French throughout her
career, she has just completed her first English film, ``Lost and
Delirious,'' starring Piper Perabo and Pare as boarding school
girls on the verge of discovering their sexuality. She is betraying
no one, she says _ most important, herself: ``The idea that, if you
speak in English, and you make a film in English, you're a
different person _ that's completely stupid. I'm sure they will be
looking a little closer at me, to see if I have not sold my soul to
Hollywood. But the reason I made this film was that it was very
close to me, to what I do. Of course, I knew that if we made the
film in English, it would be easier to get the money. I knew it was
easier to find name actresses. But when I was asked why I made this
film in English, it was because I didn't want to translate it into
French. That's the main, main reason. It's a screenplay by an
American playwright, Judith Thompson, based on a novel by an
American author _ Susan Swan's `Wives of Bath.' What else would I
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Pool recalls when one of her films was refused by a Quebec film
festival because it was deemed to be ``not Quebecois.'' ``I made
all my films here, so what is a Quebec film?'' she asks,
incredulous. ``What is the parallel between Pierre Falardeau's
films and Denys Arcand's films? They cannot be compared. They're
completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Quebec may be warming to a more international
perspective. Lepage recalls the inaugural Jutra Awards (named for
the director) last year _ the Jutras are Quebec's own film awards,
a sort of provincial Oscars _ and the big winner was ``The Red
Violin,'' an English-language film directed by the Montreal
filmmaker Francois Girard, and starring Samuel L. Jackson and a
host of Anglo-Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, Lepage says: ``Suddenly we had all these
English-Canadian actors accepting all these prizes, and speaking
their broken French, saying `Thank you,' and feeling very uneasy,
because they're in the French Quebec bastion that is deciding to
give them some credit. That started a bit of a buzz at that moment,
and I think that Quebec will learn as it gets more productive in
its film industry that it is an industry where a lot of creators
will want to exploit larger markets _ not just subtitles.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Frappier, who produced ``Jesus of Montreal'' and now runs
his own production company, Max Films, believes a new generation of
Quebecois filmmakers is blossoming, for whom language is secondary
to the film itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we cannot listen to the word `globalization' for
years and years without its having an effect on the minds of young
people,'' says Frappier. He points to Denis Villeneuve, one of his
young directors, as an example. Villeneuve's new film,
``Maelstrom,'' a stylistic experiment narrated by a fish, had its
premiere at the Toronto Film Festival, and, says Frappier: ``
`Maelstrom' has nothing to do with Quebec and everything to do with
Quebec. It's a new form of cinematography that has no boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the films made in Frappier's stable are ideal: an
expression of Quebecois culture that does not rely on language.
``When Lars von Trier makes a film in English, he is doing a film
only he can do,'' Frappier says. ``He has roots. And that's what we
should never lose when we make a film, even if it's in English, or
has universal appeal: that it comes from here, and it has a
specific vision.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lepage, reaching that point is a simple question of
confidence: ``The only thing that really shakes the basis of
Quebec's assurance in its identity is the fact that it's a very,
very young society. Our writers, our filmmakers, our theater people
are all alive. They're young, somebody like Michel Tremblay, who's
probably our equivalent of Shakespeare, or Schiller, or Horst
Strindberg _ you can call him on the phone and talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel very strong,'' he went on, ``because I've toured
the world many times and I could sense how Quebec culture has its
place, whether it's translated into English or not. It has a mark,
it's very strong, it's very specifically Quebecois. So am I nervous
about this? Not as nervous as others might be.''

RANDALL HAS HANDLE ON WHAT BACKUP SHOULD BE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham has received as much praise this week for his
handling of the so-called quarterback controversy as he has for his
stellar play against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, 37, has gone to great lengths to explain that he
knows that he has no chance to supplant Troy Aikman, no matter how
well he plays. Furthermore, he understands and accepts the role he
agreed to when he joined the Cowboys last June.
</P>
<P>
   So he's being lauded for his selfless attitude, which he credits
to maturity and a spiritual rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been different during my egotistical days,''
Cunningham said. ``I've matured. And I've learned to humble myself
unto the Lord. If you humble yourself, you will be lifted up.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit also should go to the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you. Cunningham has been in Aikman's
position on more than one occasion during a 15-year career dotted
with a healthy share of high highs and low lows.
</P>
<P>
   Three times during his 11-year stay in Philadelphia, Cunningham
had former starters as primary backups. Jim McMahon, Rodney Peete
and Bubby Brister all came in knowing that Cunningham was the
starter, yet all openly pursued his job.
</P>
<P>
   And this was before Mr. Congeniality (Jeff George) went from
Cunningham's backup to his replacement in Minnesota last season.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said he learned a lot from those experiences. He said
divisiveness can tear up the team, while fostering an unhealthy
quarterback environment that prevents both starter and backup from
reaching their full potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of respect for Troy and what he's done in
the past,'' Cunningham said. ``We can work together. There have
been teams I've been on when the backup guy is a tough guy to deal
with. That's tough on the quarterbacks. You can't say the wrong
things at the wrong time. Whenever you are a starter, you've got to
have a good relationship with the guys around you. But it takes
time to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say the two quarterbacks just got a little closer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only Cunningham can take back that rub-it-in touchdown
pass he threw after faking a kneel-down in the waning moments of
the Eagles' 37-20 victory against the Cowboys in 1987. \Nsubheds:No
contest, right? All sides are right to roundly dismiss any hint of
a quarterback controversy.
</P>
<P>
   This is Troy Aikman's team. And it should remain Aikman's team
until Aikman decides to walk away. With three Super Bowl titles
under his belt, he has earned that right.
</P>
<P>
   And while Aikman's long-term health _ considering his concussion
history _ may be better served with Cunningham starting, there's no
concrete evidence that the Cowboys would be better served with
Cunningham at quarterback. Until there is, Aikman haters, please
pipe down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to the blindly loyal Aikman backers who see a quarterback
controversy as a joke because they believe Cunningham is a far
inferior quarterback, their career numbers heading into the 2000
season suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Entering his 12th season, Aikman had a 90-64 record as a
starter. His quarterback rating was 82.6. He had thrown 158
touchdown passes and 127 interceptions. Aikman has been to the Pro
Bowl six times.
</P>
<P>
   Entering his 15th season, Cunningham had a 79-50-1 record as a
starter. His quarterback rating was 81.4. He had thrown 198
touchdown passes and 128 interceptions. Cunningham had four Pro
Bowl appearances and two league MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's review: In 24 fewer starts, Cunningham had 11 fewer
victories and 14 fewer losses. He had thrown 40 more touchdown
passes and only one more interception. His quarterback rating is
just a shade off of the supposedly more accurate and consistent
Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's big edge is playoff results. He is 11-4 as a starter in
the postseason, including three Super Bowl titles. Cunningham is
3-6 with no Super Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are those who wonder how good Cunningham could
have been in the playoffs if former Eagles coach Buddy Ryan would
have put any emphasis on the offense or Minnesota Vikings coach
Denny Green would have cared something about defense in 1998.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``You and I will not be having this discussion after
Labor Day,'' Paul B. Guenther, the chairman of the New York
Philharmonic, bravely declared last April. ``Either that or you'll
be talking to my successor here.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Guenther was promising that the orchestra would have
named its next music director by now.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   But who's keeping track? Probably no one on the Philharmonic's
board; who would want to take over Guenther's position and its
problems just now?)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Guenther could hardly be blamed for feeling euphoric at the
time; he had cast two lures, and a big fish was nibbling at each.
In the end, the bigger one, Riccardo Muti, got away as music
director. But Guenther landed the other one: Zarin Mehta took over
as the orchestra's executive director just after Labor Day,
replacing Deborah Borda, who decamped last December for a similar
position with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. With the kinds of
difficulties American orchestras face today, Mehta may well prove
the more important catch.
</P>
<P>
   At 61, he is considered a star in the small world of
classical-music management. Guenther has said that every other
candidate interviewed for the position suggested that Mehta would
be the ideal choice if he were available but that the Philharmonic
would never get him. Mehta, who was the managing director of the
Montreal Symphony Orchestra from 1981 to 1991, when he became
executive director of the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, Ill.,
the summer home of the Chicago Symphony, had just signed another
five-year contract with Ravinia when the Philharmonic came calling.
</P>
<P>
   Even before arriving in New York, Mehta took a hand in the
search for a new music director to replace Kurt Masur in 2002. In
addition, Mehta seems to have wasted little time in papering over
the Philharmonic's shattered relationship with Masur, who opens his
10th season on Wednesday at Avery Fisher Hall. Masur said in May
that he had no dates scheduled with the orchestra after the end of
his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to guest conduct,'' Zarin Mehta said on Sept. 5,
his first day on the job, looking instantly at home, sitting at a
conference table before an outsize bust of Mahler in his spacious
office at Avery Fisher Hall. ``He has three weeks already for the
2002-3 season. He and I go back many years, and I'm looking forward
to working on his last two seasons with us and making sure that
things are done properly for him. I'd like to do something special
in his final summer, 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the stalled search for Masur's successor, now more than
two years old, Mehta said that it would go forward as soon as the
orchestra returned from its vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the eggs were in one basket,'' he said of the Muti
courtship.
</P>
<P>
   Word of a short list of candidates leaked from the Philharmonic
last spring. Along with Muti, who broke off negotiations in July,
the list named two people Mehta would probably find congenial:
Mariss Jansons, the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony and
the associate principal conductor of the St. Petersburg
Philharmonic in Russia, whose work Mehta is said to admire; and
Christoph Eschenbach, until recently the music director of the
Houston Symphony, whom Mehta hired to succeed James Levine as music
director at Ravinia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta is also said to have discussed the Philharmonic vacancy in
at least vague terms with Daniel Barenboim, the music director of
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and of the Deutsche Staatsoper
Berlin. Mehta would not be drawn into a discussion of individual
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the `short list' of candidates people talk about,
and it has names that could not possibly be involved with the
Philharmonic for a variety of reasons,'' Mehta said. ``It wasn't a
short list so much as a wish list. So we have to be practical, and
you will find that I'm a very practical person.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the search is starting again from scratch. Mehta,
undaunted by failed predictions like Guenther's, said he hopes to
have a music director in place by the end of the year. Nor does
Guenther himself hesitate to crawl out on another limb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unreasonable to think that it could happen by the end
of the year,'' Guenther echoed last week, citing Mehta's very
presence and involvement as factors attractive to potential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Time is of the essence for Mehta. ``Even if the new conductor is
not available for more than two weeks or six weeks or whatever in
2002-3, it is important that the person be named as music director
between now and then,'' he said. ``I have no pretension of being
music director. None at all. I'm a very opinionated person, but I
keep my opinions to myself. I want to work with somebody. I've
already started planning that season in terms of conductors,
general layout, when a tour can take place. But soon I have to jump
in with both feet.''
</P>
<P>
   To help develop a cohesive season with interesting programming,
Mehta is trying to hire fewer guest conductors than usual, for
periods longer than single weeks, a practice he would like to see
continue when a music director arrives. The conductors he mentions
for 2002-3 are unsurprising: Muti, Charles Dutoit and Sir Colin
Davis in addition to Masur. (It would hardly be surprising or amiss
if Zubin Mehta, Zarin's older brother, who was music director
before Masur, were represented as well, though Zarin Mehta seems to
go out of his way to avoid any appearance of favoritism.) Mehta is
also brainstorming with established maestros like Pierre Boulez,
Zubin Mehta's predecessor as music director of the Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his protestations of avoiding artistic interference,
Zarin Mehta makes it clear that he will take a stronger hand in
artistic administration than some of his peers, who delegate much
of the responsibility. Welz Kauffman, the orchestra's last artistic
administrator, followed Borda to Los Angeles in May and recently
replaced Mehta at Ravinia, starting that job the same day Mehta
began his. Mehta has just hired the less-experienced Jeremy Geffen
from the Aspen Music Festival as artistic administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be my right hand,'' Mehta said. ``But the only reason
I'm in this business is because I like music. The thought of not
being involved in the creation of what happens _ every cancellation
to me is a challenge. As I say, I've sat down and looked at 2002-3.
I have looked at the summers of 2001 and 2002, and Masur and I have
already talked about a couple of ideas. I don't want anyone else to
do that. If I was going to administer just anything, I would have
taken a commercial job somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehta began his working life in a commercial position, with the
accounting firm of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand in Montreal. Unlike Zubin
Mehta, Zarin never had aspirations as a performer, though he
developed a broad familiarity with music early. He was born in
Bombay in 1938, a son of Mehli Mehta, a violinist and conductor who
founded the Bombay Symphony in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's osmosis,'' Zarin Mehta said. ``No, actually, it's
more than that. We have four children, and they grew up in music
even before I went to the Montreal Symphony in 1981. My wife is a
singer. There was music in the house, because of teaching.
Musicians were always there. But none of my children had the same
interest in classical music that Zubin and I did from listening to
music on 78s in India.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehta is married to Carmen Lasky Mehta and the father of two of
her children, who are now in their 30s. The other two he calls his
own were Lasky's from a previous marriage, to Zubin Mehta
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   (Bejun Mehta, who first made his name as a boy soprano and has
recently established himself in New York as a countertenor, is a
cousin of the Mehta brothers.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The business of music is something quite different,'' Zarin
Mehta said. ``That comes kind of naturally. My father ran his own
concerts and chamber concerts, so it became kind of a business, and
it was talked about at the dinner table. Zubin and I both went into
nonmusical directions for a time. At that stage there was never any
thought of our going into the profession, because in Bombay there
really wasn't a profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubin Mehta eventually went to Vienna to join a cousin who was
studying piano, and the rest is musical history. Zarin Mehta, still
in his teens, went to study accounting in London, where he attended
concerts often, usually in standing room. In 1962, he took up his
job in Canada with his lively interest in music in tow.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Symphony's administration fell into disarray in the
1970s, when no suitable executive could be found (fluency in French
being the major hurdle). From his position on the board, Mehta
played a major role in the hiring of Dutoit as music director in
1976. Finally, with no end of the fruitless search for an executive
in sight, Mehta took over the management of the orchestra himself,
guiding it into an era of international acclaim that lasts to this
day.  &QL; 
MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   At Ravinia, he established a similar run of successes. In 1995,
the year Eschenbach took over as music director, the festival also
unveiled a $12 million renovation of its facilities. Mehta formed
the Ravinia Festival Orchestra and instituted programs in jazz and
contemporary music as well as opportunities for young performers.
To those who knew him, he seemed as content with his situation as
the board was with him, and it may never have occurred to either
party that the new five-year contract signed last fall would be a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was difficult,'' Mehta said of his premature
departure. ``They were extremely disappointed. They tried to talk
me out of it. At the same time, I think they realized that this was
an opportunity that was right for me. That's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   He professes to find New York irresistibly appealing; and hardly
less so, the sheer prospect of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something so different from what I've been doing, and
it's nice to have fresh air every so often. Without ever planning
it, it's just worked out that every 10 years I have a natural
change of direction. I certainly didn't plan this. And in the last
three months I've said: `Well why? I'm in a very comfortable
position in a lovely city. Why am I doing this?' But I think it's
to wake up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakeup calls are sure to come, not only in Mehta's dealings with
the Philharmonic players, though their reputation for
obstreperousness seems happily to have faded in recent years, but
also in his dealings with the unwieldy bureaucracy of Lincoln
Center. Extensive renovation lies ahead at Avery Fisher Hall as at
most of the other buildings in the center, and Mehta does not yet
know exactly what to expect or when it may happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'd like to see Avery Fisher Hall sound better,'' he
said. ``And look better.''
</P>
<P>
   Also problematic is the Lincoln Center Festival, in which the
Philharmonic has served honorably over five years to relatively
little reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the festival is extremely avant-garde,'' Mehta
said. ``But we're the only constituent group that's performing
regularly. I think it's wrong for the Philharmonic to play to
one-third houses. I like to think we have a certain self-respect,
and we shouldn't be doing that sort of thing.'' The Philharmonic
will not participate next year for other reasons, and any future
involvement, Mehta said, will hinge on programmatic interest, like,
perhaps, that Masur tribute in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta is clearly not a man to trifle with, a quality that should
serve him well in New York, at Lincoln Center and with the feisty
Philharmonic.

MADONNA ENCOUNTERS VIRTUAL EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 17)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The notion of an objective, natural reality, separate from human
intervention, was damaged beyond repair in the 20th century. It was
besieged on all sides by art, philosophy and technology: by Cubism
and post-modernism, by film and sound recording, by television and
synthesizers, by video games and plastic surgery, by all the gizmos
of the computer era. Any separation between natural and artificial
has grown fuzzy and, in practice, irrelevant. Now, everyone lives
on the cusp of the physical and the virtual.
</P>
<P>
   That's the running joke, though some might call it a subtext, on
Madonna's new album, ``Music'' (Maverick/Warner Brothers 2-47598),
her latest foray into electronica. The cowgirl hat Madonna wears in
the video clip for ``Music'' is an emblem of outdoorsy Nature, but
nothing on the album _ not an acoustic guitar, not Madonna's voice
_ arrives without an obvious electronic tweak or two. She flaunts
the synthetic without a hint of insincerity.
</P>
<P>
   On her 1998 album ``Ray of Light,'' Madonna pondered meaning and
purpose, love and fate, with her voice enveloped in William Orbit's
protean, shimmering productions. ``Music'' brings Madonna back down
to earth. The album is a batch of songs, not a grand statement; it
moves from giddy dance-floor highs to pretentious lows. In her
lyrics, Madonna, who is 42, returns to her past staples of dance,
romance and female self-determination, along with some attempts at
mature reflection. Most of the music _ even when written with Orbit
_ trades the resonant, liquid backdrops of ``Ray of Light'' for
sparse settings that seem to be rationing how many sounds they use.
It's as if Madonna has replaced a de Kooning painting with a
Mondrian.
</P>
<P>
   Orbit is still invaluable. Emphasizing staccato rhythm instead
of lush chords this time, he collaborated on two uptempo songs that
jump off the album: ``Runaway Lover,'' a disco update with an
exuberant tangle of keyboard lines ricocheting in stereo, and
``Amazing,'' a lovelorn rocker that puts tremolo guitars and a
1960s garage-rock beat behind one of Madonna's most heartfelt vocal
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's main new collaborator is Mirwais, a producer, musician
and programmer from Paris whose last name is Ahmadazai. He was in
the bands Taxi Girl and Juliette before turning to dance music.
Now, along with Air (from Paris) and To Rococo Rot (from Berlin),
he is part of a wave of European producer-programmers who have
rediscovered both the buzzy, wiggly sounds of old analog
synthesizers and the idea that less can be more. They build tracks
with a few keyboard settings, a pithy drumbeat and little pockets
of space; Air often adds a dissociated, electronically filtered
voice. Where some electronica aspires to cinematic grandeur, these
minimalists prefer to stack up deadpan musical one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Mirwais is as droll as any of them. He has an ear for the nasal
early synthesizers and tinny drum sounds Kraftwerk used in the
1970s, for the blunt drumbeats of old-school hip-hop and for the
bright blips of early-1980s electro dance music, all of which now
sound pleasantly dated. But he detours off memory lane, unwilling
to let the retro sounds ease into nostalgia. Atop familiar beats,
he creates slyly anachronistic combinations, as he does in the
title song of ``Music,'' which sets up dizzying syncopation around
one unchanging chord.
</P>
<P>
   On Mirwais' own album, ``Production,'' he applies titles like
``Definitive Beat'' and ``Digital Science'' to what start out as
rudimentary rhythm tracks. He makes a sustained sound hover above
them or starts a high syncopated blip; then he warps the basic beat
by filtering it into a shadow of its original self, or he makes it
stutter and leapfrog itself. Using relatively simple techniques, he
gets results that are both witty and startling.
</P>
<P>
   Through her career, Madonna has used what business experts call
the ``fast follower'' strategy, quickly picking up other people's
good ideas and reshaping them in friendlier, more commercial form.
She has pulled more than one style out of the dance underground by
slipping it underneath straightforward pop songs. Although there
are a few vocals on Mirwais' solo album, Madonna brings pop
instincts to their collaborations, providing genuine melodies and
serviceable lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Mirwais, for his part, keeps twisting the musical context.
``Don't Tell Me,'' an obsessive love song, uses a fingerpicked
guitar, and Madonna sings a passable Bonnie Raitt imitation. The
song doesn't stay folky; the guitar lick reveals itself as a sample
that gets lopped off at the end for unexpected jolts of silence,
Madonna's voice is multiplied and the guitar is flanked by a
Morse-code blip bouncing off a low wah-wah note.
</P>
<P>
   Mirwais and Madonna also play hide-and-seek with her voice. Most
pop-dance divas and their producers still trade on the contrast of
human versus mechanical that was established by Donna Summer and
Giorgio Moroder in the 1970s. As the machines tick out repetitive
parts, the singer provides unpredictability and passion, a
personality that listeners can identify with. While male groups
from Kraftwerk to Zapp to the Jonzun Crew have made trademarks out
of inhuman, distorted voices, until recently women have usually
gotten a naturalistic treatment, even if their vocals are snipped
into samples for dance tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Cher's ``Believe'' and Christina Aguilera's ``Genie in a
Bottle'' both used some of the same electronic fillips as Madonna
does on ``Music.'' But Mirwais and Madonna push the cybervocals
further. In ``Impressive Instant,'' a bouncy electro outer-space
travelogue, Madonna is filtered, repitched, compressed, echoed and
edited into sudden leaps; she slips in and out of the hallucinatory
electronics with whimsical ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's Perfect,'' a shrewd mixture of apology (``I feel so
sad/ What I did wasn't right'') and self-justification (``What did
you expect/ I'm doing my best''), could have been a rueful ballad
sung to the acoustic guitar that appears briefly in the middle of
the song. Instead, drums snicker and Madonna's voice is run through
a vocoder to become distant and disembodied, as if this particular
sentiment was a prerecorded response.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna gets heavy-handed in ``I Deserve It,'' a
guitar-strumming ballad so solemn it verges on self-parody. The
album ends with self-righteous dirges, ``Gone'' (``Why should I be
sad/ For what I never had'') and ``Paradise,'' which includes
tearful spoken-word passages in both English and French. Yet even
in the dud songs, Madonna doesn't return to the unquestioning pomp
of typical diva anthems. Antigravity synthesizer lines waft
overhead and whir quietly around her; electronics veil and reveal
her voice. The pop-song structures are stable, but they've moved
into a sonic realm where anything can happen.

GAME DAY FOR COWBOYS' PRACTICE-SQUAD WIDE RECEIVER IS IN FRONT OF A
TV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Damon Hodge isn't going to jump out of his chair
screaming and yelling. Well, maybe he will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe. If it comes down to the fourth quarter, and we need a
score to win,'' Hodge says.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter is a few hours away. While his teammates are
preparing to play the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday night, the
Cowboys practice-squad wide receiver prepares his spaghetti and
meat sauce at his apartment near Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   This is how he watches his team play a road game. Not on the
sidelines, but at home with a remote control by his side and a
glass of juice in his hand. He is an arm-chair receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's identical to being redshirted,'' Hodge says.
``It's tough. Injured guys have something to strive to get back to.
No matter what I do, it depends on what someone else does. Yeah, I
still get butterflies, but I don't get nervous like it's fear. I
want to get contact, so it will get it out of the way to get back
into rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Only he can't take a hit in his new bachelor pad, which is
furnished with a big couch, a big chair, a big bed, a Sony
PlayStation, a Sega Dreamcast and one of thoseJumboTron-size TVs
where you can smell Joe Theismann's cologne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny how some of these commentators talk. They don't
know what they're talking about,'' Hodge says. ``They just talk. Of
course, Theismann knows what he's talking about. But Dennis
Miller?''
</P>
<P>
   With his left leg slung over the side of his big chair, Hodge
watches the Cardinals move down the field on their opening drive,
assisted by Cowboys cornerback Kareem Larrimore's 37-yard pass
interference penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, c'mon, Kareem,'' Hodge says. ``He \RLarrimore\S is
physical, but he's more of a speed guy. The toughest thing about
going against \Rthe Cowboys cornerbacks\S is aggression. They
gamble, but Kareem and Ryan \RMcNeil\S catch up more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodge sits with his arms at his side, never getting too up or
too down. This is part of his job as one of the team's five
practice-squad players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely wasn't a Cowboys fan growing up,'' says Hodge,
who lived the first 12 years of his life in the Bronx, N.Y. ``I was
a Giants fan. I still follow them a little bit, but I'm a Cowboy
now. I grew up hating the Cowboys and the Eagles, but I loved
Randall Cunningham and Troy Aikman.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyhood idol Cunningham is on the screen tearing up the
Cardinals. His 47-yard touchdown pass to James McKnight gives
Dallas a 14-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play is called `Speed Bomb,' '' Hodge says. ``Randall's
arm is a little different. Troy is more of a touch guy. He throws a
very catchable ball. Randall, his passes have more steam on them.
It's catchable, but you have to be ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a knock at the door. It's Cowboys practice-squad tight
end James Whalen. This apartment complex has become a
home-away-from home for some Cowboys. Punter Micah Knorr and kicker
Tim Seder live here, as do a few other players.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen makes himself at home, dishing out some spaghetti before
sitting down in front of the TV. Third-string quarterback Clint
Stoerner's face appears briefly on the screen. He has become one of
Hodge's closest friends, and a champion of the practice-squad
players after being elevated to the 53-player active roster last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see you Clint Stoerner!'' Whalen shouts. ``He's my boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The score ticker comes across the screen, showing the Giants'
33-18 victory against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whalen, man, the Eagles didn't look anything like they did
last week,'' Hodge says.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are beginning to look nothing as they did in last
week's 21-16 loss to the Giants. Arizona trails the Cowboys, 31-26,
in the fourth quarter when Cardinals receiver David Boston catches
a 63-yard pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran that play all week in practice,'' says Hodge, who runs
the opponent's offense in practice. ``I scored three touchdowns on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen seconds later, Frank Sanders catches a 17-yard touchdown
pass and Arizona takes a 32-31 lead. The Cowboys have 1:54
remaining to win. This should be the time for Hodge to scream and
shout like a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of time,'' Hodge says calmly. ``We'll come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys move to the Arizona 43 before four consecutive
incompletions send Dallas to 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hodge smacks his hands together. It's the loudest he has been
all game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to swallow a loss like this,'' Hodge says. ``We did
such a great job of establishing ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for a practice player who never boards the plane or puts on
the pads, screaming or yelling isn't necessary. Losing hurts either
way.

THE AIR-CONDITIONED REVERIE OF A FUNDAMENTALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Summertime in Houston. This is what it's like to be a
martyr to city-love. Heat and mugginess drive the body into
underground streets and climate-controlled rooms, behind sealed
windows and closed doors. The mind feels trapped, too.
Intellectually, you know that you're in a great American city.
Physically, you feel absent.
</P>
<P>
   The sensation of absence must be acute for Rafael Moneo,
architect of the new Audrey Jones Beck Building at Houston's Museum
of Fine Arts. In Moneo's native Spain, builders have been coping
with heat for eons. Here in Texas, a one-time Spanish colony,
architecture is for all practical purposes a network of sealed
membranes, constructed around air-conditioning systems and linked
together by cars chilled to bone-rattling discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   The week I went to Houston, a photograph appeared on the front
page of this newspaper depicting the apparent melting of the polar
ice cap. Yes, Virginia, Santa's workshop is under water. Compared
to this alarming piece of news, the Beck Building is scarcely worth
mentioning. Nonetheless, the building is a good one. It deserves a
positive story. So does the link, however remote, between the Beck
and our watery top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, when I arrive in a city to look at a building, I spend
some hours prowling the vicinity to orient myself to the site. In
Houston, it was too hot to prowl, or even to inspect the Beck
Building's exterior, except from the window of my hotel room across
the street. From this perspective, the building's context was the
window, the newspaper and a bowl of complimentary fruit. Still life
with art museum. Nature morte.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even a discouraged city-lover would risk dehydration to
visit a building by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Two previous
additions to the Museum of Fine Arts were designed by the great
master, in 1958 and 1974. These have now been renovated, to
coincide with the Beck Building's opening last May, when the
weather may have been more conducive to architectural appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Moneo was an excellent choice to build on Miesian precedent.
Like Mies, Moneo is a fundamentalist. He believes in essences,
architectural values that endure. ``I am committed,'' he said, ``to
an architecture that maintains faith in the principles and the
mechanisms architecture has always had.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Mies, who preferred the term ``building art''to
architecture, Moneo embraces material construction as
architecture's basic fact. He is not a structural expressionist.
The stone surfaces of the Beck Building conceal load-bearing steel
and concrete construction. But Moneo's forms and volumes do not
violate the logic of the materials and methods used to fabricate
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Beck is a square, two-story box. It occupies an entire block
in the museum district a few miles from downtown, across the street
from the Mies expansion and the museum's original home, a 1924
Beaux Arts temple. All four sides of the Beck are covered with a
light pink stone that shimmers with a lustrous, Mediterranean
bloom. Only spare geometric cuts are made in the facades: some
large windows framed in bronze; a wedge-shape trough that allows
the sun to reach a skylight; air grilles. On the west side, a deep
reveal shelters the main entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The Beck's roof can be counted a fifth facade. It supports the
building's most conspicuous urbanistic device: a grid of louvered
light boxes that illuminate the galleries below. Night photographs
taken from above suggest that the lanterns were intended to echo
the downtown skyline some miles away. This effect is not apparent
from the street. Nonetheless, the roofline makes an elegant
night-time apparition.
</P>
<P>
   Two entrances to the Beck cause anxious indecision, particularly
since the main one is concealed in deep shadow beneath an overhang
and separated from the street by a driveway. The driveway is partly
screened by a thick cement wall that has been molded into scored
letters forming the museum's name. The lettering, designed by
Massimo Vignelli, is astonishingly unattractive. If the intention
was to recall the thick walls of adobe construction, the gesture is
hollow here.
</P>
<P>
   Blast of conditioned air. Ticket lobby. Then, as the body
adjusts, a vision of space-on-space: an atrium of an amplitude that
you wouldn't believe possible in a two-story building, even with
the little penthouse that enables the atrium to punch through the
roofline. You are instantly relieved on entering, and not just by
the coolness. The atrium's compressed, almost intimate
monumentality states that Moneo knows everything there is to know
about museum fatigue, including how to spare you from it.
</P>
<P>
   Classically composed yet dynamic, the atrium is animated by two
diagonals that slice asymmetrically through it. A staircase to the
left, an escalator to the right form two triangles that face each
other in reverse _ two flipped halves of a divided square. The
length and thinness of the two banks magnify the room's scale. The
space is further enlivened by the eclectic array of antique
sculptures that face you like a committee welcoming you to the
history of art.
</P>
<P>
   Take the escalator to the permanent collection. You may be
halfway through it before your eye is drawn to the Beck's signal
detail: a cubic convergence of planes and textures. A narrow strip
of stone is set into the floor around the perimeter of each
gallery. Playing against the stained, dark oak floor, the strips
are light-catchers, horizontal frames that extend the wall's
surface into the space of the room. Just above the stone, thin,
louvered aluminum air-conditioning grilles are mounted at the base
of the wall. The doorways between the classically proportioned
galleries are framed with brushed bronze panels.
</P>
<P>
   It may strike you that the entire building was designed to
create a sympathetic environment for this device for framing space
and light. While the skylights, with their louvered light boxes,
are formally more assertive, the detailing in the galleries
themselves defines the visitor's experience. They helped persuade
me that the Museum of Fine Arts has the richest collection I've
seen in many years.
</P>
<P>
   On leaving the Beck, you get another slap in the face. The blast
of heat is only part of the shock. There is also the abrupt
transition from the visual to the physical, from the sphere of
retinal experience to a world where eye and brain are but two
organs in a wholly constituted body.
</P>
<P>
   This is what an art museum is supposed to do, you might say:
create a space ruled by the sense of sight. But to become aware of
this specialized function is to see that Moneo's building is part
of the general fragmentation of culture after all. This awareness
extends to the urban context. Like the Beck, the great majority of
our buildings are dedicated to the creation of visual effects. In
this sense, the Beck symbolizes architecture's role in the
detachment of the eye from the rest of nature.

HOUSTON: rest of nature.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The interesting thing about fundamentalists is the many
fundamentals that their thinking does not take into account.
Architecture's obedience to the eye is a relatively recent
phenomenon in the history of building. The ancient Mediterranean
sculptures that greet visitors to the Beck building served a
religious function. Greek sculpture, for example, was attached to
the temple, which itself derived its meaning and value from the
sacred earth site on which it stood. Differentiation _ into bodies,
selves, disciplines, sites and cities _ was seen by the Greeks as a
dreadful if necessary part of life. From it grew tragic theater.
</P>
<P>
   The differentiation of space into the modern art museum is also
wonderful and terrible. For the Greeks, art as well as religion
supplied the connective tissue that prevents differentiation from
pulling human life to pieces. For us, art is a thing apart. In a
modern democracy, it is neither possible nor desirable to return to
the Greek model. It is possible to imagine how, working within the
logic of art, the Beck Building might have articulated the tragic
as well as the triumphal dimension of the modern art museum.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's collection is traditionally organized by region,
chronology and school. Overall, it traces a narrative of
progressive abstraction, from funerary sculpture, created for the
body and the earth, to the thin, gorgeous lines of an Agnes Martin
painting and spare geometric shapes of the museum's sculpture
garden, created in 1986 by Isamu Noguchi. Along the way, we pass
through the Italian Renaissance and the modern transition from the
sacred to the secular, from the content-laden form of the religious
icon to the illusionary device of single-point perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's architecture tells a similar story. The Beaux Arts
building is an abstraction of classical architecture. The Mies
expansion pushes neoclassicism to the extreme reduction of glass
and steel. The Moneo building, while clad in stone, recapitulates
the Miesian ethic of formal reduction and spatial clarity. Even the
stone _ a real material that provides the Beck's formal decoration
_ represents the earth in abstract form. The story reaches a climax
with ``The Inner Light,'' an installation of artificial light
created expressly for the Beck by James Turrell. Progressing from
earth to sky, physical to ethereal, the story is fundamentally
religious in nature, a ritual procession in the temple of art.
</P>
<P>
   The story is still unfolding. The contemporary informational
city is an ethereal zone, held aloft by streams of 0s and 1s
generated by rapid electronic impulses. For now, however, its
citizens still dwell in bodies, sealed buildings and cars, and
these continue to create an invisible but highly unethereal
substance: greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is the capital of the oil economy. That economy built
the city, defined its shape and makes it habitable. Even the Museum
of Fine Arts reminds us of the city's dependence on energy. Across
the street from the Beck stands a second new building _ a shadow
Beck _ which houses the museum's air-conditioning system and a
parking garage. Unfortunately, the shadow Beck has been designed to
conceal this infrastructure. It would have been better had Moneo
chosen to aestheticize it.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts has a nice trove of sculptures by Jean
Tinguely, including ``La Bascule VII,'' a work from 1967. It is
pictured in the museum's guide book, along with a bold-face
quotation from the artist, ``All machines are art.'' This is a
fundamental modern tenet, one of the founding beliefs of New York's
Museum of Modern Art. If Moneo's thinking were sufficiently elastic
to incorporate this idea, the shadow Beck might have gained equal
standing with its twin. This could have been achieved in four easy
steps: eliminate the walls; install solar panels on the roof (an
inverse of the Beck's lanterns); light up the interior (Turrell
could have been turned loose on this); and declare the shadow Beck
a new museum acquisition _ ``Air-Conditioning, With Cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Eisenman once said the function of architecture is to
``problematize'' things. That is partly true in the case of the
Beck. It is possible to give the building high marks and still come
away thinking that something is wrong. Has one toured the wrong
building? Perhaps it is a mistake to think of the Beck's concrete
walls as its structure. Its deeper structure may lie in the shadow
building across the street. Without cars, the museum would be
inaccessible. Without air-conditioning, it would be uninhabitable.
Compared with this infrastructure, the Beck's structure is almost
incidental.
</P>
<P>
   Art museums traditionally put a fine gloss over the dark side of
baron robbery. I see no reason to disparage this civilized
practice. But the context of culture has changed dramatically in
the quarter century since the Mies expansion was completed. Clients
didn't habitually conduct global searches for architects. Before
moon landings and satellite photography, the north pole seemed far,
far away. It required a stretch to see any connection between an
air-conditioning system in Houston and an ecological catastrophe on
the polar extremities. Now, it takes a stretch to overlook one.
</P>
<P>
   The ice caps were once purely natural phenomena. Now they are
cultural phenomena as well, the product of an evolving global
operating system that has drawn together the producers and
consumers of buildings and cars to create what an art historian
might reasonably describe as the most ambitious earthwork of
historical time. Perhaps the time has come to uncreate this
masterpiece. This will require a global effort, too. Cultural
institutions have a pivotal role to play in it. We look to them for
self-awareness and for traction _ for signs that the operating
system can receive sufficient feedback to avoid the
self-destructive explosive fate Tinguely sometimes planned for his
exploding mechanical sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Our Shadow Beck would not reduce oil consumption by one drop.
But it could work powerfully on the level of metaphor, the plane on
which art museums and their contents communicate. Like Tinguely's
sculptures, the Beck Building might have spoken metaphorically
about its own civilization. I think it would say: ``Houston, we
have a problem.''

DEATHS AT NEW HAMPSHIRE TRACK FORCE NASCAR CHANGE, BUT IS IT THE
RIGHT ONE?
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Armed with an interim fix and intriguing new questions, the
NASCAR Winston Cup Series is loading up for a somber return to New
Hampshire International Speedway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin Jr. were killed in separate crashes
during practice this season in Turn 3 of the 1.058-mile oval in
Loudon, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from drivers to institute some sort of
energy-absorbing ``soft wall'' technology before Sunday's Dura Lube
300, NASCAR officials announced Saturday that Cup and NASCAR Busch
North Series cars will be required to compete with a one-inch
carburetor restrictor plate during practices, qualifying and the
races at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's decision is unprecedented, as it marks the first time
the horsepower-reducing plates will be used other than at the
2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway and the 2.66-mile Talladega
Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought with regards to the restrictor plate is obvious,''
said Mike Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief
operating officer. ``The track has not changed, but the cars are
faster; this will slow them down. That's \Rrestrictor plates\S a
common denominator that everyone in the garage area knows and
understands.''
</P>
<P>
   And some even loathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the same things about restrictor plates I've always
thought about restrictor plates. It's not racing,'' said seven-time
Cup champion Dale Earnhardt, driver of the No. 3 GM Goodwrench
Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``I applaud NASCAR for doing something, but
they're doing this because everybody is hollering. They should be
hollering at every racetrack, not just one. I think it's the wrong
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-inch-by-5-inch plate fits between the V-8 engine's
four-barrel carburetor and intake manifold. The plate restricts the
amount of air that flows between those components, reducing the
amount of horsepower an engine can generate.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nelson, Winston Cup Series director and a former series
crew chief, estimated the plate will cut horsepower output from 750
to approximately 490 or 500 at NHIS. Nelson also said NASCAR data
showed teams can expect a reduction of approximately 10 mph at top
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Although NASCAR has been unable to offer substantive proof, hung
throttles are believed to have carried both Petty, a regular in the
NASCAR Busch Grand National Series, and Irwin, a former Winston Cup
rookie of the year, into the concrete wall before they could react.
Petty, 19 and the first fourth-generation athlete in any sport, was
killed on May 12. Irwin, 30, was killed on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Benson, driver of the No. 10 Aaron's Pontiac Grand Prix,
said even with the use of computers, speeds this weekend will
remain open to conjecture until the first practice laps are turned
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we're not going to be taking a different line,'' said
Benson, referring to the preferred groove around the track. ``If
the throttle's stuck and you're doing 140 mph as opposed to 150
mph, you might be able to get around the corner a little bit
further, which may change the angle of impact. But we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield, who suffered a concussion Aug. 3 after a crash
during practice at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, does not see
the plate as a long-term solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``But NASCAR was under a lot of pressure to do something
quickly, something that would at least answer New Hampshire,'' said
Mayfield, driver of the No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus. ``This
addresses the speed issue; how fast you go into these corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sit there saying, `Do something, do something,' and
then, after they do something, step back and say, `Hey, we didn't
mean ``that''.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, NASCAR has
mandated use of a throttle-stop on all Cup cars and an ignition
``kill switch'' button on the steering wheel, within easy reach of
the driver. However, native Texan and current Cup points leader
Bobby Labonte did not have time to hit the switch on his steering
wheel during a crash in practice at Darlington Raceway on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace, who set the NHIS qualifying record at 132.089 mph
on July 7, said the plate will change driving styles around the
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could look at it as what may resemble another first-time
race there,'' said Wallace, a four-time winner this season in the
No. 2 Miller Lite Ford. ``But say what they like and do what they
will, I personally would have still liked to have seen the
Styrofoam walls all the way around the place.''
</P>
<P>
   James Ince, Benson's crew chief, said that fortunately for Cup
teams, racing remains a ``reaction business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure of the aerodynamic package, spring and shock
package, the gearing ... everything down to tailpipes and
headers,'' Ince said. ``We're happy that NASCAR did do something,
but it will be a pretty busy weekend for all of us.''
