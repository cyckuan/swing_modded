<HEADLINE> NBC Set To Start 'Later Today' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From ``Tonight'' to ``Late Night.'' From  
``Today'' to ``Later Today.'' Anyone else sense a pattern over at 
NBC? 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, this is a network with a well-developed sense of time.  
Starting Tuesday at 9 a.m., NBC will learn if it's the right time 
to extend the dominant ``Today'' franchise. That moment marks the 
premiere of ``Later Today,'' a live weekday hour that tries to 
stake a middle ground between news and chat. 
</P>
<P>
	All television is essentially a combination of business  
calculation and creative energy, but ``Later Today'' owes more of 
its existence to the accountants. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC has talked for years about expanding ``Today,'' the show  
that dominates morning television. Even with the program's ratings 
success, NBC's desultory daytime lineup could never take advantage 
of its head start. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, NBC stations aired a mix of the NBC-owned  
``Leeza,'' local programming and syndicated shows in the time slot 
following ``Today.'' Now the affiliates will try a show that 
blatantly trades on the success of ``Today,'' a program NBC owns 
and from which it can profit enormously if ratings soar. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Zucker, ``Today'' executive producer, developed ``Later  
Today'' and put one of his trusted deputies, Mike Bass, in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do everything we can to make 9 to 10 (a.m.) a  
huge success,'' Zucker said, ``understanding that nothing comes 
before 7 to 9 (a.m.). We will do nothing to jeopardize the success 
of 7 to 9.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jodi Applegate anchors ``Later Today'' from a Manhattan studio  
that resembles a ``Pottery Barn'' display floor. Asha Blake and 
actress Florence Henderson are her co-hosts. Each owes her job to 
the fickle nature of television timing. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC brass spotted Applegate, host of a hit morning talk show in  
Phoenix, when they were in Arizona a few years ago for the Super 
Bowl. She moved East and established herself as a network 
star-in-the-making on the weekend ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake thought few people were watching her when she anchored  
ABC's overnight news show, but it coincided with the time Zucker 
was up pacing the floor with a newborn baby. He liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Henderson, Zucker had a hunch she might be right for the  
job after seeing her kibitz with Katie Couric on a ``Today'' 
segment about a book Henderson had written. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson is a show-biz veteran who played Carol Brady in ``The  
Brady Bunch'' and sang at Tiny Tim's wedding. She was a ``Today 
girl'' in 1959 on the day host Dave Garroway released a barrel of 
monkeys on-camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have five unions in our business,'' she said. ``I belong to  
all of them, I pay dues in all of them and I work in all of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV isn't exactly filled with older people -- an important daytime  
audience -- so the 65-year-old Henderson is a plus, Zucker said. She 
hardly has trouble keeping up with her younger colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first half hour, it's a weird feeling,'' Applegate  
said. ``You're almost hallucinating -- it's like working with Mr. 
Spock. After a while, you realize it's a human being. It's Florence 
Henderson. It's not Carol Brady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a mix of consumer and health news, celebrity interviews and  
just plain chat about what's going on, ``Later Today'' is designed 
to flow seamlessly from the final half hour of ``Today.'' That's 
when features predominate and women are the primary audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not exactly the sister show of the `Today' show,''  
Applegate said. ``We're the first cousin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of fans peering in on ``Today'' from a window to the  
street, ``Later Today'' will invite some in. There's seating for a 
tiny studio audience of about 45 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake is looking forward to seeing how many viewers can relate  
to some of her experiences: potty-training a 4-year-old and coping 
with a cross-country move. She's still house-hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This show allows us to talk about feelings and emotions,'' she  
said. ``It enables us to tell stories that I hope people can 
benefit from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former news anchors Applegate and Blake will take control on  
days when there is a big story and ``Later Today'' becomes more of 
a news show. Producers believe that this ability to shift focus 
will help distinguish the show from another close cousin, ``The 
View.'' ABC's popular daytime talker is produced by the network's 
entertainment division, and ``Later Today'' comes from the news 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff and Mike are masters at knowing how to turn a corner,''  
Applegate said. ``You never feel like you're getting whiplash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they're successful, who knows what comes next for  
time-conscious NBC? 
</P>
<P>
	How about ``Much Later Today''? ``Afternoon Nap''? ``Better Late  
Than Never''? 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe those are ideas whose times will never come.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	COPS: Court TV is delving into what happens with some of its  
subjects before they get into the courtroom. The cable network 
presents a special Labor Day marathon of ``Cops,'' the video verite 
series that follows police officers on action-packed rounds. The 
marathon includes some never-before-seen footage from the Fox 
series. The marathon begins at 8 a.m. EDT, and presages the 
addition of ``Cops'' onto Court TV's weekday prime-time lineup.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Bear May Not Have Been Rabid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Two laboratories have been unable to  
confirm that rabies killed a bear cub that as many as 400 tourists 
played with at a petting zoo and a barn dance last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial tests at Iowa State University found that the  
5-month-old bear died of rabies on Aug. 27, prompting health 
officials to try to reach people as far away as Australia to tell 
them they could be at risk for the fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
	While rabies has not been ruled out as the cause of death, the  
Iowa Department of Public Health said Friday that labs at 
University of Iowa and at the Centers for Disease Control in 
Atlanta were unable to replicate the positive test result. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gary Osweiler, director of Iowa State's veterinary  
diagnostic laboratory, said the scientists in Ames stand by their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``One test resulted not in a strong positive, but in a very weak  
positive, but it was still judged a positive,'' Osweiler said. ``We 
did another test Monday, and that also was positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although saliva from the animal must penetrate the skin to  
transmit the disease, doctors warned that no chances should be 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Swenson, who opened the petting zoo on his 250-acre farm in  
Clermont in June, called the new test results ``encouraging news. 
We're just hoping and praying that this test is the right one and 
the other ones are wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Jay Jacobs Prepares for Liquidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Jay Jacobs Inc., a clothing retailer that tried  
to shift its focus from teen-agers to young professionals after a 
brush with bankruptcy in the mid-1990s, is preparing to go out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The 58-year-old company filed a Chapter 11 petition Friday and  
asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas T. Glover to grant authority for 
liquidation of inventory and termination of Rex Loren Steffey as 
president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Following liquidation, ``it currently is contemplated that the  
leases for its 114 stores in 22 states will either be rejected or 
assigned and store employees will be laid off,'' a company 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The release said 54 employees at corporate headquarters and the  
Jay Jacobs distribution center were laid off Aug. 27. As of July 
31, the company had about 1,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1941, the company became a leader in teen fashion in  
the 1960s and '70s. At its zenith in the 1980s, the chain included 
nearly 300 stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Beset by growing competition and expansion costs, Jay Jacobs  
filed for reorganization in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in May 
1994. Steffey was hired late that year and the company emerged in 
October 1995 with 153 stores and a new focus on clothing for 
professionals 18 to 34 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales failed to rebound and more stores were closed. Founder Jay  
Jacobs resigned as chairman in June 1997 and from the board that 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997 a bankruptcy judge approved a recapitalization  
as a modification to the reorganization plan, but the statement 
said the company has been short of cash since last October.

<HEADLINE> Times Mirror To Sell Sporting News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Times Mirror will sell The Sporting News and  
two job-training companies as part of a campaign to focus on its 
newspaper, magazine and flight information businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times and other  
newspapers, also announced Friday it has completed a transaction 
expected to save the company $23.5 million a year in dividends by 
reducing outstanding shares of common and preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to The Sporting News -- the nation's oldest sports  
publication -- and its sportingnews.com Internet site, Times Mirror 
will sell AchieveGlobal, a professional training company, and Allen 
Communication, which produces interactive software and job training 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also will sell StayWell, a health information  
company. It will keep Jeppesen Sanderson, a profitable unit that 
provides flight planning, information management, navigation data 
and other services to major airlines around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The anticipated sales will result in a highly focused company  
building on our core strengths,'' said Mark H. Willes, Times 
Mirror's chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror shares jumped $3.87 1/2 to $61.50 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales continue a pattern of consolidation and share buybacks  
launched by Willes after he arrived at Times Mirror in 1997, said 
newspaper industry analyst John Morton of Morton Research in Silver 
Springs, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will improve their bottom line,'' Morton said. ``Times  
Mirror has become a more newspaper-oriented company. This will 
further that, but still leave behind the very highly profitable 
Jeppesen Sanderson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of outstanding shares were reduced through a deal in  
which Times Mirror, its largest shareholder, the Chandler Trusts, 
and other affiliates each contributed assets worth $1.235 billion 
to TMCT II, a limited liability company formed by Times Mirror and 
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction reduced Times Mirror's common stock for  
financial reporting purposes by about 12.4 million shares. 
Outstanding preferred stock was reduced by 501,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar transaction was completed by Times Mirror and Chandler  
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror newspapers include the Times, Newsday, The  
Baltimore Sun and other papers. The company also publishes Field &AMP; 
Stream, Outdoor Life, Popular Science and other specialty 
magazines.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Saints PR Director Dead at 69 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Jerry Wynn, a former public relations  
director for the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers, has 
died at the age of 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn died Wednesday of complications following cancer surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	After 12 years as public relations director for the Chargers, he  
moved to New Orleans in 1977 and took the same job with the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry was the consummate artist in his field,'' said Don  
Weiss, former NFL executive director. ``He was always upbeat and 
had a great knack at dealing with all facets of the media. Because 
of this, the league used his expertise for the first Super Bowl in 
Los Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn also was sports manager for the 1984 world's fair in New  
Orleans, a media consultant for CBS Sports, a public relations 
instructor at Loyola University, a publicity director for the Fair 
Grounds race track and a public relations consultant for the city 
of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	He coordinated media transportation for Pope John Paul II's  
visit to New Orleans in 1987 and was a member of the Host Committee 
for the Republican National Convention in New Orleans in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Bobby Wynn, two daughters, a son, a  
sister and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service was scheduled for Sunday at Touro Synagogue  
in New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> 8 Die in Small Plane Crash in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A twin-engine plane carrying the  
founder of a hair replacement company hit the edge of a shopping 
center and crashed in flames early Friday, killing all eight people 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was five miles from Palm Beach International Airport  
when the pilot asked for permission to land around 3:30 a.m. It hit 
a corner of a roof, clipped power lines and burst into flames a 
half-mile from the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	No one on the ground was hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	``The voice -- the pilot or whoever it was talking -- said they  
had the airport in sight,'' said Alan Yurman, a National 
Transportation Safety Board investigator. Then the pilot shouted 
``Mayday!'' into the radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no explanation of what the emergency was,'' Yurman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the victims were affiliated in some way with the  
Chambers Hair Institute in Delray Beach, which also has a clinic in 
Troy, Mich., Yurman said. The eighth was the pilot of the 
Beechcraft King Air BE-90. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were pilot George Rivera, 47, of Tampa; Dr.  
Constantine Peter Chambers, 64, of Manalapan, who is the founder of 
the hair clinics; Andrea Coolidge, 31; Shawn Meckelburg, 19; Erica 
Jones, 22; Mindy Marino, 17; Peter Passaris; and Alan Steven 
Rivera, 19. All were from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers, who owned the plane, had a student pilot's license.  
Alan Yurman, an investigator with the National Transportation 
Safety Board, said it's unknown yet who was piloting the plane at 
the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the trip wasn't clear. The pilot took off from  
near Pontiac, Mich., and was bound for Boca Raton. He made one stop 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our office is temporarily closed due to a tragedy in our  
family,'' a recording at the hair replacement company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was registered as an air ambulance, but Yurman said he  
didn't know if it ever was used for medical purposes.

<HEADLINE> German Mark To Be Kosovo Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a major step toward severing  
Kosovo's remaining ties with Yugoslavia, the United Nations 
announced Friday that the German mark will replace the Yugoslav 
dinar as Kosovo's official currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Kouchner, head of the U.N. mission, signed a new  
regulation allowing the use of the mark, the U.S. dollar, the Swiss 
franc and other convertible currencies. But although other Western 
currencies can be used, the German mark will become the undisputed 
king. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxes are to be collected in marks and if fees are paid in  
dinars, the United Nations said an extra fee, which will be set 
later, will be tacked on to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to outlaw the dinar but we will not encourage  
the use of it,'' said U.N. official Joly Dixon. ``Anybody that 
wants to pay in dinars has to pay an additional fee for the 
transaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials said the Yugoslav government, which officially  
retains sovereignty over Kosovo despite the presence of 40,000 
NATO-led peacekeepers, was not consulted before the decision was 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to give supremacy to the German mark codifies a  
system that had been in effect unofficially for some time due to 
the weakness of the Yugoslav dinar, which is not freely 
convertible. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Yugoslav forces evacuated the province in June under  
a U.N.-sanctioned peace plan, the Germany mark circulated widely as 
a parallel currency, especially in areas controlled by the Kosovo 
Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	The German mark is the preferred currency for black market  
dealers throughout Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, officially declaring the mark as the primary  
currency is a major step in a province where the majority ethnic 
Albanian population aspires to complete independence from Serbia, 
the main Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from Russia, China and other countries, the  
United States accepted language in U.N. Security Council resolution 
1244 -- which established the peacekeeping mission -- affirming 
Yugoslav sovereignty over Kosovo until the final status is 
determined.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Sign Top Pick Stefan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Thrashers are complete for their  
first training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion team signed center Patrik Stefan to a three-year  
contract Friday, ensuring the NHL's top draft pick would be on hand 
for the start of camp in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan, who turns 19 on Sept. 16, will receive a total of $3.075  
million in base salary over the three years -- the maximum allowed 
for a rookie under the league's collective bargaining agreement -- 
but the deal was held up by the value of potential bonuses in the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I was pretty nervous about,'' said Stefan, who  
arrived in Orlando about 6 p.m. on a flight from the Los Angeles 
area. ``But it's done now. It's great to be here. I'm excited and 
everything is perfect. I can't wait to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would disclose the bonus structure, but Stefan's  
agent, Steve Kotlowitz, was looking to exceed the potentially 
most-lucrative rookie package, currently held by Tampa Bay's 
Vincent Lecavalier. 
</P>
<P>
	Lecavalier can earn up to $3 million annually in bonuses or $8  
million over the life of his three-year deal for reaching targets 
in games played, goals, assists, points, points per game and 
plus-minus rating. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of negotiations, Kotlowitz and Thrashers general  
manager Don Waddell finally agreed on the bonuses Thursday night 
and finalized the deal Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrik has the potential to be an elite player in the NHL and  
having him in camp is an important part of his development,'' 
Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan arrived in time for a team meeting Friday night. The  
Thrashers will take the ice for the first time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very important for him to be there,'' Kotlowitz said in  
a telephone interview from his office in Edmonton, Alberta. ``He's 
very much looking forward to being part of the Atlanta Thrashers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers traded up to land Stefan with the top pick in the  
draft. The 6-foot-2, 205-pounder played last season with Long Beach 
in the International Hockey League, totaling 11 goals and 24 
assists in 33 games. His playing time was limited by a pair of 
concussions, but Atlanta officials insist that his health is fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan should make the Thrashers' 23-man roster but the team is  
hoping to bring him along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not too concerned with Patrik Stefan this year or next  
year,'' Waddell said. ``We want to bring him along right. I'm more 
concerned with where he is four or five years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Atlanta agreed to a deal with its only other  
unsigned player, goalie Scott Langkow. The 24-year-old, who spent 
all but one game last season in the minors, is expected to provide 
minor-league insurance behind Damian Rhodes and Norm Maracle. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 65 players at training camp.

<HEADLINE> Army Demotes Ret. Maj. Gen. Hale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A retired Army general who was court-martialed  
last spring for having adulterous affairs with the wives of four 
subordinates says he will fight an Army decision to demote him. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hale, who retired in March 1998 as a two-star major  
general, said Army Secretary Louis Caldera acted illegally when he 
announced that Hale has been knocked down to a one-star brigadier 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	The demotion means a reduction in retirement pay that will cost  
Hale about $750 a month for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	At his court martial in March 1999, Hale admitted to the  
adulterous affairs and apologized to the Army. He pled guilty to 
seven counts of conduct unbecoming an officer and one count of 
lying to investigators. He was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and 
forfeit $12,000 of his $75,744 annual pension for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Caldera's announcement Thursday, Hale's attorney,  
Frank Spinner, issued a statement on Hale's behalf calling the 
action an ``unprecedented abuse of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While General Hale regrets the embarrassment he brought upon  
the Army that led to this result, he has no choice but to challenge 
in federal court Secretary Caldera's illegal and capricious 
decision,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Caldera is literally making up the rules as he goes  
along,'' Spinner said, adding that he knows of no other case in 
which the Army has demoted an officer after retirement. ``It is my 
belief that Congress never authorized the secretaries of the Army, 
Air Force and Navy to take this kind of action against a retired 
officer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Caldera's action, Hale's current retirement pay of $6,250 a  
month will be reduced by about $750 a month. That cut is 
retroactive to Hale's retirement date of March 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Army lawyers said it will be up to the Defense Department's  
Finance and Accounting Service to decide whether to seek 
reimbursement from Hale for a portion of the pay he has collected 
since retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army said Hale's only option for appealing the decision  
would be to petition the Army Board for Correction of Military 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
	Donnamaria Carpino, one of the women Hale had sex with, issued a  
statement endorsing the Army's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased that the Army has come to the stunning revelation  
that a court-martialed general should not retain all of his 
stars,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, who wrote to Caldera in July  
urging that Hale's rank be reduced, said she was pleased the Army 
secretary ``closed the Hale case on a high note of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This proportionate punishment sends a clear signal that the  
enforcement of regulations against sexual harassment must remain 
blind to rank or privilege,'' the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera acted on the unanimous recommendation of a panel of  
three active-duty generals convened in August to determine whether 
Hale should be allowed to keep his two-star rank. 
</P>
<P>
	When allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced in 1998, Hale  
denied them and even sued one of his accusers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was the highest-ranking Army officer to face court-martial  
since 1952. His sexual misconduct occurred while he worked in the 
NATO command in southern Europe. The resulting furor led the 
Pentagon to change its rules to bar top officers from retiring 
while facing allegations of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other case in which an Army general faced court-martial  
since Congress enacted the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1951 
was in 1952, when Maj. Gen. Robert Grow, military attache in 
Moscow, was tried on charges of dereliction of duty. Grow was 
reprimanded and suspended from command for six months.

<HEADLINE> Study: Mom's Blues Can Hinder Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mothers who suffer from depression need to  
seek help because their blues could affect their children's 
development, researchers for the government say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women need to know if they feel depressed, it's not only about  
them,'' said Sarah Friedman, who coordinated the study for the 
National Institute for Child Health and Human Development. ``It's 
also going to affect their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Children do worse on developmental tests if their mothers are  
depressed, but a mother's depression does less damage if the family 
is well off financially, said the study, released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers studied 1,200 families to see if a mother's  
depression hindered her children's learning ability in the crucial 
first three years of life. 
</P>
<P>
	They questioned mothers beginning at their children's births and  
visited their homes to watch mother-child interaction. When the 
children were 3, their readiness for school -- things such as 
counting and knowing colors and shapes -- was tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Mothers who were chronically depressed were more likely to have  
children who scored lower on the tests, the eight-year study 
concluded. The results will be published in the September issue of 
the journal Developmental Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
	Depressed women who had higher incomes and other advantages such  
as higher education were more sensitive to their children's needs, 
and their depression had lesser effect on their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money seems to be a key issue,'' said one of the researchers,  
University of North Carolina child development specialist Martha 
Cox. ``It could be a case of women in positions of seeking better 
outside child care, or giving themselves more breaks, or buying 
more services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These women have more options or more things to turn to, to  
keep their depression from affecting their relationship with the 
child,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reseachers recruited families from Arkansas, California, Kansas,  
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Washington 
and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	A mother's depression is problematical because of the theory  
that depressed moms won't interact with their children. Researchers 
said maternal blues may have the worst effect on the youngest 
babies, who depend more on their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showed that if mothers were particularly sensitive to  
their babies, regardless of depression, the children developed 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exploration and play are such an important way that children  
learn in the early years,'' Cox explained. ``Having a mother that 
can facilitate that exploration and play is important to the 
children's development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The children in the study now are in the third grade and will be  
followed at least through the sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen percent of the families were headed by single mothers,  
but interactions with fathers and other adults were not measured. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also may have underestimated depression's impact  
because teen-age mothers, disabled children or substance abusers 
were not studied, and the poorest families dropped out of the 
project.

	Israel, Palestinians Reach Agreement  
</P>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians  
concluded a long-sought agreement today for a further Israeli 
pullback from the West Bank. The deal clears the way for a possible 
overall peace accord within a year. The agreement, which will be 
signed tomorrow in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, 
plants the first seeds of a permanent peace by setting a Feb. 15 
deadline to put together a framework for a final settlement.

	Dennis Still Menace to N.C. Coast  
</P>
<P>
	SALVO, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis, which spoiled last  
weekend for vacationers on the North Carolina coast, threatened to 
wash out the last big beach weekend of summer, too. Forecasters 
said they expect the onetime hurricane to finally wade ashore on 
the state's curving southeastern coast on Sunday night, in the 
middle of the Labor Day holiday. A mandatory evacuation order was 
lifted today for beachfront neighborhoods in Nags Head, Kitty Hawk 
and Kill Devil Hills. Farther south, on Hatteras Island, where the 
raging surf chewed up the main north-south highway and choked it 
with chest-high beach sand, only four-wheel-drive traffic was 
permitted.

	Energy Dept. Admits Laser Flaws

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department admitted to serious  
problems today in a program to build the world's largest laser, 
including mismanagement that will add hundreds of millions of 
dollars to its original $1.2 billion price tag. Energy Secretary 
Bill Richardson, who said he was assured the project was on target 
as recently as June, ordered an overhaul of the program at the 
Lawrence Livermore weapons laboratory and an investigation into why 
the cost overruns were not revealed earlier. The massive laser, 
which was supposed to have been completed by 2003, is being built 
at the California research lab in a project to monitor and maintain 
America's nuclear warheads without testing nuclear bombs.

has terrorized East Timor since a historic vote earlier this week 
on independence from Indonesia. Thousands of residents fled for 
their lives and frightened U.N. workers were forced to abandon 
their posts as the militias swept through towns in much of the 
territory. With results of the vote to be announced tomorrow and 
independence widely expected to prevail, many fear the violence may 
only get worse.

inquiry into the car crash that killed Princess Diana, dismissing 
all charges against nine photographers and a press motorcyclist 
implicated in the accident. The judge's terse conclusion came in a 
one-page statement: Alcohol, drugs and excessive speed caused the 
crash that ended the life of the ``people's princess.'' Diana, her 
boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, died in the Aug. 
31, 1997, crash in a Paris traffic tunnel.

a broad rally that included the biggest point gain in the history 
of the Nasdaq composite index. At the close of trading on Wall 
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 235.24 at 
11,078.45. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange led 
decliners 2,290-677. The Nasdaq rose 108.34 to 2,842.58, according

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises With Stocks, Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar staged a broad, sharp advance Friday,  
following the course of U.S. stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	A report of less-than-expected increases in wages and new jobs  
in the United States dampened inflation jitters and bolstered 
American markets. The dollar benefited as investments poured into 
the rising American markets before the three-day Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to 110.05 Japanese yen in late New York from  
109.11 yen Thursday, when it was at a seven-month low. The dollar's 
gains also undercut the euro, which fell to $1.0612 from $1.0686, 
and the British pound, which dropped to $1.6026 from $1.6067. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had been under pressure in recent trading as  
economies overseas begin showing new signs of strength and 
inflation fears rose in the United States. As U.S. stocks and bonds 
slumped earlier this week, there were fears that investors would 
dump dollars as they unloaded American securities. 
</P>
<P>
	But an unemployment report of only a modest rise in wages and a  
smaller-than-expected rise in the number of new jobs calmed fears 
that a 4.2 percent jobless rate -- the lowest in 29 years -- was 
rekindling inflation. In Friday's rally, the Dow Jones industrial 
average shot up 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq composite index surged 
almost 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the gains in U.S. financial markets Friday on the  
brighter inflation outlook did not remove the long-term questions 
about the dollar, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also rose to 1.5067 Swiss francs from 1.4936, but  
slipped to 1.4921 Canadian dollars from 1.4952. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8433 German 
marks, up from 1.8301; 6.1819 French francs, up from 6.1379; and 
1,824.80 Italian lire, up from 1,811.80.

<HEADLINE> Woman Donates Kidney to Stranger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Several transplant centers turned down a  
50-year-old woman's offer to donate one of her kidneys to a 
stranger in need before a hospital here agreed to the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman endured surgery and a battery of physical and  
psychological tests at the University of Minnesota's hospital 
simply because she knew there was a long waiting list for organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The donor was ``purely motivated by altruism,'' said Cheryl  
Jacobs, a social worker who took part in the psychological 
screening of the woman. Hospital officials said they were 
convinced, after intense psychological and physical screening, that 
she made the offer for the right reasons and knew the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The donor and the recipient both asked to keep their identities  
secret, even from each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The transplant took place in early August but wasn't disclosed  
until Thursday, after the patients had left the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Transplanted kidneys generally come from a cadaver or a living  
relative. Transplant programs have been reluctant to accept kidney 
donations from living strangers for several reasons, including 
concern about exposing the donor to the risks of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical risks to the donor are considered quite low, although in  
this case, the donor had to spend three to four days in the 
hospital, and up to six weeks at home recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Living, unrelated transplantation is growing in the United  
States,'' said Dr. William Bennett, president of the American 
Society of Nephrology. ``It was always felt before, why use a 
living patient when you could use a cadaver donor? But it turns out 
the fact that the donor is living confers some advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Arthur Matas, who performed the transplant, published a  
study in 1992 in The Lancet, a British medical journal, that found 
that people who live with one kidney after donating the other are 
not at increased risk of suffering from kidney failure or 
hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42,000 people on the kidney transplant waiting list now have  
to wait between three and five years for a new organ. Two decades 
ago, the wait was only about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, doctors have been discussing the ethical issues  
surrounding unrelated transplants for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital is approached about a half-dozen times a month by  
people asking if they can donate kidneys, but until recently, there 
was no system to screen the callers, identify their true motives 
and put their kidney into a pool for recipients.

<HEADLINE> Christie Attends Discipline Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Linford Christie, the 1992 Olympic 100-meter  
champion, appeared before a disciplinary panel Friday on a drug 
charge but wasn't expected to know the outcome of the hearing until 
after the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Though retired and only running for fun while he coaches other  
sprinters, Christie was suspended after testing positive for the 
steroid Nandrolone after an indoor meet at Dortmund, Germany, in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	UK Athletics, the sport's national governing body, said the  
39-year-old Briton faced a three-man panel at the hearing. If found 
guilty, he faces a two-year ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hearing has concluded and we will make a further  
announcement as soon as the outcome is known,'' UK Athletics 
spokeswoman Jayne Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong anti-drug campaigner, Christie has declared his  
innocence since the result of his test was announced Aug. 4 and 
vowed to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have consistently opposed the use of banned substances by  
athletes and it is ridiculous to imagine I would take them after my 
retirement,'' Christie said after UK Athletics confirmed his 
positive test. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am completely innocent of any wrongdoing and any case  
against me will be vigorously defended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UK Athletics has launched a campaign for more reliable tests for  
Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey was the latest high-profile  
athlete to test positive for the steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Jamaican withdrew from the World Championships  
just before the start of competition after learning that traces of 
Nandrolone were found in her urine sample at a meet in Lucerne, 
Switzerland, on July 5. Ottey also has vowed to clear her name.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Still Menaces N.C. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Like the fictional character of the same  
name, Dennis won't leave his neighbors alone and is making a mess 
of the yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Wilson says: Go Home Dennis the Menace,'' proclaimed a  
sign at one restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents up and down North Carolina's Outer Banks expressed  
similar sentiments. The only people apparently happy with the storm 
were two surfers spotted Thursday afternoon floating on their 
boards off the beach village of Frisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Stiff wind gusting up to 60 mph, showers and 14-foot waves  
assaulted the state's northern coast for a fifth day today. Road 
crews worked to clean up the mess Dennis made. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis first battered the North Carolina shoreline as a  
hurricane on Monday, then headed out to sea and weakened. But 
within a day, it was backtracking toward the Outer Banks, this time 
downgraded to a tropical storm. 
</P>
<P>
	By this afternoon, the storm was about 190 miles south-southeast  
of Cape Hatteras. The storm was drifting erratically, with maximum 
sustained wind around the core of 60 mph. Forecasters believe 
Dennis will begin moving slowly to the west by Saturday. There is a 
chance it could come ashore Sunday or Monday, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erosion experts compared Dennis to a nor'easter, the winter  
storm that does not pack a hurricane's wallop but stays longer, 
making it worse for beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that beaches along the Outer Banks were already  
in bad shape to begin with,'' said Bill Cleary, who studies barrier 
islands at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. ``Over the 
past 25 years, these beaches have been hit by several hundred 
nor'easters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Outer Banks -- a thin, 130-mile strand of barrier islands  
-- the storm wreaked havoc on Hatteras Island's lifeline, N.C. 12, 
ripping out some sections of road and heaping chest-deep beach sand 
on others. At a quarter-mile neck of Hatteras Island just north of 
Buxton, Dennis created a trench cutting the island in half, then 
filled it in with sand. 
</P>
<P>
	Battered N.C. 12 was opened to islanders in four-wheel-drive  
vehicles, but it may be days before regular traffic is permitted on 
the island. The stretch near Buxton where the ocean cut through can 
be drive across only at low tide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Highway 12 is now passable,'' state public safety Secretary  
Richard Moore said today. ``The roadbed, or parts of the roadbed, 
are there for people who know what they are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dare County Sheriff Bert Austin, trapped at his home on Hatteras  
all week, said tourists will be able to leave the island with their 
cars later today when the ferry to Ocracoke and the mainland 
reopens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to some people from Pennsylvania who have been here  
14 days on their summer vacation,'' Austin said today. ``They've 
been very patient, but they're ready to roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the islanders plan to stay, he said. ``I don't think you  
could tear them out chained to a bulldozer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Transportation called in 181 pieces of  
equipment, 200 employees and 200 prisoners to clean sand and 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucker Andrew Hoffman, who left his home in Salvo on Sunday to  
make deliveries as far away as Pennsylvania, waited in Manteo for 
word that he could go back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get home and see what happened,'' Hoffman said.  
``The not knowing is rough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An evacuation order for neighborhoods in Nags Head, Kitty Hawk  
and Kill Devil Hills north of Hatteras Island was lifted this 
morning. Visitors were welcome in the beach towns over the Labor 
Day weekend but they should confirm reservations first. 
</P>
<P>
	While waiting for commercial deliveries to resume, islanders  
have been supplied with emergency food, water and repair materials 
by helicopters and convoys of National Guard vehicles racing to 
avoid high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	Power and water service had been restored to much of the island  
by Thursday, but phones still were down. 
</P>
<P>
	Electric power also was restored on Ocracoke Island, which had  
operated for days on generator power, and a ferry loaded with heavy 
equipment left Cedar Island on Thursday to begin clearing roads 
there, said state Public Safety Secretary Richard Moore. He said 
another ferry bearing a fuel truck and food would head there later. 
</P>
<P>
	On Hatteras Island, steep escarpments were seen along the beach  
in front of houses washed under by waves and along deserted 
stretches of Cape Hatteras National Seashore 
</P>
<P>
	The erosion caved in a swimming pool at a beachfront motel and  
also claimed five houses in the village of Rodanthe and one in 
Kitty Hawk, where others showed signs of being undermined. Scores 
more houses were left with waves washing under them and dangling 
decks and steps.

<HEADLINE> EPA Officials Plead Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Two Environmental Protection Agency employees  
accused of falsifying documents pleaded innocent Friday to 
obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc M. Radell, 40, and Claudia Johnson, 36, are also charged  
with conspiracy to obstruct justice and perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Radell and Johnson were indicted by a federal grand jury last  
week for allegedly falsifying documents that backed up the agency's 
legal defense of its decision to let Indian tribes regulate their 
own water quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials allege the two falsified and  
backdated EPA documents that were required for the agency's 1996 
decision to let three tribes regulate water standards on their 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	The state of Wisconsin sued over the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreements with the tribes -- the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa  
band, the Oneida tribe and the Menominee tribe -- were withdrawn. 
The case was dismissed and the EPA was ordered to pay Wisconsin and 
other parties about $369,000 in attorney's fees and costs.

<HEADLINE> Coke Forecast Causes Stock To Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Blaming struggling foreign economies that have  
impeded sales overseas, The Coca-Cola Co. said Friday that 
third-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The news didn't go over well with investors, causing Coke's  
stock price to drop nearly 4 percent, or $2.12 1/2 to $57.37 1/2 in 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based Coca-Cola predicted earnings per share will be  
34 cents to 35 cents this quarter, compared with analysts' 
predictions of 36 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, the company said it will reduce earnings by an  
additional 2 cents to 3 cents a share because of the recall 
stemming from a health scare linked to Coke in Belgium and France. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke blamed slow growth in beverage sales on the continuing  
economic turmoil abroad. Though it's still having trouble in 
Russia, Venezuela, Colombia and parts of Eastern Europe. But sales 
are expected to improve in other foreign markets, such as 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of those markets are beginning to return to what I would  
call a healthy status,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of 
Beverage Digest. ``It sounds like it may now be starting to come 
out of some of the difficult times it's faced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke also said it expects retail sales in the United States to  
improve after it decided to raise prices earlier this year. Sicher 
agreed, saying the decision hurt Coke sales at first, but 
competitors are matching the higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the company's largest market, the United States, we're  
going to see improved performance in the fourth quarter and the 
year 2000,'' Sicher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke warned fourth quarter earnings could also be affected by  
the recall. The company plans to keep up an aggressive marketing 
campaign to win back consumers. Efforts have included free-drink 
giveaways and putting Coca-Cola ``greeters'' in supermarkets to 
talk with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trends indicate that consumer confidence levels are on track  
to return to pre-incident levels by the end of the year,'' William 
P. Casey, president of Coke's Greater Europe Group, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it expects its operations in Turkey to be  
affected by the recent earthquake disaster and its Chinese 
operations to be hurt by recent flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's main rival, PepsiCo, said Thursday that it also expects  
lower beverage sales in the third quarter, though strong sales of 
snack food and fruit juice will keep profits on track with 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of PepsiCo were up $1.006 1/4 cents at $34.62 1/2 in trading on  
the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Six Killed in Maryland House Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- A couple and their four children were found  
dead in a house fire early today in this Baltimore suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire broke out about 4:30 a.m. and was extinguished in about  
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	All the victims were found on the second floor, Baltimore County  
fire Lt. Glen Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames were intense in the back of the first floor and the  
second floor was already fully engulfed when firefighters arrived, 
``making a rescue attempt futile,'' fire spokesman Mark Hubbard 
said. ``Nobody could survive in those conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors, awakened by a barking dog, tried to wake the family.  
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed at the door, banging,'' neighbor David Rice said.  
They could hear the home's smoke alarms sounding inside. ``We just 
couldn't raise them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dog was found dead in a kennel on the first floor.  
</P>
<P>
	The family had attended the Orioles game Thursday evening, when  
Cal Ripken hit his 400th home run, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire was under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Killed were Marie Jamison, 33; her two children, James McCready,  
10, and Brandon McCready, 6; her husband, Raymond Jamison, 39; and 
his two sons -- Raymond Jr., 12, and Jacob, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	At Norwood Elementary School, which Brandon and Jacob attended  
and the other two boys used to attend, crisis counselors met with 
classmates today, principal Harry Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous loss of the school community,'' he said.  
``We are very close here. It's like the loss in a family because we 
are so close.''

<HEADLINE> Internet's 30th Birthday Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thirty years after the first primitive  
Internet connection, the scientists who pioneered the technology 
and the entrepreneurs profiting from it tried to predict what's 
next for the global computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	Their conclusion? It could become invisible.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet will become transparent to us,'' said Len  
Kleinrock, a University of California, Los Angeles computer science 
professor. ``It will be everywhere, always available and not in our 
face -- just like electricity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinrock spoke Thursday at a conference marking the anniversary  
of the first Internet connection, which took place in his lab Sept. 
2, 1969. Then, few people cared when bits of data first flowed 
between two bulky machines linked by a 15-foot cable. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has since expanded into a force that is changing the  
way people work, learn, play and shop. New technologies are 
emerging that could allow fast access over the airwaves, and not 
just through computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't want to be connected to their desktops,''  
said Robert Kahn, president of the Corporation for National 
Research Initiatives and a computer language creator. ``They want 
to be able to move around and have access to all that 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several executives agreed, suggesting the Internet should become  
a force that works behind the scenes to carry information to 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``A user does not understand what is happening behind the  
computer screen,'' said George Vradenburg III, senior vice 
president of America Online. ``The future is in the art of making 
it disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But future advances will likely remain based on the same  
technology that was first tested in Kleinrock's lab in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The project grew from the needs of the Defense Department's  
Advance Research Projects Agency, which was formed after the Soviet 
Union's 1957 launch of Sputnik, the first manmade satellite to 
orbit the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials wanted a fast, efficient, decentralized way of sharing  
information between research centers. And the computers needed to 
speak a common language 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinrock pioneered the technology as a graduate student at  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, writing the first paper on 
the subject in 1961. He became a professor at UCLA in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	His lab was chosen for the first test communication, and by the  
end of 1969, four sites were connected: UCLA, the Stanford Research 
Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara and the 
University of Utah. The number increased to 10 within seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, there were applications like e-mail and file transfer  
utilities, but it wasn't until the late 1980s, when the World Wide 
Web appeared, that the network became a force not only in research 
but also in commerce and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the conference, the refrigerator-size Interface Message  
Processor, a translator between the early computers, made a rare 
public appearance. Its rows of lights were dark and its battleship 
gray case was opened, exposing wires, fans and other components. 
</P>
<P>
	It was used in the first test, and decommissioned in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Details of the Unemployment Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The nation's unemployment rate inched down to 4.2 percent in  
August, returning to a 29-year low and helping some workers who 
historically have had a harder time finding jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of unemployed blacks fell to 7.8 percent from July's  
8.8 percent. The August rate still was more than double the 3.7 
percent rate for whites, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the unemployment rate for Hispanics crept up to 6.5  
percent in August from 6.2 percent in July, Labor Secretary Alexis 
Herman said unemployment rates for Hispanics as well as blacks are 
near record lows. 
</P>
<P>
	The black unemployment rate hit a record low of 7.3 percent in  
June, and Hispanic unemployment was at a record low rate of 5.8 
percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In other details:  
</P>
<P>
	--The unemployment rate for whites remained unchanged at 3.7  
percent, the same rate as in July. 
</P>
<P>
	--The jobless rate for adult women fell to 3.7 percent from 4  
percent, while the rate for adult men rose slightly to 3.6 percent 
from 3.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The rate of unemployed teen-agers climbed to 13.5 percent from  
12.7 percent, as many left summer jobs to return to school.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Dispute Federal Loan Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Clarice Stahl and others like her may have  
signed away the farm 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A widow living near Saco, Mrs. Stahl was surprised earlier this  
year when the federal Farm Service Agency demanded $75,000 in 
connection with the 1989 renegotiation of her mortgage. With prices 
for wheat and cattle in the cellar, she doesn't have $75,000, and 
fears she will lose the farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the widow who is on the end of it here, and I'm concerned  
about what I'm going to do,'' said Mrs. Stahl, who is in her 70s 
and had entered the loan agreement with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	She is among 10,600 U.S. farmers, 212 of them in Montana, who  
got partial writeoffs of federal loans over the last decade to help 
them avoid foreclosure and continue farming. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Service Agency says that in return, it expected that  
after 10 years the borrowers would pay back what was written off, 
or half of their farms' gain in value, whichever was less. 
</P>
<P>
	Some borrowers dispute that interpretation, saying their  
understanding was that the payback was required only if they got 
out of farming during the 10 years. By their interpretation, 
staying in farming the full 10 years means the writeoff should be 
extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Stahl and many of the 4,200 other U.S. farmers who  
signed in 1989, when the deals were first offered, the 10-year mark 
has arrived and the disputed wording could decide whether they can 
keep their farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the farmers are unable to produce the cash in this time  
of low prices for beef, wheat and other commodities, and they are 
questioning the property appraisals that the government arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Stahl was notified her cattle and grain farm gained  
$150,000 in value over the decade, and based on that, the Farm 
Service Agency wanted $75,000. Unable to make a lump-sum payment, 
she looked into the agency's plan that allows payments spread over 
25 years, and was found ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Farm Service Agency has granted a one-year  
extension on repayment, but that is hardly relief, said Dennis 
Garsjo, Mrs. Stahl's financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``A year from now she'll be in the same situation, because she  
still won't be able to write a check for $75,000, plus 5 percent 
interest,'' Garsjo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Service Agency is trying to help by offering extensions  
that may be renewed up to three years, said Bob Zimmerman, senior 
loan officer at the agency's offices in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers also could get a bit of a break under a proposed rule  
change and a bill sponsored by Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont. Both 
would require that appraisals of farms exclude capital investment, 
such as equipment purchases, made during the 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials say that in calling for payment, they are  
simply carrying out the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This went with the territory,'' Zimmerman said. ``Although the  
commodity prices have been difficult these last years, the 
agreements have to be dealt with nevertheless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said some borrowers may not have fully grasped the  
obligations they were taking on, but he disagreed with those who 
say the contract language is ambiguous. He noted that in the 
unlikely event that a borrower's property value did not rise, no 
money is due.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Rise on Crop Outlook / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures jumped higher early today on the  
Chicago Board of Trade after private forecasts suggested the crop 
will be smaller than official reports estimate. Grain futures also 
were slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth straight day that soybeans headed upward,  
although gains were expected to be limited amid profit-taking ahead 
of the three-day Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp gains early were in response to an estimate the previous  
day by Farmers Commodities Corp. of Des Moines, Iowa, that pegged 
the 1999-2000 soybean crop at 2.736 billion bushels. That fell well 
shy of the Department of Agriculture's August forecast of 2.87 
billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn opened slightly higher before turning mixed amid light  
profit-taking in advance of the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also opened higher but hit resistance because of U.S.  
spring wheat harvest delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1/4 cent to $2.71 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1/4 cent to $2.22 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 1/2 
cent to $1.16 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1 3/4 cents to $4.97 1/4 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were slightly higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .18 cent to 66.85 cents a bushel;  
October feeder cattle rose .03 cent to 79.15 cents a bushel; 
October lean hogs fell .85 cent to 46.20 cents a bushel; February 
pork bellies fell 2.57 cents to 54.75 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Asks Review of Twins Antitrust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- State Attorney General Mike Hatch this  
morning asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a state Supreme 
Court decision which held that the Minnesota Twins were exempt from 
antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organized baseball, unlike any other sport or industry, claims  
to have a complete and blanket exemption from antitrust laws,'' 
Hatch said in a statement. ``The state of Minnesota believes it has 
the right to look at professional baseball to see if they have 
violated antitrust laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court's ruling in April temporarily ended a  
state investigation into whether baseball officials conspired to 
get public money for a ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said neither the Twins nor major league baseball could  
be forced to comply with an investigation begun by former Attorney 
General Hubert Humphrey III and continued by Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important to pursue the possibility that the independent  
owners of baseball may be threatening to boycott communities which 
do not increase public subsidies for ballparks,'' Hatch said in the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey had asked for papers going back to 1959 to determine  
whether baseball officials illegally conspired by threatening to 
move franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins and the league argued that their conduct was exempt  
from state and federal antitrust laws because the U.S. Supreme 
Court has held that the business of professional baseball was 
exempt. The state Supreme Court followed that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the sale and relocation of a baseball  
franchise ... is an integral part of the business of professional 
baseball and falls within the exemption,'' Justice Paul H. Anderson 
wrote in the Minnesota Supreme Court's unanimous decision in April. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote that the exemption ``may be an aberration'' carved out  
by the U.S. Supreme Court, but the nation's highest court should 
retain the exclusive privilege of overruling its own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey began the investigation in December 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	A Ramsey County judge last year ordered the team to comply with  
the investigation, but only as far back as 1992. The judge stayed 
the order while the Twins' appeal was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The order covered all documents related to revenue sharing,  
potential relocation and sale of major league baseball teams, and 
the construction and methods for obtaining new ballparks in 
Minnesota and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Still Threatens N.C. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALVO, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis, which spoiled last  
weekend for vacationers on the North Carolina coast, threatened to 
wash out the last big beach weekend of summer, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said they expect the onetime hurricane to finally  
wade ashore on the state's curving southeastern coast on Sunday 
night, in the middle of the Labor Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacationers and residents alike were sick and tired of the  
11-day-old storm, whether it disrupted their summer break or 
wrecked their hopes for a money-making tourist-filled weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to go home,'' said Pete Wilcox, as he sat at a  
roadblock in Nags Head on Friday, trying to reach his home in 
Rodanthe, on Hatteras Island. ``I've been out of work a week and 
don't need that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A mandatory evacuation order was lifted on Friday for beachfront  
neighborhoods in Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills. 
Farther south, on Hatteras Island, where the raging surf chewed up 
the main north-south highway and choked it with chest-high beach 
sand, only four-wheel-drive traffic was permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	But by then, many of the hundreds of thousands of vacationers  
who each summer pack the Outer Banks, a 130-mile stretch of barrier 
islands, were long gone. About 130,000 people live on the coast, 
but during the summer that grows fivefold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally we would be full for all three days,'' said Nancy  
Newins, manager of Lucille's Motel in Carolina Beach, surveying 
bookings for fewer than half her rooms Friday. ``We're hoping the 
storm goes away and everybody sees it on the news and hurries 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, then-Hurricane Dennis sideswiped the coast without  
ever coming ashore, though it dumped up to 8 inches of rain and 
dished out 20-foot waves and 100 mph winds. Then it headed out to 
sea. But soon it began backtracking. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday night, the storm was about 160 miles south-southeast  
of Cape Hatteras and drifting toward the west-northwest near 2 mph 
with sustained winds around 60 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis could strengthen before coming ashore after midnight  
Sunday, Jack Beven, a hurricane specialist at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. But he warned that Dennis has confounded 
predictions before. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it has done since it got east of Hatteras is on the  
strange side,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, state Public Safety Secretary Richard Moore warned  
beachgoers: ``We have the prospect of having a lot of rain and wind 
in the state this weekend, or we may not have any at all. We just 
don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Cards' Swann May Be Back in 6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Standout defensive tackle Eric Swann, who  
hasn't played a football game since the middle of last season, 
hopes to be back in the Arizona Cardinals' lineup in 6-8 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a whole lot longer than the Cardinals were expecting just  
a few short weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann said his recovery from major surgery on his arthritic  
right knee is taking longer than initially expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking his long silence, Swann spoke on a conference call from  
his home on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When training camp began, the Cardinals hoped the two-time Pro  
Bowl performer would be ready for the Sept. 12 opener at 
Philadelphia. But as the days passed and he was not able to do much 
beyond riding a stationary bicycle and other rehabilitation 
exercises, it became obvious he would not be ready that soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not bothered by it,'' Swann said, ``because I have to be  
100 percent when I step back on the field, and that's a fact. I 
can't go out there half-ready or a quarter-ready, I've got to be 
100 percent. The surgery was a very aggressive surgery, and 
sometimes it takes longer than usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Swann's timetable is accurate, at the earliest he wouldn't be  
back until the Oct. 17 home game against Washington. Arizona has 
the following week off, then plays New England at home on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann went to San Francisco on Wednesday to be examined by Dr.  
Richard Steadman, the noted knee specialist who performed the 
surgery on Dec. 7. Tests conducted by Steadman showed the strength 
and flexibility of the knee increased from 50 percent to 80 percent 
of normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann played in seven games last season, then had surgery. The  
team expected him back in a few weeks, but he was dissatisfied with 
the results and went to Steadman, the Colorado-based doctor who 
performed major surgery on Olympic gold medalist skier Picabo 
Street and many other noted athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a smart decision on my behalf,'' he said. ``It's a  
personal decision and it's not against anybody else. Eric Swann has 
to take care of Eric Swann.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steadman performed an unusual ``microfacture'' surgery designed  
to help regenerate cartilage growth. Swann said he was in extreme 
pain, and his career would have been over if he tried to play the 
remainder of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to take the knee and just split it in half and  
look at it, there's a lot of wear and tear in the hard cartilage on 
the bones there,'' Swann said. ``There were a lot of bald spots 
there that were actually wearing out. There were nerves hitting 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a situation like that, it makes it very tender  
to walk around and very tender to get in the squatting position and 
play, because you've got a lot of grind. On top of that, you add 
300-plus or 600-plus pounds of guys double-teaming you and cutting 
you and you've got a pretty heavy, spicy, ouchy dish, if you know 
what I mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Swann said, ``if things stay on course and there aren't any  
terrible setbacks or anything and I don't rush it, I could play 
another five or six years easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann hadn't spoken to reporters about his condition since  
before last year's first surgery. In his brief conference call, he 
insisted he was not bothered by the criticism he received from fans 
and local sports talk show hosts who thought he should have played 
through the pain as the Cardinals made their postseason run. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an old saying that we use in football,'' he said.  
```When you're well, you're hell. When you're hurt, you're dirt.' 
I'm not really moved by what people say in their comments or 
anything like that. People have a right to their opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann refused to criticize the Cardinals organization.  
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, they've been pretty supportive,'' he said. ``Of  
course, they want you on the football field. That's what they hired 
me to do. When you're not out there, there's always that pressure 
to get back out there earlier. But overall, I would say I've been 
pretty satisfied with the support I've received from my club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said Wednesday's  
examination ``means he's going in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, since we've come back down to the valley, the heat's  
helped Eric's conditioning,'' Tobin said. ``He's continued to work 
at it, so I'm encouraged.''

<HEADLINE> Most Wanted U.S. Fugitive Is Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After more than a decade of freedom in Central  
America, the No. 1 fugitive on the U.S. Marshal Service's ``15 Most 
Wanted'' list was arrested at an Atlanta airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Paul Zink, a fugitive since 1988, will stand trial in  
Wisconsin on charges of running a large cocaine ring there. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested Thursday as he stepped off a plane at Hartsfield  
International Airport under the guard of State Department 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Zink, 43, was arrested in Guatemala in February, but officials  
there refused to extradite him to the U.S. to face drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Guatemalan immigration officials expelled Zink as  
an ``undesirable person,'' said Robert McMichael, U.S. Marshal for 
the Northern District of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemalan officials, working with representatives from the U.S.  
State Department, put Zink on a flight Thursday morning. State 
Department officials then guarded him on the flight, McMichael 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zink was No. 1 on the U.S. Marshal's list because of the length  
of time he was a fugitive and because he was considered dangerous, 
McMichael said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zink had been arrested before for homicide, attempted murder and  
weapons and drug possession, but the Marshal Service said on 
Thursday it didn't know if he had been convicted or served time in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to federal charges of conspiracy to distribute  
cocaine, Zink also was wanted on murder-solicitation charges in 
Kenosha County, Wis., for allegedly hiring a gunman to kill a 
police informant in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Zink had family in Guatemala and was found working as a  
freelance guide, providing tours of Mayan ruins under the name 
Marcos Potts. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Zink used his brother's vital statistics to  
obtain a passport to leave the United States. His brother, Kevin, 
was convicted in 1990 of assisting his flight.

<HEADLINE> Cookies Recalled Over Nut Allergy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A labeling error that could result in serious,  
even life-threatening, repercussions to people allergic to nuts is 
prompting a Canadian company to recall certain bags of Sensational 
Gourmet chocolate chip cookies sold in 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The cookies may contain pecans, although they are not listed as  
an ingredient. People allergic to nuts should not eat the recalled 
cookies, but return them to the place of purchase for a refund. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled cookies are in 12-ounce bags marked with the codes  
``Best By Feb. 24 OOD'' or ``Best By Feb. 24 OOE.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colonial Cookies of Kitchener, Ontario, said Friday they were  
sold in grocery and convenience stores in Connecticut, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode 
Island, Virginia and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	A Connecticut child had a mild allergic reaction, prompting  
Colonial Cookies to suspect some of its cookies with pecans may 
have been mixed up in packaging with the chocolate chip variety.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President and Mrs. Clinton the happy  
buyers of a five-bedroom Dutch Colonial house in a wooded New York 
City suburb, you'd think the first family would be pleased to learn 
the dwelling's seller is a political contributor.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Wins Court Approval for Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- He owns six scoring titles, a couple of  
Stanley Cups and a handful of National Hockey League records. Now 
Super Mario owns the Penguins, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 2 1/2 years after playing his final game, Mario Lemieux --  
who brought championship trophies to a once-troubled Pittsburgh 
franchise and battled back from Hodgkin's disease -- got the hat 
trick Friday when a bankruptcy judge made him the first retired 
player to become owner of a major sports team for which he played. 
</P>
<P>
	It took U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz a few minutes to  
consummate a $95 million closing that puts the franchise in 
Lemieux's hands and ends a 10-month odyssey by ensuring the 
Penguins stay in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the puck's on Mr. Lemieux's stick and we've all seen what  
he's been able to do with that,'' Markovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour later, Lemieux appeared in a natty business  
suit and was introduced to reporters as the new owner. He began his 
new career by lowering ticket prices on 3,500 seats at the Civic 
Arena and announcing the creation of a section of seats where 
families can buy tickets at reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Craig Patrick will run the hockey side of the  
organization; Lemieux promised he will stay on the business side of 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless somebody wants to know what the Hall of Fame center has  
to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants me to, I'll be glad to give him my opinion,''  
Lemieux said, flashing a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little to smile about in the days leading up to final  
approval of the deal. Negotiations over a deal at the Civic Arena 
were breaking down with SMG, the Philadelphia-based group that 
leases the facility and rents space to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	It took an early morning conference call Wednesday between  
Lemieux's group, SMG, the governor's office and U.S. Sen. Rick 
Santorum to finalize a deal. SMG will invest $5 million in the team 
and Lemieux will pay $1.5 million in debts to the arena management 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG will lease space to the team until 2004, after which time  
SMG's role would be reduced -- if the team is still playing at the 
38-year-old facility. Lemieux said he wants a new facility, but 
said it was not a priority in his first hour on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to bring the team out of bankruptcy. We have to  
make it viable now. Hopefully, we can make this a great success 
story,'' Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG attorney Daniel Shapira said the two parties, which have had  
a rocky relationship, will be forced to get along now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, the Penguins will thrive and survive in  
Pittsburgh,'' Shapira said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was last October when former co-owner Roger Marino took the  
franchise into bankruptcy court for protection from creditors. 
Lemieux, who sued Marino for some $30 million in salary by the 
Penguins, became the head of a committee of creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later he was putting together a bid for the team.  
</P>
<P>
	On June 24 this year, Markovitz -- whose only options were to  
approve the Lemieux plan or sign off on an alternative proposal 
that could have moved the franchise, possibly to Portland -- gave 
Lemieux the go-ahead. Lemieux said at the time he felt ``like a 
rookie again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has more than a dozen investors in his group, with some  
$52 million raised so far and more expected. He has the largest 
stake of all the owners, most of it coming in the deferred salary 
he was owed from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a businessman just yet, but everyone can learn,''  
Lemieux said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins begin training camp Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new era, for sure,'' said Patrick, who said he was a  
little worried about the prospect of starting training camp without 
the deal being finalized. ``I was afraid if this wasn't done, where 
the funds were coming from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he will address the team next week at training  
camp, likely just telling the younger players that they have a 
chance that shouldn't be squandered. 
</P>
<P>
	He would know.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you,'' Lemieux said, ``I'm real excited to be  
back.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Admits Laser Flaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is ordering  
an overhaul of an ambitious $1.2 billion program to build the 
world's largest laser after finding hundreds of millions of dollars 
in cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he was erroneously assured as recently as June  
that the project at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 
California was on target and within budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive laser, which will be housed in a facility as large  
as a football field and include 192 beams once completed, is a key 
part of a program to monitor and maintain America's nuclear 
warheads without actually testing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department officials said mismanagement discovered  
recently may cause the project's cost to soar as much as $350 
million above the originally projected $1.2 billion and delay the 
scheduled 2003 completion date by at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's announcement Friday came a week after an  
embarrassing disclosure about the former project director's 
academic credentials. Edward Campbell resigned the post after it 
became known that for years he had implied he held a doctorate in 
electrical engineering when he had never completed his dissertation 
at Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell remains an employee at Livermore. Department officials  
said his resignation was not related directly to the cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, run by  
the University of California, did not immediately return telephone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharply critical of the university's handling of the laser  
construction, Richardson said he has ordered $2 million of the 
university's $5.6 million good-performance fee withheld because of 
the laser project problems. Additional money may be held back after 
a more thorough investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university ``must assume a stronger role in oversight of  
research and development projects'' such as the laser, Richardson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was particularly miffed about long delays in notifying him  
about management and cost problems surrounding the project, 
formally called the National Ignition Facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``As late as early June, ... I was informed that NIF was on cost  
and on schedule,'' Richardson said. He said he has directed an 
independent panel of experts to investigate what happened and 
recommend how to get the project back on course. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cost overruns stem from underestimating the difficulty of  
assembling the high-precision optical components of the 192-beam 
laser system, said a senior Energy Department official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson directed that a new contractor be found to carry out  
the final assembly and integration of the facility. The weapons lab 
retains overall responsibility for the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, Bruce Tarter, director of the Livermore lab, assured  
lawmakers at a congressional budget hearing that the project was 
progressing without problems and said half the 192 beams would be 
available by 2002. The project would be completed in 2003, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased to report that NIF construction is on budget and  
on schedule,'' Tarter testified. He asked for $248.1 million in 
construction funds for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. He said 87 
percent of the $1.2 billion total cost would be committed by the 
end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its inception in 1997, the program has been the object of  
seven scientific and four management reviews, the latest last 
spring. ``Clearly we have had a major project management 
surprise,'' Richardson said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Appears at Fund Raisers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKANEATELES, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton ended her New  
York vacation the same way it began: raising money for her 
all-but-declared U.S. Senate run. 
</P>
<P>
	After a quiet day out of the public eye, Mrs. Clinton appeared  
at two fund-raisers Thursday night, with President Clinton in tow. 
It was the First Family's final full day of vacationing in upstate 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big deal. The biggest deal,'' said Joe Rainone,  
owner of Mulrooney's, a downtown Syracuse pub where one of the 
fund-raisers was held. 
</P>
<P>
	Both events benefited Mrs. Clinton's senatorial exploratory  
committee. She has spent the summer on a ``listening tour'' of New 
York trying to decide whether to run for the U.S. Senate seat being 
vacated by the retiring Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The first fund-raising stop for Mrs. Clinton was at the home of  
Edward Green, a law firm president. About 200 people attended the 
two-hour cocktail party at a cost of up to $1,000 apiece. The event 
raised $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's a very intelligent woman,'' said Dorothy  
Staller, one of the guests invited to the cocktail party. ``She 
would make a very competent senator for the state. The Rodham 
Clinton campaign will have a lot of very nasty people attacking 
her. And I'm already very angry. I think she's a very highly 
qualified person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Mulrooney's, about 250 people paid at least $250 apiece to  
meet the Clintons and have their photographs taken with the 
presidential couple. The party raised another $105,000 for Mrs. 
Clinton's likely run for U.S. Senate, said John Kinney, the 
fund-raiser's organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was incredible. They were so nice and courteous. They took  
time to meet everyone. They were very personable,'' Rainone said. 
``She didn't actually say it. But she made it very clear she was 
going to be running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both fund-raisers were closed to the public. Hundreds of people  
lined the streets in Cazenovia hoping to shake hands with the 
Clintons. Thousands were out in downtown Syracuse looking for the 
same opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the presidential motorcade did not stop either place  
and onlookers had to settle for fleeting glances of a waving 
president and first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon arriving in New York last weekend, the Clintons attended  
fund-raisers on Long Island. Over the course of the trip, Mrs. 
Clinton expected to raise about $800,000 for her exploratory 
campaign committee.

<HEADLINE>  More Fighting in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Anti-independence militiamen occupied  
towns and villages across East Timor today, and police evacuated 
dozens of U.N. staff workers from one of the many areas that were 
under siege by the marauding gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are burning everything. They don't respect anything. They  
are out of control. They are crazy,'' said one of the 54 U.N. 
workers who returned to Dili, the territorial capital, from the 
town of Maliana, southwest of the capital. He spoke on condition of 
anonymity, saying he feared reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indonesian police are doing nothing to stop the violence,''  
said another evacuated U.N. worker, American David Peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty of the evacuated staffers were foreigners acting as  
liaison officers or civilian police. The rest were East Timorese. 
</P>
<P>
	A new wave of violence also swept across parts of Dili, where  
votes were being counted in Monday's historic referendum on East 
Timor's future. Smoke poured from some shacks that had been set on 
fire near the U.N. compound in Dili's troubled Becora district. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are running for their lives. There is panic. The  
shooting is coming closer,'' said one frightened resident, who also 
refused to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. mission said it was ``defenseless'' in the face of the  
deteriorating security situation and the inability of Indonesian 
defense forces to restore law and order. 
</P>
<P>
	A television station was shut down after militiamen threatened  
technicians, stopping the broadcast of a U.N.-produced program on 
the progress of vote counting. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian forces, which invaded East Timor in 1975, have been  
widely accused of doing little to control the militant groups that 
want the small island territory to remain part of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense minister Gen. Wiranto said today he was sending 1,400  
more soldiers to the region. Police said they would send 400 more 
specially trained officers over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said at least four locally hired  
U.N. staff members have been killed and six were missing since 
Monday's referendum on whether the half-island territory should 
break away from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups and witnesses said that more than a dozen  
East Timorese residents have died in the fighting this week, but no 
official civilian death toll was available. 
</P>

	Given the large turnout, many people believe that voters  
favoring independence will win the referendum. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  More Fighting in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Anti-independence militiamen occupied  
towns and villages across East Timor today, and police evacuated 
dozens of U.N. staff workers from one of the many areas that were 
under siege by the marauding gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are burning everything. They don't respect anything. They  
are out of control. They are crazy,'' said one of the 54 U.N. 
workers who returned to Dili, the territorial capital, from the 
town of Maliana, southwest of the capital. He spoke on condition of 
anonymity, saying he feared reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indonesian police are doing nothing to stop the violence,''  
said another evacuated U.N. worker, American David Peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty of the evacuated staffers were foreigners acting as  
liaison officers or civilian police. The rest were East Timorese. 
</P>
<P>
	A new wave of violence also swept across parts of Dili, where  
votes were being counted in Monday's historic referendum on East 
Timor's future. Smoke poured from some shacks that had been set on 
fire near the U.N. compound in Dili's troubled Becora district. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are running for their lives. There is panic. The  
shooting is coming closer,'' said one frightened resident, who also 
refused to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. mission said it was ``defenseless'' in the face of the  
deteriorating security situation and the inability of Indonesian 
defense forces to restore law and order. 
</P>
<P>
	A television station was shut down after militiamen threatened  
technicians, stopping the broadcast of a U.N.-produced program on 
the progress of vote counting. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian forces, which invaded East Timor in 1975, have been  
widely accused of doing little to control the militant groups that 
want the small island territory to remain part of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense minister Gen. Wiranto said today he was sending 1,400  
more soldiers to the region. Police said they would send 400 more 
specially trained officers over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said at least four locally hired  
U.N. staff members have been killed and six were missing since 
Monday's referendum on whether the half-island territory should 
break away from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups and witnesses said that more than a dozen  
East Timorese residents have died in the fighting this week, but no 
official civilian death toll was available. 
</P>
<P>
	As the vote-counting continued in Dili under tight security,  
Wimhurst confirmed that the results of the referendum would be 
announced Saturday, several days earlier than expected.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended lower Friday on  
worries over another rise in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index fell 189.25 points,  
or 1.4 percent, closing at 13,178.31. On Thursday, the index had 
lost 176.63 points, or 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said investors were cautious ahead of the release later  
Friday in the United States of unemployment data, which could 
provide clues about whether there would be another increase of U.S. 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, U.S. stocks fell because of worries over inflation  
and interest rates. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial 
average lost 94.67 points to close at 10,843.21. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped  
1.26 points, or 0.01 percent, to close the day's trading at 
17,629.99 points. On Thursday, the average closed down 171.23 
points, or 0.96 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in Tokyo was listless, with investors wary of taking new  
positions ahead of next week's release of several important 
economic indicators. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were anxious to see what direction the U.S. stock market  
would take after Labor Day, in addition to waiting for the 
announcement of Japan's gross domestic product data, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 109.74 yen in  
late trading, up 0.32 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also 
above its late New York level of 109.11 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan shares closed sharply lower for the second straight  
session as investors took profits following recent gains. Reports 
that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a U.S. investment advisory 
company, has recommended not overweighting Taiwan shares added to 
the bearishness, said analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 152.18  
points, or 1.8 percent, to 8,073.97. 
</P>

3.86 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,155.09. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- Almeric L.  
Christian, the first native of the U.S. Virgin Islands to be named 
a judge in the territory's District Court, died Wednesday at age 79 
of an undisclosed illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian was appointed by President Nixon in 1969 and retired  
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's most controversial decisions were in two 1970s cases  
in which he ruled that immigrants' children had a right to public 
education.

	PRAIRIE VILLAGE, Kan. (AP) -- Mary Hudson, who built an oil  
empire worth $325 million that landed her as one of the few women 
on the Forbes 400 list, died Thursday of cancer. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1933, Ms. Hudson borrowed $200 from her father to open her  
first Hudson Oil Co. station in Kansas City. It was the first of 
more than 300 gas stations and convenience stores that would make 
her one of America's richest entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of her business fell apart in the 1980s following a string  
of court judgments for overcharging customers at the pumps and for 
underpaying employees. She pleaded no contest to conspiracy and was 
ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. 
</P>

<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Lionel S. Jackson Sr., former publisher  
of the New Haven Register and Journal-Courier newspapers, died 
Wednesday at his home in Montecito, Calif., after a long illness. 
He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was publisher of Jackson Newspapers from 1973 to 1982.  
His father, John Day Jackson, purchased the Register in 1895 and 
the Morning Journal-Courier in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, the John Day Jackson Trust sold the newspapers for an  
estimated $185 million. The paper was later sold to the current 
owners, Journal Register Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Lionel Jackson began his career at the Register in 1936, working  
at various capacities before rising to national advertising manager 
in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lionel Jackson took over as sole publisher for both papers in  
1973. After his son assumed the post in 1982, he retained the 
titles of chairman of the board of directors and chief executive 
officer until the sale of the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Patricia Hope Johnstone Jackson; two  
daughters, a son and five grandchildren.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charles Lowe, who guided the career of  
actress Carol Channing during their four-decade marriage, died 
Thursday. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe and Miss Channing, 78, separated last year after she  
accused him of mismanagement. The two were estranged at the time of 
Lowe's death, publicist Alan Eichler said. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Steel City, Neb., Lowe served in the Army during  
World War II. After the war, he went from advertising executive to 
producer of the 1950-58 ``The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show'' 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Miss Channing married in 1956 and Lowe focused his  
attention on her stage career. He also produced five network TV 
specials with his wife, including ``An Evening with Carol 
Channing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1998, Ms. Channing filed for divorce.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- American painter Jeanne Miles, an abstract  
artist whose geometric creations were inspired by Asian art and 
ideas, died Aug. 27 at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Her half-century career produced a series of one-woman shows at  
New York galleries as well as paintings for the permanent 
collections of such museums as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art 
and the Guggenheim Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miles' paintings earned the 1968 American Institute of Arts  
and Letters Award, the 1970 and 1973 Mark Rothko Awards and the 
1974 Pelham von Stdeffler Art Fund Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	She taught at Oberlin College in Ohio, Moravian College in  
Pennsylvania and Yale.

stamps and a major stamp dealer for years, died Aug. 27 of cancer. 
He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirman started attending stamp auctions as an amateur dealer  
when he was 14. In 1950, he decided to make his hobby his business 
and bought the dealership Stanley Gibbons Inc., one of the leading 
traders for stamp collectors in the U.S. For years, the Gibbons 
catalogue served as a pricing guide for American stamps. 
</P>

and co-founder of Teledyne Inc. who designed an aircraft guidance 
system used worldwide, died Tuesday of brain cancer. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Singleton led one of the nation's largest conglomerates for  
three decades. He was known for his prowess on Wall Street and was 
a merger guru from the 1960s to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He launched Teledyne in 1960 as a semiconductor maker with his  
partner George Kozmetsky. Their first venture was building digital 
computers for aircraft and space exploration projects. Singleton 
developed the inertial guidance system now used in commercial and 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	By the mid-1980s, conglomerates were not in favor with Wall  
Street and Teledyne began divesting itself. It also became involved 
in military procurement scandals and paid more than $100 million in 
fines to settle claims that it inflated bills to the Pentagon and 
falsified tests on electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes magazine listed Singleton as one of the nation's 400  
richest people last year with an estimated fortune of $750 million. 
Singleton retired as Teledyne's chief executive officer in 1986, 
but remained as chairman until 1991.

	Zebrowski was born and educated in the United States. He lived  
many years in Britain, and went to India when he joined the Peace 
Corps in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	While teaching English at a school in Karimnagar in  
south-central India, he became interested in the intricate 
silverwork of the area and the artwork of the Deccani sultanate. 
</P>
<P>
	Zebrowski later studied in Paris and at Harvard University. His  
1983 thesis, ``Deccani Painting,'' became the standard work on the 
subject. Another book was published in 1997, and he completed work 
on another this year while gravely ill.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Denies Helping Govt Snoop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. sought to assure consumers  
Friday that it did not insert a secret backdoor in its popular 
Windows software to allow the U.S. government to snoop on their 
sensitive computer data. 
</P>
<P>
	The sensational charge of a quiet alliance between Microsoft and  
the U.S. National Security Agency came after a Canadian programmer 
stumbled across an obscure digital ``signing key'' that had been 
labeled the ``NSA key'' in the latest version of Microsoft's 
business-level Windows NT software. 
</P>
<P>
	An organization with such a signature key accepted by Windows  
could theoretically load software to make it easier to look at 
sensitive data -- such as e-mail or financial records -- that had 
been scrambled. The flaw would affect almost any version of 
Windows, the software that runs most of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft forcefully denied that it gave any government agency  
such a key, and explained that it called its function an ``NSA 
key'' because that federal agency reviews technical details for the 
export of powerful data-scrambling software. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are just used to ensure that we're compliant with U.S.  
export regulations,'' said Scott Culp, Microsoft's security manager 
for its Windows NT Server software. ``We have not shared the 
private keys. We do not share our keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The claim against Microsoft, originally leveled by security  
consultant Andrew Fernandes of Mississauga, Ontario, on his Web 
site, spread quickly in e-mail and discussion groups across the 
Internet, especially in those corners of cyberspace where Microsoft 
and the federal government are often criticized. 
</P>
<P>
	Culp called Fernandes' claims ``completely false.''  
</P>
<P>
	An NSA spokesman declined immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Schneier, a cryptography expert, said the claim by  
Fernandes ``makes no sense'' because a government agency as 
sophisticated as the NSA doesn't need Microsoft's help to 
unscramble sensitive computer information. 
</P>
<P>
	``That it allows the NSA to load unauthorized security services,  
compromise your operating system -- that's nonsense,'' said 
Schneier, who runs Counterpane Internet Security Inc. ``The NSA can 
already do that, and it has nothing to do with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandes, who runs a small consulting firm in Canada, said he  
found the suspiciously named ``NSA key'' -- along with another key 
for Microsoft -- while examining the software code within the latest 
version of Windows NT. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the second key was discovered earlier by other  
cryptographers, but Fernandes was the first to find its official 
name and theorize about its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``That (the U.S. government) has ... installed a cryptographic  
back door in the world's most abundant operating system should send 
a strong message to foreign (information technology) managers,'' he 
warned on his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fernandes seemed less worried Friday in a telephone  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that they have reason to lie,'' he said. ``The  
main point is, you can't really trust what they're saying. They've 
been caught with their hand in the cookie jar. In fact, I think 
they're being fairly honest, but you don't know what else is in 
Windows.''

<HEADLINE> Famed Calif. Beach Declared Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Miles of famed ``Surf City,  
USA'' beach along the Southern California coast are open again now 
that the mysterious bacteria which forced them closed this summer 
have all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Contamination levels of fecal bacteria at Huntington State Beach  
have dropped enough to allow swimmers and surfers back into the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials believe urban runoff in storm drains -- rather  
than a sewage leak -- may have caused the beach fouling. A report on 
possible causes will be reviewed today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be monitoring the water twice a day and keeping a close  
eye on the results,'' said Larry Honeybourne of Orange County's 
Health Care Agency. ``For now, the water meets the standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only about one mile of the 8-mile strip will remain closed, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after Thursday's announcement, lifeguards removed the  
tape that had cordoned off the shoreline for most of the summer, 
earning cheers from business owners and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all smiles down here,'' said Jack Clapp, who had already  
recalled laid-off workers for his beachfront store. ``I called them 
all and told them I'm going to have some work for them this 
weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reopening came just in time for the Labor Day weekend,  
traditionally one of the year's most lucrative along the shore. The 
city has lowered its normal $7-a-day parking fee to $1 for the 
holiday weekend in an attempt to lure beachgoers back. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem first surfaced in late June when health officials  
found high levels of bacteria, including extremely high levels of 
enterococcous -- known to cause gastrointestinal and respiratory 
infections. By July 1, they closed its first section of beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the level of bacteria intensified and spread. Between Aug.  
6 and Aug. 21, officials closed six more sections. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too early to tell how much the pollution problem may have  
damaged the image of Huntington Beach, immortalized as ``Surf City, 
USA'' in the 1950s Jan and Dean rock classic and in Beach Boys 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the reopening, health and sanitation workers warn the  
problem has not been resolved -- and swimmers and surfers could be 
out of the water again.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Minister Sentenced for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A California clergyman who defrauded about 2,000  
followers out of $1.4 million in a pyramid scheme was sentenced to 
nearly four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Groeschel, 67, was sentenced to three years and 10  
months in prison for a pyramid scheme based in his hometown of Palm 
Desert, Calif., in which he told followers they could make millions 
of dollars in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Groeschel, who ran the Association of Individual Ministries  
under the name Pastor Chuck, pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to express my remorse and state I'm sad to end  
my life this way, ashamed of it,'' the white-haired preacher said 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Groeschel carried out the criminal scheme in  
the name of God, quoting lines from the Bible that indicate profit 
is not a bad thing. One Biblical passage promised ``we will receive 
a hundred fold return in this life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 and 1998, he collected more than $1.4 million from about  
2,000 lower-income individuals, many of them residents of New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Although promising some contributors 15 percent profit on  
contributions, Groeschel allegedly kept most of the money, 
transferring more than $237,000 to an overseas account in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Allen G. Schwartz said Groeschel betrayed  
those who were committed to religion and demonstrated the same 
behavior that caused him on May 13, 1993 to be convicted by a jury 
in New Mexico of promoting an illegal pyramid scheme. He was 
sentenced in that case to a year and a half in prison.

<HEADLINE> Internet Standards Effort Hits Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A much-touted industry effort to develop a  
common standard to let technology companies freely exchange data 
with other businesses across the Internet has hit an unexpected 
snag due to conflicting corporate agendas. 
</P>
<P>
	A computer industry group said Friday it had rejected a proposed  
version of the standard over concerns it skewed toward U.S. 
companies and will prevent European companies from participating. 
</P>
<P>
	One worry of the Computing Technology Industry Association is  
the standard would enable businesses to exchange personal data 
about their consumers, such as buying habits. This would violate of 
European government privacy rules, which are stricter than those in 
the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	The rejection is expected to delay the release of the standards  
to computer and software makers and distributors, which had been 
expected next February. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bump in the road,'' said Kathey Hale, an analyst with  
the Dataquest high-tech research firm. ``I'm surprised there was 
such a lack of communication here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standards-setting group, called RosettaNet, was launched  
with much ballyhoo in June to harness the XML software language to 
speed the transmission of data across electronic networks linking 
computer and software makers, parts suppliers and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industries, such as auto companies, also are working on  
standards for XML, or extensible markup language. XML is a way to 
tag electronic information with identifying codes so that 
businesses can exchange information without worrying about the need 
to reformat data so that it can be retrieved and viewed by others. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a business can easily send orders to a parts  
supplier across the Web without paying big consulting fees to an 
outside company to set up an electronic network. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology industry is being closely watched by XML  
supporters because it is a driving force behind international 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	A phone message left with Fadi Chehade, executive director of  
the RosettaNet group, was not returned. A RosettaNet spokeswoman 
said he wasn't available. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the concern over European privacy standards,  
another worry is the standard would require companies using it to 
have an identifying code issued by the Dun &AMP; Bradstreet financial 
information firm. Most U.S. companies have such codes, though 
European companies do not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies in Europe wouldn't use the standard at all,'' said  
Nicole Shelley, senior director of electronic commerce standards 
for the CTIA, based outside Chicago and made up of 7,500 U.S. and 
Europe technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley said as a result of its concerns, its members would not  
launch tests of the standards over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's rejection of the proposal ``is going to delay'' the  
standards, she said. ``The smaller and larger players are saying 
they can't implement these standards.''

<HEADLINE>  Foyt Returning to Winston Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- An old face will make a new start next  
year in NASCAR when A.J. Foyt returns to Winston Cup racing as a 
car owner. 
</P>
<P>
	And Foyt, a four-time Indianapolis 500 champion and winner of  
the 1972 Daytona 500, will run the entire Winston Cup schedule for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 64-year-old Foyt, conditioned to winning championships  
with his Indy Racing League cars, is not abandoning the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just be doing a lot of commuting,'' Foyt said Friday at  
Darlington Raceway. ``It might be a little tough to do the 
Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in the same day, but I'll 
get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt, despite infrequent appearances he worked into his Indy-car  
career for more than two decades, is no stranger to NASCAR. And his 
operation out of a 30,000-square-foot shop in Charlotte, N.C., will 
be run by longtime team manager and crew chief Waddell Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not getting into this just to run,'' said Foyt, who also  
announced a sponsorship deal with Conseco Inc., the financial 
services group that has backed his Indy-car effort. ``We want to go 
out there and finish in the top 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt realizes the difficulty of that with a single-car operation  
in a sport where all 23 races this year have been won by drivers 
from multicar teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's tough, and it was even when I raced here,'' said  
Foyt, who had seven victories in 128 NASCAR career starts. ``But if 
you hire the right people, you can make some things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much remains to be done before Foyt will be ready to field his  
first entry in the first race of the next century -- the 
season-opening Daytona 500. Most of the details will be left to 
Wilson, who built the engines and has called the shots for several 
Daytona 500 winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the unfinished business is selecting a driver and make of  
car. All Foyt knows at this time is that the car will be his 
familiar No. 14, the number Kenny Brack drove to both the IRL title 
last year and the Indianapolis 500 championship in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny likes those IROC cars,'' Foyt said of the all-star  
series in which Brack has driven stock cars. ``But I don't think 
he's ready for these Winston Cup cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt might consider owner-driver Ricky Rudd, and discussed  
buying his operation. Rudd, a 20-time career winner who lost his 
lucrative sponsorship, is still seeking backing to keep his own 
operation afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wouldn't rule out driving for Foyt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know A.J. is a fierce competitor, and I am, too,'' Rudd  
said. ``A.J. and I are alike in that if we were playing tiddlywinks 
we'd probably be kicking each other under the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt is the second open-wheel car owner to announce he's  
entering NASCAR next season. Cal Wells III, who owns cars in CART, 
is forming Winston Cup and Busch Series teams in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Danger Rises for Some Fed Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patti Rodgers remembers the dark, early  
morning in 1996 when she watched a ranger station in Oregon's 
Willamette National Forest burn to the ground. The arson changed 
the way she thinks about dangers she faces on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to pay closer attention to where I am and who else is  
there,'' said Rodgers, a Forest Service employee. ``We're all more 
sensitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is good reason for the caution, according to an employees'  
advocacy group. Threats, violence and vandalism directed at Forest 
Service and Bureau of Land Management employees and buildings rose 
for the third consecutive year in 1998, said the Public Employees 
for Environmental Responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest Service workers reported 53 threats or troublesome events  
last year, up from 34 in 1995, the first year the group kept track 
of such problems. 
</P>
<P>
	BLM officials reported 42 threats or attacks, up from eight in  
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the reports came from the West, where the vast share of  
public lands are located. 
</P>
<P>
	A Forest Service employee in Nevada was threatened for not  
approving a permit, a Forest Service worker in New Mexico was 
pushed by someone who was mad about new fees, and a pipe bomb went 
off in the rest room of a BLM building near Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	As populations grow, and communities press against the  
boundaries of federal lands, problems formerly thought to exist in 
cities are becoming more common in parks and forests, federal 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some cautioned, however, that crime on federal lands is still  
rare, and that reporting of problems -- not crimes themselves -- may 
be what is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma City bombing and other high-profile violent acts on  
federal lands heightened the awareness of federal employees and 
prompted them to do a better job of reporting crimes, said Michael 
Pendleton, a senior research fellow at the University of Washington 
in Seattle who has studied crime in parks and forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees said security precautions have become more common at  
federal land sites, including name badges and security cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The agencies are limited in what they can do. The BLM, the  
nation's largest public land manager, has just 200 law enforcement 
officers to cover 264 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, agencies haven't done enough to protect workers, said  
Rob Perks, national field director for the employee group. If there 
were better data on such violence, for example, workers could be 
better prepared to prevent it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His group obtained its data under the Freedom of Information  
Act. The Justice Department is supposed to collect reports of 
violence against federal employees but is asking Congress to repeal 
the requirement. Agencies keep inconsistent records, and the 
Justice Department doesn't have the personnel to compile the data, 
said department spokesman John Russell.

<HEADLINE> Global Crossing Restructures Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Faced with a slumping stock price, Global  
Crossing Ltd. moved Thursday to protect its plans to take over 
Frontier Corp., restructuring a $8 billion deal for the telephone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing's stock has dropped 50 percent in recent months,  
forcing the fiber-optic cable operator to increase its stock bid 
for Frontier. Shareholders of Rochester, N.Y.-based Frontier will 
now get 2.05 shares of Global Crossing, worth about $46 based on 
Thursday's closing stock price. Global Crossing also will assume 
about $1.6 billion in debt from Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were motivated to revise our agreement by the overwhelming  
strategic and financial benefits of our merger, and are now looking 
forward to its prompt closing,'' Bob Annunziata, Global Crossing's 
chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The shareholders of both companies will vote on the deal later  
this month, though Global Crossing already has enough votes to pass 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, which is building an undersea cable network to  
carry high-speed Internet traffic, originally offered $63 per 
share, or $10.9 billion, for Frontier, provided Global Crossing's 
shares traded above $34.56. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors worried that telephone rate wars will squeeze  
profits have pushed industry stocks down. Global Crossing's stock 
closed below the threshold on Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing's shared continued to fall Thursday as some  
investors rejected the added dilution to their shares from the new 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Global Crossing fell $1.56 1/4 to $22.43 3/4 on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market. That drop shaved off more than 6 percent from the 
value of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier's stock ended off 50 cents at $41.75 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier offers local, long-distance and wireless service.  
Global Crossing aims to use Frontier's customers to generate 
revenue across its cables that will span five continents. 
</P>
<P>
	To help prop up its stock price, Global Crossing agreed to buy  
back up to $500 million of its shares after the deal with Frontier 
closes at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Top executives of both companies also have agreed to hold onto  
their shares for at least six months after the ink dries on the 
final contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a sign there is greater value ahead,'' said Thomas  
Casey, vice chairman for Global Crossing.

<HEADLINE> 2 Charged in MIT Laughing Gas Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- MIT police filed drug charges against  
two people Friday in the case of a student who died after inhaling 
laughing gas from a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Mosher, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology senior,  
and recent graduate Rene Ruiz, both 22, face charges stemming from 
drugs found in the dorm room where Richard A. Guy was found dead 
Tuesday, said MIT Police Chief Anne Glavin. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy, a physics major from Mission Viejo, Calif., was asphyxiated  
as a result of nitrous oxide inhalation. Mosher, a major in brain 
and cognitive science, and Ruiz lived together in the same East 
Campus dormitory as Guy. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint filed in court lists charges that include  
possession with intent to distribute nitrous oxide, hallucinogenic 
mushrooms, amphetamines and marijuana. The woman and man also face 
charges of conspiracy, possession of a hypodermic needles and 
cruelty to animals -- cats -- though police would not further explain 
the cruelty charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of our investigation, we have been able to shed  
light on illegal drug use that existed within the living group at 
East Campus and quite likely beyond,'' Glavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosher and Ruiz were ordered to appear in court for arraignment  
Sept. 10. A message left on their answering machine was not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference to announce the charges, MIT President  
Charles M. Vest called Guy's death ``a grim reminder of so many 
other needless deaths throughout the country, every year, of young 
people who foolishly involve themselves with drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guy's death came two years after the substance-abuse death of  
another MIT student shocked the campus. In 1997, 18-year-old 
freshman Scott Krueger died three days after he was found in an 
alcohol-induced coma on a fraternity floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The death prompted MIT officials to require all freshmen to live  
on campus beginning in the fall of 2001. The fraternity where 
Krueger was served was also indicted on criminal charges, though 
the case was never prosecuted because no one from the fraternity 
appeared in court. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the school revoked the diploma of a man who bought  
alcohol consumed by Krueger and other pledges.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Uranium Plant Operators Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- Workers who say they were exposed to  
radiation at a uranium enrichment plant filed suit Friday, seeking 
$10 billion in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 workers sued the former private corporate operators of  
the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, which refines uranium for use 
in nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks to represent all current and former workers  
and their families, which could mean 10,000 plaintiffs or more, 
lawyer Mark Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence that any worker was made sick by the  
exposure, according to lawyer William McMurry. However, radiation 
levels at the plant exceeded federal standards and were severe 
enough to cause fear and concern among workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the former operators of the plant are Union Carbide Corp.  
and the Lockheed Martin Corp., which took over after a merger with 
Martin Marietta Corp. The suit also alleges General Electric Corp. 
is responsible for damages because it improperly shipped 
contaminated products to the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin declined comment.

	The Department of Energy, which is investigating reports that

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Industry Wins Fla. Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The tobacco industry dodged a potential  
multibillion-dollar judgment after a judge ruled damage claims in a 
class-action lawsuit must be considered one person at a time 
instead of as a group. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Friday by the 3rd District Court of Appeal in Miami  
came in a case filed on behalf of as many as 500,000 sick Florida 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor who  
heads an anti-tobacco clearinghouse, said the ruling erased 
prospects for a crippling damage award against cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Short term, it's a victory,'' Daynard said. ``The industry has  
ducked the bullet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In July, a jury decided in the smokers' favor, ruling that the  
industry produced a deadly product. The next step is to decide how 
much the smokers will get in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers on both sides were barred by a gag order from talking  
about the case, but industry experts saw Friday's decision as a 
major shift in the case favoring tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has essentially devastated the most threatening aspect of  
the claim to the tobacco industry,'' said Martin Feldman, tobacco 
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	A big verdict would have forced tobacco companies to post a  
large bond to appeal the case and could have forced a bankruptcy 
filing this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was the first class-action lawsuit by smokers ever to  
go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the second round is set to begin. The jury will  
return to determine whether two sick smokers should be compensated. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are the nation's five biggest cigarette makers --  
Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, 
Lorillard Tobacco and the Liggett Group -- and two industry 
associations, the Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A and the 
Tobacco Institute Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	With Friday's decision, ``there is no potential for damages to  
be decided on a group basis and, as a result, this case now doesn't 
look very different from the vast majority of cases brought against 
the industry,'' Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The individual claims will produce smaller dollar awards, and  
the industry will have an opportunity to wipe out the whole case by 
appealing once one damage award is set, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll just be ordinary multimillion punitive verdicts,''  
Daynard said. ``But this thing is still probably the most potent 
litigation on the horizon against the tobacco companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Results of recent tobacco cases have been mixed. In March, a  
jury in Portland, Ore., awarded $81 million to the family of a 
smoker who died of lung cancer. The month before, a woman with 
inoperable lung cancer won $51 million in San Francisco. Both 
awards were reduced by judges. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry won another Oregon case as well as lawsuits on  
behalf of unions in Ohio, three dead smokers in Tennessee and one 
in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- twice in Florida and once in New Jersey, Oregon and 
California. Both Florida verdicts and the New Jersey verdict were 
overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $206 billion national settlement reached with the tobacco  
industry in November bars states from suing to recoup the costs of 
treating sick smokers, but it does not prohibit lawsuits by 
individuals.

<HEADLINE> Baines Back As an Indian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Harold Baines returned to Camden Yards on  
Friday, happy to be closer to home and delighted to be playing with 
a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles traded the 40-year-old designated hitter  
to the Cleveland Indians on Aug. 27, getting two young pitchers 
while giving the longtime St. Michael's resident a chance to play 
for a first-place team. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland arrived Thursday night, and Baines took a drive to the  
Eastern Shore to be with his family. On Friday, he was in the 
starting lineup as the Indians resumed their quest to wrap up 
another AL Central title. 
</P>
<P>
	Beforehand, he took some time to talk to Baltimore beat writers  
who had grown accustomed to talking to him in the home clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	So Harold, who'd have thought you'd end up here?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the game. That's the way I approach it,'' he  
said. ``I'm just happy to be in this situation at this point in the 
season, knowing that I'm going to go farther than playing in the 
regular season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because his contract ends after this year, he could very well  
return to the Orioles next season. That's something he'll think 
about after the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to talk about the future right now,'' he said, as  
always using the minimum amount of words to convey his thoughts.

<HEADLINE>  Collins Resigns As Angels' Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A tearful Terry Collins resigned as the  
Anaheim Angels' manager on Friday, less than three months after the 
last-place team gave him a two-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Maddon, the Angels' bench coach, will take over as interim  
manager for the rest of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim began Friday with a nine-game losing streak and a 51-82  
record, the worst in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and general manager Bill Bavasi said the manager was not  
forced out. The two had a long talk Thursday night, and both 
decided it would be best if he quit now. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi said he made his recommendation to Collins ``a little bit  
for the club and mostly for Terry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's not bitter, but I'm bitter. This club had every  
reason to respond and didn't. This is just bad chemistry in the 
clubhouse,'' Bavasi said. ``The team didn't quit on Terry; I can't 
imagine anybody quitting on Terry. ... They quit on themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels were still in contention at the All-Star break, but  
lost 37 of their next 47 to plummet into last place in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, the team's got to perform,'' Collins said.  
``When you don't perform, the manager's accountable. I had a 
feeling today that this is the time. I tried everything I knew, 
from patting them on the back to try to motivate them to kicking 
them in the butt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 50, hadn't spoken to any of the players about the  
decision, although he said he planned to talk later with some of 
them individually. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision apparently had lot more to do with the players'  
squabbling among themselves than it did with the team's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday in Cleveland, I had to address a couple of issues  
again and was unable to talk about the game, and that's when it hit 
me,'' Collins said. ``I won't miss the bickering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Bavasi asked some players for their opinion of the manager  
before Collins' contract was renewed, players seemed to splinter 
into pro- and anti-Collins factions. A few unidentified players 
complained about Collins' managing style, but he was given the 
extension anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Randy Velarde, who publicly took issue with  
Collins, was traded to Oakland along with starting pitcher Omar 
Olivares for three minor leaguers on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest clubhouse flareup came when reliever Troy Percival  
complained that not all of his teammates were on the field during a 
brawl with in Cleveland on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident began began after Percival allowed a three-run  
homer to Richie Sexson, capping a 10-run, eighth-inning rally, and 
then hit David Justice with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo Vaughn was in the clubhouse watching on TV and went to the  
dugout, but said he arrived too late to go on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Percival noted that some players hadn't participated in the  
fight, an apparent reference to Vaughn. The following day, Vaughn 
complained that no Angels' pitcher has retaliated this year after 
he was hit, and criticized Percival for hitting Justice, saying, 
``Take a beating like a man and get the next out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi said the makeup of the team doesn't seem to be working,  
and that he accepted responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than we're going to be looking for a manager the rest of  
this season, we're going to be looking at the players,'' he said. 
``I don't know how they're going to react to this, and I'd be less 
than honest if I said I cared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim could be headed for the poorest season in the Angels'  
39-season history -- worse than the 1980 team's 65-95 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like they're the Harlem Globetrotters out there, and  
we're the Washington Generals,'' Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina 
said after Thursday night's 6-5 loss at Cleveland, which turned out 
to be Collins' final game. 
</P>
<P>
	After managing the Houston Astros to second-place finishes in  
the NL Central from 1994-96, Collins went to Anaheim and had a 
220-237 record with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in clubhouses where guys don't like each other,''  
Collins said. ``But when I was in Houston, they still went out and 
played hard every game. The manager has one hammer these days, the 
lineup card, and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team had high expectations after signing Vaughn to an $80  
million, six-year contract last November, and began the season with 
baseball's 13th-highest payroll at $51.5 million. But the season 
was filled with injuries and discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina was one of several key players sidelined for an  
extended period, along with Vaughn, outfielders Jim Edmonds and Tim 
Salmon, and pitchers Ken Hill, Tim Belcher, Jason Dickson, Mike 
James, Pep Harris and Jack McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, criticized in the past for being too intense, signed  
the extension on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't believe there's a better place to work,'' he  
said then.

<HEADLINE> Circle of Life Wins Spinaway Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Circle of Life came from just off  
the pace and beat odds-on favorite Surfside by 1 1/4 lengths in the 
$200,000, Grade I Spinaway Stakes for 2-year-old fillies at 
Saratoga on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Surfside, a daughter of Seattle Slew-Flanders, lost for the  
first time after two impressive starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Whineshine was another 1 3/4 lengths back in third in the  
field of six. The order of finish was completed by March Magic, 
Dance for Dixie and Asher. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the second in three career starts for Circle of Life  
who carried 121 pounds and John Velazquez over seven furlongs in 
1:23:1. She earned $120,000 for Michael B. Tabor. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $10, $3.60 and $2.10. Surfside paid $2.90  
and $2.10, while Miss Whineshine was $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Pletcher, Circle of Life's trainer, had endured some bitter  
disappointment just two days earlier when he was forced to withdraw 
More Than Ready, his prize colt and the pre-race favorite, from 
Saturday's Hopeful Stakes because the colt developed a slight 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Pletcher, who once worked as an assistant to Surfside's trainer  
D. Wayne Lukas, said ``It's nice to win a race like the Spinaway. I 
have a lot of respect for Wayne's filly. When I was working for 
him, Flanders was one of my favorite horses. We have a tough 
decision to make. There are only 16 days to the Matron and, after 
that the Frizette. Obviously, the Breeders' Cup (Nov. 6 at 
Gulfstream) is our major goal. We have to see if those other two 
races fit into the schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas revealed that Surfside ``had a little mucous after her  
last race and that's why we put her on Lasix. I thought 
seven-eighths was well within her range. I don't think she showed 
her best today. We kind of committed to Kentucky, so she may run 
there (at Churchill Downs) next.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Hikes Bank Bailout Estimate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Mexican government has sharply increased  
its estimate of the cost of bailing out the country's banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicente Corta, executive secretary of the new Mexican deposit  
insurance agency known as IPAB, told reporters Friday the bailout 
would cost $93.4 billion, or about 19.3 percent of Mexico's gross 
domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous government estimate was $59 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Even with the sharp increase, though, the government's bailout  
estimate was still lower than the one given earlier this week by 
the ratings agency Standard &AMP; Poor's: $105.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Corta said the government's estimate is lower because it  
includes expected asset recoveries and higher deposit insurance 
fees that banks are required to pay. The government hopes to 
recover $22 billion from the sale of bank assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's poorly regulated banking industry was on the brink of  
collapse when the value of the peso dropped in 1994-95, sending 
interest rates soaring and leaving debtors unable to pay back their 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	President Ernesto Zedillo's bailout plan was approved by  
Congress last year, despite strong objections from opposition 
politicians who considered it a bailout of rich, politically 
connected bankers by poor taxpayers.

<HEADLINE> Study: Mom's Blues Can Hinder Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children do worse on developmental tests if  
their mothers are depressed, but a mother's depression does less 
damage if the family is well off financially, says a study released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers studied 1,200 families to see if mother's depression  
hindered her children's learning ability in the crucial first three 
years of life. 
</P>
<P>
	They questioned mothers beginning at their children's births and  
visited their homes to watch mother-child interaction. When the 
children were 3, their school readiness -- things such as counting 
and knowing colors and shapes -- was tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Mothers who were chronically depressed were more likely to have  
children who scored lower on the tests, concluded the eight-year 
study financed by the National Institutes of Health. The study will 
appear in the September issue of the journal Developmental 
Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
	But depressed women who had higher incomes, and other advantages  
such as higher education, were more sensitive to their children's 
needs, and their depression had lesser effect on their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money seems to be a key issue,'' said one of the researchers,  
University of North Carolina child development specialist Martha 
Cox. ``It could be a case of women in positions of seeking better 
outside child care, or giving themselves more breaks, or buying 
more services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These women have more options or more things to turn to, to  
keep their depression from affecting their relationship with the 
child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reseachers recruited families from Arkansas, California, Kansas,  
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Washington 
and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	A mother's depression is problematical because of the theory  
that depressed moms wouldn't interact with their children. And 
researchers said maternal blues may have the worst affect on the 
youngest babies, who depend more on their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showed that if mothers were particularly sensitive to  
their babies, regardless of depression, the children developed 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exploration and play are such an important way that children  
learn in the early years,'' Cox explained. ``Having a mother that 
can facilitate that exploration and play is important to the 
children's development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, if a mother and child were playing with a book or  
puzzle, the sensitive mother would pay attention to what the child 
was trying to do, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study children are now in third grade and will be followed  
at least through sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen percent of the families were headed by single mothers,  
but interactions with fathers and other adults were not measured. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the study may have underestimated depression's impact  
because teen mothers, disabled children or substance abusers also 
were not studied. The poorest families wound up dropping out of the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	School readiness has long worried educators, given that poor and  
other disadvantaged children often get to kindergarten without 
skills necessary for school success. 
</P>
<P>
	The research shows families in which the mother suffers  
depression need to seek help, said Sarah Friedman, who coordinated 
the study for the NIH's National Institute for Child Health and 
Human Development. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women need to know if they feel depressed, it's not only about  
them,'' she said. ``It's also going to affect their children.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Tokyo Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Friday amid concern  
that Japanese monetary officials were ready to intervene to prop up 
the greenback. Tokyo's key stock index slipped marginally. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.60 yen at midafternoon, up 0.18 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
109.11 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.26 points,  
or 0.01 percent, to close the day's trading at 17,629.99 points. On 
Thursday, the average closed down 171.23 points, or 0.96 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar steadied amid renewed market  
feeling that Japan's central bank may intervene in an attempt to 
halt the yen's appreciation, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have repeatedly said a premature  
strengthening of the yen is undesirable amid sporadic signs that 
Japan is recovering from its worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen is seen as negative for Japan's economy because it  
makes the nation's exports more expensive, and therefore less 
competitive, overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's recovery was prompted by comments from Eisuke  
Sakakibara, Japan's former vice finance minister for international 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a U.S. television interview broadcast Friday on CNBC,  
Sakakibara, now an advisor to the Finance Ministry, said currency 
``intervention is always a strategic decision,'' which depends on 
market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Sakakibara's remarks, there have been no recent signs of  
dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of Japan, the country's 
central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors were waiting for the release of U.S.  
employment figures for August, due out in Washington later Friday, 
for a further signal about the direction of the high-flying U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 117.48 yen, up from  
115.86 late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei slipped marginally on concerns  
that the stronger yen may undermine Japan's fledgling economic 
recovery, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	An overnight fall on Wall Street also pushed down Tokyo share  
prices, they said. The Dow closed 94.67 points lower at 10,843.23 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up a marginal 0.01 points, insignificant in 
percentage terms, to 1,497.00. The TOPIX closed up 0.75 points, or 
0.05 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 215 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.8400 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8850 
percent, driving its price up to 100.50 yen from 100.12 yen.

<HEADLINE> Former Cat Stevens Finds Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Yusuf Islam -- formerly the pop star Cat  
Stevens -- says he has finally found peace and balance in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit Thursday to the Islamic School of Kansas City,  
the man who wrote and sang such hits as ``Peace Train'' and 
``Morning Has Broken'' said he is now a ``complete human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, at the height of his stardom, he canceled a world tour,  
converted to Islam and changed his name. He spent the better part 
of the 1980s denouncing his past life as immoral. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 51, he said he has accepted his past as ``an experience, a  
lesson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, I wanted to be as large as I could be,'' he said. ``I

<HEADLINE> N.J. Cops Thwart Casino Suicide Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- After a string of three suicide leaps  
off casino buildings last month, police convinced another would-be 
jumper to abandon his attempt Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people gathered at the foot of a Trump Plaza hotel  
tower after Jaramillo Rogeles, 19, climbed onto a ledge at about 
10:30 p.m. Thursday, police Sgt. Michael Tullio said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ledge was nearly 20 stories up, near the top of the  
building. Police negotiators climbed to the top of the tower and 
after nearly 2 1/2 hours of talk, convinced Rogeles to put on a rescue 
harness and climb a ladder to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Tullio said the man was suffering from personal problems that  
had nothing to do with gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	During an eight-day period last month, three people killed  
themselves by leaping from casino buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	A gambler who had lost $87,000 at the tables jumped off a Trump  
Plaza roof. A dealer at Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino leaped 
to his death from the casino's parking garage. A German tourist 
made a fatal jump from a Resorts Atlantic City parking garage.

<HEADLINE> United Shuttle Turbulence Hurts 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It was just another flight up the  
California coast. The seat belt light was out, and some of the 107 
passengers on the United Shuttle flight were roaming around the 
cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, without warning, turbulence. The plane plunged  
dramatically, sending passengers flying. Fifteen people were 
injured with sprains, cuts and back pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody went straight to the ceiling,'' passenger Ronald  
Kalio said. ``There was two stewardesses that spent the rest of the 
trip in the aisles. They were knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines flight 2036 encountered the turbulence at about  
2:20 p.m. Thursday, about halfway through the flight from Los 
Angeles to San Francisco, said United spokesman Joe Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how far the plane, flying at 24,000 feet,  
dropped. An airport spokesman noted that people can hit their heads 
if a plane drops just a few feet and they are not wearing seat 
belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of those injured were members of a Quincy, Mass., high  
school girls soccer team. Eight-year-old Benjamin Francisco, who 
was traveling with the group of 57 people, suffered a gash on his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I looked out the window, my first thought was, `It's  
going down,''' said Maureen Cheesman, mother of one of the team 
members. ``When I looked down the aisle, I saw the little boy whose 
head was bleeding profusely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 737 continued to San Francisco International Airport  
and landed safely less than an hour later, a Federal Aviation 
Administration spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen passengers and a flight attendant were treated at  
hospitals and released. Another flight attendant was kept overnight 
at a hospital with a head injury and was in stable condition 
</P>
<P>
	Airport spokesman Ron Wilson said the plane most likely  
encountered clear-air turbulence, which is rarer than the more 
common wake turbulence. Hopkins, however, said that after talking 
with the pilot, United is ``90 percent sure'' the culprit was wake 
turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
	Wake turbulence is caused by air stirred up by another plane.  
Wilson said a larger MD-11 passenger jet was in front of the United 
Shuttle flight, but was ahead by at least 10 miles, the minimum 
legally required separation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clear-air turbulence -- a weather phenomenon -- can't be seen or  
spotted by instruments and results in a more violent jolt for 
passengers, Wilson said.

<HEADLINE> Woman Donates Kidney to Stranger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A woman donated a kidney to a complete  
stranger, undergoing surgery and a battery of physical and 
psychological tests simply because she knew there was a long 
waiting list for organs. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said that transplants in which neither donor nor  
recipient knows the other person were almost unheard of until a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the 50-year-old donor was ``purely motivated by  
altruism,'' said Cheryl Jacobs, a social worker who took part in 
the psychological screening of the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The donor and the recipient both asked to keep their identities  
secret, even from each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The transplant took place in early August but wasn't disclosed  
until Thursday, after the patients had left the hospital at the 
University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Transplanted kidneys generally come from a cadaver or a living  
relative. Transplant programs have been reluctant to accept kidney 
donations from living strangers for several reasons, including 
concern about exposing the donor to the risks of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the donor in this case was turned down by several  
transplant centers before the university accepted her offer. 
Hospital officials said they were convinced, after intense 
psychological and physical screening, that she made the offer for 
the right reasons and knew the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	She could have gotten some reassurance from Dr. Arthur Matas,  
who performed the transplant. In 1992, he published a study in The 
Lancet, a British medical journal, that found that people who live 
with one kidney after donating the other are not at increased risk 
of suffering from kidney failure or hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42,000 people on the nation's kidney transplant waiting list  
generally will have to wait three to five years for a new organ. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, there were 11,990 kidney transplants in the United  
States, and just over 4,000 came from living donors. Of those, 163 
were unrelated to the recipients, according to the United Network 
on Organ Sharing. UNOS doesn't keep data on how many came from 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Matas said he has heard of only one other such procedure.  
</P>
<P>
	However, Dr. William Bennett, president of the American Society  
of Nephrology, said: ``Living, unrelated transplantation is growing 
in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was always felt before, why use a living patient when you  
could use a cadaver donor?'' Bennett said. ``But it turns out the 
fact that the donor is living confers some advantage.'' That's 
because organs from cadavers have to be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Kahn, director of the university's Center for Bioethics,  
said he expects the hospital to perform more transplants with 
organs from unrelated donors. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital is approached about six times a month by people  
asking if they can donate kidneys, so officials have set up a 
system to screen the callers, identify their true motives and put 
their kidneys into a pool for recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if one kidney we get this way, it's one less person on  
the list,'' Kahn said. ``Even if it's one a year, it's a success.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Denies Helping Govt Snoop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. sought to assure consumers  
Friday that it did not insert a secret backdoor in its popular 
Windows software to allow the U.S. government to snoop on their 
sensitive computer data. 
</P>
<P>
	The sensational charge of a quiet alliance between Microsoft and  
the U.S. National Security Agency came after a Canadian programmer 
stumbled across an obscure digital ``signing key'' that had been 
labeled the ``NSA key'' in the latest version of Microsoft's 
business-level Windows NT software. 
</P>
<P>
	An organization with such a signature key accepted by Windows  
could theoretically load software to make it easier to look at 
sensitive data -- such as e-mail or financial records -- that had 
been scrambled. The flaw would affect almost any version of 
Windows, the software that runs most of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft forcefully denied that it gave any government agency  
such a key, and explained that it called its function an ``NSA 
key'' because that federal agency reviews technical details for the 
export of powerful data-scrambling software. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are just used to ensure that we're compliant with U.S.  
export regulations,'' said Scott Culp, Microsoft's security manager 
for its Windows NT Server software. ``We have not shared the 
private keys. We do not share our keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The claim against Microsoft, originally leveled by security  
consultant Andrew Fernandes of Mississauga, Ontario, on his Web 
site, spread quickly in e-mail and discussion groups across the 
Internet, especially in those corners of cyberspace where Microsoft 
and the federal government are often criticized. 
</P>
<P>
	Culp called Fernandes' claims ``completely false.''  
</P>
<P>
	An NSA spokesman declined immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Schneier, a cryptography expert, said the claim by  
Fernandes ``makes no sense'' because a government agency as 
sophisticated as the NSA doesn't need Microsoft's help to 
unscramble sensitive computer information. 
</P>
<P>
	``That it allows the NSA to load unauthorized security services,  
compromise your operating system -- that's nonsense,'' said 
Schneier, who runs Counterpane Internet Security Inc. ``The NSA can 
already do that, and it has nothing to do with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandes, who runs a small consulting firm in Canada, said he  
found the suspiciously named ``NSA key'' -- along with another key 
for Microsoft -- while examining the software code within the latest 
version of Windows NT. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the second key was discovered earlier by other  
cryptographers, but Fernandes was the first to find its official 
name and theorize about its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``That (the U.S. government) has ... installed a cryptographic  
back door in the world's most abundant operating system should send 
a strong message to foreign (information technology) managers,'' he 
warned on his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fernandes seemed less worried Friday in a telephone  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that they have reason to lie,'' he said. ``The  
main point is, you can't really trust what they're saying. They've 
been caught with their hand in the cookie jar. In fact, I think 
they're being fairly honest, but you don't know what else is in 
Windows.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Allows Pre-Game Prayer in Tex. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, Texas (AP) -- The biggest cheer at the year's first  
high school football game here wasn't for a play or a player, but 
for a 17-year-old student who offered the pre-game prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Television cameras were trained on Marian Lynn Ward before  
Friday night's game between Santa Fe and Crosby high schools as she 
asked God to bless the event. A one-minute standing ovation 
followed her remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Fe Independent School District Superintendent Richard  
Ownby had warned any student who violated an appeals court ruling 
banning pre-game prayer would be disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
	But hours before kickoff, U.S. District Judge Sim Lake of  
Houston issued a temporary restraining order barring the school 
district southeast of Houston from punishing Miss Ward if she led 
the crowd in prayer. The school guidelines ``clearly prefer atheism 
over any religious faith,'' he ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Santa Fe High School student had been elected to deliver  
``inspirational remarks'' before the game, but bowed out due to 
threats of punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Ward, her voice cracking, seemed on the verge of crying as  
she said: ``God thank you for this evening. Thank you for all the 
prayers that were lifted up this week for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her father, the Rev. Bob Ward of the Santa Fe Baptist Church,  
watched proudly with his wife, Marjorie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very proud of her,'' the pastor said. ``I'm pleased  
with her character and her conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Kelly Coghlan, representing Miss Ward, had filed suit  
against the district late Thursday. Although Miss Ward had not 
indicated she would pray, Coghlan said he believed the 
superintendent's threat of discipline violated her Constitutional 
right to speak freely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want a government that tells students they must  
pray,'' Coghlan said. ``But I do not want a government either that 
stifles genuinely student-initiated prayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Ward said she received supportive calls during the week  
from supporters in several states, as well as Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a bit overwhelmed, and it's pretty surreal right now,''  
she said during halftime. ``It was a lot of relief because it's 
been a tough week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A national debate over school-sanctioned prayer focused on Santa  
Fe in 1995 when two families filed suit against the Galveston 
County school district, challenging its policies allowing 
student-led prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	While the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit supported prayer at high  
school commencements, its ruling on sporting events ended the 
football tradition across Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Fe school district has petitioned the Supreme Court to  
review the case, citing an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
ruling that makes pre-game prayer legal in Alabama, Florida and 
Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Signs One-Year Rockets Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Free agent forward Charles Barkley agreed to a  
one-year contract with the Houston Rockets, the team said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still a great player and we really need him,'' said  
Carroll Dawson, the Rockets' vice president of basketball 
operations. ``He said he wanted to play one more year, so that's 
what we talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson would not confirm the amount of the contract but Houston  
television station KRIV, citing sources, reported it was worth $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, the NBA's MVP in 1992-93 with the Phoenix Suns, is  
heading into his 16th NBA season and fourth with the Rockets. He 
finished second in the league in rebounds last season, averaging 
12.3. He also averaged 16 points and 4.5 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the Rockets announced they signed free agent Thomas  
Hamilton. The 7-foot-2 center will be entering his second NBA 
season but hasn't played since 1995-96 with the Boston Celtics. He 
played in 11 games that season, averaging 2.3 points and 2.0 
rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Seven Die When Small Plane Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- An ambulance plane flying from  
Michigan to Boca Raton crashed into a strip mall early today while 
trying to make an emergency landing, killing all seven aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't immediately known if any were patients.  
</P>
<P>
	The plane, a twin-engine Beechcraft King Air BE-90, hit the roof  
of a mall building at about 3:30 a.m., according to Federal 
Aviation Administration spokeswoman Tanya Wagner in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven dead were aboard the plane, according to Jorge  
Prellezo, regional director of the National Transportation Safety 
Board in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an ambulance flight, ``like airplanes they actually  
charter to move a patient,'' he said, but he didn't know whether 
any of the seven were patients. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a small fire after the crash, Prellezo said.

	``The landing gear from the aircraft is inside one of the  
buildings,'' Capt. Nigel Baker of Palm Beach Fire Rescue told 
WFOR-TV in Miami.

<P>
	The plane, which took off from a small airport near Pontiac,  
Mich., was diverted after the pilot reported problems, the station 
reported.

<HEADLINE> Irvan To Retire From Winston Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Ernie Irvan, recovering from a second  
head injury in five years, retired today after 13 seasons on the 
NASCAR Winston Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a tough decision to make, but I was able to make it  
on my own terms, and now I can focus on my immediate future,'' said 
Irvan, who nearly died from a head injury five years ago and still 
is recovering from a less-serious one two weeks ago. ``Physically, 
I feel good, but I believe this is the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Californian said doctors who have been treating  
him since his latest crash, Aug. 20, at Michigan Speedway, did not 
tell him he had to retire. He said he made the decision Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said another accident like the one I had earlier probably  
would be detrimental to me living a wholesome life,'' Irvan said, 
his voice cracking with emotion as he sat with his wife and two 
children. ``It's something that brings tears to my eyes to know I'm 
never going to drive a Winston Cup car again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He crashed during a practice session for a Busch Series race,  
sustaining head and lung injuries. He spent several days in a 
Michigan hospital, then returned to his farm in Mooresville, N.C., 
to continue his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened five years to the day after a near-fatal  
wreck on the same 2-mile superspeedway. Irvan lingered near death 
after the 1994 crash, at first given only a 10 percent chance of 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	But he recovered, and 14 months later resumed a once-promising  
career that included a victory in the 1991 Daytona 500, the world's 
premier stock car race. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan has driven in the Winston Cup series since 1987, getting  
his first victory for Morgan-McClure Racing in 1990. He had seven 
of his 15 career victories for that team, then moved to Robert 
Yates Racing late in 1993 after its driver, Davey Allison, was 
killed in a helicopter crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan became a fan favorite in part because the No. Ford 28 had  
been driven by several Hall of Famers. Yates did not renew Irvan's 
contract at the end of the 1997 season, and the driver moved to 
MBII Motorsports, with whom he recently agreed to a contract 
extension through the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Irvan didn't win in two seasons with MBII, his  
popularity grew with fans as a result of slick marketing by his 
sponsor. Children were excited by the paint schemes on his cars, 
especially that of M&AMP;M's, which includes comic-strip-like candy 
pieces all over the No. 36 Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first Michigan accident, Irvan never regained his  
form. He had three more victories for Yates, the most recent his 
only career win at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was big moment for me, because I almost died at that  
track,'' Irvan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan had five top-10 finishes this season, his best sixth in  
the Las Vegas 400. He made 313 starts, had 22 poles and 68 top-five 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is co-owner of Irvan-Simo Motorsports, which has fielded  
entries in NASCAR's Truck, Grand National and Winston Cup series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some people are surprised that I'm still able to  
comprehend all this,'' Irvan said. ``So, I think retiring now is 
the smartest thing I can do.''

<HEADLINE> Photos Peek Into D.C.'s Top Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who don't expect ever to get into the  
private drawing room of Sir Christopher Meyer, Queen Elizabeth's 
ambassador to Washington, can get a peek inside the residence 
through a book of photos that penetrates some of the capital's top 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The kind of peeping Toms who are fascinated by interior decor  
can have a look at Sir Christopher's state dining room. They will 
see the massive red drapes, the four glasses at each place setting 
and the queen's monogram on the chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	But they have to imagine the white ties, deep-cleavage dinner  
gowns, tall footmen in royal livery and the kilted Scots bagpiper 
who used to appear at formal dinners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Private Washington'' is a coffee-table book that appeals to  
people curious about how the other half lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Architectural photographer Walter Smalling Jr. also looked into  
Halcyon House, built in 1787 five years before the White House was 
begun. On Prospect Hill just below the tower of Georgetown 
University, it looks out over the Potomac, the landmarks of the 
capital and the high-rises of Rosslyn on the Virginia side of the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
	George Washington and other founding fathers knew Halcyon House  
as the home of Benjamin Stoddert, the first secretary of the Navy. 
It was near the landing of the ferry from Virginia, where 
Washington and Jefferson lived. Author Jan Cigliano writes that the 
William Jefferson Clintons have also been there to ``dance the 
night away.'' The first lady's office confirmed that they have been 
guests at least once. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once people accepted to let us go into their homes, it wasn't  
difficult,'' the author said in an interview. ``But about twice as 
many refused. They were people who are in public office, or just 
want to keep their lives private.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cigliano and Smalling cover 26 homes in the book.  
</P>
<P>
	Real estate developer John Dreyfuss, 49, has spent more than 20  
years redoing Halcyon House. His biggest job was to get rid of odd 
additions by a former owner who kept building for 38 years until 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Clemons, known in his Georgetown neighborhood as an  
eccentric, had put in doors that led into walls, closets that led 
into other closets, rooms too low to stand in, and 10 rental 
apartments masked by a four-story facade facing the street. The 
original spare but elegant two-story structure faces the river, 
across a garden said to have been laid out originally by Pierre 
L'Enfant, who planned the city of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreyfuss now has a sculpture studio in the basement and rents  
out space for business events every few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Private Washington'' provides views of the dining room and its  
Japanese screens in the Georgetown mansion of Katharine Graham, 
which also dates back to Revolutionary times. She's the 82-year-old 
president of the Washington Post Co. who won a Pulitzer Prize last 
year for her autobiography ``Personal History.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other media celebrity lairs include the home of the Post's  
retired executive editor, Ben Bradlee. His wife, author Sally 
Quinn, writes in the introduction to the book of being scared by an 
apparition in her back doorway of a woman in the lace cap and 
full-skirted gown of the 1700s. The ghost disappeared as suddenly 
as she came. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out it was a costumed guide from the Old Stone House,  
the oldest house in Georgetown, built long before the White House. 
She had seen the Bradlees' garden gate open and couldn't restrain 
her professional curiosity.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dropped in Princess Di Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A French judge has dismissed all charges against  
nine photographers and a press motorcyclist implicated in the car 
crash that killed Princess Diana, ending the two-year investigation 
into the accident, judicial sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In his decision, Judge Herve Stephan said the accident was ``due  
to the fact that the driver of the car was inebriated and under the 
effects of drugs incompatible with alcohol, which did not allow him 
to maintain control of his vehicle,'' the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephan also concluded that the decision by Dodi Fayed, Diana's  
boyfriend, to order an off-duty security official, who was drunk, 
to drive the Mercedes, also contributed to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana died in the Aug. 31, 1997 crash in a Paris traffic tunnel.  
Fayed and the driver, Henri Paul, were also killed. Only bodyguard 
Trevor Rees-Jones survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed Al Fayed, Dodi's father and the owner of the Ritz Hotel  
that leased the vehicle, will appeal the decision, said his lawyer 
in Paris, George Kiejman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The photographers have a shared responsibility with the  
drivers,'' Kiejman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Fayed will continue to pursue ``the truth,'' said a spokesman  
in London. Al Fayed has said he believes there was a murder 
conspiracy plotted by people who did not approve of Diana's 
relationship with Dodi, an Egyptian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Al Fayed has the resources and the will and has vowed to  
find out exactly why his son and the others died,'' said spokesman 
Laurie Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl Spencer, Diana's brother, who had also lashed out against  
the photographers, thanked the French authorities for ``the time 
and effort they have put into the investigation, and I respect the 
legal conclusions that have been reached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckingham Palace had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The judge followed recommendations issued Aug. 16 by the state  
prosecutor to drop charges of manslaughter and failing to assist 
persons in danger against the photographers and the press 
motorcyclist, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Speed and alcohol long have been identified as the major causes  
of the crash, but initial suspicion fell on the photographers who 
were involved in a high-speed chase of Diana in hopes of getting a 
valuable shot of the princess and her beau. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographers, who acknowledge tailing Diana, claim they  
were made scapegoats and maintained throughout the investigation 
that they bore no responsibility for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	They had been placed under formal investigation, which in France  
is one step short of being formally charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision to dismiss the charges is a tremendous relief  
and puts an end to two nerve-wracking years,'' said Romuald Rat, a 
photographer who had tried to take Diana's pulse as she lay dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana was the world's hottest photographic prey in the summer of  
1997, and photos of her and Dodi in the midst of a budding romance 
could fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited report by Stephan, the chief investigating  
judge, can be appealed by any of the parties to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Rees-Jones, who has filed a suit against the Ritz  
hotel and its car service, Etoile Limousine, ``for endangering the 
lives of others,'' praised the decision. Christian Curtil said he 
was pleased the judge had ``emphasized the responsibility of the 
Ritz hotel and the Etoile-Limousine company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Rees-Jones had not decided whether to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	The bodyguard's suit cites the Ritz and the car service for  
``failing to provide a licensed driver'' for the Mercedes that 
crashed. The driver, Henri Paul, did not have the type of license 
required to drive the Mercedes 280S sedan, provided to the Ritz by 
Etoile-Limousine.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Wear '22' As Tribute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Angry with baseball and many of his colleagues  
who didn't support the union leadership, National League umpire 
Steve Rippley said Friday he may retire next week and join the 22 
umps already out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just gets to the point where the whole thing gets to be  
mind-boggling,'' Rippley said. ``The money is not the issue here. 
It's what they've done and the principle, to see how they have been 
so ruthless, with how they treated the families, just for whatever 
reasons. It's not humane what they've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the remaining umps, including Gerry Davis, Jeff  
Kellogg, Jerry Layne, Ed Rapuano and Rich Rieker, wore ``MLUA 22'' 
on their caps Friday night in tribute to the 22 members of the 
Major League Umpires Association who were let go Thursday as a 
result of the union's failed resignation strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's to show that they are in our hearts and in our prayers,''  
Davis said. ``I haven't seen anything that stops it. We receive 
memos all the time on things that are legal. We've never received 
anything that says you can't have numbers written on your cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Hirschbeck had the initials of his son, and rightfully  
so. The Pittsburgh Pirates had `Kid' written on their hats for 
Jason Kendall. The Atlanta Braves had No. 14 for Andres 
Galarraga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations  
in the commissioner's office, wasn't pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect that at some time very shortly that practice  
will come to an end,'' he said. ``Baseball has been lenient with 
respect to cap adornments that refer to injured or seriously ill 
teammates and that kind of thing. Political statements are not 
viewed the same way, and we will take appropriate steps through the 
leagues to make sure that practice stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Montague, a supporter of the union leadership, wore ``22'' on  
his cap Thursday and missed Friday's game between Milwaukee and St. 
Louis, saying he was dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the doctor prescribes Gatorade for a malady, you have to  
be skeptical,'' Alderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, a crew chief scheduled to work a weekend series in  
Chicago, called NL senior vice president Katy Feeney on Thursday 
and said he wanted to retire. She told the 16-year veteran to think 
it over, Rippley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Rippley spoke with Paul Runge, the league's  
executive director of umpires, who said he should take the weekend 
off, think about his decision and get back to him Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Triple-A umpire Dan Iassonga filled in for the games at Wrigley  
Field, joining a crew that included Wally Bell, Jerry Meals and 
Hunter Wendelstedt. Bell, who is in his seventh season, was one of 
three NL umpires who broke with the union leadership. Meals is in 
his third NL season and Wendelstedt is among the 25 newly hired 
umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Darling and Larry Poncino, who had been on Rippley's crew,  
were among the 22 umpires whose resignations were accepted. They 
worked their final games Wednesday and hope an arbitrator will 
order the NL to reinstate them after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My workload is going to go up, and they're not going to  
compensate me for it,'' said Rippley, scheduled to work in 
Milwaukee starting Tuesday. ``Some of these kids don't have a week 
in the big leagues. You don't have 25 qualified guys at Triple-A to 
be major league umpires. They are running the pennant races with 
unqualified umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep saying the minor-league system needs revamping. If  
the minor-league system is so bad, how can you pull 25 guys up? 
They're going around in circles. All they're doing is getting 
caught up in their own lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, a member of the union's board, said one reason to  
remain would be to provide a vote for union head Richie Phillips, 
who faces a battle from a dissident group that wants 
Baltimore-based agent Ron Shapiro to negotiate the umpires' next 
labor deal. 
</P>
<P>
	AL umpires Joe Brinkman, John Hirschbeck and Dave Phillips are  
organizing the dissidents, who are expected to try to form a new 
union by submitting a petition to the National Labor Relations 
Board. The dissidents, who caused the union's strategy of mass 
resignations to collapse in July, need at least 30 percent of 
umpires to call for an NLRB-supervised election, and they are 
convinced they have sufficient support. 
</P>
<P>
	If Rippley retires, he would receive his final paycheck in  
October and get about $310,000 in termination pay. The 45-year-old 
from Seminole, Fla., isn't sure what he would do next. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything arranged or set up,'' he said. ``I would  
think somebody would want me. Given how we travel, how we work 
under all that pressure, there's got to be a job out there where 
somebody would want me.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Gets Right To Sue Over 'Annie' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The sun will come out tomorrow for Joanna  
Pacitti, who won the right to pursue a lawsuit against Macy's over 
a starring role in the Broadway musical ``Annie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
ruled Thursday in favor of the 15-year-old girl from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said she can resume the breach-of-contract  
suit she filed against the department store. She claimed she won a 
contest to star in the show but was cut from the cast two weeks 
before the scheduled opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said a judge erred in ruling that Joanna had  
won only a chance to audition, not a guaranteed Broadway role. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. said ``it was reasonable for  
plaintiffs to believe that Macy's offered the starring role of 
`Annie' on Broadway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department store had billed its heavily publicized  
nationwide audition contest as ``Macy's Search for Broadway's New 
Annie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Ray, a spokesman at Macy's flagship store in New York, had  
no comment.

<HEADLINE> Romanowski Denies Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill  
Romanowski did not fraudulently obtain a controlled prescription 
drug, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference Thursday, Romanowski attorney Jeff Springer  
accused authorities of harassing Romanowski and of leaking 
information about the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is truly disappointing when a decent, good family man gives  
of himself to the community and charitable organizations and has 
his good name and character assassinated under the circumstances 
simply because he finds himself to be a Denver Bronco,'' Springer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegations are scandalous.''  
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski and his wife, Julie, attended the news conference,  
but declined to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas County sheriff's deputies have alleged Romanowski used  
fraud and deceit to obtain Phentermine, a drug that usually is 
prescribed to help severely obese people lose weight. It also acts 
as a stimulant to the central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Attila Denes said the department has recommended felony  
criminal charges be filed against Romanowski, his wife, Dr. Randall 
Snook of Littleton and Loretta Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the four has been arrested.  
</P>
<P>
	Denes said Snook wrote eight prescriptions for Phentermine for  
Mrs. Romanowski and Johnson between September 1998 and August. He 
alleged the drugs were obtained primarily for Romanowski. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer said the drug is legal and is not banned by the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
	``What Bill Romanowski did was approved and encouraged by a  
doctor, and has been ratified by at least one other doctor,'' 
Springer said. ``In order to avoid publicity, the doctor wrote the 
prescription in the name of somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our opinion ... Bill has not violated any laws.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Capt. Bill Walker said his deputies and Drug  
Enforcement Administration agents took the case to prosecutors 
Thursday following a two-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Arapahoe County district attorney's office  
said a decision on whether charges will be filed probably will not 
be made until late next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski faces felony charges of fraud and deceit, conspiracy,  
and a misdemeanor charge of unlawful use of a controlled substance. 
Mrs. Romanowski and Johnson face felony charges of fraud and 
deceit, as well as conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Snook faces the same charges along with a felony charge of  
unlawful acts and a charge of unlawful dispensing of a controlled 
substance.

<HEADLINE> Browns Tear Up Home Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns decided to plow under  
their ``cow pasture'' before playing the Pittsburgh Steelers on it. 
</P>
<P>
	After players complained about loose turf and former linebacker  
Chris Spielman called it a ``cow pasture'' after two exhibition 
games, the Browns tore up and replaced the entire playing field in 
their new $283 million stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	With their first regular-season home game at the new Cleveland  
Browns Stadium set for Sept. 12 and on national TV, the Browns had 
the field, planted by the city in late June, re-sodded from goal 
line to goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did this because we felt the level of play that one could  
expect on the preexisting field was not what the mayor of the city, 
the Cleveland Browns or the National Football League were expecting 
from this new facility,'' Browns president Carmen Policy said. 
``This was not the way we wanted to highlight our game especially 
on prime-time TV with the nation watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the Browns' first two exhibition games, players were  
losing their footing as they tried to cut and large chunks of the 
sod came up. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, according to Policy, was that a clay base should  
have been used instead of sand and the sod should have been laid 
earlier. The grass needed at least 3 inches of root depth and had 
only reached 2, partly because of the late installation and a hot, 
dry summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, who retired earlier this week because of a neck  
injury, was the most outspoken player about the condition of the 
playing surface. But Policy said the team was aware of the problem, 
and decided to replace the field and its sand base, partly because 
of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns are reportedly paying the $75,000 to $100,000 bill to  
redo the job, but Policy said the team, which has made other 
alterations to the stadium, would work with the city before 
deciding on how to pay for the latest change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't make the decision because we thought it was on  
somebody else's dime,'' said Policy, who was handed the keys to the 
new stadium by the city on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said he has been very pleased with the new stadium, and  
that the majority of the complaints the Browns have received from 
fans could be easily solved. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the Browns played their first exhibition game,  
Policy heard about one of the problems while jogging. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy ran buy, and said, `Great game, great stadium. Put  
some timeouts on the scoreboard,''' Policy said. ``We took care of 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Will Name Investigator for Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today denied that  
recent revelations about the FBI's use of tear gas during the 1993 
Branch Davidian siege had strained her relations with FBI Director 
Louis Freeh. This is no time to ``play one off against the other,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At her weekly news conference, Reno said she will find a person  
who is free of ``conflicts of interest and will be well-received'' 
to head an independent investigation into why it took the FBI six 
years to acknowledge its use of the pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I hope will happen is that we will be able to agree on a  
mandate that gives them full authority to pursue any unanswered 
question,'' the attorney general said, declining to identify the 
candidate she is seeking to head the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno and Freeh themselves have been under siege since the FBI's  
disclosure last week that a ``very limited number'' of incendiary 
tear-gas rounds were fired at a concrete outpost adjacent to the 
Davidians' compound on the final day of the 51-day standoff. That 
admission, and the FBI's production this week of previously 
undisclosed videotape evidence, came after six years of denials. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault on the complex near Waco, Texas, ended with cult  
leader David Koresh and some 80 followers dead -- some by fire, 
others by gunshot. Reno accepted full responsibility for the 
assault and federal officials have insisted that the fire was 
started by Koresh and his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	While confirming that she had ordered agents not to use  
incendiary devices during the tear-gas operation, Reno said all the 
evidence she has seen supports the view that federal agents did not 
start the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the truth shows what I believe to be the case -- that we  
tried to set up something that would bring the people out and give 
them a chance to come out in a safe and orderly way -- and that it 
was their determination and their judgment and their actions that 
brought that fire upon them, then I would use the experience we 
have here and figure out what we can do for the future,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether she would resign: ``If the truth shows I've done  
something wrong, then I will accept the consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she hoped to identify the lead investigator as soon as  
possible, but didn't say when that would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken some time because I want to do it the right  
way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also told reporters she is proceeding carefully because she  
wants to assure that the investigation ``has the confidence and 
faith of the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she and Freeh often confer on difficult issues and  
sometimes disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, sometimes I call him and say, `Why did you do this?' or  
he will call and say, `If I were you, I'd do that.' That's the type 
of relationship we have,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is among those calling for an independent  
investigation of the Waco case. Clinton ``is deeply concerned that 
the attorney general appears to have been misled and may have been 
lied to'' about what went on at Waco, White House spokesman Jake 
Siewert said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's admission last week that combustible tear gas was used  
provoked a furor on and off Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Reno-ordered probe, congressional hearings  
will be convened this fall and the House Judiciary Committee 
chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, is pushing for a congressional 
commission in hopes that would avoid the bitter partisanship 
exhibited during earlier Waco hearings on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The infrared videotape made public Thursday, recorded from an  
FBI plane, runs from just before 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. on the final 
morning of the 51-day siege -- covering the period during which the 
FBI assault began. 
</P>
<P>
	That footage, which FBI officials said was recently discovered  
at the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's offices in Quantico, Va., was 
taken into custody Wednesday by federal marshals at Justice's 
instruction. The Hostage Rescue Team was in charge of operations 
during the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno denied today that Justice's use of marshals to confiscate  
the evidence marked a public rebuke to the FBI -- a contention her 
own aides had made. ``I think it was everyone trying to figure out 
what the best way to do it was, and some people making some 
assumptions that weren't correct,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A second videotape, which runs from 8 a.m. to 10:42 a.m.,  
surfaced Thursday; and FBI officials were taking steps to release 
it publicly as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau officials had previously insisted in sworn affidavits  
that they didn't have any infrared video footage before 10:42 a.m. 
-- hours after the tear-gas assault began at 5:55 a.m. FBI spokesman 
Tron Brekke said the apparent discrepancy is ``a legitimate point 
for inquiry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early morning tape captured a radio transmission in which an  
FBI field commander granted permission for an agent to lob military 
incendiary tear-gas rounds at a concrete bunker 40 yards from the 
Davidians' compound. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can try it?'' asked the rescue team's supervisory special  
agent, Stephen P. McGavin, after saying that an agent could ``with 
relative safety'' use a vehicle as cover and fire military tear gas 
canisters into the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, that's affirmative,'' answered Richard M. Rogers, the  
rescue team's assistant special agent in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Brekke said bureau officials decided to release the video and a  
transcript because the action ``clearly demonstrates that we are 
interested in the facts concerning Waco to come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in our interest,'' he added. ``Our credibility's been  
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said the conversation took place at 7:49 a.m. -- nearly  
two hours after the tear-gas assault began but hours before flames 
began racing through the Davidians' wooden home at 12:07 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Online Magazine Has Hooker-Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tracy Quan is still a working girl. She just has  
a new position. 
</P>
<P>
	Quan, a one-time New York prostitute, is writing a twice-weekly  
column for the online magazine salon.com. The column takes the form 
of a diary of a New York call girl of Asian ancestry named Nancy 
Chan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds a lot like Quan's past life -- so much so that a  
competitor griped that the column, ``Diary of a Manhattan Call 
Girl,'' was not clearly identified as fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	So is it fact? Fiction? Roman a clef?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely fiction,'' says the self-proclaimed,  
self-employed former hooker. ``It's done in the way that Tom Clancy 
and others have used what they know about an industry to tell a 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The column debuted in July. Among the racier entries were  
segments titled ``Thighs Wide Shut'' and ``Lesbian Blind Date.'' 
Quan says she has already received dozens of e-mails from men, 
women, johns and hookers. 
</P>
<P>
	The columns generally mix pop psychology and soft-core porn,  
offering a peek into the title character's personal and 
professional lives. The stereotypical hooker with a heart of gold 
doesn't turn up here; a woman trying to quit the business through a 
12-step program does. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prostitutes have huge problems balancing their love lives,  
their families and their friends with work,'' Quan says. ``The life 
is complicated. It's a psychologically challenging situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one column, Nancy is trying to balance a blossoming romance  
with her work. ``A boyfriend is a professional liability, eating 
into precious time and energy that might have been expended 
profitably,'' Quan writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinner and a movie, apparently, are out.  
</P>
<P>
	There are other do's and don'ts for the working girl: ``I never  
discuss girl business with a john.'' In the summer, all business is 
done between Tuesday and Thursday to accommodate johns taking long 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	Quan is vague about her personal life: She was a teen-age  
runaway who eventually went into prostitution, spending 10 years in 
the business. Now in her 30s, she has been writing for the last two 
years, and hopes the diary may eventually become a book. 
</P>
<P>
	Among her inspirations in taking up the pen: ``Happy Hooker''  
Xaviera Hollander, the madam turned author and Penthouse columnist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Xaviera Hollander is a friend, someone I admired, someone who  
inspired me as a kid,'' Quan says. ``I was inspired by her 
real-life experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quan says she intends to concentrate on her writing now, putting  
her other career on hold -- perhaps permanently. But her experiences 
on the job will always inform her work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think of myself as a reformed ex-hooker,'' Quan says.  
``I still see the world through the eyes of a working girl.''

<HEADLINE> Man's Determination Is Son's Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Floyd Nichols was 19 when his large intestine  
was surgically removed, an effort to stop a genetic disease that 
causes deadly colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked at first, but 16 years later, the disease was  
threatening his life again. Doctors had little more to offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse to Nichols, one of his children inherited the disease,  
leaving him destined to either undergo his dad's radical intestine 
operation or get early colon cancer unless doctors found a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, a Denver businessman unaccustomed to hearing there's no  
solution, took matters into his own hands. Without any science 
training, he searched databases until he stumbled onto a potential 
drug -- and recruited doctors in a quest to make the treatment 
reality in time to protect his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Nichols' tiny company asked the Food and Drug  
Administration for permission to sell the drug Aptosyn. Nichols 
didn't live to see it, but his 11-year-old son seems to be helped 
by experimental use of Aptosyn -- and his family hopes it will prove 
Nichols' legacy for sufferers of the rare familial adenomatous 
polyposis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad for me to think that Floyd isn't here now to see  
the incredible progress that's being made,'' said his wife, Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
	Familial adenomatous polyposis, or FAP, is an insidious  
inherited disease that causes hundreds of polyps to carpet the 
large intestine and rectum as early as adolescence. Left untreated, 
those polyps almost always turn into colon cancer by age 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Because many people don't know they have FAP until it turns  
cancerous, it's hard to say how many are affected, but estimates 
range up to 25,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Current treatment: Remove the large intestine, and sometimes the  
rectum, so polyps have no place to grow. If the rectum is left, 
patients need frequent checkups to remove precancerous polyps. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, the surgery eliminates cancer risk. But it's incredibly  
difficult -- ``horrendous'' was Nichols' word -- particularly when 
patients frequently are in their teens. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols was unusually unlucky, because polyps poised to become  
cancerous grew back in part of his small intestine when he was 35. 
</P>
<P>
	He started hunting last-ditch treatments -- and discovered 11 FAP  
patients in Louisiana had a surprising side effect from the 
arthritis drug sulindac: It shrank their polyps. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols started taking sulindac in 1989, and his polyps ``went  
right away,'' recalled Dr. Rifat Pamukcu, who treated Nichols at 
the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	But sulindac has another side effect -- it's hard on the stomach,  
frequently causing ulcers. Pharmaceutical companies told Nichols 
they weren't exploring what made sulindac help FAP or creating a 
stomach-friendly version, so he persuaded his doctor, Pamukcu, to 
co-found their own drug company. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 10 grueling years -- Nichols furiously raised money to  
keep the scientists afloat and Pamukcu recalls the frustration when 
a failed experiment cost an entire year of work. Then Nichols died 
suddenly in 1996 of another aggressive cancer, barely a year after 
his Cell Pathways Inc. began testing its potential FAP drug 
Aptosyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Aptosyn is a metabolite of sulindac that Pamukcu discovered  
induced programmed cell death, one of the body's natural ways of 
getting rid of cells poised to turn cancerous. In a study of 73 
adults with FAP who retained a rectum, Aptosyn caused a 55 percent 
reduction in rectal polyps, an effect Pamukcu hopes will protect 
those people from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Nichols' 11-year-old son became the first child  
enrolled in an ongoing pediatric study to see if Aptosyn could 
postpone, if not prevent, intestinal surgery. A checkup shows his 
intestinal polyps have shrunk, said Mrs. Nichols, who asked that 
the boy not be named. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA should decide by February whether Philadelphia-based  
Cell Pathways studied enough people to prove Aptosyn really works. 
Meanwhile, Aptosyn is being tested against against common colon 
cancer -- which strikes over 120,000 Americans a year who don't have 
FAP -- and some other tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a promising time. Scientists now know inflammation-fighting  
drugs can attack colon polyps in a manner different than Aptosyn 
does. G.D. Searle is seeking FDA approval for its arthritis drug 
Celebrex to treat FAP, and Merck &AMP; Co. is studying competitor Vioxx 
against FAP, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens with Aptosyn, ``this has come a long way''  
thanks to a dad, Pamukcu said. ``This was a motivated man.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dolphins QB Craig Erickson Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Craig Erickson, once the heir apparent to Dan  
Marino, was released Friday by the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson underwent elbow surgery last year and failed to  
overtake Damon Huard this summer in the battle for the job backing 
up Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't disappointed in Craig's play,'' coach Jimmy Johnson  
said. ``We were extremely happy with the play of Damon Huard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, an eight-year veteran, said he wasn't surprised to be  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into training camp, I knew I had to have a very good  
camp,'' Erickson said. ``I could have done some things differently. 
There might be a few philosophy things, the way I approached the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to elaborate, but it's no secret he fell out of  
favor with Johnson last year. Johnson was skeptical about the 
severity of Erickson's elbow injury before the quarterback finally 
had surgery Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, 30, said his elbow feels fine now, but he declined to  
say whether he wants to join another team. He grew up in nearby 
West Palm Beach, played for the Miami Hurricanes and plans to keep 
his home in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson was released partly because the Dolphins have numerous  
injuries and need roster space for other positions. They may sign 
another third-string quarterback in a few weeks, and Johnson said 
he might try to re-sign Erickson later at a reduced salary if he's 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, who had a base salary of $650,000 this season, didn't  
rule out rejoining Miami, his third NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a dream come true to be able to play for the  
Dolphins,'' he said. ``I've had a great time here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson was Miami's No. 2 quarterback in 1996-97, starting  
three games when Marino was hurt. Marino, 37, has started 41 
consecutive regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard, a third-year pro, was an undrafted free agent and joined  
Miami in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good friend,'' Erickson said. ``He's progressed really  
well.''

<HEADLINE> Alcohol-Linked Road Deaths at Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As motorists prepared to travel for the Labor  
Day weekend, the government released encouraging news about 
alcohol-related crash fatalities: The number of such deaths has 
dropped to its lowest level in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 15,935 alcohol-related traffic deaths in 1998, down  
1.5 percent from 16,189 the year before, the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday. The 1998 figures are 
the lowest in all the 17 years the government has kept such 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol-related traffic fatalities accounted for 38.4 percent of  
the 41,471 highway deaths nationwide last year. The figure was 38.5 
percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of young people killed in alcohol-related crashes also  
dropped to nine per 100,000 in 1998, from 10 per 100,000 the year 
before, President Clinton said in radio remarks Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But even one child killed because of drunk driving is too  
many,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ricardo Martinez, an emergency room doctor who heads the  
NHTSA, released the figures at a news conference sponsored by 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which urged motorists not to drink 
and drive over the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	MADD president Karolyn Nunnallee said the National Safety  
Council is predicting that 468 people are likely to die on the 
nation's highways this weekend, and about 53 percent of those 
deaths are expected to be alcohol-related. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here because we refuse to accept this death count  
prediction as a matter of fact or fate,'' Mrs. Nunnallee said. ``We 
are here with a mission ... to see that everyone returns home 
safely from this long holiday weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During last year's Labor Day weekend, 464 people were killed and  
50 percent of those were alcohol-related. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas had the most alcohol-related traffic deaths last year with  
1,792, followed by California at 1,324. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest percentage was in Washington, D.C., where half of  
the 54 traffic deaths came in alcohol-related crashes. Utah had the 
lowest rate; there were 50 alcohol-related traffic deaths last year 
-- or 14.4 percent of its 350 fatalities. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canucks Re-Sign Todd Bertuzzi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks  
re-signed veteran left-winger Todd Bertuzzi to a contract said to 
be for two years for slightly more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A restricted free agent, Bertuzzi is coming off an  
injury-plagued year in which he missed 31 games with a fractured 
tibia and another 19 when he suffered a season-ending torn ACL in 
his left knee on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year NHL veteran managed just eight goals and 16 points  
in 32 games last year. Drafted 23rd overall by the New York 
Islanders in 1993, he was acquired by the Canucks in a Feb. 1988 
deal that sent Trevor Linden to Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Bertuzzi's new contract were not released, but The  
Vancouver Sun reported Friday that he was to be paid a little over 
$1 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bertuzzi signed, the Canucks go into training camp this  
weekend with four remaining restricted free agents yet to sign -- 
defensemen Ed Jovanovski and Adrian Aucoin and forwards Dave 
Scatchard and Peter Schaefer.

<HEADLINE> Internet's 30th Birthday Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thirty years after the first primitive  
Internet connection, the scientists who pioneered the technology 
and the entrepreneurs profiting from it tried to predict what's 
next for the global computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	Their conclusion? It could become invisible.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet will become transparent to us,'' said Len  
Kleinrock, a University of California, Los Angeles computer science 
professor. ``It will be everywhere, always available and not in our 
face -- just like electricity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinrock spoke Thursday at a conference marking the anniversary  
of the first Internet connection, which took place in his lab Sept. 
2, 1969. Then, few people cared when bits of data first flowed 
between two bulky machines linked by a 15-foot cable. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has since expanded into a force that is changing the  
way people work, learn, play and shop. New technologies are 
emerging that could allow fast access over the airwaves, and not 
just through computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't want to be connected to their desktops,''  
said Robert Kahn, president of the Corporation for National 
Research Initiatives and a computer language creator. ``They want 
to be able to move around and have access to all that 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several executives agreed, suggesting the Internet should become  
a force that works behind the scenes to carry information to 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``A user does not understand what is happening behind the  
computer screen,'' said George Vradenburg III, senior vice 
president of America Online. ``The future is in the art of making 
it disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But future advances will likely remain based on the same  
technology that was first tested in Kleinrock's lab in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The project grew from the needs of the Defense Department's  
Advance Research Projects Agency, which was formed after the Soviet 
Union's 1957 launch of Sputnik, the first manmade satellite to 
orbit the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials wanted a fast, efficient, decentralized way of sharing  
information between research centers. And the computers needed to 
speak a common language 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinrock pioneered the technology as a graduate student at  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, writing the first paper on 
the subject in 1961. He became a professor at UCLA in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	His lab was chosen for the first test communication, and by the  
end of 1969, four sites were connected: UCLA, the Stanford Research 
Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara and the 
University of Utah. The number increased to 10 within seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, there were applications like e-mail and file transfer  
utilities, but it wasn't until the late 1980s, when the World Wide 
Web appeared, that the network became a force not only in research 
but also in commerce and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the conference, the refrigerator-size Interface Message  
Processor, a translator between the early computers, made a rare 
public appearance. Its rows of lights were dark and its battleship 
gray case was opened, exposing wires, fans and other components. 
</P>
<P>
	It was used in the first test, and decommissioned in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> CBS-TV To Team Clayson and Gumbel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a summer-long search, CBS will announce  
Tuesday that it has hired ABC News correspondent Jane Clayson to be 
Bryant Gumbel's on-air partner on the ``Early Show,'' two sources 
close to the talks said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The revamped morning news show begins broadcasting in November.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Clayson, based in Los Angeles, is a reporter for ``World  
News Tonight'' and has worked at ABC since 1996. She was a reporter 
and anchor at a local station in Salt Lake City before then. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources confirming her selection spoke on condition of  
anonymity. Ms. Clayson did not immediately return a telephone 
message, and CBS News spokeswoman Sandra Genelius declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had hoped to name a co-anchor by mid-summer after persuading  
Gumbel this spring to return to morning TV. The search so 
preoccupied CBS executives that it was jokingly dubbed ``Operation 
Glass Slipper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC's Maria Bartiromo, ABC's Elizabeth Vargas, NBC's Dawn  
Fratangelo and CBS's Thalia Assuras were among the women reportedly 
being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had sought Ms. Clayson for the ``Early Show'' news reader  
position this summer but failed when ABC matched its salary offer, 
according to published reports. ABC is not expected to try and 
block her departure for the more lucrative anchor position. 
</P>
<P>
	With morning TV one of the few growth areas for the networks,  
CBS is moving boldly to end its perennial doormat status in the 
time slot. CBS is spending between $20 million and $30 million to 
build a new storefront studio across from New York's Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has hired Laurie Hibberd to report on pop culture, author  
Lisa Birnbach and former MTV VJ Martha Quinn to periodically talk 
about aging baby boomers and Mark McEwen to deliver weather and 
entertainment news. Martha Stewart and Bob Vila are expected to 
return from the current show. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the morning wars, ABC unveils its new Times Square  
studio for ``Good Morning America'' on Sept. 13.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Admits Laser Flaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department admitted to serious  
problems Friday in a program to build the world's largest laser, 
including mismanagement that will add hundreds of millions of 
dollars to its original $1.2 billion price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who said he was assured the  
project was on target as recently as June, ordered an overhaul of 
the program at the Lawrence Livermore weapons laboratory and an 
investigation into why the cost overruns were not revealed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive laser, which was supposed to have been completed by  
2003, is being built at the California research lab in a project to 
monitor and maintain America's nuclear warheads without testing 
nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department officials said mismanagement may cause the  
project's cost to soar as much as $350 million above the originally 
projected $1.2 billion and delay completion by as much as two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's announcement came a week after an embarrassing  
disclosure about the former project director's academic 
credentials. Edward Campbell resigned after it became known that he 
had for years implied he held a doctorate in electrical engineering 
when he never in fact completed his Ph.D. dissertation at Princeton 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell remains an employee at Livermore. Department officials  
said his resignation was not related directly to the cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, run by  
the University of California, did not immediately return telephone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharply critical of the university's handling of the laser  
construction, Richardson said he has ordered withheld $2 million of 
the university's $5.6 million good-performance fee because of the 
laser project problems. Additional money may be held back after a 
more thorough investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university ``must assume a stronger role in oversight of  
research and development projects'' such as the laser, said 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	He was particularly miffed about long delays in notifying him  
about management and cost problems surrounding the project, 
formally called the National Ignition Facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``As late as early June, ... I was informed that NIF was on cost  
and on schedule,'' Richardson said, adding that he has directed an 
independent panel of experts to investigate what happened and 
recommend how to get the project back on course. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cost overruns stem from underestimation of difficulties and  
complexities involved in assembling high-precision optical 
components of the 192-beam laser system, said a senior department 
official, who spoke on condition of not being identified further. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson directed that a new contractor be found to carry out  
the final assembly and integration of the facility, which when 
completed will cover an area the size of a football field. The 
weapons lab retains overall responsibility for the finished 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before Congress last March, Bruce Tarter, director  
of the Livermore lab, assured lawmakers that the project was 
progressing without problems and said half the 192 beams would be 
available by 2002. The project would be completed in 2003, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased to report that NIF construction is on budget and  
on schedule,'' Tarter told a congressional budget hearing. He asked 
for $248.1 million in construction funds for the fiscal year 
starting Oct. 1. He said 87 percent of the $1.2 billion total cost 
would be committed by the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its inception in 1997, the program has been the object of  
seven scientific and four management reviews, the latest last 
spring. ``Clearly we have had a major project management 
surprise,'' said Richardson.

<HEADLINE>  Reno Will Name Investigator for Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today denied that  
recent revelations about the FBI's use of tear gas during the 1993 
Branch Davidian siege had strained her relations with FBI Director 
Louis Freeh. This is no time to ``play one off against the other,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At her weekly news conference, Reno said she will find a person  
who is free of ``conflicts of interest and will be well-received'' 
to head an independent investigation into why it took the FBI six 
years to acknowledge its use of the pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I hope will happen is that we will be able to agree on a  
mandate that gives them full authority to pursue any unanswered 
question,'' the attorney general said, declining to identify the 
candidate she is seeking to head the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno and Freeh themselves have been under siege since the FBI's  
disclosure last week that a ``very limited number'' of incendiary 
tear-gas rounds were fired at a concrete outpost adjacent to the 
Davidians' compound on the final day of the 51-day standoff. That 
admission, and the FBI's production this week of previously 
undisclosed videotape evidence, came after six years of denials. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault on the complex near Waco, Texas, ended with cult  
leader David Koresh and some 80 followers dead -- some by fire, 
others by gunshot. Reno accepted full responsibility for the 
assault and federal officials have insisted that the fire was 
started by Koresh and his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	While confirming that she had ordered agents not to use  
incendiary devices during the tear-gas operation, Reno said all the 
evidence she has seen supports the view that federal agents did not 
start the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the truth shows what I believe to be the case -- that we  
tried to set up something that would bring the people out and give 
them a chance to come out in a safe and orderly way -- and that it 
was their determination and their judgment and their actions that 
brought that fire upon them, then I would use the experience we 
have here and figure out what we can do for the future,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether she would resign: ``If the truth shows I've done  
something wrong, then I will accept the consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she hoped to identify the lead investigator as soon as  
possible, but didn't say when that would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken some time because I want to do it the right  
way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also told reporters she is proceeding carefully because she  
wants to assure that the investigation ``has the confidence and 
faith of the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she and Freeh often confer on difficult issues and  
sometimes disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, sometimes I call him and say, `Why did you do this?' or  
he will call and say, `If I were you, I'd do that.' That's the type 
of relationship we have,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is among those calling for an independent  
investigation of the Waco case. Clinton ``is deeply concerned that 
the attorney general appears to have been misled and may have been 
lied to'' about what went on at Waco, White House spokesman Jake 
Siewert said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's admission last week that combustible tear gas was used  
provoked a furor on and off Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Reno-ordered probe, congressional hearings  
will be convened this fall and the House Judiciary Committee 
chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, is pushing for a congressional 
commission in hopes that would avoid the bitter partisanship 
exhibited during earlier Waco hearings on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The infrared videotape made public Thursday, recorded from an  
FBI plane, runs from just before 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. on the final 
morning of the 51-day siege -- covering the period during which the 
FBI assault began. 
</P>
<P>
	That footage, which FBI officials said was recently discovered  
at the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's offices in Quantico, Va., was 
taken into custody Wednesday by federal marshals at Justice's 
instruction. The Hostage Rescue Team was in charge of operations 
during the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno denied today that Justice's use of marshals to confiscate  
the evidence marked a public rebuke to the FBI -- a contention her 
own aides had made. ``I think it was everyone trying to figure out 
what the best way to do it was, and some people making some 
assumptions that weren't correct,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A second videotape, which runs from 8 a.m. to 10:42 a.m.,  
surfaced Thursday; and FBI officials were taking steps to release 
it publicly as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau officials had previously insisted in sworn affidavits  
that they didn't have any infrared video footage before 10:42 a.m. 
-- hours after the tear-gas assault began at 5:55 a.m. FBI spokesman 
Tron Brekke said the apparent discrepancy is ``a legitimate point 
for inquiry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early morning tape captured a radio transmission in which an  
FBI field commander granted permission for an agent to lob military 
incendiary tear-gas rounds at a concrete bunker 40 yards from the 
Davidians' compound. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can try it?'' asked the rescue team's supervisory special  
agent, Stephen P. McGavin, after saying that an agent could ``with 
relative safety'' use a vehicle as cover and fire military tear gas 
canisters into the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, that's affirmative,'' answered Richard M. Rogers, the  
rescue team's assistant special agent in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Brekke said bureau officials decided to release the video and a  
transcript because the action ``clearly demonstrates that we are 
interested in the facts concerning Waco to come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in our interest,'' he added. ``Our credibility's been  
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said the conversation took place at 7:49 a.m. -- nearly  
two hours after the tear-gas assault began but hours before flames 
began racing through the Davidians' wooden home at 12:07 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Boy Finds Pirates' '79 Series Trophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The missing 1979 World Series trophy turned up  
behind a Pittsburgh-area church, and the boy who found it got to 
visit with the Pirates on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it remained unclear exactly how the trophy disappeared  
from the lobby of the Allegheny Club at Three Rivers Stadium and 
authorities continued their investigation, now armed with 
fingerprints taken from the well-traveled trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe somebody's conscience was bothering them and they  
decided to turn it in,'' said Det. Donald Pasquarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Offerman, 12, was doing cleanup work Friday morning at a  
church when he found a black plastic bag outside the back door. He 
saw the trophy gleaming from the top of the bag and hailed firemen 
who were conducting a fundraiser in the neighborhood, after which 
they contacted police. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw it at first I knew what it was, but I didn't want  
to believe it,'' said Offerman, who had seen television reports 
about it being taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasquarelli said the freckle-faced youngster mentioned to police  
that he was a big fan of the Pirates, and told him he knew the team 
was back in town Friday for a game against the San Francisco 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so cute,'' Pasquarelli said. ``He said, `Hey officer,  
I'm free tonight. I don't have anything to do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pasquarelli said he knew someone at the Allegheny Club, and a  
few phone calls later, the Pirates had arranged for Offerman to 
meet his favorite player, second baseman Warren Morris. He was also 
given tickets to attend the game with family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Offerman walked awestruck across the field and  
visited in the dugout with Pirates manager Gene Lamont. He tried on 
a few hats before finding one that fit just right; Lamont told him 
to make sure and roll the bill just right. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's eyes opened wide as Morris walked up to him. When  
asked what position he would play, Offerman said second base. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd better watch out, Mo,'' Lamont teased.  
</P>
<P>
	Offerman doesn't really remember much about the 1979 World  
Series when the Pirates won the trophy, but he wanted to make sure 
the trophy got back to its proper place, so officials made sure he 
was the one to put it back into the trophy case. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a real good kid, just like out of a movie or something,''  
Sgt. Mark Ninehouser said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was minor damage to the award; two pennants -- the Boston  
Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics -- were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy has rarely left the stadium since it was donated by  
the Galbreath family, former owners of the team. But sometime 
between 5:15 p.m. and 6 p.m. Wednesday, during a private corporate 
party at the club, the trophy disappeared from an unlocked glass 
display case. Authorities and a memorabilia expert estimate the 
value of the trophy at $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegheny Club president Kevin Vaughn said they don't think it  
was a guest who took it. A guard is posted at the stadium entrance 
to check the guest list for anyone coming in and likely would have 
noticed someone leaving with something that stands 3 feet tall and 
weighs about 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the trophy is returned, they're in there reviewing  
all the security measures,'' Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh burglary detectives were questioning employees and  
some 100 guests who attended the private evening party, which was 
hosted by a club member. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must have gone out into the stadium area,'' Vaughn said.  
``We have no idea how they got it, actually.''

<HEADLINE>  Irvan To Retire From Winston Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Ernie Irvan, recovering from a second  
head injury in five years, retired today after 13 seasons on the 
NASCAR Winston Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a tough decision to make, but I was able to make it  
on my own terms, and now I can focus on my immediate future,'' said 
Irvan, who nearly died from a head injury five years ago and still 
is recovering from a less-serious one two weeks ago. ``Physically, 
I feel good, but I believe this is the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Californian said doctors who have been treating  
him since his latest crash, Aug. 20, at Michigan Speedway, did not 
tell him he had to retire. He said he made the decision Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said another accident like the one I had earlier probably  
would be detrimental to me living a wholesome life,'' Irvan said, 
his voice cracking with emotion as he sat with his wife and two 
children. ``It's something that brings tears to my eyes to know I'm 
never going to drive a Winston Cup car again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He crashed during a practice session for a Busch Series race,  
sustaining head and lung injuries. He spent several days in a 
Michigan hospital, then returned to his farm in Mooresville, N.C., 
to continue his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened five years to the day after a near-fatal  
wreck on the same 2-mile superspeedway. Irvan lingered near death 
after the 1994 crash, at first given only a 10 percent chance of 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	But he recovered, and 14 months later resumed a once-promising  
career that included a victory in the 1991 Daytona 500, the world's 
premier stock car race. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan has driven in the Winston Cup series since 1987, getting  
his first victory for Morgan-McClure Racing in 1990. He had seven 
of his 15 career victories for that team, then moved to Robert 
Yates Racing late in 1993 after its driver, Davey Allison, was 
killed in a helicopter crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan became a fan favorite in part because the No. Ford 28 had  
been driven by several Hall of Famers. Yates did not renew Irvan's 
contract at the end of the 1997 season, and the driver moved to 
MBII Motorsports, with whom he recently agreed to a contract 
extension through the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Irvan didn't win in two seasons with MBII, his  
popularity grew with fans as a result of slick marketing by his 
sponsor. Children were excited by the paint schemes on his cars, 
especially that of M&AMP;M's, which includes comic-strip-like candy 
pieces all over the No. 36 Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first Michigan accident, Irvan never regained his  
form. He had three more victories for Yates, the most recent his 
only career win at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was big moment for me, because I almost died at that  
track,'' Irvan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan had five top-10 finishes this season, his best sixth in  
the Las Vegas 400. He made 313 starts, had 22 poles and 68 top-five 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is co-owner of Irvan-Simo Motorsports, which has fielded  
entries in NASCAR's Truck, Grand National and Winston Cup series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some people are surprised that I'm still able to  
comprehend all this,'' Irvan said. ``So, I think retiring now is 
the smartest thing I can do.''

<HEADLINE> No Deal in Detroit Teacher's Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Officials in the state's largest school district  
and the teachers striking against it dug in their heels over merit 
pay and class sizes as negotiators tried to end the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked a lot but we agreed on nothing,'' said John Elliott,  
president of the Detroit Federation of Teachers, the union 
representing 9,200 teachers. ``There's no movement, no momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Classes in the 172,000-student district were canceled for a  
fourth day Thursday as negotiations went on throughout the day 
before breaking off shortly before midnight. Talks were scheduled 
to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have issues that haven't been resolved,'' said Jim  
Amar, a state mediator appointed Aug. 24 to sit in on the talks 
between the board and union. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers won at least one concession from the reform-minded  
school administration -- a district proposal to extend the school 
day by 2 hours, to 8 1/2 hours, was withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, teachers would not oppose having aides and other  
non-teaching personnel work longer days so the district could offer 
after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	David Adamany, the district's chief executive, remained  
committed to his proposal to reward schools meeting test score and 
attendance targets by granting ``merit bonuses'' to every employee 
in that school -- including custodians and secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Danic, an English teacher at Osborn High School, said  
the plan would reward teachers at what he called ``showcase 
schools'' without recognizing competent teachers at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inequity of the worst teacher in a good school receiving a  
bonus, but not a good teacher in a bad school, is totally unfair,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other contentious issues included salary, class size and sick  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous contract between the teachers and the school system  
expired June 30, and an extension ran out Monday. Teachers then 
voted to reject negotiators' recommendation for another extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike has put at least a temporary halt to reform efforts  
led by Adamany since he took the job in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John Engler, who signed legislation shifting control of the  
district from the elected board to an appointed board that hired 
Adamany, said the change was necessary to shore up lagging test 
scores, chronically low attendance and graduation rates in the 
nation's 10th-largest city.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Surge Upward; Crude Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean futures zoomed Friday to their highest price since March  
as investors braced for a smaller crop than expected due to a run 
of dry weather in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, crude oil and its products rose and pork  
bellies fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans advanced for a fourth consecutive day on the Chicago  
Board of Trade in response to three forecasts that predicted the 
crop would come in significantly smaller than the most recent 
government estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The three private forecasts averaged about 90 million bushels  
less than the 2.87 billion bushels anticipated by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture in its August estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers Commodities Corp. of Des Moines, Iowa, predicted the  
1999-2000 soybean crop would be 2.736 billion bushels, while Sparks 
Co. put it at 2.789 billion bushels. Allendale Inc. of McHenry, 
Ill., forecast it only slightly higher -- 2.816 billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices had risen 5 percent in electronic trading overnight, and  
the trend continued into the regular trading day. But enthusiasm 
was dimmed somewhat by forecasts for rain in the Midwest that could 
increase crop size. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for November delivery rose 2 3/4 cents to $4.98 1/4 a bushel,  
the highest closing price since March 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains also advanced slightly along with soybeans over similar  
crop uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some bullish forecasts out, but we're also getting  
closer and closer to harvest time,'' prompting caution, said Jack 
Scoville, vice president of the Price Futures Group in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	December wheat rose 2 3/4 cents to $2.89 a bushel; December corn  
rose 1/2 cent to $2.22 1/2 a bushel; December oats were unchanged at 
$1.16 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil prices leapt back up to the $22-a-barrel mark on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange, recovering from two days of losses, 
and natural gas followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said that with the U.S. hurricane season still not over,  
the market was wary about the possibility of a sudden storm that 
could cause damage in the Gulf of Mexico during the three-day Labor 
Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just didn't want to go home short over the long weekend  
in case something tropical came up,'' said Bill O'Grady, an energy 
analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also got support from a private survey of oil companies  
which found that OPEC countries are thought to be largely 
fulfilling their promise to stick to oil production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for October delivery rose 51 cents to $22 a barrel;  
October unleaded gasoline rose 1.25 cents to 64.76 cents a gallon; 
October heating oil rose 1 cent to 57.47 cents a gallon; October 
natural gas rose 9 cents to $2.561 for each million British thermal 
units. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude for October delivery rose  
23 cents to $21.03 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures plummeted for a second straight day on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange over concerns of an overabundance of product on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.8 percent fall meant the pork bellies market was just shy  
of recording the maximum 5 percent decline for the second day in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	February pork bellies fell 2.75 cents to 54.57 cents a pound;  
October lean hogs fell 1.20 cents to 45.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Homeless Samaritan Finds a Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman who gave a kidney to save a boy's  
life, then wound up in a homeless shelter, got a new place to live 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first key that I've had in years to my own  
house,'' Marian Neal said as she entered the Washington, D.C., 
townhouse with Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal will pay $56 per month in rent -- utilities included -- for a  
one-bedroom apartment in a complex built in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	The small brick rowhouse has bars on the ground floor windows  
and public housing police make routine patrols. But for Neal, it is 
a small slice of heaven. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to worry about someone saying, 'You can't be  
here, you can't stay,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Neal befriended a 7-year-old neighbor while living  
with a friend in a public housing complex in nearby Alexandria, Va. 
She began taking the boy to kidney dialysis treatments and 
eventually donated a kidney. A successful transplant was done in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	But earlier this week, housing officials said she was breaking  
the rules by living with her friend and ordered her to leave. Neal 
is unable to work because of a degenerative spinal condition and 
she was denied Social Security benefits, so she moved to an 
Alexandria homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Her plight was featured on radio and television stations,  
leading to more than $5,000 in cash donations and a used car from a 
local dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo said he told his staff on Thursday to find Neal a place to  
live and they did it in a day, using exemptions to federal housing 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who has been that good and that kind to the community  
deserves a place to live that they can call their own,'' he said, 
calling Neal ``a genuine American heroine.''

<HEADLINE> Inkster May Head for Hall of Fame  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- When Juli Inkster last appeared at the  
State Farm Rail Classic in 1983, she was a rookie starting what 
would become a remarkable career. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, she could leave the three-day tournament as a member  
of the LPGA Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	After being a dominant player on the tour in the latter half of  
the 1980s, Inkster had only four victories between 1991 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, however, the mother of two has rejuvenated her career  
by winning four tournaments -- two of them majors -- and is No. 2 on 
the tour money list behind Karrie Webb. Inkster has been in the top 
10 in 14 of 18 events this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Golfers need 27 points to get into the Hall of Fame under the  
LPGA's new point system. Inkster has 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Most tournament wins are worth a point, with majors worth two.  
</P>
<P>
	Inkster is among several big names competing in the tournament  
that begins Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Nancy Lopez also is seeking a milestone this  
weekend. Despite a sore knee -- she underwent surgery in June -- 
Lopez is looking for career win No. 50, her third in this 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Others entered are Dottie Pepper, winner of last week's  
Oldsmobile Classic, No. 4 money winner Lorie Kane, British Women's 
Open champion Sherri Steinhauer and defending champion Pearl Sinn. 
</P>
<P>
	The course is known for its low scores. In the past two years,  
it took a 3-under 141 to make the 36-hole cut -- an LPGA record. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to hit spectacular shots,'' Sinn said of the  
6,403-yard, par 72 course. ``Your whole work begins on the 
greens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn earned her first career victory last year by shooting a  
final round 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Other former Rail Classic champions in the field are Hollis  
Stacy (1977), Betsy King (1985, '86 and '88), Helen Dobson (1993), 
Barb Mucha (1994), Mary Beth Zimmerman (1995), Michelle McGann 
(1996) and Cindy Figg-Currier (1997).

<HEADLINE> Canada To Test-Burn U.S. Nuke Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers will use a shipment of reactor  
fuel from New Mexico's Los Alamos lab to test whether Canada's 
nuclear reactors are suitable to dispose of weapons-grade 
plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada has committed only to the tests, although the Canadian  
government has offered to burn as much as 100 tons of the plutonium 
fuel blend over a 25-year period. The test burns are expected to 
take several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The test is a step forward in getting rid of nuclear weapons,  
and the government of Canada is committed to decreasing the number 
of nuclear weapons in the world,'' said Canadian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Lloyd Axworthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department and Canadian officials announced an  
agreement Thursday on the shipment, which will be made later this 
year. The experiment at the CANDU reactor in Chalk River, Ontario, 
100 miles west of Ottawa also will involve a separate shipment of 
similar fuel from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel is a mixture of plutonium oxide and uranium oxide. The  
Energy Department previously announced that about 36 tons of 
plutonium from the U.S. weapons program will be burned as a 
mixed-oxide fuel at three U.S. civilian reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian experiments are designed to determine whether the  
Canadian reactors -- a different design than the U.S. light-water 
reactors -- also can use the mixed-oxide fuel as part of a plutonium 
disposal plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, nine mixed-oxide fuel rods containing 120  
grams of plutonium will be shipped sometime this fall by truck from 
the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to Sault St. 
Marie, Mich., where it will cross into Canada, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipments have caused concern in states along the routes,  
especially in Michigan. Antinuclear groups and some members of the 
Canadian Parliament also have voiced opposition to the program, 
fearing Canada will become a dumping ground for Cold War-era 
plutonium from both Russia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based  
nonproliferation advocacy groups, also has voiced concerns about 
using the CANDU reactors for plutonium disposal. Other countries, 
including South Korea, have the same design reactors and may pursue 
similar programs, said Steven Dolley, the institute's research 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Canadian and U.S. officials characterized the Canadian  
program as another step to ensure that the plutonium is disposed of 
safely and kept out of the hands of rogue states and terrorists 
seeking to use if in weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The disposal plan calls for pure plutonium from weapons pits, or  
triggers, to be converted into plutonium oxide and then mixed with 
uranium oxide to create the mixed-oxide, or MOX, fuel that can be 
burned in a civilian reactor much like the conventional uranium 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel rods at Los Alamos already have been processed into MOX  
fuel, officials said.

UNLV football streak. Now he wants to work on another. 
</P>
<P>
	``This football team is 1-0. It's a winning streak we're on  
now,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-longest losing streak in college football -- 16 games  
over two seasons -- came to an end Thursday night in Denton, Texas, 
where UNLV opened the Robinson era with a 26-3 win over North 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	It was cause for celebration not only for the new coach, but for  
the players who have endured tough times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did it, baby,'' fifth-year senior wide receiver Len Ware  
said. ``We finally did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did UNLV break its 16-game losing streak, it also broke  
a 26-game road losing streak that began in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because it came against a mistake-prone North Texas team  
that looks to be the easiest opponent on UNLV's schedule did not 
temper the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The streaks are dead,'' UNLV safety Randy Black screamed at  
his teammates as the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson gave UNLV president Carol Harter the game ball after  
the win, which was the first for the 64-year-old coach since he was 
fired at USC two seasons ago. Harter hired Robinson after last 
season's team went 0-11 under former coach Jeff Horton. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Robinson's recruits could easily have gotten the ball,  
though, after making solid debuts that give the team hope for the 
rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Jeremi Rudolph showed why he was considered the top  
running back prospect in Florida five years ago by carrying 20 
times for 97 yards and two touchdowns, while junior quarterback 
Jason Vaughan's first Division I start was efficient with 16 of 19 
passes completed for 127 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said before the game that regardless of what happened we  
were going to come home and start getting ready to be a better 
football team,'' Robinson said. ``and that's what we're going to 
do. There's not an unbelievable hue and cry in our locker room. We 
expected to win the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most impressive part of the win was UNLV's defense,  
which has been much maligned over recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	North Texas was limited to just four first downs in the second  
half, and the three points allowed were the fewest by a Rebels' 
defense since Sept. 3, 1994, when UNLV defeated Eastern Michigan 
17-3 in Horton's debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' defensive coordinator Jeff McInerney said when asked  
if he thought before the game his unit could hold North Texas to 
just a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	UNLV led only 6-3 going into the fourth quarter, then turned a  
crucial penalty on a field-goal attempt into a touchdown that 
sparked a 20-point fourth-quarter rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Things get tougher next week as the Rebels travel to Baylor  
before returning home to face Iowa State on Sept. 18 in the home 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our kids played like winners,'' Robinson said. ``How  
talented are we? Hell, I don't begin to know. But I felt like we 
did not look like a team that had lost 100 million in a row. I'm 
really proud of them for that. I think this is just one more step 
forward.''

<HEADLINE> 'Junior' Gotti Gets Nearly 6 1/2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- John A. ``Junior'' Gotti was sentenced  
to nearly 6 1/2 years in federal prison Friday for following his 
father into the family business, and he took it like a stand-up 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a man's man. I'm here to take my medicine,'' the  
35-year-old Gotti, dressed in dark suit and wearing glasses, told 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, who prosecutors say succeeded his imprisoned father as  
boss of the Gambino crime family, pleaded guilty in April to 
bribery, extortion and other charges, many of them stemming from a 
scheme to take control of a New York topless club. Thirty-nine 
other people have pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted at trial, Gotti could have faced up to 15 years and  
millions of dollars in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker handed down a six-year,  
five-month sentence and a $1 million fine, scolding Gotti for 
putting the crime family above his own. Gotti and his wife are 
expecting their fifth child. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he was baffled by the son's decision to repeat  
the mistakes of his father, ``Dapper Don'' John J. Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know the toll that kind of behavior took on the family and  
particularly children,'' Parker said. ``Yet the pattern, for 
reasons I'm unable to fathom, is duplicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker gave Gotti until Oct. 18 to surrender. Outside, Gotti and  
his lawyers pushed past reporters and walked to a pizzeria, where 
they ordered two large pies before ducking out a back door, leaving 
the pizzas untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti's lawyers had asked for leniency, portraying him as a  
devoted ``Mr. Mom'' known for coaching youth soccer, driving his 
kids to school and giving to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued for the maximum sentence of seven years,  
three months. They told the judge that surveillance photos and 
other evidence proved that Gotti took control of the once-mighty 
Gambino crime family after his father received a life sentence in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors gave Parker excerpts of comments made by the elder  
Gotti when he learned, in prison, of his son's indictment. 
Infuriated by the carelessness that allowed agents to find piles of 
cash and a roster of gangland members, Gotti said his son and 
co-defendants ``should never be sent to jail. They should all be 
sent to the insane asylum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Gotti was known as the Teflon Don for avoiding  
conviction in three trials as mob boss. By contrast, the younger 
Gotti earned a reputation as a mediocre mob leader -- one tabloid 
dubbed him ``Dumbfella.''

<HEADLINE> Another Umpire May Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Angry with baseball and many of his colleagues  
who didn't support the union leadership, National League umpire 
Steve Rippley said Friday he may retire next week and join the 22 
umps already out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just gets to the point where the whole thing gets to be  
mind-boggling,'' Rippley said. ``The money is not the issue here. 
It's what they've done and the principle, to see how they have been 
so ruthless, with how they treated the families, just for whatever 
reasons. It's not humane what they've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, a crew chief scheduled to work a weekend series in  
Chicago, called NL senior vice president Katy Feeney on Thursday 
and said he wanted to retire. She told the 16-year veteran to think 
it over, Rippley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Rippley spoke with Paul Runge, the league's  
executive director of umpires, who said he should take the weekend 
off, think about his decision and get back to him Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Triple-A umpire Dan Iassonga filled in for the games at Wrigley  
Field, joining a crew that included Wally Bell, Jerry Meals and 
Hunter Wendelstedt. Bell, who is in his seventh season, was one of 
three NL umpires who broke with the union leadership. Meals is in 
his third NL season and Wendelstedt is among the 25 newly hired 
umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Darling and Larry Poncino, who had been on Rippley's crew,  
were among the 22 umpires whose resignations were accepted. They 
worked their final games Wednesday and hope an arbitrator will 
order the NL to reinstate them after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My workload is going to go up, and they're not going to  
compensate me for it,'' said Rippley, scheduled to work in 
Milwaukee starting Tuesday. ``Some of these kids don't have a week 
in the big leagues. You don't have 25 qualified guys at Triple-A to 
be major league umpires. They are running the pennant races with 
unqualified umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep saying the minor-league system needs revamping. If  
the minor-league system is so bad, how can you pull 25 guys up? 
They're going around in circles. All they're doing is getting 
caught up in their own lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, a member of the union's board, said one reason to  
remain would be to provide a vote for union head Richie Phillips, 
who faces a battle from a dissident group that wants 
Baltimore-based agent Ron Shapiro to negotiate the umpires' next 
labor deal. 
</P>
<P>
	AL umpires Joe Brinkman, John Hirschbeck and Dave Phillips are  
organizing the dissidents, who are expected to try to form a new 
union by submitting a petition to the National Labor Relations 
Board. The dissidents, who caused the union's strategy of mass 
resignations to collapse in July, need at least 30 percent of 
umpires to call for an NLRB-supervised election, and they are 
convinced they have sufficient support. 
</P>
<P>
	If Rippley retires, he would receive his final paycheck in  
October and get about $310,000 in termination pay. The 45-year-old 
from Seminole, Fla., isn't sure what he would do next. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything arranged or set up,'' he said. ``I would  
think somebody would want me. Given how we travel, how we work 
under all that pressure, there's got to be a job out there where 
somebody would want me.''

<HEADLINE> Umpires Wear '22' As Tribute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Angry with baseball and many of his colleagues  
who didn't support the union leadership, National League umpire 
Steve Rippley said Friday he may retire next week and join the 22 
umps already out of work.

reasons. It's not humane what they've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the remaining umps, including Gerry Davis, Ed Rapuano  
and Rich Rieker, wore ``MLUA 22'' on their caps Friday night in 
tribute to the 22 members of the Major League Umpires Association 
who were let go Thursday as a result of the union's failed 
resignation strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that we will be looking at over the next couple  
of days,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of 
baseball operations in the commissioner's office. ``I would expect 
that at some time very shortly that practice will come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball has been lenient with respect to cap adornments that  
refer to injured or seriously ill teammates and that kind of 
thing,'' Alderson said. ``Political statements are not viewed the 
same way, and we will take appropriate steps through the leagues to 
make sure that practice stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Montague, a supporter of the union leadership, wore ``22'' on  
his cap Thursday and missed Friday's game between Milwaukee and St. 
Louis, saying he was dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the doctor prescribes Gatorade for a malady, you have to  
be skeptical,'' Alderson said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Sign Steve Duchesne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Free agent Steve Duchesne, a playmaking  
defenseman who finished last season with Philadelphia, signed a 
one-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve brings a great deal of NHL experience and depth to our  
blue line,'' Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said. ``He's a 
strong skater, moves the puck very well and will fit in nicely with 
our defensive group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duchesne, 34, is a three-time all star who was once part of the  
trade that sent Eric Lindros from Quebec to Philadelphia. He was 
fourth among NHL defensemen in scoring two seasons ago with St. 
Louis with 14 goals and 42 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was a disappointment last year for Los Angeles, which  
signed him as a free agent. He had just had just four goals and 19 
assists in 60 games before being traded to Philadelphia. He had two 
goals and five assists with the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Duchesne is not a physical player and is not known as a strong  
defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 14-year NHL career, Duchesne has played for  
Philadelphia, Los Angeles and St. Louis twice each and Quebec and 
Ottawa once. He has 208 goals and 460 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract terms were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia PM Skips Pacific Rim Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad  
will not attend next week's annual summit of Pacific Rim leaders in 
New Zealand, fueling speculation Friday about imminent general 
elections in Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Deputy Prime Minister  
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi would stand in for Mahathir at the Sept. 
12-13 summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should not be interpreted as a snub,'' Syed Hamid told  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, however, whipped up widespread speculation that  
Mahathir, Asia's longest-serving leader, is preparing to dissolve 
Parliament and call a quick poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's reaction is that it's election related,'' said Lim  
Kit Siang, the opposition leader of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	But Syed Hamid denied it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Mahathir has many things to attend to,'' he said, but  
refused to give a cause for the cancellation. ``It is nothing 
unusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Mahathir would travel to New York later this month  
to attend the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Elections are not due until June 2000, when Parliament expires.  
But observers widely expect Mahathir to hold them before the end of 
the year, as the ruling National Front coalition has been 
feverishly campaigning nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the 73-year-old leader may try to capitalize on the  
rebounding economy and lack of cohesion within the opposition, 
which holds only 25 of the 192 seats in Parliament and would need a 
two-thirds majority to unseat Mahathir. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahathir's absence from the APEC forum in Auckland will remove  
its loudest advocate of restrictions on global financial markets 
and one of the harshest critics of the 21-member body. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahathir boycotted APEC's inaugural 1993 summit, saying APEC was  
dominated by Western members. A year after APEC was launched, 
Mahathir proposed his own East Asian Economic Group, which would 
have excluded the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, when Malaysia hosted the APEC summit, Mahathir  
criticized the body for not doing enough to put an end to the Asian 
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Witness: Jim Brown Wasn't Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A psychiatrist testified Friday that Jim  
Brown's wife was molested as a child and has a ``borderline 
personality disorder'' that may have caused her to lie to police 
when she claimed her husband threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Helene McDonald said she interviewed Monique Brown for 12  
hours and learned of her lifelong problems with men, dating to 
abandonment by her father, conflicts with her stepfather and her 
molestation by a stranger when she was 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor suggested that Monique Brown called 911 on June 15  
after arguing with her husband because she wanted to elicit a 
reaction from him, and that she later claimed to police that he 
threatened her because she was afraid their marriage was ending. 
</P>
<P>
	She quoted Monique Brown as saying: ``If I'm going to get a  
divorce, I'd better look like the victim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who set NFL rushing and scoring records for the Cleveland  
Browns in the 1960s, faces misdemeanor charges of making a 
terrorist threat and vandalism for bashing his wife's car with a 
shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, the prosecution has portrayed Brown as an  
abuser and his wife as a classic battered woman who cried for help 
then rescinded all claims of abuse in order to keep her marriage 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown testified Wednesday that she had lied about her  
husband's behavior and saying, among other things, she had given 
him permission to smash the car. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald said Monique Brown told her she believed her husband  
was having an affair and was going to leave her and move to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt he was going to leave me, so I left him,'' Monique  
Brown told her, the psychiatrist said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Brown has a borderline personality disorder,'' and such  
personalities have ``a long history of instability, fear of being 
alone and fear of being abandoned,'' she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown tends to idealize men she is involved with, then  
fears they will reject her and so rejects them first. 
</P>
<P>
	She quoted Monique Brown as saying: ``I freaked out. I felt  
totally out of control. I felt I was being abandoned. ... I felt he 
was trying to break me like my step dad did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the doctor took the stand, the defense called Brown's  
personal consultant, Duane Moody, who related a long list of his 
felony arrests and convictions before he came under Brown's 
influence a year ago and reformed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody said he went to the police station with Monique Brown the  
night of June 15 and heard her trying to rescind her allegations 
against her husband, who was arrested that night. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald was still on the stand when the case recessed for the  
holiday weekend. Outside court, Brown told reporters that this was 
the first time he had heard a report of his wife's alleged mental 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my wife has been very brave and courageous to open  
herself up to a doctor,'' he said. ``I have so much respect for 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the widow of Brown's closest friend told  
jurors that the Hall of Famer was always nonviolent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen him angry at a human being,'' said Shirley  
Hughley, who sobbed through much of her testimony as she recalled 
the 40-year friendship between Brown and George Hughley, a law 
enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
	She acknowledged that Monique Brown once sought refuge at the  
Hughley home after an argument with Brown but she said it was 
merely a dispute over business and the fact that ``he wouldn't pay 
attention to her in their argument so she took action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Monique Brown spent the night at their home and the  
next day she drove her back to the Brown home. 
</P>
<P>
	After her husband died in February, Hughley said Brown retreated  
and she didn't see him for two or three months. But since then, 
they have spent a lot of time together, ``holding each other and 
talking about George and crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a break in the proceedings while the judge was conferring  
with lawyers, Brown sat at the counsel table with his hands over 
his face and shook with sobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughley was preceded to the witness stand by Brown's  
housekeeper, Magdalena Monteroso, who said she never saw any 
violence between the Browns, saw no signs of injury on Monique 
Brown and said, ``I see them always hugging and together and 
loving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, the housekeeper acknowledged she wasn't  
always with them and encountered them only occasionally during her 
chores. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Brown told reporters he has made his life's work  
to teach gang members not to show their anger and feels he is a 
model of peaceful behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the charge that he smashed the windows on a car, he said  
``I was frustrated and I broke the windows. ... It's a question of 
is it legal to break your own property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He denied that he ever threatened his wife and, as the trial  
neared its conclusion, he said, ``regardless of what happens, you 
will never see this black man on his knees. I'm not a slave. I am a 
free, strong black man and that may be an issue with a lot of 
people.''

	Romanowski's lawyers have denounced investigators for releasing  
information before any charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists disagree on whether the drug, used alone, could be  
abused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it has great abuse potential,'' said Jim Hill,  
obesity researcher at the University of Colorado Health Sciences 
Center in Denver. ``A lot of physicians are comfortable prescribing 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, president of the North American Association for the Study  
of Obesity, added, ``I can't believe it is being used to enhance 
performance. It's nothing like amphetamines, though it is a 
stimulant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It may not be as addictive as cocaine, but it has abuse  
potential,'' said Paul Wellman, head of the psychology department 
at Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	One study in Los Angeles found that many users of methadone, a  
drug used to treat heroin addiction, also took phentermine, Wellman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Brinton of Orem, Utah, who has prescribed phentermine  
hundreds of times, said it can make patients feel they have more 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you feel good,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brinton said he has taken it himself, at a maximum dose of 60  
milligrams a day, and doubts it affects performance, although ``it 
does raise the metabolism a little.'' He said he didn't know what 
the impact of taking a larger dose might be. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of phentermine with fenfluramine, in a combination  
called ``fen-phen,'' has been linked to potentially fatal heart 
valve damage. Wellman has testified for plaintiffs in lawsuits 
filed against the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski's lawyers, meanwhile, denied he did anything illegal.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Springer, one of Romanowski's lawyers, said at a news  
conference Thursday that authorities have been harassing his 
client. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is truly disappointing when a decent, good family man gives  
of himself to the community and charitable organizations and has 
his good name and character assassinated under the circumstances 
simply because he finds himself to be a Denver Bronco,'' Springer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegations are scandalous.''  
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski and his wife, Julie, attended the news conference,  
but declined to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Attila Denes, spokesman for the sheriff's department, said  
investigators have recommended felony criminal charges be filed 
against Romanowski, his wife, Dr. Randall Snook of Littleton and 
Loretta Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the four has been arrested.  
</P>
<P>
	Denes said Snook wrote eight prescriptions for phentermine for  
Mrs. Romanowski and Johnson between September 1998 and August. He 
alleged the drugs were obtained primarily for Romanowski. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer said the drug is legal and is not banned by the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
	``What Bill Romanowski did here was approved and encouraged by a  
doctor, and has been ratified by at least one other doctor,'' 
Springer said. ``In order to avoid publicity, the doctor wrote the 
prescription in the name of somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our opinion ... Bill has not violated any laws.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Capt. Bill Walker said his deputies and Drug  
Enforcement Administration agents took the case to prosecutors 
Thursday following a two-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether Romanowski will be charged probably won't  
be made until next week, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski could be charged with felony counts of fraud and  
deceit and conspiracy, and a misdemeanor charge of unlawful use of 
a controlled substance.

<HEADLINE> NatWest Seeks L&AMP;G Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- National Westminster Bank PLC, Britain's  
third-largest bank, is negotiating to buy life insurance and 
pension provider Legal &AMP; General Group PLC, the companies announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company provided any details, but The Financial Times  
reported Natwest would pay $17 billion in a deal that mixed cash 
and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement by the companies and the London Stock Exchange  
said the takeover talks ``may or may not lead to a recommended 
offer being made by Natwest for Legal &AMP; General.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The simple truth is that we are in discussions. There is no  
deal,'' Natwest spokesman Steve Coulton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Natwest dropped sharply on the news, trading at  
$18.52, a 4 percent decrease from Thursday's close. Shares in Legal 
&AMP; General -- which would become part of a powerful new force in 
British financial services -- rose 16 cents to $3.23, a 5 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The move marks a turnabout for Natwest, which in recent years  
has been retrenching. It sold most of its global equities business 
to Bankers Trust Corp. of New York and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell for 
$300 million in December 1997, saying it did a poor job running the 
equities business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times said a definitive statement was expected  
next week and that NatWest's offer will be worth $3.36 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal &AMP; General chief executive David Prosser would join the  
NatWest board to run the retail banking and life assurance 
businesses, and both the chairman and the chief executive of 
NatWest would retain their roles in the newly enlarged group, the 
newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Foundation Losses Feared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- To Robert and Linda Hunt, the Baptist Foundation  
of America seemed like the perfect way to ensure their teen-age son 
Brian would get a college education without going into debt or 
having to juggle a job and studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert's mother had left the family ``five figures'' in  
investments with the foundation when she died in 1996, and the 
Hunts promptly earmarked some of it for their son, now 19. 
</P>
<P>
	But now Brian's plans -- and those of 13,000 other investors --  
are in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the foundation froze all new and existing accounts,  
and state regulators ordered a halt in securities sales. State 
investigators say the foundation misrepresented the securities and 
their returns and doesn't have enough money to cover all the 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators estimate that investors had poured $483 million  
into the foundation by the end of 1998. When, or if, the Hunts and 
others will see their money is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Sendrow, director of the securities division at the Arizona  
Corporation Commission, said the investigation could take months. 
</P>
<P>
	For Brian Hunt, who is from Prescott, Ariz., the uncertainty  
means working full time while attending college. For others, it 
could mean the loss of life savings or scaling back retirement 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The First Southern Baptist Church of Glendale invested more than  
$1.5 million with the BFA and planned to use the money for a new 
church in suburban Phoenix, said its pastor, Mark Mucklow. Mucklow 
said while the church awaits results of the investigation, it is 
looking at other ways of financing the $3 million building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to find God's will,'' he said. ``We don't hold  
any animosity. We want to know what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BFA was created in 1948 by the Arizona Southern Baptist  
Convention and manages money for Southern Baptist charities. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors -- particularly church members -- were lured by high  
interest rates and assurances that the investment money would 
benefit churches and ministries, according to investigators. 
Literature from late 1997 promised returns ranging from 6 percent 
for a six-month note to 11 percent for a 15-year note. 
</P>
<P>
	Sendrow said it looks like the foundation ran into problems in  
the 1980s with the decline of the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than writing them down, they apparently engaged in a  
series of manipulative operations to hide their losses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	BFA officials say they are cooperating with the investigation  
and reviewing their assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Management changes have already taken place. On Aug. 26, the BFA  
board fired William Crotts, the foundation's president since 1982, 
its legal counsel and its controller. Still, 136 staff members 
remain on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Feigin, executive director of Washington-based North  
American Securities Administrators Association, which represents 
state securities regulators, said investors tend to trust 
investments with religious or other common bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust ``can be intoxicating,'' he said. ``Unfortunately with  
investing that always means a higher risk. You have to treat them 
like strangers or you face a greater risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the letter dated Aug. 7 telling investors that their  
accounts had been frozen used religion: ``God has not promised that 
every day would be easy. And God has promised that he would be with 
us every step of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hunt said of the whole affair, ``I'm not willing to give it  
our soul. She and her family, unlike her late mother-in-law, are 
not Southern Baptist. But her family is Christian, she said, and 
will not ``write off an entire denomination or entire agency of a 
denomination.''

<HEADLINE> More FBI-Waco Evidence Is Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Roundly criticized for not disclosing evidence  
related to its 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian cult, the FBI 
released a videotape on which an FBI commander is heard authorizing 
the use of incendiary tear gas hours before a deadly fire ended the 
Davidians' 51-day standoff with federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI made the tape public Thursday as Attorney General Janet  
Reno asked an outsider to head an independent inquiry into the 
FBI's long-denied use of flammable weapons during the April 19, 
1993, assault near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin confirmed Reno's  
decision to seek someone outside the FBI and the Justice Department 
to head the inquiry, but declined to identify the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those said to be on the informal candidate list were two  
former Republican senators, John Danforth of Missouri and Warren 
Rudman of New Hampshire, as well as former Iran-Contra prosecutor 
Dan Webb. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, FBI Director Louis Freeh and congressional  
Democrats and Republicans alike have suggested that Reno sidestep 
her department and the FBI's investigative resources in favor of an 
independent review. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton ``is deeply concerned that the attorney  
general appears to have been misled and may have been lied to'' 
about what went on at Waco, White House spokesman Jake Siewert said 
Thursday as the president vacationed in upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's admission last week that combustible tear gas was  
used, recanting six years of claims to the contrary, provoked a 
furor on and off Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Reno-ordered probe, congressional hearings  
will be convened this fall and House Judiciary Committee Chairman 
Henry Hyde, R-Ill, is pushing for a congressional commission that 
he believes could conduct a review free from the bitter 
partisanship exhibited during earlier Waco hearings on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The infrared videotape made public Thursday, recorded from an  
FBI plane, runs from just before 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. on the final 
morning of the 51-day siege -- covering the period during which the 
FBI assault began. 
</P>
<P>
	That footage, which FBI officials said was recently discovered  
at the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's offices in Quantico, Va., was 
taken into custody Wednesday by federal marshals at Justice's 
instruction. The Hostage Rescue Team was in charge of operations 
during the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	A second videotape, which runs from 8 a.m. to 10:42 a.m.,  
surfaced Thursday; and FBI officials were taking steps to release 
it publicly as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau officials had previously insisted in sworn affidavits  
that they didn't have any infrared video footage before 10:42 a.m. 
-- hours after the tear-gas assault began at 5:55 a.m. FBI spokesman 
Tron Brekke said the apparent discrepancy is ``a legitimate point 
for inquiry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early morning tape captured a radio transmission in which an  
FBI field commander granted permission for an agent to lob military 
incendiary tear-gas rounds at a concrete bunker 40 yards from the 
Davidians' compound. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can try it?'' asked the rescue team's supervisory special  
agent, Stephen P. McGavin, after saying that an agent could ``with 
relative safety'' use a vehicle as cover and fire military tear gas 
canisters into the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, that's affirmative,'' answered Richard M. Rogers, the  
rescue team's assistant special agent in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Brekke said bureau officials decided to release the video and a  
transcript because the action ``clearly demonstrates that we are 
interested in the facts concerning Waco to come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in our interest,'' he added. ``Our credibility's been  
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said the conversation took place at 7:49 a.m. -- nearly  
two hours after the tear-gas assault began but hours before flames 
began racing through the Davidians' wooden home at 12:07 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and Reno, who have been harshly criticized over the Waco  
assault and its deadly ending, have said there was no evidence to 
suggest the blaze was set by the pyrotechnic devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Cult leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during the  
inferno, some from gunshot wounds, others from the fire.

<HEADLINE>  Israel Says Peace Deal Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Momentum built today in the quest for a new  
Israel-Palestinian land-for-security deal, with Israeli Foreign 
Minister David Levy saying the two sides were near an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli officials speaking on condition of anonymity said  
negotiators had resolved a dispute over the release of Palestinian 
prisoners that had delayed the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement by Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said ``there  
is a possibility'' the agreement would be signed Saturday. The 
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh has been proposed has a 
venue. 
</P>
<P>
	However, speaking to reporters in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian  
leader Yasser Arafat said there were still difficulties. Asked what 
were the main obstacles blocking an agreement, Arafat pointed to an 
``attempt to escape from the obligations which had been signed and 
agreed upon.'' He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a joint news conference after meeting with U.S.  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Levy expressed optimism a 
deal would be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very close to reaching a final agreement between the  
two sides for the betterment of the peace process,'' Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright played down her involvement. ``I was there basically in  
the role of facilitator. Perhaps I shouldn't introduce a new term 
into all of this, but maybe I was just the handmaiden,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had excellent meetings here ... with the prime  
minister and his team,'' she said. ``We are hopeful that this 
agreement will be concluded and we will be able to move forward in 
the comprehensive peace process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Israeli official said the dispute over the prisoners had  
been resolved after the Palestinians accepted an Israeli offer to 
release 350 Palestinians held for anti-Israeli activities. The 
Palestinians initially had insisted on the release of 400 
prisoners. Earlier reports said the Israeli offer stood at 356 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the agreement on prisoner releases, the Israeli  
officials said there was still disagreement one a clause barring 
both sides from taking unilateral actions in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over the prisoners had drawn Albright into a shuttle  
diplomacy she never sought. She held talks Thursday in Alexandria, 
Egypt, with Arafat, and in Jerusalem early today with Barak to try 
to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak had issued a veiled ultimatum after his meeting with  
Albright, saying the Palestinians had until today to come up with a 
satisfactory answer. If such a response was not received, Israel 
would implement the original Wye River land-for-security agreement 
of last October to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Palestinians had initially sought exactly that, it  
appears that both sides would benefit from carrying out the revised 
agreement instead. The Palestinians would get more West Bank land 
sooner and win the release of more prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israelis would gain because the projected new agreement  
carries a tentative target date -- September 2000 -- for a permanent 
agreement and would thus defuse the threat of a unilateral 
Palestinian declaration of statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to justify their brinksmanship, both sides have said the  
release of prisoners was a fundamental and emotional issue. Israel 
has said that as a matter of principle, it cannot release 
Palestinians who killed Israelis in terror attacks. The 
Palestinians have said that as part of peacemaking, the bloody 
slate of the past has to be wiped clean and that former guerrillas 
must win their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The last-minute deadlock had changed Albright's role from  
honored guest to mediator. Until now, she had held back, operating 
on the assumption the most successful agreements are the product of 
direct negotiations between the parties with minimal outside 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	But as prospects waned for a signing ceremony Thursday in  
Alexandria, a resigned Albright stepped in. ``It is natural that 
while I am here I try to be of assistance,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other thorny issues have been settled in recent days. The  
parties settled on a five-month timetable for a withdrawal from 
part of the West Bank -- starting at the beginning of this month and 
ending Jan. 20. They have also agreed that talks on a permanent 
peace agreement should begin immediately after the first pullback, 
and that the negotiations should be concluded within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft of the new accord also contains a clause saying both  
sides should refrain from unilateral actions. For the Palestinians, 
this would mean that Israel will not massively expand or build new 
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or change the 
status quo of Jerusalem. For Israel, this would be an assurance 
that the Palestinians will not declare statehood before a peace 
accord is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli officials said there were last-minute disagreements  
over this clause.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says IMF May Delay Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund's next loan  
installment to Russia may be delayed, the country's finance 
minister said Friday as he insisted that no previous IMF money was 
misspent. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said the IMF board in  
Washington, which had planned to meet later this month, may not 
convene until October to discuss releasing the second installment 
of a $4.5 billion loan to help Russia pay its debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have said that a visiting IMF delegation was  
satisfied with the government's adherence to loan conditions. The 
IMF team flew out on Friday, but did not comment on its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF loan is being used to pay back existing Russian debts to  
the fund. The amount of the next installment has been set at $640 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's efforts to obtain the next installment have been  
complicated by U.S. newspaper reports questioning whether the 
Russian government may have diverted IMF money. The IMF says it has 
no evidence of any wrongdoing by Russian authorities, but is taking 
the allegations seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no basis for anyone to say that there are problems  
with the use of funds from international sources,'' Kasyanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance minister also said that increased government  
controls were helping control capital flight from Russia, a major 
problem that is estimated to drain $1 billion out of the country 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
	In other economic developments Friday, Russia's exports have  
fallen 5 percent and imports have crashed 45 percent in the first 
eight months of this year compared to last year, Kasyanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Russia consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in August, down  
from 2.8 percent a month earlier, the Russian Statistics Agency 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation was 29.5 percent for the first eight months of the  
year, the government statistics agency said. However, the monthly 
inflation rate has been coming down since a financial crisis a year 
ago sent prices surging. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation for all of 1998 was 84 percent.

<HEADLINE> Former Pastor Gets Va. Prison Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- Former pastor James Ogle was sentenced  
Friday to eight years in prison for asking a parishioner to join 
him in a plot to kill each other's wives. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rambling, tearful statement, Ogle apologized to his wife,  
children, friends and the congregation of the Bull Run Bible 
Fellowship in Manassas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was never my intention to put my wife's life in danger,''  
Ogle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogle, 46, was convicted in June of attempted murder and  
solicitation of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogle, who blamed his wife for his career failures and had had an  
affair with a parishioner, had suggested to Scott Jinks that they 
swap murders, police testified. Ogle was counseling Jinks and his 
wife about their marriage at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I take care of your wife, will you take care of mine?''  
Ogle asked Jinks, according to police. Jinks went to police and 
taped several conversations.

into all of this, but maybe I was just the handmaiden,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had excellent meetings here ... with the prime  
minister and his team,'' she said. ``We are hopeful that this 
agreement will be concluded and we will be able to move forward in 
the comprehensive peace process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Israeli official said the dispute over the prisoners had  
been resolved after the Palestinians accepted an Israeli offer to 
release 350 Palestinians held for anti-Israeli activities. The 
Palestinians initially had insisted on the release of 400 
prisoners. Earlier reports said the Israeli offer stood at 356 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the agreement on prisoner releases, the Israeli  
officials said there was still disagreement one a clause barring 
both sides from taking unilateral actions in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over the prisoners had drawn Albright into a shuttle  
diplomacy she never sought. She held talks Thursday in Alexandria, 
Egypt, with Arafat, and in Jerusalem early today with Barak to try 
to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak had issued a veiled ultimatum after his meeting with  
Albright, saying the Palestinians had until today to come up with a 
satisfactory answer. If such a response was not received, Israel 
would implement the original Wye River land-for-security agreement 
of last October to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Palestinians had initially sought exactly that, it  
appears that both sides would benefit from carrying out the revised 
agreement instead. The Palestinians would get more West Bank land 
sooner and win the release of more prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israelis would gain because the projected new agreement  
carries a tentative target date -- September 2000 -- for a permanent 
agreement and would thus defuse the threat of a unilateral 
Palestinian declaration of statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to justify their brinksmanship, both sides have said the  
release of prisoners was a fundamental and emotional issue. Israel 
has said that as a matter of principle, it cannot release 
Palestinians who killed Israelis in terror attacks. The 
Palestinians have said that as part of peacemaking, the bloody 
slate of the past has to be wiped clean and that former guerrillas 
must win their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The last-minute deadlock had changed Albright's role from  
honored guest to mediator. Until now, she had held back, operating 
on the assumption the most successful agreements are the product of 
direct negotiations between the parties with minimal outside 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	But as prospects waned for a signing ceremony Thursday in  
Alexandria, a resigned Albright stepped in. ``It is natural that 
while I am here I try to be of assistance,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other thorny issues have been settled in recent days. The  
parties settled on a five-month timetable for a withdrawal from 
part of the West Bank -- starting at the beginning of this month and 
ending Jan. 20. They have also agreed that talks on a permanent 
peace agreement should begin immediately after the first pullback, 
and that the negotiations should be concluded within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft of the new accord also contains a clause saying both  
sides should refrain from unilateral actions. For the Palestinians, 
this would mean that Israel will not massively expand or build new 
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or change the 
status quo of Jerusalem. For Israel, this would be an assurance 
that the Palestinians will not declare statehood before a peace 
accord is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli officials said there were last-minute disagreements  
over this clause.

	U.S.-China Trade Talks Planned  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and China have scheduled  
their first trade talks in four months, signaling a thaw in the 
countries' recent chilly relations. The technical-level discussions 
will be held next week, probably in Beijing, in advance of a 
meeting between President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
in New Zealand. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher 
said yesterday the technical-level meeting will be a 
``stock-taking'' of where the two countries stand on negotiations 
to bring China into the World Trade Organization.

	BOSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore cruised Boston Harbor and  
then went ashore to announce new federal initiatives aimed at 
protecting America's coastlines and ocean waters. ``They're not 
just part of the environment, but they're an engine of our 
economy,'' Gore said of oceans in a speech at the New England 
Aquarium. ``We need to take bold steps to protect the oceans.'' 
Gore announced that President Clinton had signed a proclamation 
yesterday giving U.S. authorities the right to enforce 
environmental, customs and immigration laws at sea within 24 
nautical miles from shore, up from 12 miles.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Drawn into a shuttle diplomacy she never

Palestinians to resolve their disagreement over the release of a 
few dozen prisoners and sign an agreement. Officials in Egypt -- 
another broker in last-minute efforts to revive the Wye memorandum 
-- indicated that a signing ceremony is set for today at Sharm 
el-Sheik, an isolated Red Sea resort. The Information Ministry even 
chartered a plane for journalists. The Egyptians had hoped to host 
the signing ceremony in Alexandria -- Albright's first stop -- 
yesterday, but the disagreement over 44 Palestinian prisoners 
stymied an otherwise completed agreement.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Roundly criticized for not disclosing evidence  
related to its 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian cult, the FBI 
released a videotape on which an FBI commander is heard authorizing 
the use of incendiary tear gas hours before a deadly fire ended the 
Davidians' 51-day standoff with federal agents. The FBI made the 
tape public yesterday as Attorney General Janet Reno asked an 
outsider to head an independent inquiry into the FBI's long-denied

	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters battled back flames  
from huge wildfires that roared around mountain resort towns 
yesterday as hotel owners and shopkeepers feared the pall of smoke 
would kill their usually prosperous Labor Day business. Closed 
campgrounds and a canceled carnival had merchants worrying about 
the impact on tourism on the last holiday weekend of summer. ``It 
will affect business big time,'' said Barb Aker, owner of Gold Pan 
Dining. ``It's very, very slow. There's no traffic at all. Normally

	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis hung off North  
Carolina's Outer Banks for a third day yesterday and kept pounding 
away at the coast with 14-foot waves and 45 mph gusts, doing more 
damage to the beach than a single blow from a big hurricane. ``It 
is immensely worse as far as damage to the shoreline and beachfront 
retreat,'' said Orrin Pilkey, a Duke University coastal geologist. 
Although a hurricane can be deadly because it can blow down 
buildings, it typically ``goes across the islands very quickly.'' 
The assault on the North Carolina coast has been going on since 
early Monday.

Cuba's own urine tests and other evidence proves that the two 
weightlifters stripped of gold medals for drug use during the Pan 
American Games were actually drug free. ``It was all a colossal 
lie, an infamous and shameful lie, a criminal plundering of merits 
won through denial, tenacity, consecration and sacrifice,'' the 
Cuban leader said on national television. Castro called for the 
unusual television program, which included 14 foreign journalists 
and five Cuban journalists. No questions were allowed until the 
completion of the second half of the program, scheduled to resume 
at 8:30 p.m. today.

<HEADLINE> Rep: Let Feds Watch Amusement Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a spate of fatal roller coaster  
accidents, a member of Congress wants to restore the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission's oversight of amusement park rides. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said Friday he will introduce  
legislation giving the commission power to set standards for rides, 
perform inspections and investigations, recall unsafe equipment and 
impose civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``As these rides get higher, faster and more technologically  
sophisticated, the potential for unforeseen catastrophe rises as 
well,'' said Markey, the top Democrat on the House Commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission regulated rides at amusement parks and temporary  
sites, such as carnivals and fairs, prior to 1981. That year, after 
court challenges, Congress exempted rides at permanent sites from 
the commission's oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	``That left nobody watching the store,'' said Ann Brown, the  
CPSC chairwoman. ``If Congress were to vote to return safety 
authority to the CPSC, we would certainly welcome it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission still regulates rides at carnivals and fairs. It  
collects death and injury data from all rides. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 38 states regulate amusement park rides, the rules vary  
widely. Florida, for example, has exemptions for parks with over 
1,000 employees, said Russ Rader, the commission's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve states and the District of Columbia do not regulate  
rides: Alabama, Arizona, California, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Montana, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah and 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Four deaths last month called the safety of rides into question.  
</P>
<P>
	In Ocean City, N.J., a mother and daughter died when they were  
ejected from a roller-coaster car at Gillian's Wonderland Pier 
after it suddenly slid backward from a 30-foot ascent and crashed 
into another car. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Great America park in Santa Clara, Calif., a disabled  
12-year-old boy died on the Drop Zone ride when he slipped out of a 
harness. At Paramount's Kings Dominion in Doswell, Va., a man who 
had partially wiggled out of a shoulder harness died when he fell 
from the Shockwave, a stand-up roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unusual events of the past couple of weeks have us all a  
bit mystified,'' said John Graff, president of the International 
Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. ``But we are 
absolutely certain it's not because of any change in the safety 
practices of the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graff said the industry still has an extraordinary safety  
record, with serious injuries occurring in one out of every 25 
million rides. At least 95 percent of parks fall under some sort of 
state or local regulation, and more than half the states without 
regulations have no or very few parks, he said. Additional federal 
oversight ``would be unwise,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays' Boggs Out With Hurt Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs, the newest member of the  
3,000-hit club, will miss the remainder of the season after an MRI 
on Friday revealed torn cartilage in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the news I was hoping for, but at least we found out  
what the problem was. Now we just have to get it fixed,'' said the 
41-year-old third baseman, scheduled for surgery next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time AL batting champion was injured Aug. 2 sliding  
into a base at Seattle. Five days later, he became the first player 
to homer for his 3,000th career hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The discomfort in the knee, however, got progressively worse  
over the next month and Boggs had started just five of 19 games 
before deciding to have an MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery will be performed by Dr. Koco Eaton, and the expected  
recovery time is 4-to-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The procedure is so simple. You zip in, they change the oil  
and you zip out,'' Boggs said, adding that he expects to play again 
next season. ``The rehab is doing stuff I normally do during the 
course of the offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs finished the year with 3,010 hits, 20th on the career  
list. He batted .301, the 15th season he's hit at least .300, and 
had two homers and 29 RBIs in 90 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays hold an option on his contract for next season,  
and Boggs said he didn't see any reason why his injury would affect 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I proved I could still play at 41. That's all an  
athlete can ask for,'' Boggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to my dad. I got the same line I get all the time:  
`Son, things happen for a reason.' He said don't worry about it, so 
I'm not.''

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Hinder Tourism in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- Spirits lifted today as only a thin  
stain of brown smoke marred a blue sky over San Bernardino 
Mountains resorts a few miles from a huge fire that jeopardized 
vital Labor Day weekend tourist business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turning the corner,'' declared the headline of the fire  
command's daily situation report for the West's biggest wildfire, a 
61,770-acre blaze that was 50 percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the progress would embolden tourists to head to the  
popular region east of Los Angeles was uncertain, however. 
Merchants have already seen profits blow away with the towering 
billows of smoke that poured off the range most of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacancy signs eagerly blinked along the road circling the lake  
6,750 feet high in the mountains, while business owners Thursday 
fielded hundreds of phone calls from tourists worried about reports 
of the big wildfire just six miles to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our last hurrah of the season and bad press could ruin  
the tourism industry up here,'' said Barb Aker, co-owner of Gold 
Pan Dining and Nugget Room Cocktails in Fawnskin, a tiny hamlet on 
the north side of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabins at Big Bear Lodge are normally packed at this time, said  
manager Chuck Smith. But they were only at 50 percent occupancy 
Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no smoke or soot reached the resorts that line the  
lake, the drone of a steady stream of helicopters could be heard as 
they dipped buckets into the water and hustled back to the fire's 
hottest spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Roads, by contrast, were quiet.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to make for a very slow weekend,'' said Damon  
Dennis, manager of Alpine Sports Center, which sells camping 
supplies. ``Usually we're very busy by now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Willow fire closed 13 campgrounds and halted all  
travel on San Bernardino National Forest land north of the lake. By 
today, the cost of fighting the blaze reached $6.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze was blamed on an illegal campfire but now classified  
as ``under investigation,'' meaning the cause is unclear. It is one 
of seven large California fires that have burned about 125,000 
acres of forest and desert land. Elsewhere across the West, 
firefighters made progress against six other significant wildfires 
in Montana, Utah and Idaho, where a 35,118-acre grass blaze near 
the Snake River community of Glenns Ferry was contained Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The worries of Big Bear-area merchants were mirrored in  
communities near other California fires. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,300-acre Mixing fire in Riverside County was fully  
contained, but it still put a dent in business at nearby Idyllwild. 
Gary Busher said his family's Oak Crest Lodge had only one of five 
rooms booked, and just for tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we have nothing else for the weekend,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles County, some campgrounds in Angeles National  
Forest were closed because of a 7,100-acre blaze north of Azusa. It 
was 68 percent contained today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, firefighters struggled with clusters of  
wildfires started by lightning storms on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27,100-acre High Complex fire in the Shasta-Trinity area --  
actually 19 lightning-ignited blazes burning in a cluster 22 miles 
north of Redding -- was 87 percent surrounded. Containment was 
expected Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Study: Mom's Blues Can Hinder Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children do worse on developmental tests if  
their mothers are depressed, but a mother's depression does less 
damage if the family is well off financially, says a study released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers studied 1,200 families to see if mother's depression  
hindered her children's learning ability in the crucial first three 
years of life. 
</P>
<P>
	They questioned mothers beginning at their children's births and  
visited their homes to watch mother-child interaction. When the 
children were 3, their school readiness -- things such as counting 
and knowing colors and shapes -- was tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Mothers who were chronically depressed were more likely to have  
children who scored lower on the tests, concluded the eight-year 
study financed by the National Institutes of Health. The study will 
appear in the September issue of the journal Developmental 
Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
	But depressed women who had higher incomes, and other advantages  
such as higher education, were more sensitive to their children's 
needs, and their depression had lesser effect on their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money seems to be a key issue,'' said one of the researchers,  
University of North Carolina child development specialist Martha 
Cox. ``It could be a case of women in positions of seeking better 
outside child care, or giving themselves more breaks, or buying 
more services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These women have more options or more things to turn to, to  
keep their depression from affecting their relationship with the 
child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reseachers recruited families from Arkansas, California, Kansas,  
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Washington 
and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	A mother's depression is problematical because of the theory  
that depressed moms wouldn't interact with their children. And 
researchers said maternal blues may have the worst affect on the 
youngest babies, who depend more on their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showed that if mothers were particularly sensitive to  
their babies, regardless of depression, the children developed 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exploration and play are such an important way that children  
learn in the early years,'' Cox explained. ``Having a mother that 
can facilitate that exploration and play is important to the 
children's development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, if a mother and child were playing with a book or  
puzzle, the sensitive mother would pay attention to what the child 
was trying to do, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study children are now in third grade and will be followed  
at least through sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen percent of the families were headed by single mothers,  
but interactions with fathers and other adults were not measured. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the study may have underestimated depression's impact  
because teen mothers, disabled children or substance abusers also 
were not studied. The poorest families wound up dropping out of the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	School readiness has long worried educators, given that poor and  
other disadvantaged children often get to kindergarten without 
skills necessary for school success. 
</P>
<P>
	The research shows families in which the mother suffers  
depression need to seek help, said Sarah Friedman, who coordinated 
the study for the NIH's National Institute for Child Health and 
Human Development. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women need to know if they feel depressed, it's not only about  
them,'' she said. ``It's also going to affect their children.''

<HEADLINE> Park Ride Inspections Bill Advances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A bill requiring annual inspections of  
amusement park rides moved one step closer to law with final 
approval Friday from the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was introduced after an accident in December on a  
sailing ship ride at Disneyland killed one man and injured his wife 
and a park worker. It gained renewed attention last month after 
accidents at two Northern California amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-year-old disabled boy was killed Aug. 22 after falling out  
of the Drop Zone Stunt Tower at Paramount's Great America in Santa 
Clara. Three days later, 28 passengers were trapped for nearly four 
hours on a roller coaster at Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed the bill 30-6. The measure faces a final vote  
next week in the Assembly, which approved an earlier draft by a 
60-15 margin, before going to Gov. Gray Davis. Davis had not yet 
taken a position on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	California requires inspections of rides at traveling carnivals,  
but not at the state's 72 permanent amusement parks. There have 
been 16 fatal accidents in the past 28 years on amusement rides in 
California, including 12 at permanent amusement parks.

<HEADLINE> First Day of New Umps Goes Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball games went on, even without the 22  
umpires who lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours after the departures of the veterans became official  
at 6 a.m. Thursday, an opponent of the union leadership said the 
other umps might be locked out until next summer unless Richie 
Phillips is toppled. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a chance one more umpire would join the 22. NL  
umpire Steve Rippley called the league office and said he was 
thinking of resigning, according to several management officials 
who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year veteran didn't quit Thursday, NL senior vice  
president Katy Feeney said, but it was unclear if he had made any 
final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no problems involving the 25 new umpires during  
Thursday's eight games, and none of the veteran umps who kept their 
jobs walked out in sympathy with the terminated 22, whose best 
chance to get back on the field is winning in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Foster, who became a permanent AL ump earlier in the day,  
ejected Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild during an argument in 
the sixth inning of Thursday night's game at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was fine,'' Rothschild said. ``He gave me a chance to walk  
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Cuzzi, one of 13 new NL umps, was among three newcomers in  
his four-man crew for the Phillies-Giants game in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult,'' he said. ``I have the plate today. I'm going  
out to work the best that I can. I don't know what to expect from 
the other guys. We have a young guy coming up from Triple-A. He's 
never worked a game in the big leagues before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That umpire, Jim Wolf, was called up from the minors as a  
fill-in for union president Jerry Crawford, who was with Phillips 
on Tuesday and Wednesday at federal court in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The first game for Wolf, who isn't among the 25 permanent new  
umps, involved the Phillies, for whom his brother, Randy, pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have butterflies big-time,'' Jim Wolf said. ``I've got a  
swarm in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal agreed to Wednesday night in Philadelphia,  
the 22 stopped work, but will be paid for the rest of the year. 
Whether they resigned, as owners say, or were fired, as the union 
says, will be decided by an arbitrator at a date not yet 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia branch of the American Arbitration Association  
gave each side a list of 15 arbitrators Thursday. If umpires and 
owners can't agree on one, they will take turns crossing out names 
until only one remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's lawyers are expected to try to convince the  
arbitrator not to decide the case, arguing that even if umps were 
terminated, their labor contract leaves those decisions up to 
league presidents, with no appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the 22 umps, managers weren't sure what to expect in the  
season's remaining 4 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality may not be what we're used to,'' New York Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said. ``Ideally, you would like to understand 
what the young umpires are going through. But if something happens 
in the eighth inning of a close game, you throw that all out the 
window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL ump Joe Brinkman, a leader of the group trying to replace  
Phillips, predicted owners would lock out umpires on Jan. 1, just 
as they did in 1995 when the previous labor deal expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``If nothing changes, I don't see us going back to work next  
season until June or July,'' Brinkman said. ``If Richie is gone, 
then that will change considerably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It appears opponents will attempt to petition the National Labor  
Relations Board to form a new union, according to several baseball 
lawyers who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty percent or more of eligible union members are needed to  
petition the NLRB to conduct an organization election. Depending on 
whether the 22 count, there are either 71 or 93 umpires, meaning 22 
or 28 umpires are needed on a petition. Ultimately, the NLRB 
determines who is eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``My negotiator is still Richie Phillips and will be Richie  
Phillips, and it won't change,'' said Ed Montague, an NL ump who 
kept his job. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires' departures resulted from the union's failed  
strategy of mass resignations, designed to force an early start to 
negotiations for a contract to replace the labor deal that expires 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of negotiating, baseball accepted the 22 resignations  
and hired 25 replacements from the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a brand-new crew put together, and the first time we've  
worked together as a crew,'' AL ump Dan Morrison said after his 
game in Baltimore on Thursday night. ``It's like starting all 
over.''

</P>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- Almeric L.  
Christian, the first native of the U.S. Virgin Islands to be named 
a judge in the territory's District Court, died Wednesday at age 79 
of an undisclosed illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian was appointed by President Nixon in 1969 and retired  
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's most controversial decisions were in two 1970s cases  
in which he ruled that immigrants' children had a right to public 
education.

</P>
<P>
	PRAIRIE VILLAGE, Kan. (AP) -- Mary Hudson, a self-made  
businesswoman who built an oil empire worth $325 million that 
landed her as one of the few women on the Forbes 400 list, died 
Thursday of cancer. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in 1933, when her husband was killed in a truck  
accident, Ms. Hudson borrowed $200 from her father to open her 
first Hudson Oil Co. station in Kansas City. It was the first of 
more than 300 gas stations and convenience stores that would make 
her one of America's richest entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hudson said that when Forbes listed her on its list of 400  
richest Americans, in the mid-1970s, she was worth about $325 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	She would also live to see much of her business fall apart in  
the 1980s following a string of court judgments for overcharging 
customers at the pumps and for underpaying some employees. She 
pleaded no contest to conspiracy and was ordered to perform 200 
hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hudson rebounded in the final years of her career to oversee  
a smaller, rejuvenated operation.

<P>
	DREXEL HILL, Pa. (AP) -- Milton Jack Mirman, an authority on U.S.  
stamps and a major stamp dealer for years, died Aug. 27 of cancer. 
He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirman started attending stamp auctions as an amateur dealer  
when he was 14. In 1950, he decided to make his hobby his business 
and bought the dealership Stanley Gibbons Inc., one of the leading 
traders for stamp collectors in the U.S. For years, the Gibbons 
catalogue served as a pricing guide for American stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirman headed the company until he sold it to the  
Intergovernmental Philatelic Corp. in 1979. He stayed in its 
management until he retired in 1997.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Auxiliary Bishop P. Francis Murphy, who worked  
for social justice and better interfaith relations during his over 
40 years with the Catholic Church, died Thursday of cancer. He was 
66. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy was named auxiliary bishop by Pope Paul VI and appointed  
vicar general and western vicar in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy co-chaired the program committee for the 9th  
Jewish/Christian Workshop in 1986, which led to many initiatives, 
including the Baltimore Institute for Christian/Jewish Studies. He 
also was a board member of The Interfaith Alliance, an organization 
of Christian and Jewish leaders from across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Murphy co-founded Interfaith Housing of Wester,  
Maryland, Inc., an organization dedicated to developing safe and 
adequate housing for the poor.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eugene Ostroff, longtime curator of  
photography at the National Museum of American History, died last 
month of cancer. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Ostroff retired in 1994 after 34 years with the Smithsonian  
Institution. He was credited with opening the museum's Hall of 
Photography in 1972 and organizing a number of special exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	After joining the Smithsonian in 1960, he pursued research into  
the history of photography and published his findings, mostly in 
technical and scientific periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
	He later consulted with museums around the world on standards  
for storing and displaying old photographs.

                          *Stanley Weigel    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Retired U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel,  
a gruff liberal who defended professors in loyalty oath cases, died 
Wednesday at age 93. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge since 1962, Weigel took semi-retired senior status in  
1982 but continued handling cases until he stepped down about two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	His most prominent case started in the early 1970s, when inmates  
of Northern California prisons challenged their conditions of 
confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, Weigel ordered improvements in conditions for 2,500  
inmates of the maximum-security lockup units at century-old San 
Quentin and Folsom prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	As a lawyer, starting in 1928, he specialized in antitrust  
cases, but he took on a civil liberties case in 1949 that other 
local lawyers shunned: the defense of 39 University of California 
professors who refused to take loyalty oaths. He won their 
reinstatement with back pay. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican, Weigel was appointed to the bench by Democratic  
President Kennedy.

                         *Henry R. Singleton    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Henry E. Singleton, an innovative engineer  
and co-founder of Teledyne Inc. who designed an aircraft guidance 
system used worldwide, has died. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Tuesday of brain cancer at his home.  
</P>
<P>
	Singleton led one of the nation's largest conglomerates for  
three decades. He was known for his prowess on Wall Street and was 
a merger guru from the 1960s to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He launched Teledyne in 1960 as a semiconductor maker with his  
partner George Kozmetsky. Their first venture was building digital 
computers for aircraft and space exploration projects. Singleton 
developed the inertial guidance system now used in commercial and 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	By the mid-1980s, conglomerates were not in favor with Wall  
Street and Teledyne began divesting itself. It also became involved 
in military procurement scandals and paid more than $100 million in 
fines to settle claims that it inflated bills to the Pentagon and 
falsified tests on electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes magazine listed Singleton as one of the nation's 400  
richest people last year with an estimated fortune of $750 million. 
Singleton retired as Teledyne's chief executive officer in 1986, 
but remained as chairman until 1991.

<HEADLINE> Kipketer, Szabo Near $1M Jackpot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- World champions Wilson Kipketer and  
Gabriela Szabo maintained their perfect records in the Golden 
League competition at the Van Damme meet Friday, putting them only 
one victory away from sharing the $1 million jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, of Denmark, ran the season's best time in the 800  
meters, clocking 1 minute, 42.27 seconds, beating Hezekiel Sepeng 
by five meters. Kipketer was within world record pace after 400 
meters, but had too much to do on his own from then on and fell 
1.16 seconds short. Sepeng set a South African record of 1:42.69. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jackpot is out there,'' Kipketer said. ``It is like a  
lottery. I just have to run fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo did just that to maintain her chance.  
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Zahra Ouaziz tried to shake off Szabo for much of the  
women's 3,000-meter race, but the Romanian just bided her time and 
waited to outkick her. The result was similar to the World 
Championships at Seville last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo finished in 8:25.82, her second-fastest time this year.  
</P>
<P>
	The two champions have won all six Golden League meets, and if  
they continue their streak through Tuesday's ISTAF Berlin meet, 
they will end up with $500,000 each as the overall jackpot would be 
sliced in half. 
</P>
<P>
	In a great performance which had no impact on the Golden League,  
Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj ran the second-fastest men's 3,000 in 
history, 7:23.09, only 2.42 seconds off Kenyan Daniel Komen's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Steeplechase world record-holder Bernard Barmasai also won his  
sixth race out of six Friday, but the IAAF has eliminated him from 
the jackpot competition. If he wins the last of the seven races and 
is denied the Golden League purse, he said he might sue the IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot be employed somewhere and get no salary,'' he said.  
``I want to run good in Berlin and then afterwards do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF punished Barmasai for saying he colluded with Kenyan  
teammate Christopher Koskei to determine the outcome of the Golden 
League race at Zurich. Barmasai denied he tried to fix the race. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Van Damme, he proved he was the best in his discipline,  
taking the lead at the halfway stage and building a 40-meter lead 
before finishing in 8:03.08, the second-best time of the season. 
Koskei, the world champion, finished four seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmasai finished fifth at the World Championships, but said the  
Zurich scandal had cost him too much sleep and concentration. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones, the women's 100-meter world champion, was the only  
other athlete with a 5-for-5 record, but she has not recovered from 
the back injury sustained during the semifinals of the 200 at 
Seville and was a no-show here. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet had 53 medalists from the World Championships,  
including 18 world champions. The main absentee was triple gold 
medalist Maurice Greene, who is running in Britain over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Bruny Surin, the silver medalist at Seville, won the  
100 in 10.04, edging Jon Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
	Surin could not make it a 100-200 double though. Michael  
Johnson, the 400 world champion and 200 and 400 record-holder, won 
the 200 at 19.93, .09 seconds off the season's best of Nigerian 
Francis Obikwelu. 
</P>
<P>
	Inger Miller continued to dominate the 200 in the absence of  
Jones, beating Beverly McDonald of Jamaica, matching their 1-2 
finish at Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium's Mohammed Mourhit set a European record for 10,000  
meters, breaking the mark of Portugal's Antonio Pinto by more than 
20 seconds in finishing second to Charles Kamathi of Kenya. Kamathi 
ran the year's fastest time, 26:51.49. The Moroccan-born Mourhit, 
now competing for Belgium, was timed at 26:52.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinto had set the previous mark of 27:12.47 at Oslo in July.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Hartwig, the American record-holder in the pole vault, made  
up for a disappointing showing at Seville, beating world champion 
Maksim Tarasov of Russia with a leap of 19 feet, 6 1/4 inches.

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttles Virtually Grounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA has practically grounded its  
space shuttle fleet because inspections have uncovered a startling 
number of damaged wires that could endanger a mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Technicians discovered that an exposed wire caused a short  
circuit that knocked out two engine computers during the most 
recent shuttle launch, that of Columbia in July. Similar flaws 
later were found elsewhere on Columbia and in the wiring on 
Endeavour and Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Now all flights are off until at least mid-October.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is a serious situation,'' shuttle program manager Ron  
Dittemore said Thursday. ``We are not going to fly again until we 
understand what we have and get it fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Endeavour and Discovery have dozens of wires that must be  
repaired or reinforced. Endeavour should have gone up in 
mid-September with radar equipment to map Earth's surface, 
Discovery in mid-October with crucial replacement parts for the 
Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began July 23, when a short circuit five seconds  
into Columbia's launch knocked out computers for two of the 
shuttle's three main engines. Because each engine has two computers 
and only one is needed, Columbia made it to orbit with five 
astronauts and the powerful Chandra X-ray Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	It was believed to be the first time in 95 shuttle missions that  
a short circuit occurred during liftoff, by far the most dangerous 
part of the flight. If an engine had shut down, the shuttle would 
have had to attempt an unprecedented emergency landing in Florida 
or in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Columbia was still in the atmosphere -- and not in the  
vacuum of space -- when the short happened in the cargo bay, sparks 
could have ignited. 
</P>
<P>
	But shuttle circuit breakers are much more sensitive than those  
in a home or even on a plane; they immediately pop when a short 
occurs, halting the flow of electricity. That's what happened 
aboard Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-second short was caused by an exposed wire that had  
lost its insulation in one spot, allowing the wire to come in 
contact with a rough screw. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers evidently had stepped on the wire or brushed a tool or  
work platform against it. The damage was done at least four years 
ago, the last time Columbia underwent an extensive overhaul. It's 
possible the damage was there since Columbia's first flight in 
1981; the wiring is original. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, NASA thought the exposed wire in its oldest shuttle  
was unique and perhaps the result of age. But technicians found 
another flawed wire on the opposite side of the cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
	As a precaution, NASA ordered inspections of the wiring in its  
three other shuttles. 
</P>
<P>
	As of late this week, technicians had discovered 38 spots with  
exposed wiring in Endeavour and 26 in Discovery, and even more 
places where the wires need to be reinforced with tubes and Teflon 
wrapping ``to bulletproof it the best we can,'' Dittemore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantis has yet to be inspected thoroughly, but a quick check  
turned up one suspect wire. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspections will take at least another few weeks. Each  
shuttle has 200 miles of wiring; half of it is being checked, the 
half where workers are most likely to have damaged it. 
</P>
<P>
	The delays are making this the leanest year for shuttle launches  
since 1988, when flights resumed following the Challenger disaster. 
With only two more launches scheduled by year's end, there could be 
just four in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has yet to decide which mission will go first once flights  
resume. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've told the folks that I don't want you worrying about  
launch dates,'' Dittemore said. ``I want your heads down in the 
foxhole fixing these wires.''

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Wins Control of Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux won bankruptcy court approval  
today to take control of the Pittsburgh Penguins, making him the 
first retired player to become the owner of a major sports team for 
which he played. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz approved the deal within  
minutes of Lemieux's 9 a.m. court appearance, ending a 10-month 
odyssey of bankruptcy for the club Lemieux led to two Stanley Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like we've done something and succeeded. Now the  
puck's on Mr. Lemieux's stick and we've all seen what he's been 
able to do with that,'' Markovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge sealed the deal by approving an agreement between  
Lemieux's ownership group and SMG, the Philadelphia-based company 
that leases the Civic Arena and rents the space to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to bring the team out of bankruptcy. We have to  
make it viable now. Hopefully, we can make this a great success 
story,'' Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delays in finalizing the agreement, in which SMG agreed to  
invest $5 million in the team, postponed Lemieux's closing on the 
team several times over the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully the Penguins will thrive and survive in  
Pittsburgh,'' SMG attorney Daniel Shapira said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the NHL's board of governors approved Lemieux's  
takeover of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Lemieux came into the picture, there was still some doubt  
whether the Penguins would remain in Pittsburgh, or even in the 
NHL. The team went into bankruptcy last season and was only able to 
meet its payroll with the help of a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
	With approval of Lemieux's takeover, the Penguins made it just  
under the wire. They are scheduled to open training camp Saturday 
and will play their first exhibition game Sept. 11 against the New 
York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he and his group of investors, numbering more than  
a dozen, have put together $52 million so far and hope to raise 
more money. He said the market value of the Penguins is currently 
$85 million, or the price of an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has the largest stake in the team, most of it coming  
from the $25 million in deferred salary the Penguins owed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux will keep the hockey operation in the hands of general  
manager Craig Patrick while he concentrates on the business side 
with the help of others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a team effort, just like it was in the 90s  
when we were winning Cups,'' Lemieux said. The Lemieux-led Penguins 
won championships in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has said he will cut ticket prices immediately upon  
assuming control of the team, but he did not detail how he would do 
that. He said the prices should allow a family to attend a game 
without paying $200 or $300. Any reduction should help the team 
meet its goal of selling 12,000 season tickets for the 1999-2000 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,000 season tickets have been sold so far, even with the  
team's future uncertain for much of the summer. Last year, the team 
sold only 8,300 season tickets.

<HEADLINE> Top Marlins Pick Beckett Visits Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins first-round draft choice Josh  
Beckett got a good look Friday at Pro Player Stadium and wondered 
whether he'll ever pitch there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aren't y'all going to have a new stadium?'' Beckett asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Team owner John Henry applauded that remark at a news conference  
introducing the 19-year-old Beckett to South Florida. Henry is 
leading the push for a new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how that campaign comes out, the brash Beckett expects  
to join the Marlins rotation soon. But after talking with general 
manager Dave Dombrowski, Beckett backed off an earlier prediction 
that he'll pitch in the 2001 All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Dombrowski doesn't want me to rush,'' said Beckett, just  
out of high school. ``It's going to be wherever the development 
takes me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Marlins need pitching, and Beckett was encouraged to see  
22-year-old rookie A.J. Burnett starting Friday night against San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me happy that they're giving a young pitcher a  
chance,'' Beckett said. ``It brings a smile to your face thinking 
you can be a starting pitcher in the major leagues at his age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett, the second overall selection in June's amateur draft,  
signed a $7 million big league contract that includes a $3.625 
million signing bonus, the second-highest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	What does a teen-ager do with so much money? The right-hander  
from Spring, Texas, said he just bought the ``Urban Cowboy'' CD, 
and he's shopping for a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett played little baseball this summer. He'll pitch in the  
Fall Instructional League beginning Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty excited,'' he said. ``I'm still a fan right now.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor Disciplined for Lack of Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A doctor accused of undertreating the pain  
of six of his patients has been disciplined by the Oregon medical 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	The discipline taken against Dr. Mark Bilder marks the first  
time a state board in the United States has taken action for giving 
too little -- rather than too much -- medication, according to the 
Federation of State Medical Boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Bilder, of Roseburg, was accused of using Tylenol to treat an  
elderly man who was in pain from terminal cancer, refusing morphine 
for an 82-year-old with congestive heart failure and declining to 
resume pain medication for a woman on a mechanical ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents also indicate the doctor has had communication lapses  
with patients and families, and an apparent lack of up-to-date 
knowledge about proper pain treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bilder, who declined comment, signed a statement Wednesday  
acknowledging that his treatment showed unprofessional or 
dishonorable conduct and negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	He must undergo a one-year program in which another doctor works  
with him to assess his practice, and he must complete a course on 
doctor-patient communication. 
</P>
<P>
	A few state medical boards have investigated complaints of  
doctors undertreating pain, but Oregon is the first to take action, 
the federation said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case reflects a national shift in policy regarding pain.  
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who were once concerned about turning their patients  
into addicts are now heeding studies showing that most pain 
patients don't become addicted and many, particular those in their 
final years, are suffering too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still getting surveys that tell us that patients during  
their dying period are suffering undue pain. We want that to go to 
zero,'' said Dr. George Porter, chairman of the Oregon Board of 
Medical Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter acknowledged that 20 years ago, when Bilder was starting  
as a pulmonary disease specialist, he would not have been brought 
before the board. 
</P>
<P>
	But Porter described a new climate of compassion toward pain,  
particularly in Oregon, where voters twice approved the nation's 
only assisted suicide law and where a 1995 law shields doctors from 
discipline if they administer drugs to treat patients with 
intractable pain. 
</P>
<P>
	A study published last year in the Journal of the American  
Medical Association found that one in four elderly cancer patients 
in nursing homes received nothing for their daily pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Susan Tolle, director of the ethics center at Oregon Health  
Sciences University, praised the board for not throwing the book at 
Bilder and instead creating a plan for him to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things we aren't taught in medical school,''  
she said. ``Medicine keeps changing.''

<HEADLINE> Jesuits Focus of Harassment Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- All John Bollard wanted to do was live his  
life by the laws of the Jesuits -- poverty, obedience and chastity. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he wants the Jesuits to live by the laws that apply to  
everyone else -- particularly the law that makes employers 
responsible when supervisors sexually harass employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Bollard is suing the California Province of the Jesuits for  
sexual harassment, claiming he was sent pornographic cards, invited 
to cruise gay bars, and subjected to unwanted advances by a dozen 
priests at a Jesuit seminary in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	His suit brings the workings of a religious organization under  
the scrutiny of the courts -- a responsibility that federal courts 
have been unwilling to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we lose this lawsuit, it means that the church can hide  
behind its history and its Roman collar and its pulpit and not have 
to face issues that every corporation and every other employer in 
this country has to face,'' Bollard said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal courts, in a long series of rulings, have refused to  
allow clergy to sue churches for discrimination, saying judicial 
interference in religious decisions was either unauthorized by 
Congress or forbidden by the First Amendment's guarantee of 
religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Bollard's lawsuit was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge  
Susan Illston. The application of civil rights laws would amount to 
an ``interference of federal government in church autonomy,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals must decide whether  
Bollard can sue at all. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time an ex-seminarian has sued the Jesuits for  
sexual harassment. It is also the first time a federal appeals 
court has been asked to decide if a religious organization is 
covered by the same sexual harassment laws that govern employers 
and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's response may determine whether numerous churches are  
legally vulnerable in a time of increasing complaints of sexual 
misconduct by clergy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bollard's lawyers argue that a harassment case involves a  
secular question -- whether sexually offensive conduct occurred and 
was permitted -- that does not require delving into religious 
doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
	The question before the court, which heard arguments in June, is  
not whether Bollard was harassed but whether the government has any 
power to regulate a religious organization's treatment of its 
clergy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bollard, who left the Jesuits after eight years in 1996 and now  
teaches at a college in Southern California, is seeking an apology 
and $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't put in jeopardy the separation of church and  
state,'' he said of the suit. ``It calls them to an honesty and 
integrity that everybody is being called to in this day and age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jesuits have not addressed his factual claims in their court  
papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bollard's lawyer, James Wagstaffe, argued in court papers that  
the Jesuits ``cannot be allowed to use the First Amendment as a 
shield for illegal activities that have nothing to do with 
religious beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Jesuits and their supporters say that if Bollard can sue  
them over their response to his alleged harassment -- failing to 
fire or discipline the priests or otherwise protect him -- nothing 
is sacred. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, if allowed to proceed, would interfere with ``the core  
religious act -- the selection, assessment, retention and discipline 
of those who are designated to engage in a religion's mission,'' 
Paul Gaspari, lawyer for the Jesuit organizations in California and 
Oregon, said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Discrimination suits against religious organizations that have  
been dismissed by the courts include a female Buddhist minister 
whose funding was cut off, a female Salvation Army minister who was 
fired, a female chaplain dismissed by a Presbyterian hospital and a 
nun denied tenure by the Catholic University of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Bollard, who entered the seminary in 1988, said the harassment  
started a few years later with a birthday card with a picture of a 
naked man and suggestive language. A pornographic card from his 
supervisor read, ``Thought this might inspire some theological 
thoughts,'' the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	He brought his complaints to his supervisors, and eventually to  
Father John Privett, the Provincial or head of the West Coast 
Jesuits, who he said advised him to avoid lawyers and asked him to 
release the Jesuits from liability. 
</P>
<P>
	Privett also gave him a gift, Bollard said: a coffee cup  
inscribed ``No Whining.''

<HEADLINE> Funeral Held for Fritz Shurmur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Scott Shurmur said his father could never  
resist a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Family and friends gathered on a summery Friday morning at St.  
Francis Xavier Cathedral for the funeral for Fritz Shurmur, the 
Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator whose peripatetic coaching 
career was capped with a Super Bowl title during his memorable 
years with the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	In delivering his father's eulogy, Scott Shurmur said that when  
Mike Holmgren offered Fritz Shurmur a new challenge last winter, he 
accepted it, even though it meant leaving Green Bay, the city he 
had come to call home and where he planned to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was to be a year or two of challenge, followed by a  
lifetime of fishing,'' Scott Shurmur said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first weeks in Seattle, family members sensed a  
particular homesickness in the 67-year-old defensive coordinator's 
voice. The Seahawks embraced the teachings of their new coach 
during spring minicamps, but during a routine checkup in May, 
doctors discovered the cancer that eventually killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur died Monday at his home in nearby Suamico. Shurmur and  
his wife, Peggy Jane, are members of St. Benedict Catholic Church 
in Suamico, but the funeral Mass was scheduled for the cathedral 
because of the large crowd of mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 90-minute funeral Mass, the Rev. Gary Dantinne called  
Shurmur ``a person of faith. ... Maybe he's formulating God's new 
defense against evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren cried during the service, which was attended by several  
Seahawks assistants as well as current Green Bay coaches Ray 
Rhodes, Sherman Lewis and Emmitt Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 25 current and former players attended the funeral.  
LeRoy Butler, Santana Dotson, Gilbert Brown and Bernardo Harris, 
all Packers defensive players under Shurmur, were pallbearers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to lose a friend, because Fritz was a friend to all  
of us,'' said former Packers defensive end Reggie White, who 
attended with his wife, Sarah. ``It gets me inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur's career began at Albion College, his alma mater in  
Michigan. He was the coach at Wyoming and an assistant in the NFL 
for Detroit, New England, the Los Angeles Rams and Arizona 
Cardinals before coming to Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Shurmur said his father took particular joy in working in  
a small city like Green Bay, where ``he could be ice fishing 10 
minutes after practice.'' The Shurmurs built their retirement home 
next to a lake in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	As Shurmur's condition deteriorated during the summer, his  
favorite activity was watching exhibition games on television. 
Scott Shurmur said his father took pleasure in the Seahawks' 
defensive performance in an exhibition against San Francisco three 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the type of guy that really cared about his players,''  
White said. ``He had an intensity, and he really cared about the 
team. That's what made him the great coach he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers observed a moment of silence for Shurmur before  
their 25-17 exhibition victory over Miami on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before building the defenses that helped carry the Packers to  
consecutive Super Bowl victories, Shurmur was known for his 
unorthodox defensive schemes with the Rams that helped an otherwise 
undermanned team compete with the 49ers and the other powers of the 
1980s. He authored four books and an instructional video on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Lining the walls of the funeral home during the visitation  
period earlier this week were more than three dozen flower 
arrangements, from private well-wishers as well as such former foes 
as the San Francisco 49ers, Indianapolis Colts, Chicago Bears, 
Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints.

<HEADLINE> Volleyball Barred From Alero Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- American beach volleyball players just can't  
avoid controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, they sparred with international officials over  
qualifying for the inaugural Olympic beach tournament at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Karch Kiraly, the sport's biggest name, and three other top  
American players have been told by Association of Volleyball 
Professionals officials that they can't play in next weekend's 
Oldsmobile Alero Series, which is part of the inaugural U.S. 
Olympic Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	AVP officials, coming off last year's bankruptcy, feel the Alero  
Series is a competing tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Cup is a five-sport international competition  
scheduled next Thursday through Sunday in San Diego. Of the five 
sports, only beach volleyball has any qualification ramifications 
for the Olympics, and even that is up for debate between the AVP 
and the national governing body, USA Volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Volleyball set a Friday deadline for Kiraly and his partner,  
Adam Johnson, and the team of Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana, to 
accept invitations to the Alero Series. The AVP refused to let them 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a great event and we're sorry they can't  
be here to help grow the sport,'' USA Volleyball official John 
Kessel said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Volleyball says the Alero Series is not a tour, but rather,  
a set of nine tournaments this year and next designed to help get 
U.S. teams into the international tournaments that are part of the 
Olympic qualification process. And the purses are big enough that 
younger teams can afford to compete abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiraly is the only volleyball player to win three Olympic gold  
medals, including the '96 beach title with Kent Steffes. His 
longtime rival, Sinjin Smith, will compete here. Earlier this 
summer Kiraly broke Smith's longstanding record of 139 career beach 
victories. Kiraly has 141 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	The top four U.S. pro players aren't the only ones skipping the  
Alero Series. There was room in the eight-team men's field for one 
of three Brazilian teams -- which are ranked 1-2-3 in the world -- 
but their federation said no men's team would come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they felt it would be a good tactical move not to play  
on our soil,'' Kessel said. Brazil is sending the top-ranked 
women's team of Adriana Behar-Shelda Bede. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Cup also will include women's basketball and  
softball, men's and women's swimming, and boxing. The women's 
Olympic softball team will be announced Monday, and the women's 
hoops team will include several WNBA stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, politics and dueling sponsors are in the  
middle of the volleyball dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the AVP is back on its feet after going through  
bankruptcy, it wants to protect its sponsors and other business 
interests. AVP players competed in the first Alero Series 
tournament in May, with Kiraly and Johnson winning it, but AVP head 
Bill Berger said Alero organizers haven't lived up to certain 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that we don't want to play, but the group that  
produces the event, despite the stars and stripes backdrop, is 
running a for-profit venture,'' Berger said. ``At the end of the 
day, it's a professional beach volleyball endeavor. It's not like 
it's a philanthropic event with Hillary Clinton at the finish 
line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kessel said athletes need to play in a minimum number of Alero  
tournaments as part of the Olympic qualification process. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson said he and other AVP members discussed that with  
international officials, ``and they kind of laughed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When push comes to shove, I don't know what will happen,''  
said Johnson, who added that he'll remain loyal to the AVP even if 
it means missing a shot at going to the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The AVP is where most of us have made a great living for many  
years, and we feel we need to stick behind it to make it strong for 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kiraly wasn't available for comment Friday.

<HEADLINE> Measles May Be Wiped Out in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In the 1950s, almost every American child was  
guaranteed to get the measles. Now there is practically no measles 
left to catch. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease that's as contagious as chickenpox, but deadlier,  
appears to have been all but wiped out in the United States, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 100 cases of the measles, a record low, were recorded last  
year. And all but 29 were linked to infections that were brought 
into the country from abroad, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a vaccine became available in 1963, measles was a rite of  
passage among American children. A red rash would spread over their 
bodies. They would develop a high fever. Severe cases could cause 
blindness or brain damage, or even death. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in 1941, measles infected 894,134 Americans and  
killed 2,279, according to the Public Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically everybody had the measles before the vaccine was  
licensed,'' said Dr. Mark Papania, the CDC's acting chief of 
measles elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC says its latest data suggest measles is no longer  
indigenous to the United States, meaning it appears there are no 
more strains of the virus continually circulating in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's true, Americans would no longer get measles if  
infected people didn't bring it with them from foreign countries, 
Papania said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of saying it cautiously,'' he said. ``We're not  
quite making a declaration. But the best information we now have is 
saying measles is no longer indigenous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Measles still kills roughly 1 million people worldwide each  
year. About half of those deaths occur in central Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	All U.S. states require children to be immunized before they  
enter school. Officials estimate that 90 percent of children are 
immunized by age 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the United States, the disease surged between 1989 and  
1991, infecting 55,000 Americans and killing 120. Researchers said 
the outbreak was fueled by foreign carriers infecting preschool-age 
children who had not been immunized and youngsters who did not 
develop immunity from a single dose of the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states now require that children be immunized with two  
doses of vaccine.

	Clinton Hails Mideast Peace Deal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that lasting  
peace in the Middle East ``is now a step closer'' after the 
conclusion of an Israeli-Palestinian deal for a further Israeli 
pullback from the West Bank. ``This is truly a new beginning,'' the 
president said in a written statement. His remarks came as 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright helped orchestrate the 
long-sought accord between Israel and the Palestinians. The 
agreement will be signed tomorrow. Clinton congratulated Israeli 
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
``for their vision in seizing this opportunity.''

	Federal Judge Demands Waco Evidence

	WACO, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge ordered the Justice  
Department to turn over all evidence from the FBI raid on the 
Branch Davidian compound at Waco, saying it is needed in a wrongful 
death suit filed here. Judge Walter Smith threatened to cite the 
Justice Department with contempt if it does not comply with his 
order of yesterday, which comes after a belated FBI admission that 
incendiary tear gas canisters were used in the waning hours of the 
Texas siege. Smith rebuffed the Justice Department's complaint that 
gathering, copying and transferring the evidence would be ``an 
unwarranted and substantial burden.''

by planes, helicopters and bulldozers were battling the 61,770-acre 
Willow fire in the San Bernardino Mountains today. The blaze, which 
started Aug. 28, was one of seven large fires in California. Most 
other fires in the West were contained. Big Bear Lake and the other 
popular resorts 90 miles east of Los Angeles were depending on the 
firefighters to keep flames away through the lucrative Labor Day 
Weekend.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department admitted to serious  
problems today in a program to build the world's largest laser, 
including mismanagement that will add hundreds of millions of 
dollars to its original $1.2 billion price tag. Energy Secretary 
Bill Richardson, who said he was assured the project was on target 
as recently as June, ordered an overhaul of the program at the 
Lawrence Livermore weapons laboratory and an investigation into why 
the cost overruns were not revealed earlier. The massive laser, 
which was supposed to have been completed by 2003, is being built 
at the California research lab in a project to monitor and maintain 
America's nuclear warheads without testing nuclear bombs.

	PARIS (AP) -- A French judge today closed the painful two-year  
inquiry into the car crash that killed Princess Diana, dismissing 
all charges against nine photographers and a press motorcyclist 
implicated in the accident. The judge's terse conclusion came in a 
one-page statement: Alcohol, drugs and excessive speed caused the 
crash that ended the life of the ``people's princess.'' Diana, her 
boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, died in the Aug. 
31, 1997, crash in a Paris traffic tunnel.

<HEADLINE> Castro Puts Pan Am Games on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro put the honor of the Pan  
American Games on trial Friday with hearings aimed at showing that 
Cuban athletes were framed for drug use and unjustly forced to give 
back their gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all a colossal lie, an infamous and shameful lie, a  
criminal plundering of merits won through denial, tenacity, 
consecration and sacrifice,'' the Cuban leader said during the 
first hearing, a three-hour appearance on live television Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro called for the unusual program, which included the  
presence of 14 foreign journalists and five Cuban journalists. No 
questions were allowed until the completion of the second half of 
the program Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than a hearing, it will be a trial,'' Castro said earlier  
in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from Pan Am officials or from  
the laboratory in Montreal, which conducted the urine tests that 
Castro claimed were doctored to falsely show that Cuban athletes 
were using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, Castro, along with a leading sports official  
and a top sports doctor, said that multiple urine tests of two 
Cuban weightlifters conducted by Cuba and sent to three different 
laboratories in Europe all tested negative for the anabolic steroid 
Nandrolone. The tests were conducted four to five days after the 
athletes returned to Cuba from the Pan Am Games, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steroids are injected into the body to increase strength and  
bulk and can remain in a person's system for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Urine tests analyzed by a Canadian lab during the Pan Am Games  
at Winnipeg last month showed William Vargas, winner of the 
136-pound class, and Rolando Delgado, the 152-pound gold medalist, 
tested positive for the drug. Both weightlifters were stripped of 
their gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 20 samples analyzed by three laboratories, there was  
not a single reported presence of Nandrolone or its traces, not a 
single athlete in our weightlifting team was using drugs,'' Castro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro also defended high jump world record-holder Javier  
Sotomayor, saying that his being stripped of the gold at the Pan Am 
Games after testing positive for cocaine use was the result of a 
``dirty political war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He raised doubts about the way the urine tests for Sotomayor and  
other Cubans were conducted at the Games. The Cubans were required 
to drink water or other ``refreshing drinks'' before their tests 
and were given their tests in a room apart from athletes from other 
countries, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials have suggested that someone slipped the cocaine  
into Sotomayor's food or drink before the test, which was given 
shortly after he won his fourth straight Pan Am gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be ``absurd'' to believe that Sotomayor consumed  
cocaine before that feat, because the large quantity found in his 
system would surely have impeded his performance, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials have become increasingly frustrated by what they  
believe is an orchestrated campaign by their enemies to discredit 
the communist country and its long respected sports program. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Pan Am Games, they complained about Canadian news  
media, saying they joked about and encouraged Cuban athletes to 
defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week in Houston, Cuban athletes and sports officials walked  
out on the International Amateur Boxing Association Championships 
following a disputed bout that initially gave a Russian fighter a 
victory over a Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the five judges who worked the disputed match were  
suspended Aug. 27 by the executive committee of the AIBA.

<HEADLINE> Canucks Re-Sign Todd Bertuzzi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks  
re-signed veteran left-winger Todd Bertuzzi to a contract said to 
be for two years for slightly more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A restricted free agent, Bertuzzi is coming off an  
injury-plagued year in which he missed 31 games with a fractured 
tibia and another 19 when he suffered a season-ending torn ACL in 
his left knee on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year NHL veteran managed just eight goals and 16 points  
in 32 games last year. Drafted 23rd overall by the New York 
Islanders in 1993, he was acquired by the Canucks in a Feb. 1988 
deal that sent Trevor Linden to Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Bertuzzi's new contract were not released, but The  
Vancouver Sun reported Friday that he was to be paid a little over 
$1 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bertuzzi signed, the Canucks go into training camp this  
weekend with four remaining restricted free agents yet to sign -- 
defensemen Ed Jovanovski and Adrian Aucoin and forwards Dave 
Scatchard and Peter Schaefer.

<HEADLINE> Co-Founder of Teledyne Dies at 82 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Henry E. Singleton, co-founder of Teledyne  
Inc. and an innovative engineer who designed an aircraft guidance 
system used worldwide, has died. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Tuesday of brain cancer at his home.  
</P>
<P>
	Singleton led one of the nation's largest conglomerates for  
three decades. He was known for his prowess on Wall Street and was 
a merger guru from the 1960s to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He launched Teledyne in 1960 as a semiconductor maker with his  
partner George Kozmetsky. Their first venture was building digital 
computers for aircraft and space exploration projects. Singleton 
developed the inertial guidance system now used in commercial and 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft-spoken Singleton helped turn the company into a  
business empire. The company's annual revenues peaked at nearly $5 
billion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the mid-1980s, conglomerates were not in favor with Wall  
Street. Teledyne began divesting itself. It also became involved in 
military procurement scandals in the '80s and early '90s, paying 
more than $100 million in fines to settle claims that it inflated 
bills to the Pentagon and falsified tests on electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
	Singleton himself was not charged with anything, but some  
analysts said at the time that the legal troubles of Teledyne 
subsidiaries were a sign that its central management wasn't keeping 
tight enough control. 
</P>
<P>
	He had retired as Teledyne's chief executive officer in 1986,  
but remained as chairman until 1991. He was director of Teledyne 
until it combined forces with Allegheny Ludlum Corp. in 1996. 
Singleton then became a director for the new company, Allegheny 
Teledyne, until his retirement from the board in May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes magazine listed Singleton as one of the nation's 400  
richest people last year with an estimated fortune of $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Henry was truly a business icon,'' said Richard Simmons,  
Allegheny Teledyne Inc.'s chairman. ``His accomplishments are 
legendary, including to his commitment to creating shareholder 
value. More importantly, he was a man of integrity and fairness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singleton was born in Texas on a ranch. He attended the Naval  
Academy in Annapolis, Md. but transferred to the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology where he earned his bachelor's, master's 
and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	After his retirement, Singleton returned to his roots, raising  
cattle and enjoying some of his passions, including chess, poetry 
and studying Western folklore. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Caroline, five children and four  
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Catholic Bishop To Ordain His Twin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERVILLE, Maine (AP) -- While growing up poor in a  
single-parent household in this Maine mill town, Donald and Dana 
Pelotte teamed up as altar boys on the day they turned 12 and 
served their first Mass together. 
</P>
<P>
	Four decades later, the Most Rev. Donald Pelotte, the first  
American Indian to become a Roman Catholic bishop, is about to 
ordain his twin brother into the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dream is going to become a reality,'' Deacon Dana Pelotte  
said before Saturday's ceremony in the 54-year-old brothers' home 
parish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so proud of him, and so happy,'' said Donald Pelotte,  
who has been the bishop of the Diocese of Gallup, N.M., since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers, the youngest of five boys, started life on a farm  
outside of Waterville with no electricity or running water. Their 
father, an Abenaki Indian, left home when they were 3 months old. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys were close and constantly ``shoulder to shoulder,''  
Dana said. Their mother, a deeply religious Catholic of 
French-Canadian descent, moved the boys to town so they could 
become altar boys. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, the twins served their first Mass together.  
</P>
<P>
	At 14, Donald knew he wanted to become a priest and left for  
Eymard Seminary in Hyde Park, N.Y. He would later study at Catholic 
Theological Union in Chicago and Fordham University in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Dana stayed behind and attended public high school, then worked  
as a credit manager for a tire company to support his mother. He 
was drafted into the Army in 1965 and served as a chaplain's 
assistant in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, he became a brother in the Congregation of the Blessed  
Sacrament and worked in financial posts at churches in Ohio, 
Wisconsin, New Mexico and New York. He also served as the chief 
financial officer for his religious order. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Dana always knew he would enter religious life, he gave  
no indication early on that he had an interest in the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
	His twin recalls telling an older brother to stop asking Dana if  
he was ever going to go to the seminary. 
</P>
<P>
	But gradually, Dana said, he knew he was being called. Donald  
said he was stunned when his brother called for advance on whether 
to become a deacon or move on to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked, `Why should I become a deacon if I can become a  
priest?''' Donald said. ``I started crying because I was so 
overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Go for it.'''  
</P>
<P>
	Dana began studies for the priesthood in 1995 and graduated in  
June from the Catholic Theological Union. He is now superior of his 
religious community in Menasha, Wis., where he will return after 
his ordination. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald is spiritual leader of a largely impoverished diocese in  
New Mexico and Arizona that is 53 percent Indian, 
</P>
<P>
	``To think that from such a difficult family situation you could  
come up with a priest and a bishop,'' he said. He credited his 
mother, who died in 1985, and the local church: ``It takes a whole 
community to form a priest.''

<HEADLINE> Motor Oil Marketer Settles Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major marketer of motor oil additives has  
agreed to settle charges by federal regulators that it made 
unsubstantiated claims about its product. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement announced Thursday by the Federal  
Trade Commission, Prolong Super Lubricants, Inc., would require 
scientific substantiation for a broad range of claims made about 
its automobile motor oil additive, Prolong Engine Treatment 
Concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC had alleged that Prolong made unsupported claims that  
compared to motor oil alone, the additive reduces engine wear at 
start-up and extends the duration of engine life. The FTC complaint 
also charged Prolong with making unsubstantiated claims that the 
engine treatment reduces corrosion in engines and protects against 
engine breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement requires Prolong to back up claims about the  
additive's ability. The order also bars the company from 
misrepresenting tests, studies or research. Testimonials or 
endorsements would also require substantiation or disclosure of 
what results an ordinary consumer could expect. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it constantly conducts scientific tests on its  
products and will continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will go about the process of testing with an increased  
knowledge of the guidelines that are consistent with the 
expectations of the commission,'' said Robert Abdellah, vice 
president of corporate communications for Prolong, based in Irvine, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted 4-0 to accept the proposed settlement, with  
Commissioner Orson Swindle dissenting in part. The consent 
agreement is subject to a 60-day public comment period, after which 
the commission will decide whether to make it final.

<HEADLINE> Computers Improve Weather Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like football coaches getting each player to  
contribute their best effort for the team, scientists have found a 
way to get weather forecasting computers to work together to make 
improved predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called weather superensemble produces forecasts that are  
better than the sum of their parts, according to researchers at 
Florida State University. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeking to demonstrate to the weather community that it  
can do so well it can become a useful product in the future,'' said 
T.N. Krishnamurti, leader of the project which was reported in 
today's edition of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, in a forecast of windspeed over the United States  
three days in advance, errors in the various models ranged from 5.8 
mph to 10.1 mph with an average error of 6.5 mph. The superensemble 
reduced the error to 5.6 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In a forecast of hurricane winds three days into the future,  
computer errors ranged from 31.3 mph to 32.4 mph. Error fell to 
21.5 mph with the superensemble. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean the superensemble can replace the other  
computers, Krishnamurti stressed: ``It cooperates with the others. 
It doesn't exist if they don't exist, if they improve it 
improves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Computer models are massively complex programs that use  
mathematical formulas to describe how the atmosphere works. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of readings of wind direction and speed, temperature,  
pressure, humidity, light, cloud cover and other variables at 
different altitudes are collected around the world and continually 
fed into the computers. With a series of such reports, the formulas 
can then calculate the weather at a particular moment, assess how 
it is changing and forecast that change into the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Several important models are used in different countries, and  
the team studied their past successes and failures, calculating any 
biases. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, one model might consistently forecast too much or  
too little rain in an area while another might have trouble 
predicting the strength of the North wind. 
</P>
<P>
	When they find problem areas they give less weight to that  
portion of the forecast from that particular computer, and if 
another is better on a particular area it gets more weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining the forecasts, allowing for the strengths and  
weaknesses of each, allows production of a single new forecast 
called the ``collective superensemble'' that is better than the 
average of those involved, Krishnamurti explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it's not just one model that it represents, it represents  
the best'' of all of them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoltan Toth, who works on ensemble forecasting at the National  
Center for Environmental Prediction near Washington, said the 
report was very interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They look at all variables at all levels. I don't think anyone  
has attempted to do this,'' said Toth. ``It's primarily a bias 
remover,'' he said, confirming that removing biases can reduce the 
error in the forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his work on ensembles, Toth said, researchers use several  
computer models to produce a range of forecasts.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bengals Player Arrested in Ga. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- James Brooks, a former all-pro running back  
with the Cincinnati Bengals, was arrested Friday in Atlanta and 
will face charges in Ohio that he owes more than $100,000 in child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, 40, was arrested as he was being processed through  
customs at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport while arriving 
from England, where he had been living, Hamilton County Prosecutor 
Michael Allen said in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's office had asked for federal help in tracking down  
Brooks to face felony indictments alleging that he owes $78,000 in 
child support payments for a 6-year-old son and more than $29,000 
for a 4-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Brooks could get 6-12 months in jail for each  
case, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was to be taken before a federal magistrate Friday in  
Atlanta, Allen said. Brooks could be returned to Ohio in 10 days to 
face the charges if he opts not to fight extradition, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks had gone to England to work for an English football team  
that folded. He later was a security guard in that country, 
according to Allen's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks played high school football in Warner Robins, Ga., and  
later at Auburn, then played 11 seasons in the NFL, including eight 
with Cincinnati. He is the Bengals' career rushing leader with 
6,447 yards.

to the local level while holding schools accountable through a 
statewide rating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is fair to say that since he has been governor, education  
has fared well,'' said John Cole, president of the Texas Federation 
of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems remain, however, including some in the charter school  
program that Bush championed. The governor also hasn't been able to 
persuade lawmakers to approve everything he's wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Most notably, the Legislature refused to pass a pilot program  
Bush sought to allow public funding for private school tuition 
vouchers -- something his brother Jeb accomplished on a statewide 
basis as Florida's governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush renewed his call for vouchers Thursday -- without explicitly  
calling them that. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to Hispanic business leaders in Los Angeles, Bush  
proposed that the worst-performing schools be stripped of their 
federal funds for disadvantaged students and that the money be made 
available to parents for private education, tutoring or ``whatever 
offers hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laying out his education agenda, he boasted of progress in Texas  
schools. ``Test scores are rising, and the gap between whites and 
minorities is closing faster than anywhere else in the country,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas is ``certainly seen as a leader in education,'' said Kathy  
Christie, policy analyst with the Education Commission of the 
States. ``I think he's had a hand in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state accountability system -- which ranks schools based on  
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills scores, dropout rates and 
attendance -- is one of the nation's strongest, she said. Approved 
before Bush took office, it has been strengthened during his 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush did push for early reading proficiency and got  
that. He pushed for doing away with social promotion and got that. 
He signed the charter schools bill. He called for property tax 
reform and he didn't actually get the tax base reform, but he did 
get property tax relief,'' Ms. Christie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with better teacher pay and higher scores on the state  
achievement test, Bush's 4 1/2 years as governor have been marked by 
multibillion-dollar efforts to relieve school property taxes and 
the expansion of educational choice through charter schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has focused on ensuring that youngsters can read on grade  
level, and he played a role in a major rewrite of the state 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	He successfully pushed a law meant to ensure that students are  
academically prepared before they're promoted and signed measures 
strengthening standards, targeting school safety and increasing 
state aid to schools. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, problems remain.  
</P>
<P>
	Scores on the SAT college entrance exam, released this week,  
show Texas still lagging behind the national average. Some leaders 
attribute that to the large number of Texas students tested. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a gap between minority and white passing rates on  
the state achievement test, although it's narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund has  
filed a lawsuit calling the test invalid and discriminatory. Other 
critics say it drives Texas' curriculum and narrows students' 
educational experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Average teacher pay in Texas is below the U.S. average despite a  
just-passed $3,000 raise, according to one survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Some charter schools have run into severe financial  
difficulties. One gave up its charter without opening after taking 
more than $240,000 in public funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Many improvements under Bush are built on the work of those who  
came before him and depended on lawmakers' efforts, some note. 
</P>
<P>
	They cite a 1984 law's restriction on class size in the lower  
grades as a key element in improved student performance. A revamped 
school finance system that shifted money from the richest school 
districts and lifted up the poorest was passed before Bush became 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``These changes have occurred over the last 13, 14, 15 years,  
and they're beginning to show results on the test,'' said Al 
Kauffman, an attorney for the legal defense and education fund. He 
calls Bush's emphasis on testing a detriment but praises such 
things as his reading initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole, the teachers' union president, said the 1984 reforms  
deserve the credit for current rising test scores. But he said the 
governor also deserves credit for efforts such as restoring local 
control, safe-schools legislation, the reading initiative and 
curriculum rewrite. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Buchanan, political scientist at the University of Texas  
at Austin, described Bush's education record this way: ``No one 
thing that is earth-shattering, and not a 100 percent record of 
success, but enough there to make a claim that education is one of 
his priorities, and he has done something about it.''

<HEADLINE> O'Connor Says Fate in God's Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, hospitalized at a cancer  
center for diagnosis of an unknown ailment, says his fate remains 
in the hands of God. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is such a gift and after almost 80 years of living it, I  
have no sentiment so strong as gratitude,'' O'Connor wrote in his 
weekly Catholic New York newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	``But faith is an equal gift, most particularly the faith to  
believe that one's life, everyone's life, is ultimately in the 
hands of a loving God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, 79, has been hospitalized since Aug. 25 at Memorial  
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. It is not known when he will be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The nature of O'Connor's ailment is also unclear. He said he  
would release results of medical tests when he receives them. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardinal has announced plans to retire as head of the New  
York Roman Catholic archdiocese when he turns 80 on Jan. 15. He has 
been cardinal of the 2.2 million-member diocese, which covers 10 
New York counties, since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Farm That Inspired Wyeth Is Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHADDS FORD, Pa. (AP) -- The Pennsylvania farm where Andrew Wyeth  
painted many of his famously bleak landscapes of faded red barns 
and snowy hillsides has been sold to a nonprofit organization to be 
preserved, possibly as a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brandywine River Conservancy acquired the 33-acre Kuerner  
Farm, about 25 miles west of Philadelphia, from the Kuerner family. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm, which dates to the 18th century, is the site of more  
than 1,000 of Wyeth's works. He painted scenes of the farm and its 
personalities, including Karl Kuerner, the German immigrant who 
moved there after World War I, and Helga Testorf, who cared for the 
farmer in his old age. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of a time capsule,'' said Richard Meryman, Wyeth's  
biographer. ``As far as I can tell, it's changed very little since 
Wyeth first went over that hill and down there to meet the man he 
would paint for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Kuerner Jr., the farmer's son, who is now 72 and still  
farms hay on the property, purchased about three-quarters of the 
land from his four sisters and donated it to the conservancy. The 
rest was purchased by the conservancy, which took title to the farm 
in May. The conservancy would not disclose the sale price. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservancy is working on a plan that could include  
restoring the three-story farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuerner said it was the farm's history that motivated him to  
preserve the property. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farm kind of made Andy,'' he said. ``And Andy kind of made  
the farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth still lives nearby in Chadds Ford, though he spends his  
summers in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth first painted at Kuerner Farm in 1932 at age 15, after  
playing with toy soldiers there as a boy. He would draw upon the 
scenery time and again for more than 40 years afterward in such 
paintings as ``Winter 1946,'' ``Groundhog Day'' and ``Evening at 
Kuerners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, Wyeth began to paint Ms. Testorf, and completed more  
than 240 images, many of them nudes, that were featured in an 
exhibition 16 years later at the National Gallery of Art in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuerner Farm is one of the last working farms in Delaware  
County, which is being developed rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Also nearby are Turner's Mill, where the illustrator Howard Pyle  
taught around the turn of the century, and Windtryst, the home 
where Andrew's artist father, N.C. Wyeth, rented an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, tours of the farm may be run from the nearby  
Brandywine River Museum, where many of the Wyeths' paintings are on 
display, said Halsey Spruance, a conservancy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The house may also be opened, like the Olson House in Cushing,  
Maine, where Wyeth painted his famous ``Christina's World,'' of a 
woman sitting on the grass, reaching out toward a farmhouse in the 
distance.

<HEADLINE> Gore Says Protect U.S. Coastlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore cruised Boston Harbor and  
then went ashore to announce new federal initiatives aimed at 
protecting America's coastlines and ocean waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not just part of the environment, but they're an  
engine of our economy,'' Gore said of oceans in a speech at the New 
England Aquarium. ``We need to take bold steps to protect the 
oceans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore announced that President Clinton had signed a proclamation  
Thursday giving U.S. authorities the right to enforce 
environmental, customs and immigration laws at sea within 24 
nautical miles from shore, up from 12 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to greatly increase our ability to protect our  
environment,'' said Gore, who also noted the measure would help 
authorities fight drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the speech, Gore toured the harbor with teen-agers who  
showed him tubs full of shellfish, sea weed and other marine life, 
helped him perform tests on the water's clarity and even gave him a 
net to catch plankton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also received a report signed by Secretary of the Navy  
Richard Danzig and Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley with 
recommendations for improving federal policies towards oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	The report focused on making sure future generations can  
continue to reap economic benefits from the oceans and maintain 
national security at sea. It also stressed the importance of 
maintaining the ecological soundness of the oceans and pushed ocean 
education, research and exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore announced $5 million in aid to help fishermen suffering  
from declining fish populations and fisheries closures in the Gulf 
of Maine. In return, fishermen must agree to work with scientists 
conducting research on the health of the fish stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``No plan is worth anything unless it protects those working  
families who depend on a healthy ocean,'' Gore said. ``I think that 
a clean and safe environment is the foundation for a prosperous 
economy and a good way of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Gore never mentioned his run for the White House  
in 2000. But with the formerly filthy Boston Harbor as his 
backdrop, the event allowed him to highlight environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``People said we couldn't act to clean up this harbor, but we  
have,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the specific proposals in the report -- endorsed by Gore --  
is United States membership in the United Nations' 1994 Convention 
on the Law of the Sea, which sets international standards for the 
world's oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the only major player in the world that's not part of  
that,'' said Jerry Schubel, president of the New England Aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also urged increased research and monitoring of  
marine wildlife, a look at the possible establishment of marine 
wilderness areas, and new research on ways in which the 
environmental impact of offshore oil and gas operations could be 
reduced.

<HEADLINE> Letter Says Hatch Lobbied for Kim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch promised to ``do  
everything required'' to get the now-indicted son of an 
International Olympic Committee member a permanent resident visa, 
according to a letter revealed Friday by defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the assurances of Senator Hatch that he will do  
everything required to make the Green Card an appropriate success 
or he will acquire the same results by introducing a special 
bill,'' former Salt Lake bid president Tom Welch wrote in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch faxed the letter to John Kim, who was indicted Wednesday  
for fraudulently obtaining the residency card and lying to the FBI 
about it. Federal officials say they will try to extradite Kim, who 
left for South Korea before his indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service says it would not be  
unusual for Hatch to lobby the agency on Kim's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are tens of thousands of cases a year of congressmen  
helping people get green cards. Typically, a staffer will fire off 
a letter to INS. We have case workers here at INS who do nothing 
but handle'' congressional inquiries, INS spokesman Russ Bergeron 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether or not that occurred (in Kim's case), we wouldn't be  
able to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch spokesman Heather Barney said staffers are scouring the  
senator's archives trying to determine what help Hatch offered or 
provided Kim. But Barney says it wouldn't have been anything 
unusual, and that Hatch gets thousands of requests a year for 
immigration help. Typically, his office forwards an application to 
the INS. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim's indictment was the second criminal case arising from Salt  
Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 3, Salt Lake City businessman David E. Simmons pleaded  
guilty to a federal misdemeanor tax charge. Simmons said he created 
a phony job in New York City for Kim and was reimbursed by Kim and 
the Salt Lake Bid Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the arrangement was designed to get Kim a green  
card and influence his father, IOC executive board member Un-yong 
Kim, to vote in favor of Salt Lake's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons was charged with illegally deducting Kim's salary from  
his taxes as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is out of the reach of U.S. law -- for now.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to extradite him,'' Justice Department spokesman  
John Russell said Friday. ``We won't be satisfied until he's 
brought to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Associates for Kim family attorney Howard Graff allowed The  
Associated Press on Friday to inspect Welch's letter in New York 
City, without making a copy. The contents of the letter were not 
disputed by Welch's attorney, Tom Schaffer, who said it ``speaks 
for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer defended Welch, who is considered a target of the  
continuing Olympic investigation, in the Kim affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the deal was set up, it was a legitimate deal. Kim was  
going to provide some consulting, and Tom thought it was going to 
work -- that it would be mutually beneficial,'' Schaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simmons said it didn't work, but Kim says it did. Who's  
telling the truth? Tom says he put the parties together and they 
cut their own deal.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Allows Pre-Game Prayer in Tex. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, Texas (AP) -- A 17-year-old girl walked to a microphone  
to thunderous applause and offered a prayer before her high 
school's season-opening football game Friday night, hours after 
winning a court order allowing her to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered Marian Lynn Ward as she was accompanied by the  
Santa Fe High School principal to the announcer's booth, then stood 
and cheered for a minute and a half after she asked for God's 
blessings. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Fe Independent School District Superintendent Richard  
Ownby had warned any student who violated an appeals court ruling 
banning pre-game prayer would be disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
	But hours before the game, U.S. District Judge Sim Lake of  
Houston issued a temporary restraining order barring the school 
district southeast of Houston from punishing Miss Ward if she led 
the prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake's ruling said the school guidelines ``clearly prefer  
atheism over any religious faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elected by her classmates to deliver inspirational remarks, the  
Baptist minister's daughter made references to deity and other 
things that school officials had said could not be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since a very good judge that was using a lot of wisdom this  
afternoon ruled that I have freedom of speech tonight, I'm going to 
take it,'' she began, to renewed applause. 
</P>
<P>
	She asked God to keep the players safe and prayed that players  
and fans alike would show good sportsmanship and that God would 
bless the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Her voice cracked and she seemed on the verge of crying as she  
said: ``God thank you for this evening. Thank you for all the 
prayers that were lifted up this week for me. I pray that you'll 
bless each and every person here tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her parents, Bob and Marjorie Ward, watched proudly.  
</P>
<P>
	Ward, pastor of Santa Fe Baptist Church, said: ``I feel very  
proud of her. I'm pleased with her character and her conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Kelly Coghlan, representing Miss Ward, filed suit against  
the district late Thursday. Coghlan said although Miss Ward had not 
indicated she would pray, he believed the superintendent's threat 
of discipline violated her Constitutional right to speak freely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want a government that tells students they must  
pray,'' Coghlan said. ``But I do not want a government either that 
stifles genuinely student-initiated prayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ownby, the superintendent, said while he personally favors  
student prayer before football games, the district must enforce the 
law. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in February ruled 
sporting events are not solemn enough to warrant organized prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	A national debate over school-sanctioned prayer focused on Santa  
Fe in 1995 when two families filed suit against the Galveston 
County school district, challenging its policies allowing 
student-led prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	While the New-Orleans based 5th Circuit Court supported prayer  
at high school commencements, its ruling on sporting events ended 
the football tradition across Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Fe school district has petitioned the Supreme Court to  
review the case, citing an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
ruling that makes pre-game prayer legal in Alabama, Florida and 
Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Continues To Menace N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Stiff wind gusting up to 60 mph, showers  
and 14-foot waves assaulted the state's northern coast for a fifth 
day today. Road crews worked to clean up the mess Dennis made. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis first battered the North Carolina shoreline as a  
hurricane on Monday, then headed out to sea and weakened. But 
within a day, it was backtracking toward the Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was downgraded to a tropical storm late Tuesday, and by  
this morning was about 175 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras. The 
storm was drifting southward with maximum sustained wind around the 
core of 60 mph. Forecasters believe Dennis will turn west by 
Saturday; there is a chance it could come ashore Sunday or Monday, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erosion experts compared Dennis to a nor'easter, the winter  
storm that does not pack a hurricane's wallop but stays longer, 
making it worse for beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that beaches along the Outer Banks were already  
in bad shape to begin with,'' said Bill Cleary, who studies barrier 
islands at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. ``Over the 
past 25 years, these beaches have been hit by several hundred 
nor'easters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Outer Banks -- a thin, 130-mile strand of barrier islands  
-- the storm wreaked havoc on Hatteras Island's lifeline, N.C. 12, 
ripping out some sections of road and heaping chest-deep beach sand 
on others. At a quarter-mile neck of Hatteras Island just north of 
Buxton, Dennis created a trench cutting the island in half, then 
filled it in with sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Transportation called in 181 pieces of  
equipment, 200 employees and 200 prisoners to clean sand and 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Dare County officials said residents with four-wheel-drive  
vehicles would be allowed to return this morning to four island 
villages north of Buxton -- Waves, Salvo, Rodanthe and Avon. 
</P>
<P>
	Buxton remains off-limits to returning residents because of a  
breach in the highway north of the village, ``where the beach is 
now where the road was,'' engineer Jerry Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucker Andrew Hoffman, who left his home in Salvo on Sunday to  
make deliveries as far away as Pennsylvania, waited in Manteo for 
word that he could go back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get home and see what happened,'' Hoffman said.  
``The not knowing is rough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dare County spokeswoman Dorothy Holt said an evacuation order  
for neighborhoods in Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills 
north of Hatteras Island also would be lifted this morning. She 
said visitors were welcome in the beach towns over the Labor Day 
weekend but they should confirm reservations first. 
</P>
<P>
	While waiting for commercial deliveries to resume, islanders  
have been supplied with emergency food, water and repair materials 
by helicopters and convoys of National Guard vehicles racing to 
avoid high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	Power and water service had been restored to much of the island  
by Thursday, but phones still were down. 
</P>
<P>
	Electric power also was restored on Ocracoke Island, which had  
operated for days on generator power, and a ferry loaded with heavy 
equipment left Cedar Island on Thursday to begin clearing roads 
there, said state Public Safety Secretary Richard Moore. He said 
another ferry bearing a fuel truck and food would head there later. 
</P>
<P>
	On Hatteras Island, steep escarpments were seen along the beach  
in front of houses washed under by waves and along deserted 
stretches of Cape Hatteras National Seashore 
</P>
<P>
	The erosion caved in a swimming pool at a beachfront motel and  
also claimed five houses in the village of Rodanthe and one in 
Kitty Hawk, where others showed signs of being undermined. Scores 
more houses were left with waves washing under them and dangling 
decks and steps.

<HEADLINE>  Bush, Mexican President Open Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE PASS, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush joined Mexican  
President Ernesto Zedillo in inaugurating a new international 
bridge Friday, hailing the span as a symbol of close economic ties 
between two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a monument to people's faith in Texas, in Mexico and  
in the destiny we share. Bridges, not walls, are the finest 
monument any public official can leave,'' the Republican 
presidential front-runner said at the opening of the Camino Real 
International Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo and the governor greeted each other with a hug as they  
met on the Mexico side of the six-lane bridge linking Eagle Pass, 
Texas, with Piedras Negras in the Mexican state of Coahuila. 
</P>
<P>
	At a formal ceremony on the $30 million bridge over the Rio  
Grande, Bush thanked Zedillo for his friendship and lauded him for 
supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``NAFTA is good for Texas, it is good for Mexico, and it is  
important for our citizens to understand it is good for America,'' 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Spanish, Zedillo said the Camino Real International  
Bridge is a key to expanding economic opportunities in the border 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign for the GOP presidential nomination was evident  
throughout the morning's events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, all right,'' someone in the crowd shouted as  
Bush prepared to speak. ``Callate,'' Bush replied with a smile, 
using a Spanish term to jokingly tell the spectator to be quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush noted in his speech that both the United States and Mexico  
will elect new presidents in 2000 and said those leaders must work 
to elevate cooperation between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States' bond with Mexico needs to become ``more solid  
and more stable than ever before'' and reach the same level as its 
close relationship with Canada, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade between the United States and Mexico is nearing $200  
billion each year, Bush said, double what it was in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Camino Real International Bridge is aimed at diverting some  
commercial traffic from the center of Eagle Pass. The span, 
equipped with an automated license plate scanner and video 
monitoring banks, connects U.S. Highway 57 with Mexico 57 leading 
into strategic business areas in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference, Bush said having served as governor of a  
state bordering Mexico gives him ``a better perspective of NAFTA. 
... I have seen firsthand the benefits of trade and free trade.''

	EAGLE PASS, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush joined Mexican

<HEADLINE> 8 Die in Small Plane Crash in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Deputy Steven Lipinski was one  
traffic light away when he heard a twin-engine plane hit a shopping 
mall, clip some power lines, then crash to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 30 seconds, he was at the scene. Already, he was too  
late. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see nothing but flames inside the cabin,'' said  
Lipinski, of the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office. ``There were no 
voices, no screaming to indicate there were any survivors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All eight aboard perished in the predawn crash Friday, including  
pilot George Rivera, 47, of Tampa, and the plane's owner, Dr. 
Constantine Chambers, founder of the Chambers Hair Institute. The 
company has offices in Florida and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were passengers Andrea Coolidge, 31; Shawn  
Meckelburg, 19; Erica Jones, 22; Mindy Marino, 17; Peter Passaris; 
and Alan Steven Rivera, 19. All six were of Florida and affiliated 
with Chambers' company. 
</P>
<P>
	No one on the ground was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Chambers, who owned the plane, had a student pilot's license.  
Alan Yurman, an investigator with the National Transportation 
Safety Board, said it's unknown who was piloting at the time of the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane left Pontiac, Mich., late Thursday, where Chambers  
performed a hair-transplant operation, the Palm Beach County 
Sheriff's Office said. It had landed there Tuesday from Boca Raton 
with five people aboard, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane stopped once in Atlanta en route back to Boca Raton on  
Friday, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot's voice didn't indicate any trouble when he asked for  
permission to land at Palm Beach International Airport, Yurman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving clearance, the pilot reported he had the airport  
in his sights. Then, the plane apparently fell into distress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mayday!'' someone on the Beechcraft King Air BE-90 cried.  
</P>
<P>
	The plane clipped a single-story shopping mall, flipped and  
twisted, then burst into flames just a half mile from the runway, 
landing on the chain link fence that borders the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no explanation of what the emergency was,'' Yurman  
said after listening to a tape of the final radio contact.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Hire Calipari As Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Former New Jersey Nets coach John Calipari  
was chosen as an assistant coach for the Philadelphia 76ers, the 
team announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari will join assistants Maurice Cheeks, John Kuester and  
Randy Ayers under coach Larry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Brown has been a mentor and friend for a long time,''  
Calipari said in a statement released by the team. ``This is an 
excellent opportunity for me to help the 76ers and to grow as a 
coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari, who helped turn the University of Massachusetts into a  
national power as a college coach, was hired by the Nets on June 7, 
1996, taking over one of the league's worst teams. The Nets went 
30-52 the previous two seasons under Butch Beard. 
</P>
<P>
	A protege of Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, Calipari was  
given the power to change the Nets from a perennial loser into a 
winner, and made some progress. But following the NBA lockout, the 
Nets failed to rediscover the chemistry that made them one of the 
most exciting young teams in the league two seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In two-plus seasons as Nets coach, Calipari had a record of  
72-112. His 1997-98 team made the playoffs, but was swept by the 
eventual champion Chicago Bulls in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari is a native of Moon, Pa. and played collegiately at  
North Carolina-Wilmington and Clarion. 
</P>
<P>
	In other personnel news, the 76ers promoted Tony DiLeo to  
director of player personnel. DiLeo, the team's director of 
scouting for the past five years, replaces Kevin O'Connor, who left 
the 76ers for the Utah Jazz.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays' McGriff Signs Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Fred McGriff didn't want to move  
again, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays were more than willing to allow 
him to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old slugger, the subject of trade rumors in June,  
signed a two-year contract extension Friday that is worth about $6 
million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGriff, a Tampa native, also got a no-trade clause that will  
enable him to live year-round at home and enjoy his children 
growing up. The Devil Rays hold an option for a third season that 
would become guaranteed if he has 550 plate appearances in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's extremely important, because Fred is one of the  
cornerstones of this organization,'' general manager Chuck LaMar 
said, promising that keeping McGriff in the lineup is just one of 
several moves the team will make in an effort to be more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only has he had a great 1999, in the next couple of years  
he's truly going to separate himself as one of the great power 
hitters that ever played this game,'' Lamar said. ``Sometimes, 
because he's not as vocal as other players and maybe doesn't grab 
the limelight, his numbers go unnoticed. But they speak for 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGriff, who would have been eligible for free agency after the  
World Series, us in the final season of a $20 million, four-year 
contract he signed with the Atlanta Braves. The Devil Rays acquired 
him in November 1997 for $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A career .287 hitter with 387 homers in 13 seasons, McGriff  
struggled in 1998, batting .284 with 19 homers and 81 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He's rebounded this year, hitting .314 with 29 homers and 90  
RBIs going into Friday night's game against the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	When trade rumors swirled in June, McGriff made it clear that he  
preferred to remain in Tampa Bay to try to help the two-year-old 
franchise build a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	With McGriff's return assured, LaMar now will turn his attention  
to the future of three other veterans. Catcher John Flaherty can 
become a free agent after this season, while the Devil Rays hold 
options on the contracts of Jose Canseco and Wade Boggs, who will 
miss the rest of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a serious challenge ahead of us,'' McGriff said.  
``We're coming along and I believe we have a chance to have 
something really good here.''

<HEADLINE> Cookies Recalled Over Nut Allergy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Canadian company is recalling certain bags  
of Sensational Gourmet chocolate chip cookies, sold in 10 states, 
because they may pose a serious, even life-threatening, risk to 
people allergic to nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The cookies may contain pecans, although the packaging does not  
list nuts as an ingredient. People allergic to nuts should not eat 
the recalled cookies, but return them to the place of purchase for 
a refund. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled cookies are in 12-ounce bags marked with the codes  
``Best By Feb. 24 OOD'' or ``Best By Feb. 24 OOE.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ontario-based Colonial Cookies said they were sold in grocery  
and convenience stores in: Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia 
and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	A Connecticut child had a mild allergic reaction, prompting  
Colonial Cookies to suspect some of its cookies with pecans may 
have been mixed up in packaging with the chocolate chip variety.

<HEADLINE> Murdoch Gives $10 Mil. to Cathedral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A $10 million donation from News Corp.  
chairman Rupert Murdoch will be used to build a conference center 
for the $163 million Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, currently 
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The donation from the Murdoch Family Foundation was announced  
Thursday by Cardinal Roger Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
	The structures ``will serve the people of Southern California as  
a whole,'' said Murdoch, who is not Catholic. ``Cardinal Mahony's 
vision for this beautiful new cathedral and all that goes with it 
deserves everybody's support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,000-seat cathedral complex, scheduled to open in 2001,  
will include a landscaped plaza, meditation garden, conference 
center, and a 24,000-square-foot residence for Mahony, resident 
clergy and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The cathedral will replace tiny St. Vibiana's Cathedral, which  
was closed after suffering damage in the 1994 Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Murdochs have long recognized the importance of Los  
Angeles as a key city for the new century and millennium,'' Mahony 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch's News Corp. is a worldwide media conglomerate that  
includes newspapers, the Fox television network, 20th Century Fox 
film studio and satellite networks in Europe and Asia. Through Fox 
Sports, Murdoch also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	His donation raises contributions and pledges for the cathedral  
to $136.5 million, Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Murdoch was inducted into the Order of St.  
Gregory, a papal knighthood. His former wife is Catholic.

<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Nashville Predators signed center  
Randy Robitaille and defenseman Craig Miller and re-signed left 
wing Patrick Cote on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three will join the Predators for the start of training camp  
on Saturday, general manager David Poile said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robitaille, 23, had 28 goals and 74 assists in 74 games with the  
Providence Bruins. He helped lead the team to the AHL's Calder Cup 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ottawa, Ontario, native was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers,  
then to Nashville in exchange for Denny Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville acquired Millar, 23, from the Edmonton Oilers in  
exchange for the Predators' 1999 third-round draft selection. He 
split last season between Edmonton and the AHL's Hamilton Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cote, 24, had a goal and two assists in 70 games in his first  
full NHL season. He was originally selected by Nashville in the 
1998 expansion draft.

<HEADLINE> Umpire Montague Misses Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ed Montague, a National League crew chief who  
supports union leader Richie Phillips, missed Friday's game between 
the Milwaukee Brewers and the St. Louis Cardinals, saying he was 
dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Montague, who survived this week's purge of 22 umpires,  
consulted with a trainer before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the doctor prescribes Gatorade for a malady, you have to  
be skeptical,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president for 
baseball operations in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson said baseball normally reviews the situation when an  
umpire misses a game because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Mike Winters and Kerwin Danley, Montague worked  
Thursday's game, and all three had ``22'' stenciled on their caps. 
Montague was sharply critical of baseball commissioner Bud Selig 
during pregame interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Winters and Danley were displeased when told of Alderson's  
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie was wiped out,'' Winters said. ``His credibility in this  
league has never been questioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So (Alderson) is a doctor now?'' Danley asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Tony Randazzo, one of the 25 new umpires hired by the American  
and National leagues, worked home plate Friday in place of Montague 
as part of a three-man crew that included Winters and Danley.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Meares Back After Rehab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Shortstop Pat Meares returned to the  
Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday after his injury rehab stint in the 
minor leagues was cut short because of problems with his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares went on the disabled list May 12 with pain in the hand, a  
problem that began late in spring training. He had surgery to 
repair tendons two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares went to Triple-A Nashville on a rehab assignment Aug. 26  
but was only able to play five games before his hand began 
bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hand is all right; it's just that he still doesn't have  
enough strength to play in the games,'' Pirates trainer Kent 
Biggerstaff said. ``By the time he does his extra work and strength 
work, it kind of fatigues it. When he gets into the game, he just 
doesn't have the strength to have the at-bats you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have said that getting Meares completely healthy is  
more important than having him come back and play some games this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, that work is more important than five swings a  
game,'' Biggerstaff said. ``The options are to not let him do any 
extra work and get five swings in the game or to let him get all of 
his extra work and build his strength back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Gene Lamont said he wasn't sure if Meares would be able  
to play for the Pirates again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares appeared in 17 games for the Pirates this year, hitting  
.297 with no home runs and five RBIs. He signed with Pittsburgh as 
a free agent in March for $1.5 million, then was given a $15 
million, four-year extension in April.

<HEADLINE> CBS-TV To Team Clayson and Gumbel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a summer-long search, CBS will announce  
Tuesday that it has hired ABC News correspondent Jane Clayson to be 
Bryant Gumbel's on-air partner on the ``Early Show,'' two sources 
close to the talks said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The revamped morning news show begins broadcasting in November.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Clayson, based in Los Angeles, is a reporter for ``World  
News Tonight'' and has worked at ABC since 1996. She was a reporter 
and anchor at a local station in Salt Lake City before then. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources confirming her selection spoke on condition of  
anonymity. Ms. Clayson did not immediately return a telephone 
message, and CBS News spokeswoman Sandra Genelius declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had hoped to name a co-anchor by mid-summer after persuading  
Gumbel this spring to return to morning TV. The search so 
preoccupied CBS executives that it was jokingly dubbed ``Operation 
Glass Slipper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC's Maria Bartiromo, ABC's Elizabeth Vargas, NBC's Dawn  
Fratangelo and CBS's Thalia Assuras were among the women reportedly 
being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had sought Ms. Clayson for the ``Early Show'' news reader  
position this summer but failed when ABC matched its salary offer, 
according to published reports. ABC is not expected to try and 
block her departure for the more lucrative anchor position. 
</P>
<P>
	With morning TV one of the few growth areas for the networks,  
CBS is moving boldly to end its perennial doormat status in the 
time slot. CBS is spending between $20 million and $30 million to 
build a new storefront studio across from New York's Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has hired Laurie Hibberd to report on pop culture, author  
Lisa Birnbach and former MTV VJ Martha Quinn to periodically talk 
about aging baby boomers and Mark McEwen to deliver weather and 
entertainment news. Martha Stewart and Bob Vila are expected to 
return from the current show. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the morning wars, ABC unveils its new Times Square  
studio for ``Good Morning America'' on Sept. 13.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Demands Waco Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge ordered the Justice  
Department to turn over all evidence from the FBI raid on the 
Branch Davidian compound at Waco, saying it is needed in a wrongful 
death suit filed here. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Walter Smith threatened to cite the Justice Department  
with contempt if it does not comply with his Thursday order, which 
comes after a belated FBI admission that incendiary tear gas 
canisters were used in the waning hours of the Texas siege. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court's purpose is to secure the evidence so that neither  
the parties to the pending civil litigation, the media or the 
public will perceive that the government may have the opportunity 
to conceal, alter or fail to reveal evidence,'' Smith wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith rebuffed the Justice Department's complaint that  
gathering, copying and transferring the evidence would be ``an 
unwarranted and substantial burden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his order, Smith expressed hope that gathering the evidence  
in one place will deflect suspicions of ``a massive cover-up.'' The 
Justice Department is considering an appeal of the order. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Texas Department of Public Safety, which has in storage  
tons of evidence such as munitions, weapons and rubble from the 
raid, applauded the order. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this summer, the DPS had asked Smith to take control of  
the evidence it was holding for the Justice Department, saying it 
thought it was being used by the federal government to keep 
evidence from public scrutiny.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Said To Be Top Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ah, vacation. Time to rest, read and play  
golf. And raise campaign cash, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	On his just-concluded 16-day respite from Washington, President  
Clinton squeezed in appearances at seven fund-raisers for Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's presumed Senate race, the Democratic National 
Committee and other campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has ever seen anyone do more to raise money than this  
man at the state or federal level in our lifetimes,'' said Charles 
Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a 
Washington-based watchdog organization. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials say Clinton will keep up a steady pace of  
fund raising for the party, Senate and House campaign committees, 
his wife and Vice President Al Gore with the approach of the 2000 
elections. ``He'll be substantially involved,'' deputy chief of 
staff Steve Ricchetti said. ``We're getting very close to show 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far in 1999, a nonelection year, Clinton has attended 27  
fund-raisers that yielded $14 million for the Democratic National 
Committee, according to party figures. That does not count 
appearances for the vice president, the first lady or Senate and 
House campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a vacuum cleaner,'' said Republican National Committee  
Chairman Jim Nicholson. ``And we know that he won't hesitate to use 
the assets of the presidency. He sold the White House for 
fund-raisers and access and lets out all the stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Republican count, Clinton has been on the road 34 days this  
year to attend 55 fund-raisers. Last year, during the midterm 
election campaign, he devoted 67 days to raising money at 114 
events, according to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	President George Bush, by comparison, attended 84 fund-raisers  
during the 1990 midterm election races, said Robert Holzweiss, 
archivist of the Bush library. 
</P>
<P>
	White House and DNC officials were unable to provide their own  
lists of Clinton's fund raising. The Federal Election Commission 
does not compile figures on how much presidents help raise. The 
money is recorded by donor and recipient, and it's difficult to 
tell which fund-raiser it came from. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is absolutely phenomenal and unique,'' said presidential  
scholar Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution. ``He is simply 
very good at it. He's a man of compulsions. This is one of them. No 
other president enjoyed it as much as he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don Simon, executive vice president of Common Cause said, ``The  
remarkable thing about Bill Clinton is that he seems to enjoy fund 
raising, he seems to sort of relish in it. He is just a master of 
the art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton may feel driven, Hess said, because he wants to help his  
wife and Gore win office. ``He has some special obligations to the 
Democrats in Congress who kept him in office, literally,'' during 
the impeachment scandal. And he has a unique opportunity to help 
the Democrats regain control of the House, where a change of five 
seats could put them in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan and Bush raised campaign funds, but not on a par  
with Clinton, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were not as hands-on in the business of politics,  
including the grubby business of collecting the cash,'' the Center 
for Public Integrity's Lewis said. ``I don't think any of them were 
as deeply enmeshed in it as Bill Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials say Clinton is just trying to help  
Democrats keep up with Republicans, who traditionally raise more 
money through their allies in big business. In any event, it's 
difficult to measure Clinton against other presidents, because 
campaign-finance practices have changed dramatically, Clinton aides 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans always out-raise Democrats, always have more  
resources,'' said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``The 
president believes it's important that Democrats be as competitive 
as they can. The president has been willing to take the time to go 
out and energize Democrats around the country, including those who 
have the resources to help the party fund the elections.''	   Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign drew intense criticism after 
revelations that wealthy donors were rewarded with overnight stays 
in the Lincoln Bedroom, rides on Air Force One, invitations to Camp 
David and Oval Office chats with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never really seen before a president use the power and  
perks of the White House as an integrated part of a fund-raising 
machine the way that Clinton did in 1996,'' said Simon, of Common 
Cause. ``That was new. And the amounts of money raised were 
extraordinary.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Will Name Investigator for Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today said she  
will soon name an independent investigator outside the Justice 
Department to answer lingering questions surrounding the FBI's 1993 
assault against a Branch Davidian sect near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she hoped to identify the lead investigator as soon as  
possible, but didn't say when that would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken some time because I want to do it the right  
way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also told reporters at her regular media briefing that she  
was proceeding carefully because she wants to assure that the 
investigation ``has the confidence and faith of the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added that the person selected for the job should ``have no  
conflicts of interest and be well-received'' by the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno dodged questions about whether the furor surrounding the  
recent revelations had caused a strain between her and FBI Director 
Louis Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general said the two often confer on difficult  
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, sometimes I call him and say, `Why did you do this?' or  
he will call and say, `Why did you do that?' That's the type of 
relationship we have,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said that as authorities try to get to the bottom of what  
happened on that fateful day -- April 19, 1993 -- ``it's very 
important that people don't play one off against the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno declined to go into detail about the scope of the  
investigation, saying, ``I think we've got to let the independent 
investigator determine what he or she needs to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I hope will happen is that we will be able to agree on a  
mandate that gives them full authority to pursue any unanswered 
question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general spoke publicly a day after the FBI released  
a videotape on which an FBI commander is heard authorizing the use 
of incendiary tear gas hours before a deadly fire ended the 
Davidians' 51-day standoff with federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI had long denied that incendiary gas was used.  
</P>
<P>
	Two former Republican senators -- John C. Danforth of Missouri  
and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire -- and former Iran-Contra 
prosecutor Dan Webb are among those said to be on the list of 
candidates to conduct Reno's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, Freeh and members of Congress have suggested an  
independent review of the case.

<HEADLINE> Toledo Player Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- DeJuan Goulde, a Toledo defensive end who  
had an asthma attack during the Rockets' 35-12 loss to Syracuse, 
was released from the hospital Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goulde collapsed on the sidelines and was down for about 15  
minutes before the game was called off with 1:28 remaining Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	While medical crews attended to Goulde, who was having trouble  
breathing, players from both teams stood quietly on the field. 
Goulde was taken off on a stretcher and remained at Toledo Hospital 
overnight for observation. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo's team physician Roger Kruse said Goulde had a bronchial  
infection and was cleared to play. Goulde had 10 tackles in the 
35-12 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Kruse said Goulde would be able to play in the Rockets' next  
game against at Ball State on Sept. 18.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Signs One-Year Rockets Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Free agent forward Charles Barkley agreed to a  
one-year contract with the Houston Rockets, the team said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still a great player and we really need him,'' said  
Carroll Dawson, the Rockets' vice president of basketball 
operations. ``He said he wanted to play one more year, so that's 
what we talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson would not confirm the amount of the contract but Houston  
television station KRIV, citing sources, reported it was worth $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, the NBA's MVP in 1992-93 with the Phoenix Suns, is  
heading into his 16th NBA season and fourth with the Rockets. He 
finished second in the league in rebounds last season, averaging 
12.3. He also averaged 16 points and 4.5 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the Rockets announced they signed free agent Thomas  
Hamilton. The 7-foot-2 center will be entering his second NBA 
season but hasn't played since 1995-96 with the Boston Celtics. He 
played in 11 games that season, averaging 2.3 points and 2.0 
rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Looks Into Banking Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin, who has remained silent  
on an alleged money laundering scandal linked to Russia, summoned a 
top security officer to the Kremlin today for private talks on the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	In another corruption case, Russia's suspended chief prosecutor,  
Yuri Skuratov, confirmed today that Yeltsin and his daughters were 
linked to an investigation into an alleged bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin makes only occasional public remarks these days, and has  
left Kremlin aides to respond to several corruption scandals 
swirling around his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most serious corruption case, U.S. investigators are  
trying to determine whether Russian criminal groups laundered up to 
$10 billion through the Bank of New York. No one has been charged 
with a crime, and the Russian government has not been accused of 
any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Russian officials believe the country's reputation is  
being harmed, and the Federal Security Service is investigating the 
extent of Russian involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bribery scandal, Skuratov said he received documents from  
Swiss prosecutors alleging that Yeltsin and his family received 
kickbacks from a Swiss construction firm. Skuratov had previously 
dodged questions about the alleged involvement of Yeltsin and his 
family in the case involving the Swiss Mabetex firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov was suspended by Yeltsin in March and is under  
investigation for allegedly receiving the use of prostitutes to 
divert criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has never responded to the allegations in the Mabetex  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the security service, Nikolai Patrushev, met Yeltsin  
in the Kremlin today, and told the president that the Bank of New 
York scandal was tied to U.S. politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reported to the president that the case is political ... and  
linked to the elections in the United States,'' Patrushev said. 
``Of course, it's absurd to talk about such a sum'' being diverted 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian and U.S. authorities have held several meetings on the  
case, Patrushev noted, but said the FBI hasn't provided the 
Russians with any leads for them to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they have some specific evidence, we will carefully  
consider that,'' he said. ``As of today, they haven't provided us 
with any such materials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. newspapers have reported that the Russian government may  
have diverted loan money from the International Monetary Fund, but 
the IMF and the U.S. government say they have no evidence of this. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government -- the IMF's largest member -- said it won't  
decide whether to approve new loans until a full accounting is made 
of the IMF money Russia has already received. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF was expected to release a $640 million installment of a  
$4.5 billion loan package this month. An IMF mission is currently 
in Moscow to review Russia's compliance with conditions for the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's finance minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, cautioned today  
that the loan installment could be delayed until next month. He 
denied that any IMF money had been misused, calling the reports 
``groundless allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the country ``does  
not intend to defend itself in the wake of media publications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no reason to explain ourselves. As for Russia's good  
name, it has one,'' Ivanov told the Interfax news agency while on a 
trip to Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian press has denounced the Western reports in the Bank  
of New York case, calling it an anti-Russian witch hunt and a 
return to the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction reflects the recent decline in relations between  
the United States and Russia. The two nations clashed over the 
Kosovo conflict and Moscow is increasingly nationalistic, a stance 
welcomed by many Russians nostalgic for the days of Soviet 
superpower status.

<HEADLINE> Lab Heads Admit Doctoring Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Supervisors at a central New Jersey testing  
lab admitted Friday that they doctored data for a Japanese fuel 
blender so millions of gallons of gasoline designed to reduce air 
pollution would appear to meet federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, substandard reformulated gasoline was sold for 2 1/2  
years to motorists in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, 
according to the three men, who each pleaded guilty in U.S. 
District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men, supervisors at Caleb Brett's lab in Linden, said  
they falsified the data on behalf of Itochu Corp., The Japanese 
company shipped gasoline to Linden for distribution to retailers, 
but could not unload unless it met specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was understood that if we didn't do it, Itochu would take  
their business elsewhere,'' said former supervisor Ronald J. 
Domnik, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had no assessment yet  
of how much extra pollution the gasoline caused, spokesman Rich 
Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Itochu, Lanny Breuer, refused to discuss Itochu's  
alleged role, but said officials will cooperate with the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Domnik and Julius Balogh, who also pleaded guilty to conspiracy,  
each face five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. Nicholas 
Lehman pleaded guilty to not telling authorities about the 
conspiracy and faces three years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Drops to 4.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate dipped back  
down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in August as gains in 
computer, data processing and health care jobs helped offset 
continued job losses at factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that the decrease in  
August's unemployment rate followed a 4.3 percent rate in July. 
Despite the decline in the unemployment rate, employers added a 
smaller-than-expected 124,000 jobs to their payrolls in August, 
following a gain of 338,000 jobs in July . 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation  
pressures, grew a tiny 0.2 percent to $13.30 in August, a 3.5 
percent increase compared to a year ago. That was the third 
straight monthly rise, but slightly slower than 0.3 percent 
increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
	While low unemployment and strong wage growth appear to be good  
developments for workers, economists worry that it's a recipe for 
sparking inflation. Their fear: Employers scrambling to find 
workers woo them with higher wages and benefits, costs likely to 
drive up consumer prices if not constrained by other forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the  
second time this year and hinted no additional rate increases may 
be necessary unless the economy show signs of overheating or if 
inflation breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been on edge in recent sessions amid  
continuing fears among investors that the Fed hasn't yet completed 
its efforts to ward off inflation by imposing higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But the inflation-sensitive market for government bonds was  
heartened by the August unemployment report, and immediately pushed 
yields on 30-year Treasuries down to 6.03 percent this morning from 
6.13 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, the number of service sector jobs increased by  
132,000, led by gains in computer services which grew by 15,000 
jobs. Doctors offices, hospitals and other health-care facilities 
added 19,000 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last month of the summer, amusement and recreation  
services added 17,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, overall retail employment held about steady. Bars and  
restaurants dropped 38,000 jobs, but car dealers and furniture 
stores helped offset that decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers, still feeling the lingering affects of the global  
financial crisis, cut 63,000 jobs in August. That more than wiped 
out an increase of 51,000 jobs in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss in manufacturing jobs hit the apparel and industrial  
machinery industries hardest, while car and furniture makers, 
bouyed by brisk spending by Americans, continued to add jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, construction jobs declined by 29,000, largely  
offsetting gains in the previous two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Minorities and women continue to face higher unemployment than  
white Americans and men. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, the unemployment rate for blacks was 7.8 percent,  
lower than July's rate but still more than double the 3.7 percent 
rate for whites. The August unemployment rate for Hispanics was 6.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate for all women was 4.3 percent in August  
compared to 4.1 percent for all men. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate for teen-agers was 13.5 percent, rising  
slightly as many left summer jobs to head back to school.

<HEADLINE> Track Evens CART Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Dario Franchitti has  
temporary road courses down pat. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who won last year's Vancouver Molson Indy from the  
pole and has won the last two CART FedEx Series events on temporary 
circuits, took the provisional pole here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Team Kool Green teammate Paul Tracy, who finished second to  
Franchitti earlier this year on the temporary circuits in Toronto 
and Detroit, had the second fastest speed on Friday. But his lap 
was disqualified after his Reynard-Honda failed a technical 
inspection because it was lower than the allowable 2-inch 
clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, a 26-year-old Scotsman, turned a fast lap of 104.520  
mph on the reconfigured 1.781-mile, 12-turn course at the edge of 
downtown Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy was closest at 104.102 before his speed was disallowed.  
Fortunately for the Canadian driver, he is eligible to try again 
Saturday in the final round of time trials for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who trails series leader Juan Montoya by four points  
in the standings, got the job done Friday in only eight laps. He 
turned his fast time on his final trip around the circuit, which 
now features an uninterrupted back straightaway and wider, more 
open turns at the tightest part of the course. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the new track configuration is already considerably  
faster than last year's 1.802-mile version on which Franchitti won 
after qualifying at a then-record 101.147. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I was just trying to get used to the track and the  
changes they made,'' said Franchitti, who was conserving tires for 
the race. ``We're definitely looking for improvements tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for those track changes, he said, ``The wall being farther  
away, from a safety standpoint, is very good. It's faster and I 
think it's better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy shrugged when asked why he and Franchitti are so good on  
the temporary circuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really know why we're particularly strong on the  
street courses. They're not places we can test and we really 
haven't tested that much on road courses, either,'' Tracy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think last year we just got a good baseline and, right  
now, Dario and I are real close to each other on car set-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti said, ``Yeah, I think it gets down to teamwork again.  
Our engineers have come up with a good set-up and we're taking 
advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Moreno, continuing to sub for injured Christian  
Fittipaldi, moved up to the second qualifying spot at 103.997, 
followed by local favorite Greg Moore, from suburban Maple Ridge, 
at 103.889, Gil de Ferran at 103.867 and rookie Montoya at 103.801. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still working on it, but I'm confident,'' said Montoya,  
who comes into this week with a series-high six victories overall 
and two in a row. ``I really like the track. It was a bit tough the 
first couple of times around, but it's getting better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time Vancouver winner Michael Andretti, who is a distant  
third in the season points -- just ahead of Tracy -- was a 
disappointing 11th at 103.079. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's track layout -- which was completely new because of  
continuing construction at Concord Pacific Place, where the race is 
held -- was criticized by nearly every driver for being too bumpy, 
too slow, too narrow in critical places and lacking enough safe 
runoff areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was just no margin for error,'' said Scott Pruett, head  
of the CART drivers' safety committee. ``If you put one wrong 
wheel, you were finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's problem have all been addressed in the latest  
version of the course, which got passing marks from the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's improvement at both ends,'' Tracy said. ``I think  
they've done everything they can do with the land available to 
them.''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close at 4-Day High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed at a four-day high today,  
buoyed by a strong showing on Wall Street as inflation fears 
cooled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies had one of  
its biggest percentage gains this year, rising 7.13 points, or 2.3 
percent, to close at 312.32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed up 7.78 points at 
327.22. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 90.74 points to 3,809.11,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed up 92.73 points at 3,744.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, London's FTSE 100 blue-chip index closed up  
2.2 percent to 6,332.10; Frankfurt's Xetra DAX jumped 2.8 percent 
to 5,336.22; the Paris CAC-40 index rose 2.7 percent to 4,672.37; 
Milan's MIBtel index rose 2.2 percent to 34,001.00; and Amsterdam's 
AEX index rose 2.4 percent to 578.63. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, insurers were among the best-performing blue chips,  
after National Westminster Bank said it may make an offer for Legal 
&AMP; General. 
</P>
<P>
	However, National Westminster shares were the worst blue-chip  
performers, with analysts saying that a rumored $17 billion price 
tag would be too high. The stock fell 68 pence, or 5.6 percent, to 
1,143 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a very significant move if it happens,'' said Tim  
Dyer, head of international sales at SG Securities in London. 
``Everyone has been talking about consolidation in the financial 
sector across Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norwich Union, meanwhile, was the best performer in the FTSE  
100, with a gain of 11 percent. Analysts said Norwich may be the 
next takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
	Other European insurers that rose included Germany's Allianz,  
the biggest share in the Dow Jones Stoxx Insurance index, up 5.10 
euros at 249.00 euros in Frankfurt. Dutch-based Aegon, the second 
biggest stock in the index, rose 2.90 euros to 81.95 euros. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, auto makers were among the leading gainers, with  
Peugeot shares finishing 10.20 euros higher at 190.10 euros, amid 
growing optimism for the sector.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Names Distribution Exec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com on Friday named a new executive to  
oversee its ambitious plan to expand its shipping and distribution 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based Internet merchant named Jeffrey Wilke as its  
head of logistics. He replaces Jimmy Wright, a former operations 
expert at Wal-Mart who plans to return to retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilke comes to Amazon.com from Allied Signal, where he was in  
charge of the company's pharmaceutical fine chemicals unit. He was 
directly responsible for 15 plants/distribution centers in the 
United States, Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Amazon.com plans to add three million square feet of  
warehouse space. Its goal is to expand its distribution network so 
it can stock more goods and get them to customers faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilke's appointment comes right before the holiday shopping  
season. The company hopes he will be able to work out any kinks in 
its distribution before the Christmas crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on track to deliver our commitments this year,'' said  
Joe Galli, president and chief operating officer at Amazon.com. 
``But we have said from the beginning that there are some startup 
risks ... and some situations we have to smooth out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilke formerly worked in the information technology group at  
Andersen Consulting. He is a graduate of Princeton University and 
did his graduate studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright came out of retirement to join Amazon.con in July 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Rise on Economic News / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Good news on the inflation front sent bond  
prices surging Friday, breaking a six-session losing streak and 
nearly pushing the yield on the long bond back below 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 17/32  
point, or $15.31 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 6.01 percent from 6.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally was touched off by a report showing a  
smaller-than-expected increase in hourly wages in August, which 
helped quell fears that a tight labor market would force wages 
higher and lead the Fed to raise interest rates when it meets on 
Oct. 5. Higher rates tend to hurt the value of bonds, which pay a 
fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up between 3/16  
point and 9/32 point, and intermediate maturities were up 15/32 
point to 7/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.90 percent as the  
discount was unchanged at 4.77 percent. Six-month yields were 5.13 
percent, as the discount fell 0.03 percentage point to 4.93 
percent. One-year yields were 5.19 percent as the discount fell by 
0.07 percentage point from late Thursday to 4.93 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.13 percent from 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 19/32 to 114 7/32. The average yield to 
maturity fell to 5.79 percent from 5.82 percent.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Counts on QB for Scoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- If most schools lost their four top  
receivers, two best offensive linemen and leading runner, there 
would be ample reason to ask: How are they going to score any 
points? 
</P>
<P>
	At No. 12 Georgia, which is in that predicament, no one seems  
the least bit flustered because of one player who returned: 
quarterback Quincy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a lot of confidence last year, but he has even more  
this year,'' receiver Michael Greer said. ``I don't know what it 
is, but you just look in his eyes and you know he's a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter is only a sophomore, but his Q rating is already soaring  
off the chart for the Bulldogs as they finish preparations for 
Saturday's opener against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates picked him as one of four permanent captains for  
the season, an honor normally reserved for juniors and seniors. The 
school has launched a Web site dedicated to promoting him for the 
Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to lift the entire offense, even though he can't  
look to a receiver who caught more than 13 passes a year ago and 
can't hand off to a runner who gained more than 161 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know he'll get the ball to you in the right place, a place  
where you can make things happen,'' said Greer, the top returnee at 
receiver. ``It's fun to play with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, Carter feels more at ease than he did a year ago, when  
he joined the Bulldogs for fall practice after a recruiting fight 
with rival Georgia Tech, having not played a football game in two 
seasons while he pursued a career in minor league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, it took only a few weeks for him to win the job,  
making him the first true freshman to start at quarterback for 
Georgia in a season opener since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I had butterflies before the first game,'' the  
6-foot-3, 223-pound Carter said. ``Now, I'm sleeping well during 
the week. I've settled in and I know my role on this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His role is a bit of everything. Carter broke most of Eric  
Zeier's school freshman passing records, completing 176 of 290 
passes for 2,484 yards and 12 touchdowns, and also ranked second on 
the team with 284 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Carter showed a fortitude lacking in most freshman,  
shaking off three interceptions in the Peach Bowl to lead the 
Bulldogs from a 21-point deficit to a 35-33 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking at a guy who barely had time to learn the  
offense before he was starting,'' offensive guard Steve Herndon 
said. ``He's a lot more relaxed when he gets back there to run the 
plays. It's helped a lot just knowing the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter thinks the turning point came in the ninth game last  
season, when he faced Auburn and defensive guru Bill Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Oliver threw the entire book at me,'' Carter recalled.  
``On the first nine plays, I saw nine different coverages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, he completed 23 of 37 passes for 351 yards, including  
an 80-yard touchdown strike to Greer in which the quarterback 
pumped twice, allowing his receiver to slip past the secondary. The 
Bulldogs won 28-17. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Carter will be even more prepared if a team should  
try to baffle him with Oliver-like tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get the scouting report on Monday, I already know many  
things that I didn't know last year,'' Carter said. ``I know what 
the other team is trying to do right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah State coach Dave Arslanian cringes at the thought of trying  
to stop Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching Georgia on film, I saw Quincy Carter scramble out and  
throw a strike 62 yards on a straight line,'' Arslanian said. 
``I've never seen anything like that before. I hope I never see it 
again. We'll try to keep him on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter has put his baseball career on hold, walking away from  
the Chicago Cubs organization this summer so he could work out with 
his football teammates. He's had more success throwing a ball than 
hitting one, failing to get above Class A and struggling with a 
career average in the low-.200s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't given up on baseball,'' he said. ``But I'm kind of  
playing it down right now to see how far I can go in football. 
Baseball is still there. I still love the sport. We'll just see how 
it goes after this season.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Charged in MIT Laughing Gas Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A student and a recent graduate were  
charged today in connection with the death of a Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology student who inhaled laughing gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Mosher, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology senior,  
and 1999 graduate Rene Ruiz face charges stemming from the 
distribution of illegal drugs from the dorm room where Richard A. 
Guy was found dead Tuesday, MIT Police Chief Anne Glavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical examiner said the 22-year-old junior physics major  
from Mission Viejo, Calif., was asphyxiated as a result of nitrous 
oxide inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint lists charges that include possession of nitrous  
oxide, hallucinogenic mushrooms, amphetamines and marijuana, all 
with intent to distribute. The pair also face charges of 
conspiracy, possession of a hypodermic needle and cruelty to 
animals, cats. Police did not further explain the cruelty charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are scheduled to appear in Cambridge District Court a  
week from today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosher, a major in brain and cognitive science, lived in the  
same East Campus dormitory as Guy. 
</P>
<P>
	MIT officials believe he was alone at the time of his death, but  
authorities were investigating whether he had been inhaling from a 
``community canister'' of gas shared by other students. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy had taken some time off from the prestigious university and  
was seeking readmission to the degree program as a junior this 
fall, MIT spokesman Ken Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the second MIT student to die from on-campus substance  
abuse in two years. In September 1997, 18-year-old freshman Scott 
Krueger died three days after he was found in an alcohol-induced 
coma on a fraternity floor.

<HEADLINE> Destructive Mealybug Seen in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL CENTRO, Calif. (AP) -- A bug that leaves a destructive,  
cotton-like mass on branches and has decimated crops in the West 
Indies over the past decade has been spotted in the continental 
United States for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned because, No. 1, it's a new pest and because of  
its potential impact on agriculture and the urban environment,'' 
Imperial County agricultural commissioner Steve Birdsall said 
Thursday. ``I'm glad we have a mechanism in place to make an early 
detection. I'm confident biological methods will be effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pink hibiscus mealybug appears as a white, cotton-like mass  
at the end of branches. It causes leaf deformation on infested 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Pesticide isn't effective against it, but the parasitic wasp is.  
The mealybug decimated crops in the West Indies in the early 1990s, 
but was controlled by the parasitic wasp which injects its larvae 
into the mealybugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed Wednesday that  
small insects found recently in El Centro and Calexico were, in 
fact, the pink hibiscus mealybug. The Southern California towns are 
within 15 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Imperial Valley is responsible for $1 billion in crops  
including lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, wheat, hay and feed corn and 
feed crops such as alfalfa, said Imperial County spokesman and 
former carrot farmer Rob Zimmer. The mealybug, however, wasn't 
found on agricultural crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The bug was found in urban areas on the ends of fruitless  
mulberry and fig trees, along with trumpet vines and grape vines, 
said Dick Weddle, county entomologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture experts were expecting the first pink hibiscus  
mealybug to turn up in Miami, Zimmer said. The pest is found in 
tropical areas including Grenada and Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``While its arrival in the continental U.S. has long been  
anticipated, it is too soon to tell how it will react in our 
climate zones,'' Imperial County spokesman Gary Redfern said. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire county is being tested to see whether there is an  
infestation, Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we need residents' help,'' he added. ``One little bug will  
be caught if 30,000 citizens are on the lookout.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Masked gunmen hijacked an armored car Friday  
and got away with as much as a half-million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards said they were approached by two men dressed in black

stuffed an estimated $300,000 to $500,000 into bags and fled. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether a guard or a robber drove the truck to  
the alley, Campos said.

<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 53rd and 54th homers  
Friday, pulling within three homers of Sammy Sosa's major 
league-leading total. 
</P>
<P>
	The second homer, a 434-foot shot to left-center off the  
Brewers' Scott Karl in the fifth inning, tied McGwire with Mel Ott 
for 14th place on the career list with 511. He now trails Ernie 
Banks and Eddie Mathews in 12th place by one. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a 3-2 pitch from Karl deep into the left-field  
bleachers in the first. His second homer scored Ray Lankford and 
put St. Louis up 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The first baseman has homered three times in three days after  
not hitting one since Aug. 24.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Swann May Be Back in 6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Standout defensive tackle Eric Swann, who  
hasn't played a football game since the middle of last season, 
hopes to be back in the Arizona Cardinals' lineup in 6-8 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a whole lot longer than the Cardinals were expecting just  
a few short weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann said his recovery from major surgery on his arthritic  
right knee is taking longer than initially expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking his long silence, Swann spoke on a conference call from  
his home on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When training camp began, the Cardinals hoped the two-time Pro  
Bowl performer would be ready for the Sept. 12 opener at 
Philadelphia. But as the days passed and he was not able to do much 
beyond riding a stationary bicycle and other rehabilitation 
exercises, it became obvious he would not be ready that soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not bothered by it,'' Swann said, ``because I have to be  
100 percent when I step back on the field, and that's a fact. I 
can't go out there half-ready or a quarter-ready, I've got to be 
100 percent. The surgery was a very aggressive surgery, and 
sometimes it takes longer than usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Swann's timetable is accurate, at the earliest he wouldn't be  
back until the Oct. 17 home game against Washington. Arizona has 
the following week off, then plays New England at home on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann went to San Francisco on Wednesday to be examined by Dr.  
Richard Steadman, the noted knee specialist who performed the 
surgery on Dec. 7. Tests conducted by Steadman showed the strength 
and flexibility of the knee increased from 50 percent to 80 percent 
of normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann played in seven games last season, then had surgery. The  
team expected him back in a few weeks, but he was dissatisfied with 
the results and went to Steadman, the Colorado-based doctor who 
performed major surgery on Olympic gold medalist skier Picabo 
Street and many other noted athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a smart decision on my behalf,'' he said. ``It's a  
personal decision and it's not against anybody else. Eric Swann has 
to take care of Eric Swann.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steadman performed an unusual ``microfacture'' surgery designed  
to help regenerate cartilage growth. Swann said he was in extreme 
pain, and his career would have been over if he tried to play the 
remainder of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to take the knee and just split it in half and  
look at it, there's a lot of wear and tear in the hard cartilage on 
the bones there,'' Swann said. ``There were a lot of bald spots 
there that were actually wearing out. There were nerves hitting 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a situation like that, it makes it very tender  
to walk around and very tender to get in the squatting position and 
play, because you've got a lot of grind. On top of that, you add 
300-plus or 600-plus pounds of guys double-teaming you and cutting 
you and you've got a pretty heavy, spicy, ouchy dish, if you know 
what I mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Swann said, ``if things stay on course and there aren't any  
terrible setbacks or anything and I don't rush it, I could play 
another five or six years easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann hadn't spoken to reporters about his condition since  
before last year's first surgery. In his brief conference call, he 
insisted he was not bothered by the criticism he received from fans 
and local sports talk show hosts who thought he should have played 
through the pain as the Cardinals made their postseason run. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an old saying that we use in football,'' he said.  
```When you're well, you're hell. When you're hurt, you're dirt.' 
I'm not really moved by what people say in their comments or 
anything like that. People have a right to their opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann refused to criticize the Cardinals organization.  
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, they've been pretty supportive,'' he said. ``Of  
course, they want you on the football field. That's what they hired 
me to do. When you're not out there, there's always that pressure 
to get back out there earlier. But overall, I would say I've been 
pretty satisfied with the support I've received from my club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said Wednesday's  
examination ``means he's going in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, since we've come back down to the valley, the heat's  
helped Eric's conditioning,'' Tobin said. ``He's continued to work 
at it, so I'm encouraged.''

<HEADLINE> Dennis Still Threatens N.C. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALVO, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis, which spoiled last  
weekend for vacationers on the North Carolina coast, threatened to 
wash out the last big beach weekend of summer, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said they expect the onetime hurricane to finally  
wade ashore on the state's curving southeastern coast on Sunday 
night, in the middle of the Labor Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacationers and residents alike were sick and tired of the  
11-day-old storm, whether it disrupted their summer break or 
wrecked their hopes for a money-making tourist-filled weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to go home,'' said Pete Wilcox, as he sat at a  
roadblock in Nags Head on Friday, trying to reach his home in 
Rodanthe, on Hatteras Island. ``I've been out of work a week and 
don't need that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A mandatory evacuation order was lifted on Friday for beachfront  
neighborhoods in Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills. 
Farther south, on Hatteras Island, where the raging surf chewed up 
the main north-south highway and choked it with chest-high beach 
sand, only four-wheel-drive traffic was permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	But by then, many of the hundreds of thousands of vacationers  
who each summer pack the Outer Banks, a 130-mile stretch of barrier 
islands, were long gone. About 130,000 people live on the coast, 
but during the summer that grows fivefold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally we would be full for all three days,'' said Nancy  
Newins, manager of Lucille's Motel in Carolina Beach, surveying 
bookings for fewer than half her rooms Friday. ``We're hoping the 
storm goes away and everybody sees it on the news and hurries 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, then-Hurricane Dennis sideswiped the coast without  
ever coming ashore, though it dumped up to 8 inches of rain and 
dished out 20-foot waves and 100 mph winds. Then it headed out to 
sea. But soon it began backtracking. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday night, the storm was about 175 miles south-southeast  
of Cape Hatteras and drifting with sustained winds around 60 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis could strengthen before coming ashore after midnight  
Sunday, Jack Beven, a hurricane specialist at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. But he warned that Dennis has confounded 
predictions before. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it has done since it got east of Hatteras is on the  
strange side,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, state Public Safety Secretary Richard Moore warned  
beachgoers: ``We have the prospect of having a lot of rain and wind 
in the state this weekend, or we may not have any at all. We just 
don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Concerns that Japan's central bank might step in to  
boost the dollar sent the currency higher against the yen today. 
Tokyo's key stock index closed slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.74 yen in late trading, up 0.32 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
109.11 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.26 points,  
or 0.01 percent, to close the day's trading at 17,629.99 points. On 
Thursday, the average closed down 171.23 points, or 0.96 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, market players were concerned the Bank of  
Japan may intervene in markets next Thursday following the release 
of Japanese gross domestic product data for the April-June quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ stepped in on June 10 to stop the yen's rise after  
better-than-expected GDP figures for the January-March quarter 
unleashed frenzied yen-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a possibility of so-called 'event intervention,'''  
said Shuji Takano from ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have repeatedly said a premature  
strengthening of the yen is undesirable amid sporadic signs that 
Japan is recovering from its worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen is seen as negative for Japan's economy because it  
makes the nation's exports more expensive, and therefore less 
competitive, overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments from Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's former vice finance  
minister for international affairs, also spurred the dollar's 
gains, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a U.S. television interview broadcast today on CNBC,  
Sakakibara, now an advisor to the Finance Ministry, said currency 
``intervention is always a strategic decision,'' which depends on 
market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts added that investors were waiting for the release of  
U.S. employment figures for August, due out in Washington later 
today, for a further signal about the direction of the high-flying 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded between 109.14 yen and 110.24 yen during  
Tokyo's trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 117.65 yen, up from  
115.86 late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei slipped in listless trading,  
with investors wary of taking new positions ahead of next week's 
release of several important economic indicators. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were anxious to see what direction the U.S. stock market  
would take after Labor Day, in addition to waiting for the 
announcement of Japan's gross domestic product data, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next Monday is a holiday in the U.S., so I don't expect any  
significant movement that day, but often when investors come back 
from the end of their summer holiday, the mood of the market 
changes sharply,'' said Garry Evans, a strategist at HSBC 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow closed 94.67 points lower at 10,843.23  
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners outnumbered advancers 659 to 513, while 163 issues  
were unchanged. An estimated 464.63 million shares changed hands on 
the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 603.03 
million shares the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up a marginal 0.01 points, insignificant in 
percentage terms, to 1,497.00. The TOPIX closed up 0.75 points, or 
0.05 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.8350 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8850 percent, driving 
its price up to 100.54 yen from 100.12 yen.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Asks Review of Twins Antitrust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Attorney General Mike Hatch today asked  
the U.S. Supreme Court to review a state Supreme Court decision 
that said the Minnesota Twins were exempt from antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organized baseball, unlike any other sport or industry, claims  
to have a complete and blanket exemption from antitrust laws,'' 
Hatch said in a statement. ``The state of Minnesota believes it has 
the right to look at professional baseball to see if they have 
violated antitrust laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court's ruling in April halted a state  
investigation into whether baseball officials conspired to get 
public money for a ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're surprised because it was a unanimous decision from the  
Minnesota Supreme Court,'' Twins president Jerry Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said neither the Twins nor major league baseball could  
be forced to comply with an investigation begun by former Attorney 
General Hubert Humphrey III and continued by Hatch. That 
investigation was launched when Twins owner Carl Pohlad was 
considering selling the team to a North Carolina businessman who 
wanted to move the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important to pursue the possibility that the independent  
owners of baseball may be threatening to boycott communities which 
do not increase public subsidies for ballparks,'' Hatch said in the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey had asked for papers going back to 1959 to determine  
whether baseball officials illegally conspired by threatening to 
move franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins and the league argued that their conduct was exempt  
from state and federal antitrust laws because the U.S. Supreme 
Court held in 1922 that professional baseball was not interstate 
commerce and was exempt. The state Supreme Court followed that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the sale and relocation of a baseball  
franchise ... is an integral part of the business of professional 
baseball and falls within the exemption,'' Justice Paul H. Anderson 
wrote in the Minnesota Supreme Court's unanimous decision in April. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote that the exemption ``may be an aberration'' carved out  
by the U.S. Supreme Court, but the nation's highest court should 
retain the exclusive privilege of overruling its own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey began the investigation in December 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	A Ramsey County judge last year ordered the team to comply with  
the investigation, but only as far back as 1992. The judge stayed 
the order while the Twins' appeal was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The order covered all documents related to revenue sharing,  
potential relocation and sale of major league baseball teams, and 
the construction and methods for obtaining new ballparks in 
Minnesota and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust baseball cases have sprung up around the country and  
state courts have been split on whether or not they allow 
investigations.

	East Timor Braces for Violence  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- East Timor voted overwhelmingly for  
independence from Indonesia, U.N. officials announced Saturday, and 
its people braced for a possible violent backlash from pro-Jakarta 
militias. The East Timorese capital was shut and quiet after the 
announcement of the results from Monday's historic vote, with 
scared residents hunkering down inside their homes. In the Mahkota 
Hotel, where many East Timorese were packed into the lobby, tears 
of joy and relief broke out when U.N. elections team chief Ian 
Martin read out the results in Portuguese and Indonesian.

	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- With a nudge from Secretary of  
State Madeleine Albright, Israel and the Palestinians concluded a 
long-sought agreement today for a further Israeli pullback from the 
West Bank. The deal clears the way for a possible overall peace 
accord within a year. The agreement, which will be signed tomorrow 
in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, plants the first 
seeds of a permanent peace by setting a Feb. 15 deadline to put 
together a framework for a final settlement.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States has invited the other  
permanent members of the Security Council to meet next week to try 
to narrow differences on a new policy toward Iraq. But China said 
today it had to confer with its leadership in Beijing. More than 
eight months after U.N. weapons inspectors pulled out of Iraq, the 
five permanent council members -- the United States, Britain, 
France, Russia and China -- remain split in two camps on future arms 
monitoring and on whether to suspend sanctions imposed after Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	Ecuador Teen-Ager Burned Alive  
</P>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) - A 15-year-old boy, accused of robbing  
houses and beating his mother, was burned alive by a mob in the 
public square of a remote village after a six-hour vigilante trial, 
authorities said Friday. The mob execution occurred Wednesday night 
in the village of La Chimba, a half-hour drive from the city of 
Cayambe, 31 miles northeast of the capital, Quito. Police said the 
boy, William Iguamba, was grabbed in Cayambe's central plaza by a 
crowd of about 50 people and brought to La Chimba, where he was 
chained to a post in the central square. There, about 600 Indians 
from four surrounding communities spent six hours deciding the 
boy's guilt, and ultimately burned him alive, police said.

international peacekeeping force in Bosnia, despite progress made 
toward stabilizing society and establishing peace. Solana said NATO 
defense ministers would likely discuss the future of the Bosnia 
force when they meet Sept. 21-22 in Toronto. ``We do not expect any 
serious drawdown because we do not think the situation is right,'' 
he told reporters after a meeting with Richard Holbrooke, the U.S.

decliners 2,290-677. The Nasdaq rose 108.34 to 2,842.58, according

Expos. Caminiti hit his seventh homer off Dan Smith (4-7) leading 
off the second and hit a two-run shot in the ninth. He added a

<HEADLINE> Stocks Surge Higher; Dow Up 212.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher today after the  
government's employment report showed the U.S. economy added jobs 
at a slower-than-expected pace and that wage growth moderated in 
August, helping to ease fears about rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 212.76 at 11,055.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also sharply higher. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 34.91 at 1,354.02, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was up 90.46 at 2,824.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose after the Labor Department reported that employers  
added 124,000 jobs to their payrolls in August and that average 
hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose just 0.2 
percent in August, a 3.5 percent increase compared with a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Both figures helped ease concerns that the economy is  
overheating and that inflation is rising, and they provided good 
news for investors who believe that any inflationary signs could 
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for a third time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has raised interest rates twice this summer and hinted  
it won't raise them again if the economy is moderating and 
inflation remains tame. Higher interest rates cut into corporate 
profits by raising the cost of borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices also rose on the employment report, pushing yields  
on 30-year Treasuries down to 6.01 percent from 6.13 percent late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has slipped recently as interest rate fears have  
been preying on investors,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice 
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``But the payroll data eased those 
rate fears and buyers stepped up to the plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, the most sensitive to interest rate changes,  
surged today. J.P. Morgan was up 7 1/16 at 133 and American Express 
was up 6 3/16 at 142 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also rallied. America Online rose 4 5/8 to 95 7/8,  
Intel rose 3 1/2 to 88 13/16 and Yahoo! rose 10 3/16 to 151 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple rose 3 3/16 to 73 3/4 as the company continued to benefit  
from the unveiling of a new desktop computer. 
</P>
<P>
	National Discount Brokers fell 5 1/2 to 25 3/4 after the company said  
earnings in its fiscal first quarter will be well below Wall Street 
estimates. The online brokerage cited higher-than-expected costs 
for advertising and write-offs for old technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest loser in the Dow was Coca-Cola, which fell 2 5/8 to 56 7/8  
after it warned third-quarter earnings will fall short of Wall 
Street forecasts because of weak beverage sales in Asia and South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 548.94 million 
shares, up from 546.93 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The good economic news prompted many investors to stay in the  
market on what was expected to be a quiet session ahead of the 
three-day holiday weekend. U.S. financial markets will be closed 
Monday in observance of Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.12 to 433.54.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks raced higher Friday after the  
government's employment report calmed fears about rising inflation 
and prompted a broad rally that included the biggest point gain in 
the history of the Nasdaq composite index. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 235.24 to close at  
11,078.45. The Dow ended an extremely volatile week with a loss of 
11.72, or just 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq rose 108.87 to 2,843.11, surpassing the previous high  
for a one-day point gain, 103.16, set on June 16. With Friday's 
gain, the index shot within sight of its record close of 2,864.48, 
set July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks soared after the Labor Department reported that employers  
added 124,000 jobs to their payrolls in August, fewer than most 
economists expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps more significantly, the report showed that average  
hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose just 0.2 
percent in August, a 3.5 percent increase compared with a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Both figures helped ease concerns that the economy is  
overheating and that inflation is rising, and they provided good 
news for investors who believe that any inflationary signs could 
prompt the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee to raise 
interest rates for a third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the only employment report published before the  
FOMC meeting on Oct. 5, and it does not represent a compelling 
case,'' for a rate increase, said Michael Moran, chief economist at 
Daiwa Securities America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has raised interest rates twice this summer and hinted  
it won't raise them again if the economy is moderating and 
inflation remains tame. Higher interest rates cut into corporate 
profits by raising the cost of borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices also rose on the employment report, pushing yields  
on 30-year Treasuries down to 6.01 percent from 6.13 percent late 
Thursday. That provided a strong boost to stocks, which tend to 
tumble when bond yields are rising and becoming an attractive 
investment alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has slipped recently as interest rate fears have  
been preying on investors,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice 
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``But the payroll data eased those

</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, the most sensitive to interest rate changes,  
surged higher. J.P. Morgan, up 7 7/8 to 133 13/16, and American 
Express, up 6 1/8 to 142, were the biggest gainers in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris rose 2 3/8 to 39 1/2 as a Florida appeals court ruled  
that damage claims in a landmark smoking case must be considered 
one smoker at a time, effectively removing the possibility of a 
single multibillion-dollar verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, which dominate the Nasdaq, also rallied.  
Microsoft rose 4 to 95 13/16, extending its robust gains of the 
past week. Yahoo! soared 13 7/16 to 155, and online auctioneer eBay 
jumped 12 9/16 to 134. 
</P>
<P>
	National Discount Brokers fell 5 1/2 to 25 3/4 after the company said  
earnings in its fiscal first quarter will be well below Wall Street 
estimates. The online brokerage cited higher-than-expected costs 
for advertising and write-offs for old technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest loser in the Dow was Coca-Cola, which fell 2 1/8 to 57 3/8  
after it warned third-quarter earnings will fall short of Wall 
Street forecasts because of weak beverage sales in Asia and South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 38.13 to 1,357.24, and the  
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.55 to 435.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-4 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Volume of all NYSE-listed shares 
totaled 801.02 million shares, compared with 813.09 million in the 
previous session.

	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.01 percent. The  
rally on Wall Street pulled most European indexes sharply higher, 
however, as Germany's DAX index gained 2.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 
100 gained 2.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 2.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bush Skips Gov.'s Border Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- When the governors of U.S.-Mexico  
border states gather for their annual conference this month, there 
will be one very conspicuous absence: Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be the only invited governor on either side of the  
border to skip the event. Last year, Bush was host to the gathering 
when it took place in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has cultivated warm trade and cultural relations with  
Mexico that for years have been the envy of other border states, 
particularly California. The front-running Republican presidential 
candidate has made his state's strong ties to Mexico part of his 
overtures to Hispanic voters. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the border governors convene Sept. 9 in Tijuana,  
Mexico, Bush will be addressing an anniversary celebration for a 
church in the Dallas area, said Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have gone, but he had already agreed to attend the  
event for his friend Tony Evans,'' Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Tony Evans is co-founder and pastor of Oak Cliff Bible  
Fellowship Church in Dallas and a prominent speaker in Promise 
Keepers, a national evangelical men's group. He and Bush are 
friends who sometimes pray together. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 9 celebration, marking both Evans' 50th birthday and  
the 30th anniversary of his ministry, is taking place so late that 
Bush won't be able to attend day two of the border conference 
either, Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17th annual border conference will focus on cross-border  
infrastructure, bolstering the image of the border region, 
protecting the environment and preparing for natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be a good time for them to come so we can  
expand all the relationships between the states, and fortify 
them,'' said Patricia Sahragui, a spokeswoman for Alejandro 
Gonzalez Alcocer, governor of the Mexican state of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
	But she understood Bush's decision. ``This event has been  
scheduled for a lot of months, but we can understand things that 
can be in their way, so they can't attend,'' Sahragui said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Bush decided not to appear at a national conference of  
minority journalists in Seattle, even though he already was in 
town. Stung by criticism from conference attendees and from the 
news media, he reversed himself and showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks later, he angered some Hispanics by declining to  
speak to the National Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy group. 
Bush was vacationing in Maine at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush has made several trips to Mexico to meet with its  
presidents, and on Friday, he appeared with President Ernesto 
Zedillo at the opening of a new bridge on the Texas-Mexico border. 
On Thursday he attended a Latin Business Association luncheon in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush absent, the other three U.S. governors will take on  
higher profiles. Gray Davis of California, Gary Johnson of New 
Mexico and Jane Hull of Arizona have said they will attend, joining 
six Mexican governors. 
</P>
<P>
	The gathering will have special significance for Davis, who has  
made a point of improving California-Mexico ties after the tenure 
of California Gov. Pete Wilson, whom many Mexicans distrusted for 
his attempts to halt illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	When Davis replaced Wilson this year, one of his first acts was  
travel to Mexico City and Monterrey, Mexico, to bolster trade, 
education and cultural links.

<HEADLINE> Reno: Court Can OK Starr Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday that a  
special court has authority to appoint a successor to Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr was appointed to investigate President Clinton, the first  
lady and their business associates under a law that expired June 
30. Reno said she believes the three-judge appeals court panel that 
selected independent counsels can nonetheless choose a prosecutor 
to continue his work. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr plans to leave before his office's work is finished,  
according to legal sources familiar with his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department official said that ``based on the reading  
of the statute it is believed that the rules that would apply for 
an (independent counsel) departing before the act expires are the 
same that would apply now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Reno declined to comment on whether the court  
could choose a successor, saying ``I think it better for the 
Department of Justice to address the issues as they arise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, however, the issue has been examined ``all the way  
to the top'' of the department, said the official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's successor could decide to revisit important questions --  
such as whether criminal charges are warranted against either of 
the Clintons. A successor also could decide to act as a mere 
caretaker in charge of closing down the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's successor also could stir up political trouble for the  
first lady, who is considering a run for the U.S. Senate from New 
York. One focus of Starr's investigation has been Mrs. Clinton's 
legal work on a 1,000-acre real estate project south of Little 
Rock, Ark., which federal regulators concluded was riddled with 
insider transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other people remain under investigation by Starr's office.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have been looking into whether a Maryland developer  
tried to obstruct the testimony of presidential accuser Kathleen 
Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also has been looking into whether presidential aides lied  
about a role by Hillary Rodham Clinton in firings at the White 
House travel office.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Wary on Impact of Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful  
Steve Forbes cautioned Friday that gambling ``does not create a 
backbone for a powerful economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina residents will vote this fall on whether they  
want to keep the video gambling industry in the state. Next year 
they will decide on a state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I oppose video gambling and I think that gets to the whole  
issue of gambling, which has become a national issue,'' Forbes said 
while campaigning in South Carolina, which holds the South's first 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``While people think the lottery is much less harmful than video  
gambling -- and they are right on that -- the thing to remember about 
gambling is it does not create a backbone for a powerful economy,'' 
Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some video gambling supporters want to use taxes and fees from  
the industry to cut car taxes. The plan for lottery revenues is to 
help fund education. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there is no guarantee any state will carry through on  
its promises, Forbes said. ``At the end of the day, what do you 
have? You have the government taking more,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential hopeful declined to wade into  
another state controversy -- whether the Confederate flag should be 
taken down from the South Carolina Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
has proposed an economic boycott of the state until the Confederate 
flag, which was raised above the Statehouse dome in 1962, is taken 
down. So far, the Legislature has refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a state issue to be determined by the people of South  
Carolina,'' Forbes said before attending a luncheon attended by 
about 150 people. Other candidates have also kept their distance 
from the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Flag supporters say it commemorates their Southern heritage and  
those who fought on the side of the South in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I shouldn't say this, but New Jersey was on the other  
side,'' said Forbes, who lives in that state. As for the boycott, 
he said, ``It's a free country and people can call for whatever 
they wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charleston businessman Claudius Watts, a former president of The  
Citadel military college, said he did not generally attend such 
political events, but attended a Forbes luncheon to see what the 
candidate had to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mr. Forbes has proven himself in the world of business  
and he certainly has a forward-looking perspective,'' Watts said. 
``Who knows what's going to happen as far as the nomination is 
concerned? It's early.''

Exchange hold a 5-1 lead over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 64 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index

<P>
	The financial markets are reacting favorably to the latest

</P>
<P>
	The August jobless rate was down a notch to 4.2 percent, even as

</P>
<P>
	Also, a wage-inflation gauge in the report showed no cause for

<HEADLINE> Art Schlichter Freed From Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLAINFIELD, Ind. (AP) -- Former NFL quarterback Art Schlichter  
left prison Friday, but more gambling-related problems could return 
him behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter, released after serving less than half of a four-year  
sentence for gambling convictions, faces new charges of illegal 
gambling stemming from accusations he used prison pay phones to bet 
on football and hockey games. He's due in court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter, who likely will plead innocent to the latest  
charges, is continuing his treatment for the gambling habit that 
has kept him in legal trouble since 1983, his lawyer, Randall 
Woodruff, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's any secret that Mr. Schlichter has had his  
problems in recent years,'' Woodruff said. ``He's been working 
through them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madison County authorities accuse Schlichter of placing wagers  
with a Las Vegas bookmaker last November from the Correctional 
Industrial Facility in Pendleton. He was transferred to another 
state prison in Plainfield after being charged last week, 
Department of Correction spokeswoman Pam Pattison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter was at home and unavailable for comment Friday,  
Woodruff said. He said Schlichter was living in Indiana, but would 
not be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter admitted to an Indiana State Police investigator that  
he ``had a relapse and needed help,'' according to a report 
published Aug. 26 in the Herald Bulletin of Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Rodney Cummings issued warrants last week on four  
misdemeanor counts of illegal gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter, who won early release by earning two college degrees  
behind bars through Ball State University, avoided transfer to the 
Madison County Jail by posting $5,000 bond, Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the four charges carries a maximum sentence of 180 days  
and a maximum $1,000 fine. If convicted, Schlichter could be 
ordered to serve consecutive sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Schlichter was sentenced to four years in state prison  
on charges of theft, forgery and fraud in connection with the theft 
of $800,000 to support his gambling habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Before beginning his Indiana prison term, Schlichter served a  
federal sentence in Kentucky for a probation violation. He 
surrendered to Indiana authorities Jan. 26, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter played at Ohio State from 1978-1981, leading the  
Buckeyes to two Big Ten championships. He was taken by the 
then-Baltimore Colts as the fourth player overall in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL suspended Schlichter for one year in 1983 when it was  
learned that bookies had threatened him over $150,000 in gambling 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter returned to the Colts, then relocated to  
Indianapolis, in 1984. He was released following the 1985 season.

<HEADLINE> Poll Predicts Defeat for Mrs. Gandhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Opinion polls published today predict  
Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv 
Gandhi, will lose her first bid for public office when elections 
start Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mrs. Gandhi loses from the Bellary parliamentary constituency  
in the southern state of Karnataka, it would be the election's 
biggest upset, as her Congress party has won every election in the 
district since India's independence five decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi is the president of the Congress party and its most  
likely choice for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	To help ensure her election, Mrs. Gandhi is also running from a  
second district, Amethi, in Uttar Pradesh state. Her husband, who 
was assassinated, had run from Amethi. That race had been seen as 
less secure than Bellary because the Congress party candidate 
selected by Mrs. Gandhi to run last year lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls published today in the Times of India and The Pioneer  
newspapers indicated that Mrs. Gandhi would lose in Bellary to 
Sushma Swaraj of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Times of India poll, Mrs. Swaraj was projected to win 61  
percent of the Bellary vote and Mrs. Gandhi 37 percent. It said 11 
percent of the voters were undecided. The poll was conducted from a 
sample of 642 voters in several districts of Bellary from Aug. 
27-29. The margin of error was 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pioneer poll showed Mrs. Swaraj winning by a slimmer margin,  
45 percent to Mrs. Gandhi's 40 percent, with 15 percent undecided. 
No margin of error was given for that poll, conducted Aug. 30-Sept. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	That survey, however, showed Mrs. Gandhi handily winning the  
Amethi seat with 59 percent of the vote against 21 percent her 
rival, Sanjay Singh, of Vajpayee's party. The poll of 14,850 people 
in 81 voting constituencies across 16 states had a margin of error 
of 2.5 percentage points, said the Research and Development 
Initiative, which conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting was to be held in Amethi a few days after it began in  
Bellary on Sunday, the first day of balloting in the monthlong, 
staggered elections for a new parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Swaraj's tactic of aggressively highlighting Mrs. Gandhi's  
foreign birth appears to be paying off. According to the Times of 
India poll, Mrs. Swaraj would win because 75 percent of the 
respondents felt Mrs. Gandhi was a foreigner despite her becoming 
an Indian citizen 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-nine percent of those polled felt Prime Minister Atal  
Bihari Vajpayee was better suited than Mrs. Gandhi for the top job. 
Of those who said they would vote for Mrs. Swaraj, 62 percent said 
they were inclined to do so because she speaks the local Kannada 
language.

<HEADLINE> Turbulence Injures 15 on Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ONTARIO, Calif. (AP) -- Rough turbulence injured 15 people and  
sent passengers flying out of their seats on a United Airlines 
shuttle flight to San Francisco, and another plane that lost a 
wheel landed safely here. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines Shuttle Flight 2036 had taken off from Los  
Angeles when it encountered the turbulence 24,000 feet above Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody went straight to the ceiling,'' passenger Ronald  
Kalio said. ``There was two stewardesses that spent the rest of the 
trip in the aisles. They were knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seat belt light was not on, United spokesman Joe Hopkins  
said. The Boeing 737 was carrying 107 passengers and five crew 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet continued to San Francisco International Airport and  
landed safely less than an hour after takeoff, the Federal Aviation 
Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the injuries involved sprains and cuts, United spokesman  
Matt Triaca said. Thirteen passengers and one flight attendant were 
treated at hospitals and released. Another flight attendant was 
kept overnight at a hospital with a head injury and was in stable 
condition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ontario, the Sacramento-bound Southwest Airlines jet lost a  
rear wheel on takeoff from Burbank and was forced to make an 
emergency landing at Ontario Airport using its five remaining 
wheels. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Flight 253 was carrying 132 people when it took off  
from Burbank, airline spokeswoman Carol Pearson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The left rear outside wheel fell off immediately and crashed  
into a baggage loading vehicle and a United Airlines jet parked at 
a nearby gate. That flight to Denver was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shortly after the aircraft lifted off, I noticed that there  
was one of the main wheels from the main landing gear rolling at a 
high rate of speed down the runway,'' said Mark Haryment, an 
airport operations manager at Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear when the pilots knew the wheel was missing but  
they were able to land safely 1 1/2 hours later about 45 miles 
southeast of Burbank, Pearson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Landing without one wheel, it was an exceptional landing,''  
said passenger Sandy Sarber. ``The pilots received a standing 
ovation. Well, a sitting ovation.''

<HEADLINE> Republic New York Corp. Unit Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Republic New York Corp.'s securities unit is  
being investigated by federal prosecutors and bank regulators who 
are trying to determine whether assets were inflated in an 
investment fund that catered to Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking and financial services business has suspended James  
E. Sweeney, chief executive of Republic New York Securities Corp., 
and replaced the management of its futures trading division. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried investors sent shares of Republic New York down $7.18 3/4,  
or more than 10 percent, to $62.18 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republic has advised the relevant U.S. regulatory and law  
enforcement authorities and ... is working in full cooperation with 
them,'' the bank said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	State banking regulators and the U.S. Attorney's office declined  
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Republic New York is in the process of being acquired by HSBC  
Holdings PLC of London for $10.3 billion. The investigation could, 
at the very least, delay the closing of the deal, according to 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republic New York would not name the client involved in  
the investigation, a person familiar with the investigation 
confirmed it is Princeton Global Management Co., a Princeton, N.J., 
investment fund popular with some large institutional investors in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese investors may have placed as much as $1 billion in  
Princeton Global Management, according to a report Thursday in The 
Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm's phone number is unlisted, and executives could not  
immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged errors were discovered in May by Japan's Financial  
Supervisory Agency, which searched the Tokyo offices of a Hong 
Kong-based brokerage called Cresvale International Ltd., which is 
an affiliate of Princeton Global Management, according to the 
person familiar with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Supervisory Agency then contacted Republic New  
York and asked for information about the business between Princeton 
Global Management and Republic New York Securities. Republic said 
that led it to investigate and to contact U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	FSA official Toshitake Kurosawa confirmed an investigation  
relating to a Republic client, but would not name the company under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are investigating the Japan branch of one of Republic's  
clients,'' he said. ``We are not investigating and do not intend to 
investigate Republic New York Securities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first run-in with regulators for Republic New  
York Securities or its CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Sweeney paid $25,000 to settle claims by the  
Securities and Exchange Commission that he violated ``soft dollar'' 
rules. Republic New York Securities paid $50,000 to settle related 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft dollar practices are arrangements under which stock  
brokerages provide investment managers free products or services, 
such as seminars and magazine subscriptions, and in exchange the 
investment manager funnels its trades to the stock brokerage.

<HEADLINE> CBS-TV To Team Clayson and Gumbel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS's glass slipper has been filled.  
</P>
<P>
	The network will announce Tuesday that it has hired ABC News  
correspondent Jane Clayson to be Bryant Gumbel's on-air partner on 
the ``Early Show,'' ending a summer-long search. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had hoped to name a co-anchor by mid-summer after persuading  
Gumbel to return to morning TV. The search so preoccupied CBS 
executives that it was jokingly dubbed ``Operation Glass Slipper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The revamped morning news show begins broadcasting in November.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Clayson, based in Los Angeles, is a reporter for ``World  
News Tonight'' and has worked at ABC since 1996. She was a reporter 
and anchor at a local station in Salt Lake City before then. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources confirming her selection spoke on condition of

<HEADLINE> Assets Ordered Frozen in Fraud Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A judge Friday ordered that the assets of  
businesses suspected of defrauding up to $125 million from 
investors remain frozen while investigators try to track down the 
missing money. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimate that up to 12,000 investors, mostly retirees  
and wealthy Latin American families, lost part or all of the 
investments made when they were sold unregistered mutual funds, 
federal investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis in Miami originally froze  
the assets of Cyprus Funds and three related companies on Aug. 27. 
Davis had also appointed Fort Lauderdale attorney Michael I. 
Goldberg as receiver in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis took that action when the U.S. Securities and Exchange  
Commission filed its lawsuit alleging that the Cyprus Funds 
advisers operated a scheme in which some investors were paid 
interest from money gathered from later investors, a scam normally 
called a Ponzi scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely troubling,'' Christian Bartholomew, lead  
attorney for the SEC, said Friday. ``It's a classic example of 
people taking advantage of the elderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg said he's already spoken with as many as 40 people who  
invested from $7,500 to $7 million each with Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC officials are still looking for Cyrprus Funds chief Eric  
Bartoli. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartoli has homes in Ohio and Florida, and allegedly sold shares  
of the mutual funds from the office of Cyprus Funds in Doylestown, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged scheme came to light in July when Cyprus Funds  
dividend checks were rejected or returned for insufficient funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis last month froze the assets of four Ohio residents:  
Bartoli, 45, of Marshallville, Ohio, and Miami, Fla.; James L. 
Binge, 52, of Massillon; Peter J. Esposito, 45, of Canfield; and 
Douglas R. Shisler, 52, of Doylestown. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus Funds have been sold in the United States since 1994. Of  
those in the SEC complaint, only Binge is licensed to sell 
securities in Ohio, said Dennis Ginty, spokesman for the Ohio 
Division of Securities.

<HEADLINE> Freinds Honor Fritz Shurmur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Family, friends and football fans have  
spent the past few days saying goodbye to former Green Bay Packers 
defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, who died this week after 
building a reputation for clever defenses and a kind heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a uniqueness to him,'' general manager Ron Wolf said of  
Shurmur, who was on the Packers' coaching staff from 1994 to 1998. 
``For Fritz, it was the love of the game and the respect for the 
people, not only those who played with him, but those that he 
played against. The game misses people like him. You don't replace 
people like that, but you do go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur, 67, died Monday at his home in Suamico, three months  
after he was diagnosed with esophageal and liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Gary Dantinne called Shurmur ``a person of faith'' at  
today's funeral. ``Maybe he's formulating God's new defense against 
evil,'' Dantinne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Packers coach Mike Holmgren attended today's service, as  
well as Ray Rhodes, who took over coaching duties in Green Bay 
after Holmgren left for the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to lose a friend, because Fritz was a friend to all  
of us,'' said former Packers defensive end Reggie White, who 
attended the service with his wife, Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
	LeRoy Butler, Santana Dotson and Gilbert Brown, all defensive  
players under Shurmur, helped carry his casket into the church 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur built tough defenses that led the Packers to two  
consecutive Super Bowls. He left the Packers for the Seattle 
Seahawks with Holmgren. However, the Shurmurs had built a home in 
Suamico and intended to retire there. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was to be a year or two of challenge, followed by a  
lifetime of fishing,'' said Scott Shurmur, of his father's position 
with the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lining the walls of the funeral home Wednesday were more than  
three dozen flower arrangements, from private well-wishers and 
former foes such as the San Francisco 49ers, Indianapolis Colts, 
Chicago Bears, Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Seahawks, the team that pulled Shurmur from Green  
Bay, sent flowers, too. From a cross-shaped arrangement hung a card 
from Mike and Kathy Holmgren, the former Packers coach and now the 
Seahawks coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers President Bob Harlan, offensive coordinator Sherman  
Lewis, quarterback Brett Favre and his wife, Deanna, and tight end 
Mark Chmura also attended.

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians resolved a dispute  
over the release of Palestinian prisoners, moving closer to signing 
a revised West Bank land-for-security deal, two senior Israeli 
officials said today. However, there is still disagreement on one 
clause in the emerging accord dealing with a prohibition on either 
side to take unilateral actions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Palestinian negotiators could not immediately be reached for 
comment. U.S. officials would only say it was possible to reach 
agreement.

election in the district since India's independence five decades 
ago. Mrs. Gandhi is the president of the Congress party and its 
most likely choice for prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Alomar Doing it All for Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- His offensive numbers are eye-catching, and his  
defense at second base has been second to none. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Alomar has been everything the Cleveland Indians could  
have hoped for. In fact, they've never had a player like him. 
</P>
<P>
	By getting his 100th RBI in the Indians' 6-5 win over the  
Anaheim Angels on Thursday night, Alomar became the first player in 
club history to drive in 100 runs, score 100, hit 20 homers and 
steal 30 bases in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	A contrived statistic to be sure, but nonetheless one that  
points out Alomar's all-around excellence in 1999, and why he could 
be the AL's MVP this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is real special,'' Alomar said of RBI No. 100, already  
six more than his previous career best in 12 big-league seasons. 
``I never thought I would get there. I feel good about that, but as 
far as I'm concerned, the year is not over until we get to the 
World Series and win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been 51 years since the Indians last won the Series, and  
despite a rash of injuries to key players all season, they're in 
position to make another run. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, which began a four-game series at Baltimore on Friday  
night, will likely clinch a fifth straight AL Central crown in the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, the Indians were expected to win baseball's weakest  
division, especially after signing Alomar as a free agent last 
November. But the 10-time All-Star has been even better than 
advertised, finally filling the biggest hole -- the club used 18 
different second baseman since 1996 -- in Cleveland's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was Robbie's 100th RBI?,'' Richie Sexson said  
incredulously after Thursday's game. ``For a second baseman, that's 
pretty unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unbelievable. That word has been used frequently this season to  
describe Alomar, who seems to make a sparkling defensive play every 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	During the series against the Angels, he made two plays that  
rank among his season's best. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night he made a diving backhanded stop on the edge  
of the grass in short right-center, and from a sitting position 
threw out Jim Edmonds at first. The previous night, he went far to 
his left, again made a diving grab, and from his belly, shoveled 
the ball backhanded in time to first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always take great pride in my defense,'' said Alomar. ``You  
can win a lot of games hitting, but you can win more with 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensively, Alomar has flourished batting third in the Indians'  
lineup behind Kenny Lofton and Omar Vizquel, and in front of Manny 
Ramirez, the majors' RBI leader. 
</P>
<P>
	His 22nd homer Thursday night matched his career-high set in  
1996 with Baltimore, and gave him the Indians' club record for 
homers by a switch-hitter in a season, passing Carlos Baerga and 
Eddie Murray, who each hit 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, completely healed after assorted injury problems the  
past two years, is currently among the league leaders in average 
(.330), RBIs (100), steals (32), on-base percentage (.429) and 
walks (84). He leads the league in runs (117), and would have to be 
among the top five candidates for MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would mean a lot,'' he said. ``But that's not something I'm  
shooting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar joined the Indians so he could be reunited with his  
brother, Sandy, the Indians' catcher who has spent most of the 
season on the disabled list following knee surgery and is getting 
closer to a return. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win a World Series would top it all, 100 RBIs, MVP, all of  
it,'' he said. ``That's what I'm shooting for.''

<HEADLINE> West's Biggest Blaze Rages in Calif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- They've come from all over the  
country to carve miles of firebreaks around the largest wildfire in 
the West, a gritty job of hacking and shoveling that can be undone 
by a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
	By day, they shovel dirt and chop away at smoldering tree  
trunks, pausing to pick soot from their teeth and wipe sweat from 
their brows. At night, they wait in long lines for food, then crawl 
into sleeping bags and shiver in 30-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday more than 2,700 firefighters aided by planes,  
helicopters and bulldozers were battling the 61,770-acre Willow 
fire in the San Bernardino Mountains. The blaze, which started Aug. 
28, was one of seven large fires in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Most other fires in the West were contained.  
</P>
<P>
	Big Bear Lake and the other popular resorts 90 miles east of Los  
Angeles were depending on the firefighters to keep flames away 
through the lucrative Labor Day Weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke disappeared from the horizon of tall peaks during the  
morning, lifting spirits. But by afternoon wind swept smoke into 
Big Bear and people covered their faces with bandanas to protect 
against ash. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials said the lines were holding, however.  
</P>
<P>
	The day began with 43 miles of fireline already cut -- and 27  
miles to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The dirty work was being done by firefighters like Brent Smyth,  
21. He hoisted a backpack onto his shoulders and placed a 
soot-smeared yellow helmet atop his reddish-brown hair as he headed 
into the dark, smoky forest Thursday night for an overnight shift 
that would last more than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of outdoor enthusiasts are drawn to this type of work,''  
said Smyth, part of a 20-member Alpine Hot Shot crew from Colorado 
Springs, Colo., that has been fighting fires around the country 
since April. ``You have to love camping in the woods and hiking all 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ground crews do their work ahead of the wildfire, clearing areas  
with bulldozers or by hand and burning off the adjacent vegetation. 
If the wildfire crosses the line, the crew has to start all over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fire gets the old adrenaline going,'' said Mike Witte, 38, a  
Bureau of Land Management bulldozer operator from Medford, Ore. 
``You get done with the day and you feel like you've done 
something, like you've accomplished something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighting costs for the Willow blaze have topped $6 million.  
Nine firefighters have been injured.

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Transfers 109 Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- New Mexico transferred 109 inmates to a  
super-maximum-security prison in Virginia on Friday after a guard 
was stabbed to death in an uprising at a privately run prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Wallens Ridge Correctional Facility, a state prison in  
Big Stone Gap, Va., was chosen because it is designed to hold the 
most dangerous of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the history and destructive nature of these inmates, I  
think it's important to send them a message that if you mess with 
the bull, you're going to get the horns,'' said Rob Perry, New 
Mexico's corrections secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates were transferred from the medium-security Guadalupe  
County Correctional Facility, where prisoners angry about a 
lockdown took over common living areas for three hours Tuesday 
before authorities regained control. A guard was fatally stabbed 
and an inmate was stabbed and wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners believed to have taken part in killing the guard  
were sent to a maximum-security area of a state prison in New 
Mexico. Others believed to have taken part in the uprising were 
transferred to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guadalupe County prison is operated by Florida-based  
Wackenhut Corrections Corp. Perry said the transfer also was a 
warning to Wackenhut to improve its management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important to send a message to all of the parties  
involved,'' he said. ``The state of New Mexico's not going to 
tolerate prison violence, homicide and riots, and this is the 
response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four inmates and a guard have died in Wackenhut-run prisons in  
New Mexico in the past nine months. In addition, two guards were 
injured in a disturbance Aug. 17 at a prison run by Corrections 
Corporation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Wackenhut spokesman Pat Cannan said company officials are  
``concentrating our efforts to bringing the situation under 
control'' at their two New Mexico prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	The four inmate killings are more than all of New Mexico's  
state-run prisons have had in any single year since 1985. The 
killing of the guard was the first in New Mexico since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico houses about a third of its nearly 5,200 male inmates  
at privately operated prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is paying Virginia $64 a day to house each of the  
transferred inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	They were taken in three buses and three vans to Kirtland Air  
Force Base at Albuquerque, where they were put aboard a U.S. 
Marshals Service jet designed to transport inmates. The prisoners 
shouted as they left the buses, but the din of jet engines drowned 
out their words. 
</P>
<P>
	After the inmates arrived in Virginia, vans taking them to their  
new prison were involved in a minor accident on a mountainous 
two-lane road. No one was injured and no one escaped.

<HEADLINE> Webster Pleads in Prescription Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER, Pa. (AP) -- NFL Hall of Fame center Mike Webster was  
sentenced to five years' probation Friday after pleading no contest 
to illegally obtaining the prescription drug Ritalin. 
</P>
<P>
	The 46-year-old Webster, who won four Super Bowls with the  
Pittsburgh Steelers, must pay court costs and remain in a treatment 
program under the decision handled down by Judge Joseph Walko in 
Beaver County Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster was accused in February of forging prescriptions to buy  
Ritalin. He could have faced a maximum 15-year prison sentence and 
$250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster has said he suffers from severe brain damage, and his  
doctors have reported he has a cognitive dysfunction that affects 
the mental process and impairs judgment. Ritalin, a stimulant, can 
help control the condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said the blows Webster took on the football field  
might have contributed to the condition.

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttles Virtually Grounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle flights are off until  
at least mid-October because of a startling amount of damaged 
wiring discovered throughout the fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	An exposed wire caused a short circuit that knocked out two  
engine computers during the launch of the shuttle Columbia in July. 
Similar flaws later were uncovered elsewhere on Columbia and in the 
wiring on Endeavour and Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a serious situation,'' shuttle program manager Ron  
Dittemore said Thursday. ``We are not going to fly again until we 
understand what we have and get it fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of late this week, technicians had discovered 38 spots with  
exposed wiring in Endeavour and 26 in Discovery, and even more 
places where the wires need to be reinforced with tubes and Teflon 
wrapping ``to bulletproof it the best we can,'' Dittemore said. 
</P>
<P>
	A quick check of Atlantis turned up one suspect wire.  
</P>
<P>
	Endeavour should have gone up in mid-September with radar  
equipment to map Earth's surface, Discovery in mid-October with 
crucial replacement parts for the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	The delays are making this the leanest year for shuttle launches  
since 1988, when flights resumed following the Challenger disaster. 
With only two more launches scheduled by year's end, there could be 
just four in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began July 23, when a short circuit five seconds  
into Columbia's launch knocked out computers for two of the 
shuttle's three main engines. Because each engine has two computers 
and only one is needed, Columbia made it to orbit with five 
astronauts and the powerful Chandra X-ray Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	It was believed to be the first time in 95 shuttle missions that  
a short circuit occurred during liftoff, by far the most dangerous 
part of the flight. If an engine had shut down, the shuttle would 
have had to attempt an unprecedented emergency landing in Florida 
or in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Columbia was still in the atmosphere -- and not in the  
vacuum of space -- when the short happened in the cargo bay, sparks 
could have ignited. 
</P>
<P>
	But shuttle circuit breakers are much more sensitive than those  
in a home or even on a plane; they immediately pop when a short 
occurs, halting the flow of electricity. That's what happened 
aboard Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-second short was caused by an exposed wire that had  
lost its insulation in one spot, allowing the wire to come in 
contact with a rough screw. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers evidently had stepped on the wire or brushed a tool or  
work platform against it. It's possible the damage was there since 
Columbia's first flight in 1981; the wiring is original. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, NASA thought the exposed wire in its oldest shuttle  
was unique and perhaps the result of age. But technicians found 
another flawed wire on the opposite side of the cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
	As a precaution, NASA ordered inspections of the wiring in its  
three other shuttles. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspections will take at least another few weeks. Each  
shuttle has 200 miles of wiring; half of it is being checked, the 
half where workers are most likely to have damaged it. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has yet to decide which mission will go first once flights  
resume. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've told the folks that I don't want you worrying about  
launch dates,'' Dittemore said. ``I want your heads down in the 
foxhole fixing these wires.''

<HEADLINE> Quayle Shifts His Focus to N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle, seeking to  
revive his stuttering presidential campaign, is pulling significant 
staff and resources out of Iowa and other states to narrow his 
focus to the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	With his campaign locked in the single digits, Quayle also will  
work to sharpen his political message for the fall by drawing 
starker contrasts to Republican presidential front-runner George W. 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaign has been quite boring frankly,'' said the former  
vice president, who will retain a minimal presence in Iowa. ``We're 
going to turn the temperature up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks provided the first clue to Quayle's plans for  
rebounding from an embarrassing eighth-place finish in last month's 
non-binding Iowa straw poll. Almost immediately, Republican 
strategists predicted Quayle's donations would dry up and force his 
departure from the race. His South Carolina team bolted for another 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle vowed to tough it out.  
</P>
<P>
	Seeking an opportunity to prove his political viability, the  
former vice president has determined that New Hampshire was the 
best place to rejuvenate his campaign. The state seems the best fit 
for his massive tax-cut plan, aides said, and is perhaps more 
willing than Iowa to give an underdog candidate a second look. 
</P>
<P>
	``In New Hampshire, they take their responsibility seriously. It  
has that one-on-one character,'' Quayle said in a telephone 
interview with The Associated Press this week. ``They have a 
different view. It's a smaller state than Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also is the home of former Gov. John Sununu, a cochairman of  
the Quayle campaign. The former White House chief of staff has 
urged Quayle to ignore doomsayers and stay in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle will spend part of Labor Day weekend campaigning in New  
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys of the state's voters show Quayle with only minimal  
support. A poll by Franklin Pierce College and WNDS-TV said Quayle 
was supported by 4 percent of Republicans. The poll, taken Sunday 
through Wednesday, had a margin of error of 6 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle spokesman Jonathan Baron provided no details about how  
much money or number of staff will shift to New Hampshire, saying 
the magnitude of the changes has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaign is in the process of making important decisions  
about how to reorganize, restructure and reallocate our 
resources,'' Baron said. ``There will be additional staff and 
resources sent to New Hampshire -- from everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John McCain, who is in a much stronger political position than  
Quayle, has decided to bypass the Iowa caucuses for New Hampshire, 
where he expects to find a more receptive audience. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush raising records amounts of money, his rivals are  
frequently cutting back their spending plans. Lamar Alexander moved 
his entire operation to Iowa in failed effort to save his campaign. 
The former vice president has slimmed down his operation once 
already this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's final Iowa strategy is up in the air, pending a review  
of his options later in the fall after seeing whether a new tact in 
New Hampshire pays off, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he has any intention of turning off the lights  
here,'' said David Hudson, Quayle's Iowa campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how long the focus will remain on New Hampshire, Baron  
said: ``That depends on what we see in September and October'' from 
polls, fund-raising efforts and media coverage, Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't mean we're not going to continue in Iowa. We're  
just focusing on New Hampshire as we make additional decisions on 
the fall strategy and make additional announcements,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Iowa results were not surprising because Quayle  
spent just $50,000 on the pay-to-vote event -- saving his cash for 
the fall strategy beginning to take shape now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in Iowa, we  
would not have the flexibility to make the decisions we are now,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On his message, Quayle plans to narrow the list of issues he  
discusses to a handful that draw natural contrasts to Bush. The 
decisions are still being made, but aides said his plan to reduce 
federal taxes by 30 percent and his experience in foreign policy 
are likely candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle promised a battle.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make it exciting,'' he said. ``My base is  
excited. They want a fight. They want a discussion.''

<HEADLINE> Boat Captain Sentenced to 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A Bahamian boat captain was  
sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for a smuggling operation in 
which two Haitian passengers drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	Addison Joseph Hepburn was found guilty in May of smuggling and  
smuggling for profit resulting in the death of an alien. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, Hepburn dropped 33 illegal Haitian immigrants  
from his boat onto a sandbar about 120 feet off Jupiter Inlet. Some 
swam to shore, but a man and a woman died. The rest were rescued by 
the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence handed down by U.S. District Court Judge William  
Dimitrouleas was the heaviest allowed by federal sentencing 
guidelines, said prosecutor Neil Karadbil. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepburn, 45, maintained that he had been hired for $500 to take  
what he believed were legal Haitian immigrants to the United 
States. Survivors testified they paid up to $1,500 each for the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers recovered the bodies of Anne Benette Dorsonne, 25, of  
Port-au-Prince, and Richard Presendieu, who left a wife and four 
children in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents found Hepburn later that day, sleeping in his  
broken-down boat anchored about a mile south of the inlet. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors acquitted Hepburn in the death of Presendieu, because  
prosecutors were unable to prove he was on the smuggling trip, said 
Randee Golder, Hepburn's attorney.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Names Distribution Exec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com on Friday named a new executive to  
oversee its ambitious plan to expand its shipping and distribution 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based Internet merchant named Jeffrey Wilke as its  
head of logistics. He replaces Jimmy Wright, a former operations 
expert at Wal-Mart who plans to return to retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilke comes to Amazon.com from Allied Signal, where he was in  
charge of the company's pharmaceutical fine chemicals unit. He was 
directly responsible for 15 plants/distribution centers in the 
United States, Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Amazon.com plans to add three million square feet of  
warehouse space. Its goal is to expand its distribution network so 
it can stock more goods and get them to customers faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilke's appointment comes right before the holiday shopping  
season. The company hopes he will be able to work out any kinks in 
its distribution before the Christmas crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on track to deliver our commitments this year,'' said  
Joe Galli, president and chief operating officer at Amazon.com. 
``But we have said from the beginning that there are some startup 
risks ... and some situations we have to smooth out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilke formerly worked in the information technology group at  
Andersen Consulting. He is a graduate of Princeton University and 
did his graduate studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright came out of retirement to join Amazon.con in July 1998.

<HEADLINE> Reno Denies Rift With FBI Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno denied that the  
escalating Waco controversy has strained her relations with FBI 
Director Louis Freeh. Even so, she said Friday that she is looking 
outside the FBI and Justice Department to find ``the perfect 
person'' to head an inquiry into the government's 1993 standoff 
with the Branch Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after Reno acknowledged that her credibility was damaged  
by the belated FBI admission that incendiary tear gas canisters 
were used in the waning hours of the Texas siege, and with new 
tensions simmering over the FBI's release this week of previously 
undisclosed evidence, she insisted her relationship with Freeh 
remains good. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any situation where you have got to conduct criminal  
justice investigations and handle matters in the fish bowl that we 
exist in here in Washington, it is oftentimes difficult. But I have 
a relationship with Louis Freeh and with the people around him that 
I think is excellent,'' Reno said at her weekly news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we seek the truth, it's very important that people don't  
play one off against another,'' she said later. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she will appoint a person who ``has no conflicts (and)  
would be well received'' to head an independent investigation into 
why it took the FBI six years to acknowledge its use of the 
incendiary tear-gas canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	While she and senior Justice officials would not identify  
leading candidates, speculation focused on a former Republican 
senator with solid Washington credentials: John Danforth of 
Missouri. A fellow Republican, former New Hampshire Sen. Warren 
Rudman, also was rumored to rank high on a list of candidates. 
Neither returned calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been eager to identify the appropriate outside  
investigator, and I hope to name that person shortly,'' Reno said, 
adding that she is proceeding carefully because she wants to assure 
that the investigation ``has the confidence and faith of the 
American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what qualities she was looking for, Reno said: ``The  
perfect person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decisions on the scope of the inquiry, and which agencies will  
provide investigative resources, will flow from the appointment of 
an outside investigator, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, Freeh and members of Congress have urged an  
independent inquiry. A White House spokesman said President Clinton 
was ``deeply concerned that the attorney general appears to have 
been misled and may have been lied to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional committees are readying their own hearings for the  
fall, with the House Government Reform Committee already issuing 
subpoenas. And the Senate Judiciary Committee's chairman, Sen. 
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, wrote to Reno on Friday seeking documents and 
other information regarding use of the incendiary tear gas, and 
setting a Sept. 10 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	In Waco, U.S. District Judge Walter Smith ordered the government  
Thursday to surrender all evidence on the siege or be cited for 
contempt of court. Smith is scheduled next month to start hearing a 
wrongful death lawsuit filed by surviving members of the Davidian 
sect and relatives of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
	Cult leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during a  
fire that broke out after noon on April 19, 1993, at the end of a 
51-day standoff with the FBI. The siege began Feb. 28, 1993, with a 
deadly shootout as federal agents tried to arrest Koresh on weapons 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice and the FBI have been roundly criticized since the FBI's  
disclosure last week that a ``very limited number'' of military 
tear gas rounds were fired hours earlier at a concrete outpost 
adjacent to the Davidians' wooden compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's about-face came after six years of denials that  
incendiary gas containers, expressly prohibited by Reno, were used. 
That revelation was followed by discovery of aerial infrared 
videotapes spanning the first hours of the early-morning assault. 
The FBI, in sworn affidavits, had previously insisted that no 
infrared videotape existed prior to 10:42 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon learning of the tapes' existence, Reno dispatched federal  
marshals Wednesday to take custody of the evidence unearthed in the 
offices of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team in Quantico, Va. The HRT 
was in charge of operations during the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno denied that Justice's use of marshals to confiscate the  
evidence marked a public rebuke to the FBI, which some of her aides 
have contended. ``I think it was everyone trying to figure out what 
the best way to do it was, and some people making some assumptions 
that weren't correct,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The video released Thursday, which runs from the assault's 6  
a.m. start to 8 a.m., captured a radio transmission in which an FBI 
field commander granted permission for an agent to fire military 
tear-gas rounds at the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	A second tape, released Friday, runs from 7:57 a.m. to just  
before 9:30 a.m. and includes transmissions of agents saying the 
incendiary military canisters fired from a Bradley fighting vehicle 
didn't get into the bunker. ``The military gas did not penetrate 
that bunker. ... It bounced off,'' a male voice says at 8:08 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	While confirming that she had ordered agents not to use  
incendiary devices during the operation, Reno said all evidence she 
has seen supports the view that federal agents did not start the 
fire, which began at 12:07 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``The larger issue here is: The facts that we know now indicate  
that the FBI did not set that fire,'' Reno said. ``That fire was 
set by David Koresh and the people in that building.''

<HEADLINE> Second Russian Bank Employee Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A second Bank of New York employee has been  
dismissed amid an investigation into whether the Russian mob and 
others laundered billions of dollars using the bank's accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A source familiar with the matter said Thursday that Svetlana  
Kudryavtsev, an associate in the bank's Eastern European division, 
was fired for failing to cooperate with an internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A bank spokesman confirmed Ms. Kudryavtsev had been fired, but  
did not provide a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, the bank fired Lucy Edwards, a London-based vice  
president, for gross misconduct, violation of the bank's internal 
policies, falsification of bank records and failure to cooperate 
with the bank's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities are looking into allegations that up  
to $10 billion was laundered through the bank's accounts by Russian 
organized crime and other figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank had earlier suspended Ms. Edwards along with another  
executive, Natasha Kagalovsky, who supervised the bank's business 
in Eastern Europe from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kagalovsky has denied any wrongdoing. So far, no criminal  
charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Troubled that its name has been associated with the scandal,  
bank chairman Thomas A. Renyi on Monday sent a memo to employees 
defending the institution's reputation and promising ``prompt 
action'' if any inappropriate action by bank staff was discovered.

<HEADLINE> Workers Become More Demanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- This Labor Day, thousands of workers will mark  
the holiday either on strike or thinking about walking a picket 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor experts say despite agreements like the contract reached  
between Boeing and its machinists earlier this week, unions are 
growing more aggressive and more willing to walk out. Nine straight 
years of economic growth, a string of high-profile strikes, and a 
chance to win back concessions from past contracts have put 
pressure on negotiators to bring back good deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can be an example to the labor movement,'' Bill Johnson,  
president of Aerospace Machinists Industrial District Lodge 751 in 
Seattle, said Wednesday after his union approved the Boeing 
contract. ``You can take on a major corporation and be 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing machinists had struck twice during the previous three  
negotiations, including a 69-day walkout in 1995, and appeared to 
be ready to walk out this year. Instead, about 61 percent of the 
44,000-member union voted to approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract offers two annual wage increases of 4 percent and a  
third-year 3 percent raise, as well as a 10 percent signing bonus 
worth $4,400 to the average machinist. In addition, Boeing dropped 
demands for a seven-day work week and more worker contributions to 
health-insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Feuille, head of the University of Illinois' Institute for  
Labor and Industrial Relations, said the Boeing contract was an 
example of unions taking advantage of the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employers are having a hard time finding enough employees, so  
this is an opportune time to push up wages in the trenches,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But other recent contracts agreed to by union leaders have been  
rejected by members who want better deals. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,100 of 11,000 flight attendants at the St. Paul,  
Minn.-based Northwest Airlines Corp. voted last week to reject a 
proposal that would have raised their average pay by 14 percent. 
And this week, about 9,200 teachers for Detroit public schools went 
on strike, rejecting their leader's request for a contract 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	One Northwest flight attendant who campaigned against the  
contract said his colleagues wanted to break a pattern of 
concessions to the company. Attendants took pay cuts for three 
years beginning in 1993 to help keep Northwest out of bankruptcy, 
and wages are now only 3 percent higher than before the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``All kinds of things have evolved to make this a position we've  
never been in before,'' said Andy Damis of Seattle. ``We've got a 
tight job market and the pilots went on strike last year, so we 
think Northwest is really reluctant to go through that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strike last fall by 6,200 Northwest pilots was part of an  
overall increase in work stoppages, including strikes and lockouts. 
The U.S. Department of Labor said there were 34 major stoppages, 
each involving 1,000 workers or more, that affected 387,000 workers 
last year. That's up from 29 major strikes in 1997 that idled 
339,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The work force can look back at a time where they gave  
concessions or took profit sharing,'' said John Revitte, a 
professor at the Michigan State University School of Labor and 
Industrial Relations. ``Meanwhile, in the last couple of years 
they've seen incredible CEO compensation packages and mergers. In 
some of those instances, the work force says it's our turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear how such concerns might affect negotiations  
between the United Auto Workers and U.S. automakers that cover 
407,000 workers. The contract between the UAW and General Motors 
Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG expires Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which has released no information about the progress  
of the talks, hasn't held a national strike during negotiations 
since 1976. It has used plant-level strikes as a bargaining tool, 
though, the last in 1996 against GM during the last national 
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Feuille said labor actions now are much less frequent than  
in the 1950s, '60s and '70s, where no year had fewer than 200 major 
work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be a few situations where unions are willing to  
strike more than in the last 10 years,'' he said. ``But unions have 
realized the strike is a weapon that can play more into the 
employer's hands.''

<HEADLINE> Panthers Re-Sign Four Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Center Viktor Kozlov and defenseman Bret Hedican  
were among four players who have signed new contracts with the 
Florida Panthers, the NHL team announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also signing were defensemen Jaroslav Spacek and Filip Kuba.  
</P>
<P>
	Details of the contracts were not disclosed. However, Kozlov and  
Hedican both signed for three more years, while Spacek got a 
two-year deal and Kuba signed for one, said Panthers general 
manager Bryan Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	Kozlov, 24, scored had 16 goals and 35 assists for 51 points in  
65 games last season to tie him for second in scoring on the team. 
The 6-foot-5, 232- pound native of Toglitti, Russia, led the 
Panthers with 209 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedican, 29, is an eight-year NHL veteran who last season scored  
23 points on five goals and 18 assists with Vancouver and Florida. 
He was traded to Florida last January in a deal that also brought 
Pavel Bure and Brad Ference and a draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Spacek, 25, last year completed his first NHL season with the  
Panthers, scoring 15 points on three goals and 12 assists in 63 
games. The 5-foot-11, 195-pound defenseman is from Rokycany in the 
Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuba, 22, also from the Czech Republic, last season played in 45  
games with the Kentucky Thoroughbreds of the American Hockey 
League, before joining Florida. He played in five games with the 
Panthers, posting an assist.

<HEADLINE> Politics 2000 Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton for president in 2000?  
</P>
<P>
	Nah. But a filing with the Federal Election Commission is  
pumping life into the persistent rumor that she has her eye on a 
prize bigger than the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative group Judicial Watch is trumpeting the fact  
that FEC records list Mrs. Clinton as a candidate for both the 
Senate and for president. 
</P>
<P>
	They show that in January a committee called People for American  
Leadership filed a statement of organization in support of a bid by 
Mrs. Clinton for president. But the committee, formed by Thomas B. 
McMullen Jr., of Washington, D.C., folded in June without reporting 
any activity, said FEC spokeswoman Sharon Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	McMullen did not return a telephone call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The committee's filing also lists a Web site,  
www.hillary4president.org, that describes itself as grass-roots 
call to candidacy for Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The site also says the movement to draft Mrs. Clinton began in  
July 1998 at the 150th anniversary of the women's rights convention 
in Seneca Falls, N.Y., which the first lady addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is considering a run for the seat being vacated by  
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for her exploratory campaign  
committee, brushed aside speculation that Mrs. Clinton was 
interested in her husband's job. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only office that Hillary Clinton is interested in is the  
United States Senate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley on Friday filed forms  
with the Federal Election Commission that will allow his 
presidential campaign to receive matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates must file papers naming their campaign contributors  
and the amounts they donated so the FEC can determine which are 
eligible for matching federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has requested more than $1.5 million from the FEC based  
on donations from 7,168 supporters from the beginning of the year 
through April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	If the FEC deems each donation matchable, Bradley's campaign  
will receive the amount requested. He already has qualified for 
federal matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is the first Democratic candidate to submit donor  
information to the FEC. Several Republican candidates already have 
requested matching funds.

<HEADLINE> HUD Finds Home for Kidney Donor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman who gave a kidney to her 7-year-old  
neighbor may never have to spend another night in a homeless 
shelter, thanks to an outpouring of support after people learned of 
her plight. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a heroine who should be treated decently,'' Housing  
and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said of Marian Neal. 
She is to get the keys today to a recently renovated one-bedroom 
townhouse in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal, 40, has been living in a shelter since Tuesday after  
housing officials in suburban Alexandria, Va., said she was 
breaking the rules by living in a friend's public housing unit and 
ordered her to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	It was while living with her friend that Neal got to know her  
7-year-old neighbor, Terrance Varner, and his grandmother, Elaine 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrance has only one kidney and has suffered from renal failure  
since birth. It wasn't long after they met that Neal began taking 
him for dialysis treatments three times a week so his grandmother 
would not have to miss work. 
</P>
<P>
	They soon became best friends and last year Neal offered one of  
her own kidneys to Terrance. A successful transplant was done in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to work herself because of a spinal condition and denied  
disability benefits, Neal has been living on $340 a month in food 
stamps and general relief. 
</P>
<P>
	She will have to sign a one-year, renewable lease on the  
townhouse and pay rent based on her income, which Neal said makes 
the home affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy and thankful for the opportunity to be able to  
have so many people look out and help me,'' Neal said. ``I just 
feel blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neal also has received $5,000 in contributions that she intends  
to put into a mutual fund and a used 1986 Oldsmobile. 
</P>
<P>
	With the car, she still can see Terrance three times a week. And  
she talked Thursday of even having the youth occasionally come over 
and spend the night with her -- when grandmother allows.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Atlanta Killings Caught </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- A man arrested after being wounded in a  
shootout with police turned out to be the same man suspected in a 
triple shooting outside Atlanta that left two women dead, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Pierce, 21, is accused in the Aug. 26 shooting of his  
former girlfriend and her two friends who were in the Atlanta area 
attending college. The two friends died. The ex-girlfriend, shot in 
the mouth, survived and identified Pierce as the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce had attended high school with the women in Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was known to our officers. Our officers have been on the  
lookout,'' said Brookline Police Chief Daniel O'Leary. ``We were 
concerned that he was coming up here. Sure enough, he came up 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police here met up with Pierce when they approached a parked car  
they believed was empty, checking it for a possible registration 
violation. When they got close, two men who had been lying down sat 
up, O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	The car sped off and police gave chase. After they surrounded  
the car, gunfire erupted and one man fled. The other fired numerous 
shots at police before being hit in the leg, O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until the suspect was in the hospital that Boston  
police determined it was Pierce, O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the car was arrested after he crashed a car he  
allegedly stole after fleeing, O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men face charges in Massachusetts including attempted  
murder and gun possession. It was not immediately clear Thursday 
when extradition hearings might begin for Pierce, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure both of us will have our shots at him,'' said Bob  
Mathews, police captain in East Point, Ga., where the Aug. 26 
shootings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sorry it's not a more serious wound,'' he said. ``For  
the families and everyone else involved, we're glad he's in 
custody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce is accused of walking into an East Point apartment and  
shooting at the three 18-year-old Boston women, who were best 
friends and high school classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrice Lassiter was killed. Monique Brown, who was to be a  
freshman at Clark Atlanta University, died Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole survivor, Shunae Allen, had been Pierce's girlfriend.  
She identified the suspect, who had studied at Morris Brown College 
in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE>  Alomar Doing it All for Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- His offensive numbers are eye-catching, and his  
defense at second base has been second to none. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Alomar has been everything the Cleveland Indians could  
have hoped for. In fact, they've never had a player like him. 
</P>
<P>
	By getting his 100th RBI in the Indians' 6-5 win over the  
Anaheim Angels on Thursday night, Alomar became the first player in 
club history to drive in 100 runs, score 100, hit 20 homers and 
steal 30 bases in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	A contrived statistic to be sure, but nonetheless one that  
points out Alomar's all-around excellence in 1999, and why he could 
be the AL's MVP this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is real special,'' Alomar said of RBI No. 100, already  
six more than his previous career best in 12 big-league seasons. 
``I never thought I would get there. I feel good about that, but as 
far as I'm concerned, the year is not over until we get to the 
World Series and win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been 51 years since the Indians last won the Series, and  
despite a rash of injuries to key players all season, they're in 
position to make another run. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, which began a four-game series at Baltimore on Friday  
night, will likely clinch a fifth straight AL Central crown in the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, the Indians were expected to win baseball's weakest  
division, especially after signing Alomar as a free agent last 
November. But the 10-time All-Star has been even better than 
advertised, finally filling the biggest hole -- the club used 18 
different second baseman since 1996 -- in Cleveland's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was Robbie's 100th RBI?,'' Richie Sexson said  
incredulously after Thursday's game. ``For a second baseman, that's 
pretty unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unbelievable. That word has been used frequently this season to  
describe Alomar, who seems to make a sparkling defensive play every 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	During the series against the Angels, he made two plays that  
rank among his season's best. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night he made a diving backhanded stop on the edge  
of the grass in short right-center, and from a sitting position 
threw out Jim Edmonds at first. The previous night, he went far to 
his left, again made a diving grab, and from his belly, shoveled 
the ball backhanded in time to first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always take great pride in my defense,'' said Alomar. ``You  
can win a lot of games hitting, but you can win more with 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensively, Alomar has flourished batting third in the Indians'  
lineup behind Kenny Lofton and Omar Vizquel, and in front of Manny 
Ramirez, the majors' RBI leader. 
</P>
<P>
	His 22nd homer Thursday night matched his career-high set in  
1996 with Baltimore, and gave him the Indians' club record for 
homers by a switch-hitter in a season, passing Carlos Baerga and 
Eddie Murray, who each hit 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, completely healed after assorted injury problems the  
past two years, is currently among the league leaders in average 
(.330), RBIs (100), steals (32), on-base percentage (.429) and 
walks (84). He leads the league in runs (117), and would have to be 
among the top five candidates for MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would mean a lot,'' he said. ``But that's not something I'm  
shooting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar joined the Indians so he could be reunited with his  
brother, Sandy, the Indians' catcher who has spent most of the 
season on the disabled list following knee surgery and is getting 
closer to a return. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win a World Series would top it all, 100 RBIs, MVP, all of  
it,'' he said. ``That's what I'm shooting for.''

<HEADLINE>  Braves' Galarraga Back With the Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Big Cat is back, and so is his familiar big  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga, sidelined since  
spring training after undergoing cancer treatment, won't be playing 
this season, but his cancer is gone and he'll be on the bench for 
the remainder of the year rooting his teammates on. 
</P>
<P>
	His first game back was a success. The Braves beat Arizona 7-3  
to extend their NL East lead over the New York Mets to 4 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting to put on the uniform and be with those guys  
on the bench,'' Galarraga said. ``I feel like a little kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing his familiar No. 14 uniform, Galarraga hung out with his  
teammates during batting practice and returned to the field shortly 
before the game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, accompanying 
coach Pat Corrales as he brought out the lineup card. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave Galarraga a standing ovation and one fan held up  
a sign that said, ``The Braves Big Cat Is Back. Welcome Back 
Andres.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost started crying,'' he said. ``I could feel my eyes  
getting wet. I want to thank the fans for all the support they have 
given me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, fellow Venezuelan Eddie Perez playfully wrestled  
with Galarraga near first after they shook hands with the players 
coming off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to touch my base, and he didn't want me to,''  
Galarraga said, breaking into a grin once again. ``I touched it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Braves have remained a first-place team without  
Galarraga -- they won Friday for the 13th time in 14 games -- they 
welcomed his presence in the clubhouse and the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't replace that smile. You can't replace that attitude.  
You can't replace that personality,'' Chipper Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Galarraga has returned to the Atlanta dugout, the  
Braves still have his No. 14 written on their caps as they have all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be fun for him to be around the guys for  
a while,'' Walt Weiss added. ``It's great to see him. He looks 
good. His spirits are high. They always are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Friday, Galarraga had remained home in West Palm Beach,  
Fla., while undergoing treatment. His black-and-gray hair, which 
fell out during chemotherapy, has grown back. 
</P>
<P>
	``All throughout the treatment, we've been watching his tumor  
and it actually has disappeared, so we're very, very happy and 
excited,'' said Galarraga's physician, Dr. Luis Barreras, who was 
at the first baseman's side during the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors discovered a cancerous tumor pressing against  
Galarraga's spine on Feb. 18. He underwent chemotherapy for four 
months (six treatments in all, one every three weeks) followed by 
radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chemo was the toughest part,'' said Galarraga, adding ``it  
really made me sick for 2-3 days after the treatment, but I can't 
complain. I've been positive all the time and I can play baseball 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who admitted he has added about 25 pounds to his  
6-foot-3, 235-pound frame, said he will be in uniform and travel 
with the Braves the rest of the season. He must strengthen his back 
before he can return to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to be here to be with the team, at least in the  
dugout,'' he said, adding that he will provide support ``all the 
way to the World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barreras said Galarraga can begin workouts in November and is  
expected to be ready to play when spring training opens in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be able to play next year, but for right now  
he'll just be a big support for his team. I think his smile will be 
enough,'' Barreras said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who turned 38 in June, was an All-Star last year when  
he had a .305 average and led the Braves with 44 homers and 121 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling young. I feel healthy and I'm not thinking of age.  
A lot of players play past 40. Why not me?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who signed a $24.75 million, three-year contract with  
the Braves before the 1998 season, also has played with Montreal, 
St. Louis and Colorado. He has a .290 career average with 332 
homers and 1,172 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued for Kevorkian Asst. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERNALILLO, N.M. (AP) -- An associate of Jack Kevorkian who is  
charged with murder in the death of a New Mexico woman failed to 
show up for his arraignment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge issued an arrest warrant for Georges Reding, 74, of  
Galesburg, Mich., after no lawyer appeared on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding, a retired psychiatrist, is accused of giving a drug  
overdose to Donna Brennan, who died in August 1998 after suffering 
from multiple sclerosis for 20 years. An autopsy showed Brennan, 
54, died from a lethal dose of pentobarbital, a sedative. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding said in 1996 that he had witnessed five assisted suicides  
and would continue to help Kevorkian judge the mental status of 
people who sought his help in dying. He said he joined Kevorkian 
because he was ``embarrassed by the cowardice of my profession'' in 
not supporting patients who seek suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who has acknowledged helping at least 120 ailing  
people commit suicide, is serving a 10- to 25-year sentence after 
being convicted of murdering a Lou Gehrig's disease patient.

<HEADLINE>  Lemieux Wins Control of Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux won bankruptcy court approval  
today to take control of the Pittsburgh Penguins, making him the 
first retired player to become the owner of a major sports team for 
which he played. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz approved the deal within  
minutes of Lemieux's 9 a.m. court appearance, ending a 10-month 
odyssey of bankruptcy for the club Lemieux led to two Stanley Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like we've done something and succeeded. Now the  
puck's on Mr. Lemieux's stick and we've all seen what he's been 
able to do with that,'' Markovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge sealed the deal by approving an agreement between  
Lemieux's ownership group and SMG, the Philadelphia-based company 
that leases the Civic Arena and rents the space to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to bring the team out of bankruptcy. We have to  
make it viable now. Hopefully, we can make this a great success 
story,'' Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delays in finalizing the agreement, in which SMG agreed to  
invest $5 million in the team, postponed Lemieux's closing on the 
team several times over the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully the Penguins will thrive and survive in  
Pittsburgh,'' SMG attorney Daniel Shapira said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the NHL's board of governors approved Lemieux's  
takeover of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Lemieux came into the picture, there was still some doubt  
whether the Penguins would remain in Pittsburgh, or even in the 
NHL. The team went into bankruptcy last season and was only able to 
meet its payroll with the help of a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
	With approval of Lemieux's takeover, the Penguins made it just  
under the wire. They are scheduled to open training camp Saturday 
and will play their first exhibition game Sept. 11 against the New 
York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he and his group of investors, numbering more than  
a dozen, have put together $52 million so far and hope to raise 
more money. He said the market value of the Penguins is currently 
$85 million, or the price of an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has the largest stake in the team, most of it coming  
from the $25 million in deferred salary the Penguins owed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux will keep the hockey operation in the hands of general  
manager Craig Patrick while he concentrates on the business side 
with the help of others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a team effort, just like it was in the 90s  
when we were winning Cups,'' Lemieux said. The Lemieux-led Penguins 
won championships in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has said he will cut ticket prices immediately upon  
assuming control of the team, but he did not detail how he would do 
that. He said the prices should allow a family to attend a game 
without paying $200 or $300. Any reduction should help the team 
meet its goal of selling 12,000 season tickets for the 1999-2000 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,000 season tickets have been sold so far, even with the  
team's future uncertain for much of the summer. Last year, the team 
sold only 8,300 season tickets.

<HEADLINE> Foyt Returning to Winston Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- An old face will make a new start next  
year in NASCAR when A.J. Foyt returns to Winston Cup racing as a 
car owner. 
</P>
<P>
	And Foyt, a four-time Indianapolis 500 champion and winner of  
the 1972 Daytona 500, will run the entire Winston Cup schedule for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 64-year-old Foyt, conditioned to winning championships  
with his Indy Racing League cars, is not abandoning the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just be doing a lot of commuting,'' Foyt said Friday at  
Darlington Raceway. ``It might be a little tough to do the 
Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in the same day, but I'll 
get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt, despite infrequent appearances he worked into his Indy-car  
career for more than two decades, is no stranger to NASCAR. And his 
operation out of a 30,0000-square-foot shop in Charlotte, N.C., 
will be run by longtime team manager and crew chief Waddell Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not getting into this just to run,'' said Foyt, who also  
announced a sponsorship deal with Conseco Inc., the financial 
services group that has backed his Indy-car effort. ``We want to go 
out there and finish in the top 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt realizes the difficulty of that with a single-car operation  
in a sport where all 23 races this year have been won by drivers 
from multicar teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's tough, and it was even when I raced here,'' said  
Foyt, who had seven victories in 128 NASCAR career starts. ``But if 
you hire the right people, you can make some things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much remains to be done before Foyt will be ready to field his  
first entry in the first race of the next century -- the 
season-opening Daytona 500. Most of the details will be left to 
Wilson, who built the engines and has called the shots for several 
Daytona 500 winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the unfinished business is selecting a driver and make of  
car. All Foyt knows at this time is that the car will be his 
familiar No. 14, the number Kenny Brack drove to both the IRL title 
last year and the Indianapolis 500 championship in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny likes those IROC cars,'' Foyt said of the all-star  
series in which Brack has driven stock cars. ``But I don't think 
he's ready for these Winston Cup cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt might consider owner-driver Ricky Rudd, and discussed  
buying his operation. Rudd, a 20-time career winner who lost his 
lucrative sponsorship, is still seeking backing to keep his own 
operation afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wouldn't rule out driving for Foyt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know A.J. is a fierce competitor, and I am, too,'' Rudd  
said. ``A.J. and I are alike in that if we were playing tiddlywinks 
we'd probably be kicking each other under the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt is the second open-wheel car owner to announce he's  
entering NASCAR next season. Cal Wells III, who owns cars in CART, 
is forming Winston Cup and Busch Series teams in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Gore Cheered by Labor Union Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Union women cheered and pounded on tabletops  
Friday as Vice President Al Gore launched the Labor Day weekend 
with a roundhouse punch at Republicans, ``union busting'' and other 
favorite targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make this vow, that the advances and progress that we have  
seen for women in this century represents only the beginning of the 
progress we're going to make,'' Gore told the Coalition of Labor 
Union Women. 
</P>
<P>
	``A woman's place is in her union,'' the Democratic presidential  
contender declared to more cheering. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of women from across the country attending the group's  
annual meeting applauded Gore's promise to fight privatization of 
Social Security and ``risky Republican tax schemes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to the positive performance of the economy as a sign  
that the Clinton administration is on the right track economically 
and warned against GOP measures that he said would ``take us 
backward to the economy-crashing, labor-bashing policies of the 
past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said congressional Republicans ``have tried to pass a large  
number of anti-union measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to say that President Clinton has vetoed every one  
of them,'' he said, drawing huge applause. He said ``union 
busting'' practices have gained new respectability in the workplace 
and must end. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling that in decades past in the rural South some people  
worked for as little as 25 cents and hour, Gore drew a laugh when 
he cracked: ``Come to think of it, sounds a little like the 
Republican platform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were few, if any, doubters in the hall.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how so many folks can vote Republican when he  
makes so much sense,'' said Hazel Stehlik, 41, of Fort Worth, 
Texas, an airline clerk and member of a transit union. She said the 
Democrats face an uphill battle in the home state of GOP 
presidential contender George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've gone totally Bush-wacky'' in Texas, she said as union  
women flocked to shake hands with Gore. ``He has got them 
buffaloed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebelina Daniel, 51, of New York, a home-care worker and member  
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees, said she especially liked the parts of Gore's speech 
urging greater availability of day care and an end to the use of 
replacement workers in strikebound companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beautiful,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Braves' Galarraga Back With the Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Big Cat is back, and so is his familiar big  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga, sidelined since  
spring training after undergoing cancer treatment, won't be playing 
this season, but his cancer is gone and he'll be on the bench for 
the remainder of the year rooting his teammates on. 
</P>
<P>
	His first game back was a success. The Braves beat Arizona 7-3  
to extend their NL East lead over the New York Mets to 4 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting to put on the uniform and be with those guys  
on the bench,'' Galarraga said. ``I feel like a little kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing his familiar No. 14 uniform, Galarraga hung out with his  
teammates during batting practice and returned to the field shortly 
before the game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, accompanying 
coach Pat Corrales as he brought out the lineup card. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave Galarraga a standing ovation and one fan held up  
a sign that said, ``The Braves Big Cat Is Back. Welcome Back 
Andres.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost started crying,'' he said. ``I could feel my eyes  
getting wet. I want to thank the fans for all the support they have 
given me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, fellow Venezuelan Eddie Perez playfully wrestled  
with Galarraga near first after they shook hands with the players 
coming off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to touch my base, and he didn't want me to,''  
Galarraga said, breaking into a grin once again. ``I touched it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Braves have remained a first-place team without  
Galarraga -- they won Friday for the 13th time in 14 games -- they 
welcomed his presence in the clubhouse and the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't replace that smile. You can't replace that attitude.  
You can't replace that personality,'' Chipper Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Galarraga has returned to the Atlanta dugout, the  
Braves still have his No. 14 written on their caps as they have all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be fun for him to be around the guys for  
a while,'' Walt Weiss added. ``It's great to see him. He looks 
good. His spirits are high. They always are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Friday, Galarraga had remained home in West Palm Beach,  
Fla., while undergoing treatment. His black-and-gray hair, which 
fell out during chemotherapy, has grown back. 
</P>
<P>
	``All throughout the treatment, we've been watching his tumor  
and it actually has disappeared, so we're very, very happy and 
excited,'' said Galarraga's physician, Dr. Luis Barreras, who was 
at the first baseman's side during the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors discovered a cancerous tumor pressing against  
Galarraga's spine on Feb. 18. He underwent chemotherapy for four 
months (six treatments in all, one every three weeks) followed by 
radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chemo was the toughest part,'' said Galarraga, adding ``it  
really made me sick for 2-3 days after the treatment, but I can't 
complain. I've been positive all the time and I can play baseball 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who admitted he has added about 25 pounds to his  
6-foot-3, 235-pound frame, said he will be in uniform and travel 
with the Braves the rest of the season. He must strengthen his back 
before he can return to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to be here to be with the team, at least in the  
dugout,'' he said, adding that he will provide support ``all the 
way to the World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barreras said Galarraga can begin workouts in November and is  
expected to be ready to play when spring training opens in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be able to play next year, but for right now  
he'll just be a big support for his team. I think his smile will be 
enough,'' Barreras said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who turned 38 in June, was an All-Star last year when  
he had a .305 average and led the Braves with 44 homers and 121 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling young. I feel healthy and I'm not thinking of age.  
A lot of players play past 40. Why not me?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who signed a $24.75 million, three-year contract with  
the Braves before the 1998 season, also has played with Montreal, 
St. Louis and Colorado. He has a .290 career average with 332 
homers and 1,172 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Ordonez, Lopez Say Fight Behind Them </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whatever caused the fight between Rey Ordonez  
and Luis Lopez is behind them, they said one day after Lopez 
punched Ordonez, leaving the New York Mets' starting shortstop with 
six stitches over his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
	The players addressed reporters along with general manager Steve  
Phillips on Friday, but not before Phillips told them not to talk 
about details of the fight that took place on the team bus early 
Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is over,'' Ordonez said. ``It's a new day. Let's  
play baseball. That's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened was that we exchanged words and had an  
argument,'' Lopez said. ``It's over with. Rey and I talked with 
Steve and Bobby (Valentine, manager) and we're ready to play 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ordonez was ready to play Friday night against the Colorado  
Rockies, despite the swelling and the stitches. He has no 
blurriness or double vision and was cleared by doctors to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter how he looks, as long as he can see well  
enough to field grounders and hit the ball,'' Valentine said. 
``This is a baseball game, not a beauty contest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight came on the bus ride back from Newark International  
Airport early Thursday morning after the Mets completed a 3-3 road 
trip at Arizona and Houston. While neither player will miss any 
time, Valentine was unhappy with the judgment they showed with the 
team in the pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
	With four weeks to play, the Mets entered the day 3 1/2 games  
behind Atlanta in the NL East and four games ahead of Cincinnati in 
the wild-card race. Every game is critical as the Mets seek their 
first postseason berth in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to them a bit about responsibility,'' Valentine said.  
``We can't do anything about what already happened. I hope in the 
future each of them can learn from this situation and become more 
responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the players nor Phillips would say what the fight was  
about, but Phillips did deny reports that Ordonez started the fight 
because Lopez was hazing rookie Jorge Toca. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wasn't about hazing,'' Phillips said. ``This had to do  
with a situation between these two guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips would not say what discipline the team imposed on  
either player, though it is believed both were fined.

<HEADLINE> White On Trial in Immigrant Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- About 200 prospective jurors filed into Denver  
District Court today as the death penalty trial began for a 
self-proclaimed white supremacist charged in the slaying of a West 
African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors began filling out paperwork and were to watch a video  
about the jury service fundamentals before the selection process 
got under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Thill, 21, is accused of murdering Oumar Dia because he  
was black and of paralyzing Jeannie VanVelkinburgh, who tried to 
come to Dia's aid in the late-night attack at a downtown bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. VanVelkinburgh's testimony helped convict Thill's companion,  
Jeremiah Barnum. But Barnum was later granted a new trial because a 
judge ruled Ms. VanVelkinburgh's emotional behavior -- which 
included screaming and crying -- jeopardized Barnum's right to a 
fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors refused to comment on whether they plan to call Ms.  
VanVelkinburgh during Thill's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal analyst Andrew Cohen of Denver said prosecutors must  
decide whether Ms. VanVelkinburgh's testimony is crucial to their 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a witness who brings a lot to the prosecution ... but  
her credibility is in doubt and she might bring in a big risk,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thill, 21, is charged with ethnic intimidation, first-degree  
murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury selection process is expected to be arduous because of  
publicity in a crime that outraged residents and prompted anti-hate 
rallies and prayer vigils. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Diorbivol, Senegal, the slightly statured Dia was a  
hotel bellhop, sending his earnings home to support his family and 
fellow villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Thill and Barnum, who worked at a service station,  
allegedly had ties to the skinhead movement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 19, 1997, Dia, just off work, and Ms. VanVelkinburgh  
were waiting at the bus stop when Thill and Barnum approached. 
Thill knocked a baseball cap from Dia's head, called him a racial 
epithet and asked him whether he was prepared to die, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. VanVelkinburgh has testified that Barnum put Dia in a  
headlock while Thill pulled out a gun and shot Dia several times. 
When she tried to intervene, Ms. VanVelkinburgh said Thill shot her 
in the spine, pointed the gun at her head and pulled the trigger 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The weapon was empty.  
</P>
<P>
	After his arrest, Thill told several media outlets, police and  
prosecutors that he shot Dia because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	Thill acknowledged in news interviews that he was a white  
supremacist and Dia was ``in the enemy's uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a subsequent ruling, a court ruled Thill's statements to  
police could not be used during the trial because he was not 
properly advised of his constitutional rights, but the statements 
to the media may be used because Thill sought out reporters 
voluntarily.

<HEADLINE> Internet Standards Effort Hits Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A much-touted industry effort to develop a  
common standard to let technology companies freely exchange data 
with other businesses across the Internet has hit an unexpected 
snag due to conflicting corporate agendas. 
</P>
<P>
	A computer industry group said Friday it had rejected a proposed  
version of the standard over concerns it skewed toward U.S. 
companies and will prevent European companies from participating. 
</P>
<P>
	One worry of the Computing Technology Industry Association is  
the standard would enable businesses to exchange personal data 
about their consumers, such as buying habits. This would violate of 
European government privacy rules, which are stricter than those in 
the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	The rejection is expected to delay the release of the standards  
to computer and software makers and distributors, which had been 
expected next February. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bump in the road,'' said Kathey Hale, an analyst with  
the Dataquest high-tech research firm. ``I'm surprised there was 
such a lack of communication here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standards-setting group, called RosettaNet, was launched  
with much ballyhoo in June to harness the XML software language to 
speed the transmission of data across electronic networks linking 
computer and software makers, parts suppliers and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industries, such as auto companies, also are working on  
standards for XML, or extensible markup language. XML is a way to 
tag electronic information with identifying codes so that 
businesses can exchange information without worrying about the need 
to reformat data so that it can be retrieved and viewed by others. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a business can easily send orders to a parts  
supplier across the Web without paying big consulting fees to an 
outside company to set up an electronic network. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology industry is being closely watched by XML  
supporters because it is a driving force behind international 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	A phone message left with Fadi Chehade, executive director of  
the RosettaNet group, was not returned. A RosettaNet spokeswoman 
said he wasn't available. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the concern over European privacy standards,  
another worry is the standard would require companies using it to 
have an identifying code issued by the Dun &AMP; Bradstreet financial 
information firm. Most U.S. companies have such codes, though 
European companies do not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies in Europe wouldn't use the standard at all,'' said  
Nicole Shelley, senior director of electronic commerce standards 
for the CTIA, based outside Chicago and made up of 7,500 U.S. and 
Europe technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley said as a result of its concerns, its members would not  
launch tests of the standards over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's rejection of the proposal ``is going to delay'' the  
standards, she said. ``The smaller and larger players are saying 
they can't implement these standards.''

<HEADLINE> Burton Takes Pole for Dura Lube 200 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Ward Burton needed the fastest  
Darlington lap ever in a Busch Grand National car to nose out Mark 
Martin, maybe the series' most dominant driver here, to take the 
pole for the Dura Lube 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was calmly up front with a near-record run of 166.236 --  
he shut the engine down after the first of two laps -- before 
Burton, the 48th of 55 entries, sandblasted Friday's field with a 
lap of 167.676 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, who won the Winston Cup pole for Darlington's TranSouth  
400 three years ago, broke Martin's mark of 166.568 mph set in 
March for the Diamond Hill Plywood 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew from practice this morning that we had fast times,''  
Burton said. ``We wanted to back that up in qualifying and the guys 
did it pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has tamed Darlington like no other Busch racer. He has  
five victories and six poles, both series records, at the quirky 
1.366-mile oval. When he eased the gas on his Ford after one lap, 
he looked strong for another top starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, who's never won at Darlington and only once started a  
Busch race here better than fifth, slung a near-perfect line with 
his Pontiac through the track's misshapen corners. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Burton's seventh Busch pole, but first since Rockingham,  
N.C., in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little surprised that we ran as quick as the 60  
(Martin's) car,'' Burton said. ``But we held it together well in 
the corners and went pretty good in the straightaways, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin shook out a new Busch car from the record-setting machine  
he used last March. He said it ran well with its sticky qualifying 
tires, but is ready for a hard-handling experience Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty loose and we're having to do some ridiculous  
things to keep it's back end under us,'' said Martin, whose last 
Darlington victory came in 1996. ``It's giving us some real ugly 
traits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckshot Jones, a Spartanburg, S.C.-based driver who has gotten  
advice from Darlington's leading winner, ``Silver Fox'' David 
Pearson, was third in 165.109 mph, giving Pontiac two of the top 
three spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott Sadler was next at 164.992 mph, leading a group of four  
Chevrolets. Shane Hall was fifth, followed by Matt Kenseth, Joe 
Nemechek, Jeff Fuller, Jeff Purvis and Winston Cup regular Jeff 
Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	Busch series points leader Dale Earnhardt Jr., runnerup here  
last year, qualified 14th. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Winston Cup drivers, Sterling Marlin was 13th,, Dale  
Jarrett 21st, Hut Stricklin 29th and defending champion Dick 
Trickle 30th. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Labonte, spun out by Dale Earnhardt while leading the  
Goody's 500 at Bristol last week, was 43rd at 161.577 mph and 
failed to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36 fastest cars and seven provisional drivers will start on  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had gone into Winston Cup full-time at the start of this  
year. But went back to Busch racing when he couldn't stay 
competitive in NASCAR's best division. This week at Darlington, 
Jones said his crew had team meetings almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of things straight,'' he said. ``We've got a  
whole new attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones hadn't qualified better than ninth in 11 previous races  
this year.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Olympic Athlete Charged in Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Leo Adolphus Garnes, who represented his  
native Barbados in the 1992 Olympics, was charged with capital 
murder in the shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend and her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnes, 31, a standout for the Alabama A&AMP;M cross-country team in  
1993, was being held Friday in the Madison County Jail without 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	He is accused of shooting Nichol Richele Grant, 23, and her  
sister, Carla NaTasha Grant, 20, in an apparent domestic argument. 
Nichol Grant, the mother of Garnes' 5-month-old daughter, Eboni, 
died at the scene Tuesday. Carla Grant died Wednesday at a 
Huntsville hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsville police Sgt. Rex Reynolds said Friday the women  
apparently went to Garnes' Huntsville apartment, where the shooting 
occurred, because of a dispute over personal property. 
</P>
<P>
	An officer arriving at the apartment after the shootings saw  
Garnes leaving the apartment and asked him to stop, police Sgt. 
Juan Joyner said. Garnes confessed to police at the scene, Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds said there had been a dispute over the custody of the  
5-month-old child, but the argument Tuesday was apparently over 
something else. The child wasn't present at the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had religious convictions, and so did she,'' said the Rev.  
James Doggette of Madison Mission Seventh Day Adventist Church. 
``You would always see both of them in church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doggette said Garnes told him he had run 26 miles Sunday to work  
off energy and ponder his problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying to work his way through some struggles.  
Unfortunately, there was an explosion,'' Doggette said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnes, who ran the 5,000 meters for Barbados in the 1992  
Olympics at Barcelona, Spain, was selected outstanding men's track 
runner in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1993. 
He hasn't been enrolled at A&AMP;M since 1994, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The capital murder charge carries a possible death sentence, if  
convicted.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jana Novotna is still hampered by the ankle  
injury she sustained at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna turned her ankle when she stepped on the foot of her  
partner, Natasha Zvereva, during their doubles match. Two weeks 
later she played Wimbledon, where she was the defending champion, 
then took time off. But the injury still affects her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am concerned about it,'' Novotna said Friday after losing  
her third-round singles match to Anke Huber 6-3, 6-2. ``It was very 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it seems like even after a very long time off ... the  
ankle is not getting better and I am not feeling 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the same player. My movement is not the same. No  
matter how much I'm trying, I still can't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CYBER RESPITE:* The U.S. Open is traditionally known as the  
in-your-face Grand Slam, but there is at least one place on the 
grounds where players can trade in the constant fan buzz for the 
faint hum of computer terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive year, IBM is providing a cyberspace  
studio of eight terminals in a small room just off the player 
lounge and dining room. Once inside, the sound of typing takes the 
place of sneaker squeaks and bouncing balls, and the sun is muted 
by a shaded bay window. The ceiling lights are frequently turned 
off, and players are free to either surf the Internet or listen to 
the collection of movie soundtracks, U2 and Madonna CDs cranked 
from a corner stereo. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM representative Lisa Kardon said she fully expected the site  
to be popular, and there are almost always players leaning on the 
walls or slumped in soft chairs waiting for machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were setting up on Saturday and we had people peeking in  
the door, saying, `When are you opening?,''' she said. ``All the 
players use it to check e-mail, their local newspapers, whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BETTER SIGHTLINES:@ Keeping your eye on the ball is not as easy  
as it sounds, but Bolle hopes to make it easier with a new type of 
sunglass. Called Competivision, the line of shades makes the ball 
stand out from all other objects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spectrum of light enters the glass, and it has a  
neutralizing system that mutes all colors other than optic 
yellow,'' director of marketing services Mike Connelly said. ``It 
works for women's softball as well, since the ball is also 
yellow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The glasses will not work for baseball because that ball is  
white, which is not technically a color. 
</P>
<P>
	Current No. 1 Martina Hingis endorses the Bolle shades, but does  
not use them in matches. The company has designed prescription 
contact lenses for her, which she uses in practice sessions. The 
contacts, currently undergoing FDA testing, should be available to 
the public in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Polarized or prescription Competivision shades will be offered  
in 2000. Despite the fact that sunglasses are rarely a staple of 
match play, Bolle is pushing players to make the shades as 
essential to their usual gear as sunscreen or sweatbands. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the challenge,'' Connelly said. ``Our message is to get  
to the young tennis players. This technology can actually become 
equipment for them; they can get UV protection from the sun and 
they can see the ball better.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ROOKIE LEADER:@ On paper, the Australian Davis Cup team looks to  
be loaded with talent for its semifinal tie against Russia. But 
with Patrick Rafter nursing a slight rotator cuff tear and Mark 
Philippoussis recovering from knee surgery, the top singles mantle 
may well fall on 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable, isn't it?'' asked Hewitt, who took a month  
off before the U.S. Open to recover from a hurting ankle. 
``Obviously there is a cloud over Rafter and Philippoussis, and 
possibly still a little bit of a cloud over myself as well with the 
ankle ... The good thing is we've got a lot of depth on our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Arthurs, Jason Stoltenberg and Mark Woodforde are also  
available for singles or doubles duty. The tie will be held on 
grass in Brisbane on Sept. 24-26. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I was the No. 2 player, I had to try and beat both the  
guys anyway,'' Hewitt said. ``I don't think it's going to be a big 
step for me going as the No. 2 player into the No. 1 player.''

<HEADLINE> New York Times Raises Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times is raising the newsstand  
price of its weekday newspaper in the metropolitan area from 60 
cents to 75 cents. The change takes effect on Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2.50 cost of the Sunday newspaper, home delivery prices and  
the $1 newsstand price for the daily Northeast and national 
editions will not change. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first increase in suggested newsstand prices since  
September 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since we last raised the price we have increased the value of  
our product for our readers, added color, added new sections,'' 
Times spokeswoman Lisa Carparelli said Wednesday. ``We will 
continue to reinvest in our product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times Co., with holdings including The Boston Globe  
and 21 regional newspapers, three magazines, eight TV stations, two 
radio stations and nearly 50 Web sites, had revenues of $2.9 
billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> 'Roger Ebert &AMP; The Movies' Debuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It's like Rodgers without Hammerstein. Cagney  
without Lacey. Thelma without Louise. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, there is no other name that goes with Ebert other  
than Siskel -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Movie critic Roger Ebert has opted not to have a headlining  
co-host as he begins his first full season without Gene Siskel, who 
died last February while recovering from brain surgery at the age 
of 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Their widely circulated show, formerly known as ``Siskel &AMP;  
Ebert,'' is now simply called ``Roger Ebert &AMP; The Movies.'' It 
debuts this weekend with ``Good Morning America'' critic Joel 
Siegel as the first of at least three regular co-hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt we will ever find a replacement for Gene,'' says Mary  
Kellogg, an executive producer at Buena Vista Television, 
syndicator of the show. ``It was a rare moment in television where 
two individuals work. I don't think it's replaceable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When ``Siskel and Ebert'' went into syndication in 1982, the tag  
team arguably became the most recognizable and influential movie 
critics in the nation. Their trademark ``thumbs-up'' and 
``thumbs-down'' reviews became a benchmark for the movie industry, 
and viewers were drawn to their argumentative banter. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Siegel, other co-hosts on the revamped show will include  
CNN's Jeff Greenfield, who has been friends with Ebert since 
college, and Joyce Kulhawik of WBZ-TV in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegel first appeared on the Chicago-based show last season when  
Ebert and his producers were trying to figure out how to keep the 
show running while coping with Siskel's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I did the show, which was in May, I was really  
struck at how much Roger missed Gene. It was just very obvious,'' 
Siegel says. ``He'd been in this situation and he'd turn to his 
right, and it was obvious that he expected to see Gene -- and there 
I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebert, who was traveling Friday, could not be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Kellogg says the show will feature an updated set  
with ``more contemporary colors,'' a new theme song and different 
on-screen graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	The program format will, however, remain the same with Ebert and  
his co-host du jour continuing to comment on clips from movies, 
from blockbusters to low-budget art films. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the co-hosts also will be allowed to join Ebert in  
giving a thumbs-up or thumbs-down rating -- something they stopped 
doing after Siskel's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did it out of respect for Gene, as it was still his  
season,'' Kellogg says. ``Now we're moving on to the next phase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siegel says he's finding it difficult to sum up a movie with one  
gesture, especially when he has mixed feelings about a film. He 
says he's also adjusting to other aspects of the show, including 
having to keep his ratings secret until the actual taping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to confess, I felt like a guest,'' Siegel says of the  
Chicago taping of this weekend's show. 
</P>
<P>
	He laughs, then adds, ``And one of the things that strikes me  
about Roger is that when you disagree with him, he takes it very 
personally. ... He gets this hurt little boy look on his face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Programming experts say those may be just the sort of reactions  
TV viewers are looking for, a sort of friendly tension that Siskel 
and Ebert -- who grew to like one another -- made their trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, at least one TV industry insider says she thinks  
Ebert has enough clout to keep the show a success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ebert is still respected and well-known,'' Shelby Mason,  
associate director of programming at New York-based Petry 
Television, a company that serves as a liaison between TV stations 
and syndicators. ``And if there isn't any competition (from other 
shows), I'm sure people who are curious would definitely view it.''

<HEADLINE> Georgia Convict Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONROE, Ga. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man who said he went  
``berserk'' when he killed four members of a family was sentenced 
Friday to die in the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Scott Heidler was convicted Thursday of the 1997 shotgun  
massacre of Kim and Danny Daniels and two of their nine children. 
The family had once taken in Heidler while he was trying to kick a 
drug and alcohol habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidler's lawyer said his client was mentally ill and deserved  
to be spared, describing him as a ``very, very mixed-up, sick young 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But District Attorney Richard Malone told jurors Heidler  
``remains the same horrible killer that he was on Dec. 4, 1997.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a month and a half before his trial, Heidler broke out a  
first-floor window of a county jail by sawing through a cell bar 
and then an outer fence. He was found 12 hours later walking along 
a road in the boxer shorts and T-shirt he had escaped in. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidler killed the adults and Jessica, 16, and Bryant, 8, as  
they slept. He kidnapped three girls in the family and left two 
younger children, including a 10-month-old, behind with the 
blood-soaked bodies. Prosecutors say he sexually assaulted one of 
the girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just went from room to room, shooting,'' Heidler mumbled in  
an interview with police videotaped the day after the killings. ``I 
went berserk.''

	Israel Says Peace Deal Imminent  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said today  
that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were ``very close' to 
reaching a deal for a revised West Bank land-for-security 
agreement. The revised agreement had been held up by a dispute over 
Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel, but that problem 
had been resolved, Israeli officials said. Egypt's Middle East News 
Agency quoted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as saying that a 
deal had been reached and would be signed tomorrow night at the Red 
Sea port of Sharm el-Sheikh.

	Charges Dropped in Diana Probe  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A French judge has dismissed all charges against  
nine photographers and a press motorcyclist implicated in the car 
crash that killed Princess Diana, ending the two-year investigation 
into the accident, judicial sources said today. Judge Herve Stephan 
said the accident was the result of an intoxicated driver, who also 
was taking drugs incompatible with alcohol, the sources said. 
Stephan also concluded that the decision by Dodi Fayed, Diana's 
boyfriend, to order an off-duty security official, who was drunk, 
to drive the Mercedes, also contributed to the crash.

	Unemployment Drops to 4.2 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate dipped back  
down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in August as gains in 
computer, data processing and health care jobs helped offset 
continued job losses at factories. The Labor Department reported 
today that the decrease in August's unemployment rate followed a 
4.3 percent rate in July. Despite the decline in the unemployment 
rate, employers added a smaller-than-expected 124,000 jobs to their 
payrolls in August, following a gain of 338,000 jobs in July.

Michigan to Boca Raton crashed into a strip mall early today while 
trying to make an emergency landing, killing at least four of the

	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin, who has remained silent  
on an alleged money laundering scandal linked to Russia, summoned a 
top security officer to the Kremlin today for private talks on the 
controversy. In the most serious case, U.S. investigators are 
trying to determine whether Russian criminal groups laundered up to 
$10 billion through the Bank of New York. No one has been charged 
with a crime, and the Russian government has not been accused of 
any wrongdoing. The country's Federal Security Service is 
investigating the extent of Russian involvement.

	More FBI-Waco Evidence Is Found

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Roundly criticized for not disclosing evidence  
related to its 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian cult, the FBI 
released a videotape on which an FBI commander is heard authorizing 
the use of incendiary tear gas hours before a deadly fire ended the 
Davidians' 51-day standoff with federal agents. The FBI made the 
tape public yesterday as Attorney General Janet Reno asked an 
outsider to head an independent inquiry into the FBI's long-denied 
use of flammable weapons during the April 19, 1993, assault near 
Waco, Texas.

positive for drugs at last month's Pan American games were the 
victims of a plot. Castro said that multiple urine tests of 
weightlifters William Vargas and Rolando Delgado conducted by Cuba 
and sent to three different laboratories in Europe all tested 
negative for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone. However, urine tests 
analyzed by a Canadian lab during the games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 
showed Vargas and Delgado testing positive for the drug.

<HEADLINE> Big Board Won't Go Public This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange will wait until at  
least next year before making any decision on when and how the 
world's largest stock market might shift to public ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Board is currently privately owned by its members, or  
seat holders. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Grasso, the chairman of the NYSE, said earlier this  
summer that he had hoped the exchange could complete an initial 
public offering, or IPO, this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a meeting of the board of directors of the exchange  
Thursday, Grasso announced the NYSE first had to come up with a 
strategic business plan that would satisfy a number of ``very 
significant public policy questions.'' He said that study wouldn't 
be completed until sometime next year and that a decision then 
would be made on whether to proceed with an IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	Work on the strategic plan is to begin immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE and the Nasdaq Stock Market both are considering IPOs  
to fend off competition from rival electronic trading exchanges, 
known as ECNs for electronic communications networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the NYSE and Nasdaq believe going public will give them the  
flexibility to compete with ECNs, which can provide faster and 
cheaper trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Both markets also have said the stock created in an IPO could be  
used to buy or team up with an ECN. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Thursday evening on cable financial channel  
CNBC, Grasso said the NYSE could set up or team up with an ECN even 
before an IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any doubt that to the extent that we're  
going to launch an ECN ... that that will come sooner than an IPO 
will come,'' Grasso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since many of the ECNs are either publicly traded or are units  
of publicly traded companies, they already have stock that can be 
used for expansion or upgrading technology, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the issues that will be studied is how the exchange would  
be policed as a public company. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE now is self-regulated, and imposes fines and other  
penalties on members who cheat investors and break other rules. The 
NYSE also is answerable to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC officials have raised concerns that the NYSE's regulatory  
obligations would be compromised if the exchange was to shift to a 
publicly traded company that is accountable to shareholders seeking 
profits from their investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the $64,000 question, from the SEC's perspective,''  
said David Bayless, former head of the SEC's San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
	The question poses a dilemma for the exchange and potential NYSE  
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayless, echoing officials at the SEC, said the best answer may  
be for the NYSE to split off its regulatory operations into a 
separate organization, affiliated with but not part of the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso told reporters after the board meeting that another  
possible solution would be to merge regulatory operations with the 
independent enforcement of the National Association of Securities 
Dealers, the organization that also oversees Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the SEC, said he looks forward to  
working closely with the NYSE on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share a common interest in ensuring that any future  
self-regulatory structure is consistent with the protection of 
investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets,'' Levitt 
said in a statement released in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under study is the membership structure of the exchange in  
the event of an IPO and how its 1,366 seat holders would be 
compensated in a transfer to public ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	One idea floated has members receiving stock in exchange for  
their seats. But that plan could be scuttled by members who don't 
want to pay the capital gains taxes that would be assessed on that 
type of stock transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Any plan needs to be approved by two-thirds of the members.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, it's all going to boil down to what's in it for  
the members, whether the members feel it's a good deal 
financially,'' said John Burke, a 20-year seat holder with John 
Burke Securities.

<HEADLINE> Online Magazine Has Hooker-Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tracy Quan is still a working girl. She just has  
a new position. 
</P>
<P>
	Quan, a one-time New York prostitute, is writing a twice-weekly  
column for the online magazine salon.com. The column takes the form 
of a diary of a New York call girl of Asian ancestry named Nancy 
Chan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds a lot like Quan's past life -- so much so that a  
competitor griped that the column, ``Diary of a Manhattan Call 
Girl,'' was not clearly identified as fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	So is it fact? Fiction? Roman a clef?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely fiction,'' says the self-proclaimed,  
self-employed former hooker. ``It's done in the way that Tom Clancy 
and others have used what they know about an industry to tell a 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The column debuted in July. Among the racier entries were  
segments titled ``Thighs Wide Shut'' and ``Lesbian Blind Date.'' 
Quan says she has already received dozens of e-mails from men, 
women, johns and hookers. 
</P>
<P>
	The columns generally mix pop psychology and soft-core porn,  
offering a peek into the title character's personal and 
professional lives. The stereotypical hooker with a heart of gold 
doesn't turn up here; a woman trying to quit the business through a 
12-step program does. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prostitutes have huge problems balancing their love lives,  
their families and their friends with work,'' Quan says. ``The life 
is complicated. It's a psychologically challenging situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one column, Nancy is trying to balance a blossoming romance  
with her work. ``A boyfriend is a professional liability, eating 
into precious time and energy that might have been expended 
profitably,'' Quan writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinner and a movie, apparently, are out.  
</P>
<P>
	There are other do's and don'ts for the working girl: ``I never  
discuss girl business with a john.'' In the summer, all business is 
done between Tuesday and Thursday to accommodate johns taking long 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	Quan is vague about her personal life: She was a teen-age  
runaway who eventually went into prostitution, spending 10 years in 
the business. Now in her 30s, she has been writing for the last two 
years, and hopes the diary may eventually become a book. 
</P>
<P>
	Among her inspirations in taking up the pen: ``Happy Hooker''  
Xaviera Hollander, the madam turned author and Penthouse columnist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Xaviera Hollander is a friend, someone I admired, someone who  
inspired me as a kid,'' Quan says. ``I was inspired by her 
real-life experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quan says she intends to concentrate on her writing now, putting  
her other career on hold -- perhaps permanently. But her experiences 
on the job will always inform her work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think of myself as a reformed ex-hooker,'' Quan says.  
``I still see the world through the eyes of a working girl.''

<HEADLINE> United Shuttle Turbulence Hurts 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- None of the passengers on board a United  
Shuttle flight was prepared for the pocket of turbulence that sent 
it plunging dramatically from its 24,000-feet cruising altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	The seat belt light was out about halfway between Los Angeles  
and San Francisco, and some of the 107 passengers aboard the 
Thursday afternoon flight were roaming through the Boeing 737. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the plane dipped, sending many of them flying through the  
cabin, injuring 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I looked out the window,'' said passenger Maureen  
Cheesman, ``my first thought was, `It's going down.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheesman was traveling with her daughter's high school soccer  
team from Quincy, Mass. Five of the 57-member group were hurt, 
including 8-year-old Benjamin Francisco, who suffered a gash on his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	Team coach Paul Bregoli said he saw some of the children  
``bounce up from their seats and hit their heads on the overhead 
compartments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger Ronald Kalio said ``everybody went straight to the  
ceiling. There was two stewardesses that spent the rest of the trip 
in the aisles. They were knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the injuries involved sprains, cuts and back pain.  
Thirteen passengers and two flight attendants were treated at area 
hospitals and released, United spokesman Joe Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane continued to San Francisco International Airport and  
landed safely less than an hour later, a Federal Aviation 
Administration spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins said United is ``90 percent sure'' the plane encountered  
wake turbulence, a common disturbance caused by air stirred up by 
another plane. 
</P>
<P>
	A larger MD-11 passenger jet was in front of the United jet, but  
was ahead by at least 10 miles, the minimum legally required 
separation, said Ron Wilson, a San Francisco airport spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said the United plane may have hit clear-air turbulence,  
a rarer, more severe phenomenon which cannot be detected in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board were  
investigating.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Wins Control of Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux won bankruptcy court approval  
today to take control of the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz approved the deal within  
minutes of Lemieux's 9 a.m. court appearance, ending a 10-month 
odyssey of bankruptcy for the club Lemieux led to two Stanley Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like we've done something and succeeded. Now the  
puck's on Mr. Lemieux's stick and we've all seen what he's been 
able to do with that,'' Markovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL Board of Governors this week gave its approval for the  
group headed by the retired Hall of Famer to take over the 
Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge sealed the deal by approving an agreement between  
Lemieux's ownership group and SMG, the Philadelphia-based company 
that leases the Civic Arena and rents the space to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Delays in finalizing the agreement, in which SMG agreed to  
invest $5 million in the team postponed Lemieux's closing on the 
team several times over the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux becomes the first athlete of a major franchise to  
assumed control of his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Lemieux came into the picture, there was still some doubt  
whether the Penguins would remain in Pittsburgh, or even in the 
NHL. The team went into bankruptcy last season and was only able to 
meet its payroll with the help of a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
	With approval of Lemieux's takeover, the Penguins made it just  
under the wire. They're due to open training camp on Saturday and 
will play their first exhibition game Sept. 11 against the New York 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he and his group of investors, numbering more than  
a dozen, have put together $52 million so far and hope to raise 
more money. He said the market value of the Penguins is currently 
$85 million, or the price of an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has the largest stake in the team, most of it coming  
from the $25 million in deferred salary the Penguins owed him. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the hockey operation would remain in the hands of  
general manager Craig Patrick, and that he would take care of the 
business side with the help of others. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has said he will cut ticket prices immediately upon  
assuming control of the team, but he didn't detail any plans. He 
only said the prices should allow a family to come to a game 
without paying $200 or $300. Any reduction should help the team 
meet its goal of selling 12,000 season tickets for the 1999-2000 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,000 season tickets have been sold so far, even with the  
team's future uncertain for much of the summer. Last year, the team 
sold only 8,300 season tickets.

<HEADLINE>  Collins Resigns As Angels' Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A tearful Terry Collins resigned as the  
Anaheim Angels' manager on Friday, less than three months after the 
last-place team gave him a two-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Maddon, the Angels' bench coach, will take over as interim  
manager for the rest of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim began Friday with a nine-game losing streak and a 51-82  
record, the worst in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and general manager Bill Bavasi said the manager was not  
forced out. The two had a long talk Thursday night, and both 
decided it would be best if he quit now. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi said he made his recommendation to Collins ``a little bit  
for the club and mostly for Terry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's not bitter, but I'm bitter. This club had every  
reason to respond and didn't. This is just bad chemistry in the 
clubhouse,'' Bavasi said. ``The team didn't quit on Terry; I can't 
imagine anybody quitting on Terry. ... They quit on themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels were still in contention at the All-Star break, but  
lost 37 of their next 47 to plummet into last place in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, the team's got to perform,'' Collins said.  
``When you don't perform, the manager's accountable. I had a 
feeling today that this is the time. I tried everything I knew, 
from patting them on the back to try to motivate them to kicking 
them in the butt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 50, hadn't spoken to any of the players about the  
decision, although he said he planned to talk later with some of 
them individually. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision apparently had lot more to do with the players'  
squabbling among themselves than it did with the team's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday in Cleveland, I had to address a couple of issues  
again and was unable to talk about the game, and that's when it hit 
me,'' Collins said. ``I won't miss the bickering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Bavasi asked some players for their opinion of the manager  
before Collins' contract was renewed, players seemed to splinter 
into pro- and anti-Collins factions. A few unidentified players 
complained about Collins' managing style, but he was given the 
extension anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Randy Velarde, who publicly took issue with  
Collins, was traded to Oakland along with starting pitcher Omar 
Olivares for three minor leaguers on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest clubhouse flareup came when reliever Troy Percival  
complained that not all of his teammates were on the field during a 
brawl with in Cleveland on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident began began after Percival allowed a three-run  
homer to Richie Sexson, capping a 10-run, eighth-inning rally, and 
then hit David Justice with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo Vaughn was in the clubhouse watching on TV and went to the  
dugout, but said he arrived too late to go on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Percival noted that some players hadn't participated in the  
fight, an apparent reference to Vaughn. The following day, Vaughn 
complained that no Angels' pitcher has retaliated this year after 
he was hit, and criticized Percival for hitting Justice, saying, 
``Take a beating like a man and get the next out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi said the makeup of the team doesn't seem to be working,  
and that he accepted responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than we're going to be looking for a manager the rest of  
this season, we're going to be looking at the players,'' he said. 
``I don't know how they're going to react to this, and I'd be less 
than honest if I said I cared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim could be headed for the poorest season in the Angels'  
39-season history -- worse than the 1980 team's 65-95 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like they're the Harlem Globetrotters out there, and  
we're the Washington Generals,'' Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina 
said after Thursday night's 6-5 loss at Cleveland, which turned out 
to be Collins' final game. 
</P>
<P>
	After managing the Houston Astros to second-place finishes in  
the NL Central from 1994-96, Collins went to Anaheim and had a 
220-237 record with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in clubhouses where guys don't like each other,''  
Collins said. ``But when I was in Houston, they still went out and 
played hard every game. The manager has one hammer these days, the 
lineup card, and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team had high expectations after signing Vaughn to an $80  
million, six-year contract last November, and began the season with 
baseball's 13th-highest payroll at $51.5 million. But the season 
was filled with injuries and discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina was one of several key players sidelined for an  
extended period, along with Vaughn, outfielders Jim Edmonds and Tim 
Salmon, and pitchers Ken Hill, Tim Belcher, Jason Dickson, Mike 
James, Pep Harris and Jack McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, criticized in the past for being too intense, signed  
the extension on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't believe there's a better place to work,'' he  
said then.

	Unemployment Drops to 4.2 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unemployment edged down to 4.2 percent last  
month, returning to a 29-year low, as a pre-Labor Day government 
report today spelled good news for job seekers without re-igniting 
inflation jitters on Wall Street. Businesses added a 
smaller-than-expected 124,000 jobs to payrolls in August, after a 
gain of 338,000 jobs in July, and reported moderate wage growth, 
the Labor Department said. Economists and investors viewed the 
developments as signs that job growth is slowing to a more 
sustainable pace, and wages are growing slowly enough to keep from 
touching off inflation.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed at a four-day high today,  
buoyed by a strong showing on Wall Street as inflation fears 
cooled. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies had one 
of its biggest percentage gains this year, rising 7.13 points, or 
2.3 percent, to close at 312.32. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, 
which tracks 297 companies in countries that joined the single 
currency, closed up 7.78 points at 327.22. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 
50 Index rose 90.74 points to 3,809.11, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index

	Coca-Cola Predicts Lower Earnings  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. said today third-quarter  
earnings will fall short of expectations. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola 
predicted earnings per share will be 34 cents to 35 cents this 
quarter, compared with analysts' predictions of 36 cents. On top of 
that, the company said it will reduce earnings by an additional 2 
cents to 3 cents a share because of the recall stemming from a 
health scare linked to Coke in Belgium and France. Coke blamed slow 
growth in beverage sales on the continuing economic turmoil abroad. 
Coca Cola stock was down 2 1/8, or 3.57 percent, at 57 3/8 today.

	Workers Become More Demanding  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- This Labor Day, thousands of workers will mark  
the holiday either on strike or thinking about walking a picket 
line. Labor experts say despite agreements like the contract 
reached between Boeing and its machinists earlier this week, unions 
are growing more aggressive and more willing to walk out. Nine 
straight years of economic growth, a string of high-profile 
strikes, and a chance to win back concessions from past contracts 
have put pressure on negotiators to bring back good deals. Bill 
Johnson, president of Aerospace Machinists Industrial District 
Lodge 751 in Seattle, said Wednesday after his union approved the 
Boeing contract. ``You can take on a major corporation and be 
successful.''

	WHO Decries Flawed Drug Donations

<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Up to two-thirds of the drugs donated during  
humanitarian emergencies are unsuitable, badly labeled or near the 
end of their shelf life, the U.N. health agency Friday as it issued 
tightened guidelines on drug donations. Medical staff in countries 
in crisis have had to waste their time sorting out masses of drugs 
that they cannot use and that are costly to dispose of, the World 
Health Organization said. The updated WHO guidelines urge donors to 
ensure that their gifts respect the wishes of the receiving 
country, avoid double standards in quality and are based on good 
communication with the recipients.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund's next loan

minister said today as he insisted that no previous IMF money was 
misspent. Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said the IMF board in 
Washington, which had planned to meet later this month, may not 
convene until October to discuss releasing the second installment 
of a $4.5 billion loan to help Russia pay its debts. Russian 
officials have said that a visiting IMF delegation was satisfied 
with the government's adherence to loan conditions. The IMF team 
flew out on Friday, but did not comment on its findings.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin, who has remained silent  
on an alleged money laundering scandal linked to Russia, summoned a 
top security officer to the Kremlin today for private talks on the 
controversy. In another corruption case, Russia's suspended chief 
prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, confirmed today that Yeltsin and his 
daughters were linked to an investigation into an alleged bribery 
scandal. In the most serious corruption case, U.S. investigators 
are trying to determine whether Russian criminal groups laundered 
up to $10 billion through the Bank of New York. No one has been 
charged with a crime, and the Russian government has not been 
accused of any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Confederate Flag Is Issue in S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The Democratic mayors of South Carolina's  
two largest cities said Friday the Confederate flag should be 
removed from the Statehouse and put in a granite memorial on the 
Capitol grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Mayor Bob Coble, who along with business leaders  
unsuccessfully sued the state in 1994 to force the flag down, and 
Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. made the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
has sued over Mississippi's flag and wants tourists to boycott 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	While opponents say the flag is a symbol of racism, supporters  
say it represents Southern heritage and South Carolinians' 
sacrifices in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of moving the flag to a memorial has been offered in  
the past, but this is the first time specific design plans for a 
monument have been made. Legislators, who have the sole power to 
remove the banner, have quashed similar ideas in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.5 million monument's 4 1/2-foot-tall granite wall would be  
engraved with the names of more than 20,000 South Carolina soldiers 
who died in the Civil War. The five flags of the Confederacy would 
fly on poles at the wall and at the center would be the flag now 
atop the Statehouse. Thirteen stars on the monument floor would 
represent the states of the Confederacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The monument we believe takes away the Confederate battle flag  
away from those who have misappropriated it and puts it in a 
revered, moving and appropriate historical shrine,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina is the only state to fly the Confederate flag  
over its Statehouse, though parts of the flag, with its blue cross 
and white stars on a red background, are incorporated in the 
Georgia and Mississippi state flags.

<HEADLINE>  Boy Finds Pirates' '79 Series Trophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The missing 1979 World Series trophy turned up  
behind a Pittsburgh-area church, and the boy who found it got to 
visit with the Pirates on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it remained unclear exactly how the trophy disappeared  
from the lobby of the Allegheny Club at Three Rivers Stadium and 
authorities continued their investigation, now armed with 
fingerprints taken from the well-traveled trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe somebody's conscience was bothering them and they  
decided to turn it in,'' said Det. Donald Pasquarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Offerman, 12, was doing cleanup work Friday morning at a  
church when he found a black plastic bag outside the back door. He 
saw the trophy gleaming from the top of the bag and hailed firemen 
who were conducting a fundraiser in the neighborhood, after which 
they contacted police. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw it at first I knew what it was, but I didn't want  
to believe it,'' said Offerman, who had seen television reports 
about it being taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasquarelli said the freckle-faced youngster mentioned to police  
that he was a big fan of the Pirates, and told him he knew the team 
was back in town Friday for a game against the San Francisco 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so cute,'' Pasquarelli said. ``He said, `Hey officer,  
I'm free tonight. I don't have anything to do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pasquarelli said he knew someone at the Allegheny Club, and a  
few phone calls later, the Pirates had arranged for Offerman to 
meet his favorite player, second baseman Warren Morris. He was also 
given tickets to attend the game with family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Offerman walked awestruck across the field and  
visited in the dugout with Pirates manager Gene Lamont. He tried on 
a few hats before finding one that fit just right; Lamont told him 
to make sure and roll the bill just right. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's eyes opened wide as Morris walked up to him. When  
asked what position he would play, Offerman said second base. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd better watch out, Mo,'' Lamont teased.  
</P>
<P>
	Offerman doesn't really remember much about the 1979 World  
Series when the Pirates won the trophy, but he wanted to make sure 
the trophy got back to its proper place, so officials made sure he 
was the one to put it back into the trophy case. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a real good kid, just like out of a movie or something,''  
Sgt. Mark Ninehouser said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was minor damage to the award; two pennants -- the Boston  
Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics -- were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy has rarely left the stadium since it was donated by  
the Galbreath family, former owners of the team. But sometime 
between 5:15 p.m. and 6 p.m. Wednesday, during a private corporate 
party at the club, the trophy disappeared from an unlocked glass 
display case. Authorities and a memorabilia expert estimate the 
value of the trophy at $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegheny Club president Kevin Vaughn said they don't think it  
was a guest who took it. A guard is posted at the stadium entrance 
to check the guest list for anyone coming in and likely would have 
noticed someone leaving with something that stands 3 feet tall and 
weighs about 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the trophy is returned, they're in there reviewing  
all the security measures,'' Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh burglary detectives were questioning employees and  
some 100 guests who attended the private evening party, which was 
hosted by a club member. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must have gone out into the stadium area,'' Vaughn said.  
``We have no idea how they got it, actually.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 127  
points in today's early going. Advancers on the New York Stock 
Exchange hold a 5-1 lead over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 64 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index

<P>
	The financial markets are reacting favorably to the latest  
unemployment news from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The August jobless rate was down a notch to 4.2 percent, even as  
payrolls rose by just 124,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a wage-inflation gauge in the report showed no cause for  
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came as financial markets have been bracing for bad  
news about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't get that bad news with today's report.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Dad Charged in Daughter's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUTLEDGE, Ga. (AP) -- A man stomped his 7-year-old foster  
daughter to death when she threw a tantrum because he wouldn't buy 
her a doll, sheriff's officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies charged 35-year-old Paul Morris with murder  
and cruelty to children after an autopsy showed the girl died from 
a ruptured liver. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack happened Sunday when the Morris family had returned  
from a mall. Morris and his wife bought one of their sons football 
cleats, and the girl was upset because she wanted a doll. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a family that just goes out and buys a lot of  
stuff all at one time,'' said Sheron Vance, an investigator with 
the Morgan County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Vance said Morris hit the unidentified girl with his fists and a  
belt. Then he stomped on her and jumped on her with both feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd lost it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Morris and his wife were trying to adopt the girl, who had been  
living with the family for about five months. She had been taken 
away from her natural parents because she was born addicted to 
cocaine and had been sexually and physically abused.

<HEADLINE>  Collins Resigns As Angels' Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A tearful Terry Collins resigned as the  
Anaheim Angels' manager on Friday, less than three months after the 
last-place team gave him a two-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Maddon, the Angels' bench coach, will take over as interim  
manager for the rest of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim began Friday with a nine-game losing streak and a 51-82  
record, the worst in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and general manager Bill Bavasi said the manager was not  
forced out. The two had a long talk Thursday night, and both 
decided it would be best if he quit now. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi said he made his recommendation to Collins ``a little bit  
for the club and mostly for Terry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's not bitter, but I'm bitter. This club had every  
reason to respond and didn't. This is just bad chemistry in the 
clubhouse,'' Bavasi said. ``The team didn't quit on Terry; I can't 
imagine anybody quitting on Terry. ... They quit on themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels were still in contention at the All-Star break, but  
lost 37 of their next 47 to plummet into last place in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, the team's got to perform,'' Collins said.  
``When you don't perform, the manager's accountable. I had a 
feeling today that this is the time. I tried everything I knew, 
from patting them on the back to try to motivate them to kicking 
them in the butt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 50, hadn't spoken to any of the players about the  
decision, although he said he planned to talk later with some of 
them individually. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision apparently had lot more to do with the players'  
squabbling among themselves than it did with the team's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday in Cleveland, I had to address a couple of issues  
again and was unable to talk about the game, and that's when it hit 
me,'' Collins said. ``I won't miss the bickering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Bavasi asked some players for their opinion of the manager  
before Collins' contract was renewed, players seemed to splinter 
into pro- and anti-Collins factions. A few unidentified players 
complained about Collins' managing style, but he was given the 
extension anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Randy Velarde, who publicly took issue with  
Collins, was traded to Oakland along with starting pitcher Omar 
Olivares for three minor leaguers on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest clubhouse flareup came when reliever Troy Percival  
complained that not all of his teammates were on the field during a 
brawl with in Cleveland on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident began began after Percival allowed a three-run  
homer to Richie Sexson, capping a 10-run, eighth-inning rally, and 
then hit David Justice with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo Vaughn was in the clubhouse watching on TV and went to the  
dugout, but said he arrived too late to go on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Percival noted that some players hadn't participated in the  
fight, an apparent reference to Vaughn. The following day, Vaughn 
complained that no Angels' pitcher has retaliated this year after 
he was hit, and criticized Percival for hitting Justice, saying, 
``Take a beating like a man and get the next out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi said the makeup of the team doesn't seem to be working,  
and that he accepted responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than we're going to be looking for a manager the rest of  
this season, we're going to be looking at the players,'' he said. 
``I don't know how they're going to react to this, and I'd be less 
than honest if I said I cared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim could be headed for the poorest season in the Angels'  
39-season history -- worse than the 1980 team's 65-95 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like they're the Harlem Globetrotters out there, and  
we're the Washington Generals,'' Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina 
said after Thursday night's 6-5 loss at Cleveland, which turned out 
to be Collins' final game. 
</P>
<P>
	After managing the Houston Astros to second-place finishes in  
the NL Central from 1994-96, Collins went to Anaheim and had a 
220-237 record with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in clubhouses where guys don't like each other,''  
Collins said. ``But when I was in Houston, they still went out and 
played hard every game. The manager has one hammer these days, the 
lineup card, and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team had high expectations after signing Vaughn to an $80  
million, six-year contract last November, and began the season with 
baseball's 13th-highest payroll at $51.5 million. But the season 
was filled with injuries and discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina was one of several key players sidelined for an  
extended period, along with Vaughn, outfielders Jim Edmonds and Tim 
Salmon, and pitchers Ken Hill, Tim Belcher, Jason Dickson, Mike 
James, Pep Harris and Jack McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, criticized in the past for being too intense, signed  
the extension on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't believe there's a better place to work,'' he  
said then.

	The ruling came in a class-action lawsuit that was brought on  
behalf of as many as 500,000 sick Florida smokers. In July, a jury 
decided in the smokers' favor, ruling that the industry produced a 
deadly product. The next step is to decide how much the smokers 
will get in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The question before the appeals court was whether the damage  
claims would be considered as a group, or individually. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has essentially devastated the most threatening aspect of  
the claim to the tobacco industry,'' said Martin Feldman, tobacco 
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``This is enormous news on this 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor who  
heads an anti-tobacco clearinghouse, conceded the ruling erased 
prospects for a crippling damage award. 
</P>
<P>
	A big verdict would have forced tobacco companies to post a  
large bond to appeal the case and could have forced a bankruptcy 
filing this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll just be ordinary multimillion punitive verdicts,''  
Daynard said. ``But this thing is still probably the most potent 
litigation on the horizon against the tobacco companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers on both sides were barred by a gag order from talking  
about the case, 
</P>
<P>
	The case was the first class-action lawsuit by smokers ever to  
go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the second round is set to begin. The jury will  
return to determine whether two sick smokers should be compensated. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are the nation's five biggest cigarette makers --  
Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, 
Lorillard Tobacco and the Liggett Group -- and two industry 
associations, the Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A and the 
Tobacco Institute Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	With Friday's decision from the 3rd District Court of Appeal,  
``there is no potential for damages to be decided on a group basis 
and, as a result, this case now doesn't look very different from 
the vast majority of cases brought against the industry,'' Feldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The individual claims will produce smaller dollar awards, and  
the industry will have an opportunity to wipe out the whole case by 
appealing once one damage award is set, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of recent tobacco cases have been mixed. In March, a  
jury in Portland, Ore., awarded $81 million to the family of a 
smoker who died of lung cancer. The month before, a woman with 
inoperable lung cancer won $51 million in San Francisco. Both 
awards were reduced by judges. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry won another Oregon case as well as lawsuits on  
behalf of unions in Ohio, three dead smokers in Tennessee and one 
in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- twice in Florida and once in New Jersey, Oregon and 
California. Both Florida verdicts and the New Jersey verdict were 
overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $206 billion national settlement reached with the tobacco  
industry in November bars states from suing to recoup the costs of 
treating sick smokers, but it does not prohibit lawsuits by 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Philip Morris surged on news of the ruling, trading in  
late afternoon up $2.37 1/2, or 6 percent, at $39.25 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the NYSE, R.J. Reynolds rose 75 cents a share to  
$28.37 1/2, Lorillard parent Loews Corp. shares were up $2.81 1/4 at 
$80.37 1/2 and Liggett parent Brooke Group Ltd. was up 18 3/4 cents a 
share to $19.31 1/4. On the American Stock Exchange, Brown &AMP; 
Williamson parent British American Tobacco Co. was up 12 1/2 cents.

<HEADLINE> Pirates World Series Trophy Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Someone made off with the gold World Series  
trophy won in 1979 by the Pittsburgh Pirates, but it turned up 
today behind a church. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-year-old boy was doing cleanup work at the church found it  
in a black plastic bag outside the back door, said Detective Donald 
Pasquarelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Mark Ninehouser said two pennants were missing from the  
trophy -- the Boston Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they still don't know who took the trophy or  
how it disappeared from the lobby of the Allegheny Club at Three 
Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe somebody's conscience was bothering them and they  
decided to turn it in,'' Pasquarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of events like the annual Pirates Fest in  
March and the grand opening of Lazarus department store last year, 
the trophy has rarely left the stadium since it was donated by the 
Galbreath family, former owners of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometime between 5:15 and 6 p.m. Wednesday during a private  
corporate party at the club, the trophy disappeared from an 
unlocked glass display case. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities and a memorabilia expert estimate the value of the  
trophy at $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think it was a guest,'' club president Kevin Vaughn  
said. ``What we think is that someone somehow got into the club and 
just walked out with it.''

	Today is Saturday, Sept. 4, the 247th day of 1999. There are 118  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 4, 1781, Los Angeles was founded by Spanish settlers.  
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1888, George Eastman received a patent for his roll-film  
camera and registered his trademark, Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1894, some 12,000 tailors in New York City went on strike in  
protest of sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1917, the American expeditionary force in France suffered its  
first fatalities in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1948, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands abdicated, citing  
health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, in the first live, coast-to-coast television broadcast,  
President Truman addressed the nation from the Japanese peace 
treaty conference in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus called out the National  
Guard to prevent nine black students from entering Central High 
School in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, Ford Motor Co. began selling its ill-fated Edsel  
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, the Food and Drug Administration issued a report  
calling birth control pills safe, despite a slight risk of fatal 
blood-clotting disorders linked to the pills. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, an Alaska Airlines jet crashed near Juneau, killing 111  
people. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz won a record seventh Olympic  
gold medal, in the 400-meter relay at the Munich Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: The Air Force launched its last Titan 3 rocket,  
which reportedly carried a reconnaissance satellite. Since 1964, 
the Titan 3 had sent more than 200 satellites into space. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: On the eve of a U.N.-sponsored conference on  
population in Cairo, Egypt, Vice President Al Gore told NBC the 
United States was seeking a blueprint for world population growth 
that rejected abortion as a family planning tool and an 
international right. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: During a visit to Ireland, President Clinton said  
the words ``I'm sorry'' for the first time about his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky, describing his behavior as indefensible.

</P>
<P>
	Thought for Today: ``One should respect public opinion insofar  
as is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but 
anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an 
unnecessary tyranny, and is likely to interfere with happiness in 
all kinds of ways.'' -- Bertrand Russell, English 
mathematician-philosopher (1872-1970).

<HEADLINE> Umpire Montague Misses Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ed Montague, a National League crew chief who  
supports union leader Richie Phillips, missed Friday's game between 
the Milwaukee Brewers and the St. Louis Cardinals, saying he was 
dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Montague, who survived the purge of 22 umpires, consulted with a  
trainer before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the doctor prescribes Gatorade for a malady, you have to  
be skeptical,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president for 
baseball operations in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson said baseball normally reviews the situation when an  
umpire misses a game because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Mike Winters and Kerwin Danley, Montague worked  
Thursday's game, and all three had `22'' stenciled on their caps. 
Montague was sharply critical of baseball commissioner Bud Selig 
during pregame interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Randazzo, one of the 25 new umpires hired by the American  
and National leagues, worked home plate Friday in place of Montague 
as part of a three-man crew that included Winters and Danley.

<HEADLINE>  Foyt Returning to Winston Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- An old face will make a new start next  
year in NASCAR when A.J. Foyt returns to Winston Cup racing as a 
car owner. 
</P>
<P>
	And Foyt, a four-time Indianapolis 500 champion and winner of  
the 1972 Daytona 500, will run the entire Winston Cup schedule for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 64-year-old Foyt, conditioned to winning championships  
with his Indy Racing League cars, is not abandoning the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just be doing a lot of commuting,'' Foyt said Friday at  
Darlington Raceway. ``It might be a little tough to do the 
Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in the same day, but I'll 
get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt, despite infrequent appearances he worked into his Indy-car  
career for more than two decades, is no stranger to NASCAR. And his 
operation out of a 30,0000-square-foot shop in Charlotte, N.C., 
will be run by longtime team manager and crew chief Waddell Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not getting into this just to run,'' said Foyt, who also  
announced a sponsorship deal with Conseco Inc., the financial 
services group that has backed his Indy-car effort. ``We want to go 
out there and finish in the top 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt realizes the difficulty of that with a single-car operation  
in a sport where all 23 races this year have been won by drivers 
from multicar teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's tough, and it was even when I raced here,'' said  
Foyt, who had seven victories in 128 NASCAR career starts. ``But if 
you hire the right people, you can make some things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much remains to be done before Foyt will be ready to field his  
first entry in the first race of the next century -- the 
season-opening Daytona 500. Most of the details will be left to 
Wilson, who built the engines and has called the shots for several 
Daytona 500 winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the unfinished business is selecting a driver and make of  
car. All Foyt knows at this time is that the car will be his 
familiar No. 14, the number Kenny Brack drove to both the IRL title 
last year and the Indianapolis 500 championship in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny likes those IROC cars,'' Foyt said of the all-star  
series in which Brack has driven stock cars. ``But I don't think 
he's ready for these Winston Cup cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt might consider owner-driver Ricky Rudd, and discussed  
buying his operation. Rudd, a 20-time career winner who lost his 
lucrative sponsorship, is still seeking backing to keep his own 
operation afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wouldn't rule out driving for Foyt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know A.J. is a fierce competitor, and I am, too,'' Rudd  
said. ``A.J. and I are alike in that if we were playing tiddlywinks 
we'd probably be kicking each other under the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt is the second open-wheel car owner to announce he's  
entering NASCAR next season. Cal Wells III, who owns cars in CART, 
is forming Winston Cup and Busch Series teams in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Aggies Defense Opens With Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- It's not a good time for No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M  
to be without linebacker Dat Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
	Nguyen, the Lombardi Award winner and departed leader of the  
Wrecking Crew defense, now plays for the Dallas Cowboys. The Aggies 
will have to find a defense for Louisiana Tech quarterback Tim 
Rattay when the two teams meet in Independence Stadium on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Rattay led the nation last season with 4,943 passing yards and  
46 touchdown passes, and the Aggies are gearing up all the 
defensive backs they can muster for their season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a situation where we have to get five or six  
defensive backs ready to play,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``If 
you get someone dinged up it complicates everything. We may have 
some guys rushed into the game that maybe wouldn't have played 
otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies lost linebackers Nguyen and Warrick Holdman and  
safety Rich Coady from last year's defense that didn't allow a 
touchdown pass from Rattay in a 28-7 victory at Kyle Field. The 
Aggies are the only team to deny Rattay a touchdown pass in 24 
starts at Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do try to put pressure on the defensive backs, make them  
play three or four extra guys,'' Rattay said. ``We do different 
things to make our offense successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rattay completed 28 of 40 passes for 240 yards in last week's  
41-7 loss to No. 1 Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a secondary game,'' A&AMP;M safety Brandon  
Jennings said. ``He's got three or four go-to guys instead of one 
like last year. If our secondary shows up and plays its game, we'll 
be okay. But you've got to be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take all of us. You can't beat him with just  
four defensive backs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs like to have at least three receivers on the field  
as targets for Rattay, whose quick delivery and beefy offensive 
line keep sacks to a minimum. Florida State got to Rattay only 
once. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their scheme is timed to get the pass off in 1.9 seconds,''  
Slocum said. ``It's almost impossible to get a sack. Maybe if no 
one touched you but even if a guy just steps in front of you the 
ball is gone before you get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Aggies are 15-point favorites, they're aware of the  
intensity they'll be facing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll go into Shreveport and all their fans will be having a  
good time before we get there,'' A&AMP;M punter Shane Lechler said. 
``They'll be talking about you and all your family. They'll play 
hard as long as they have a chance. If we take care of business 
we'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs play one game annually in Independence Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the big loss to Florida State, first-year coach Jack  
Bicknell is glad to have played the first game already. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great for me too,'' Bicknell said. ``It's so hard the  
first time you do anything. You don't know what to expect. I was 
very nervous at the hotel. Once we got on the field, I settle 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies victory last year was later forfeited when it was  
learned that fullback Tiki Hardeman was scholastically ineligible. 
Hardeman sat out the rest of the season and has regained his 
starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy McCown returns for his senior year at quarterback and  
he'll have veteran receivers Chris Cole and Chris Taylor to try to 
give the Aggies more passing punch. Hardeman will share time with 
huge sophomore Ja'Mar Toombs, who stepped into Hardeman's spot a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Dante Hall, who rushed for 1,024 yards last season,  
also is back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies (11-3 last season) played their final game of last  
season in Louisiana in a 24-14 loss to Ohio State in the Sugar 
Bowl. Their goal is to return to New Orleans in January since the 
Sugar Bowl will be for the national championship. Louisiana Tech 
finished 6-6 last season.

	Mideast Deal Said Approved  
</P>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinians leaders  
will sign an agreement tomorrow to restart a long-delayed West Bank 
pullback by Israel, clearing the way for an overall peace accord 
within a year, a Palestinian Cabinet minister said. Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright, shuttling between the Israelis and 
Palestinians, presided over the diplomatic triumph as the two sides 
overcame last-minute disagreements, mostly over the release of 
Palestinian prisoners. Word of the breakthrough came from 
Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath, who spoke to reporters 
as Albright met with Yasser Arafat at his headquarters here 
tonight.

	Pro-Indonesia Gangs Roam East Timor

<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Marauding gangs of pro-Indonesian  
militias set towns ablaze today and kept up the killing spree that 
has terrorized East Timor since a historic vote earlier this week 
on independence from Indonesia. Thousands of residents fled for 
their lives and frightened U.N. workers were forced to abandon 
their posts as the militias swept through towns in much of the 
territory. With results of the vote to be announced tomorrow and 
independence widely expected to prevail, many fear the violence may 
only get worse. The U.N. mission says it has been ``defenseless'' 
in the face of the deteriorating security situation.

	Reno Denies Rift With FBI Chief  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno denied that the  
escalating Waco controversy has strained her relations with FBI 
Director Louis Freeh. Even so, she said today that she is looking 
outside the FBI and Justice Department to find ``the perfect 
person'' to head an inquiry into the government's 1993 standoff 
with the Branch Davidians. A week after Reno acknowledged that her 
credibility was damaged by the belated FBI admission that 
incendiary tear gas canisters were used in the waning hours of the 
Texas siege, and with new tensions simmering over the FBI's release 
this week of previously undisclosed evidence, she insisted her 
relationship with Freeh remains good.

	Serb Opposition Leader Raps West

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- One of Serbia's main opposition  
leaders said his rivals in an anti-government group are trying to 
incite civil war in Serbia on the explicit order of the West, local 
media reported today. The accusations were bound to further deepen 
the rift between already bitterly divided anti-government forces

	Unemployment Drops to 4.2 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unemployment edged down to 4.2 percent last  
month, returning to a 29-year low, as a pre-Labor Day government 
report today spelled good news for job seekers without re-igniting 
inflation jitters on Wall Street. Despite the drop in the 
unemployment rate, businesses added a smaller-than-expected 124,000 
jobs to payrolls in August, after a gain of 338,000 jobs in July, 
and reported moderate wage growth, the Labor Department said.

	Tobacco Industry Wins Fla. Appeal

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The tobacco industry won a major victory today when  
a state appeals court ruled that damage claims in a landmark 
smoking case must be considered one smoker at a time. That removes 
the threat of a single multibillion-dollar verdict. The ruling came 
in a class-action lawsuit that was brought on behalf of as many as 
500,000 sick Florida smokers. In July, a jury decided in the 
smokers' favor, ruling that the industry produced a deadly product.

	Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 235.24

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks raced higher today after the government's  
employment report calmed fears about rising inflation and prompted 
a broad rally that included the biggest point gain in the history 
of the Nasdaq composite index. At the close of trading on Wall 
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 235.24 at 
11,078.45. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange led 
decliners 2,290-677. The Nasdaq rose 108.34 to 2,842.58, according 
to preliminary calculations, surpassing the previous high for a 
one-day point gain, 103.16, set on June 16.

<HEADLINE>  Alomar Doing it All for Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- His offensive numbers are eye-catching, and his  
defense at second base has been second to none. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Alomar has been everything the Cleveland Indians could  
have hoped for. In fact, they've never had a player like him. 
</P>
<P>
	By getting his 100th RBI in the Indians' 6-5 win over the  
Anaheim Angels on Thursday night, Alomar became the first player in 
club history to drive in 100 runs, score 100, hit 20 homers and 
steal 30 bases in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	A contrived statistic to be sure, but nonetheless one that  
points out Alomar's all-around excellence in 1999, and why he could 
be the AL's MVP this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is real special,'' Alomar said of RBI No. 100, already  
six more than his previous career best in 12 big-league seasons. 
``I never thought I would get there. I feel good about that, but as 
far as I'm concerned, the year is not over until we get to the 
World Series and win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Alomar hit a three-run homer -- his career-high 23rd --  
and drove in five runs to lead the Indians past the Orioles 7-6. 
The homer rallied Cleveland from a 6-4 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been 51 years since the Indians last won the Series, and  
despite a rash of injuries to key players all season, they're in 
position to make another run. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, which began a four-game series at Baltimore on Friday  
night, will likely clinch a fifth straight AL Central crown in the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, the Indians were expected to win baseball's weakest  
division, especially after signing Alomar as a free agent last 
November. But the 10-time All-Star has been even better than 
advertised, finally filling the biggest hole -- the club used 18 
different second baseman since 1996 -- in Cleveland's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was Robbie's 100th RBI?,'' Richie Sexson said  
incredulously after Thursday's game. ``For a second baseman, that's 
pretty unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unbelievable. That word has been used frequently this season to  
describe Alomar, who seems to make a sparkling defensive play every 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	During the series against the Angels, he made two plays that  
rank among his season's best. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night he made a diving backhanded stop on the edge  
of the grass in short right-center, and from a sitting position 
threw out Jim Edmonds at first. The previous night, he went far to 
his left, again made a diving grab, and from his belly, shoveled 
the ball backhanded in time to first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always take great pride in my defense,'' said Alomar. ``You  
can win a lot of games hitting, but you can win more with 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensively, Alomar has flourished batting third in the Indians'  
lineup behind Kenny Lofton and Omar Vizquel, and in front of Manny 
Ramirez, the majors' RBI leader. 
</P>
<P>
	His 22nd homer Thursday night matched his career-high set in  
1996 with Baltimore, and gave him the Indians' club record for 
homers by a switch-hitter in a season, passing Carlos Baerga and 
Eddie Murray, who each hit 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, completely healed after assorted injury problems the  
past two years, is among the league leaders in average (.331), RBIs 
(105), steals (32), on-base percentage (.429) and walks (84). He 
leads the league in runs (119), and would have to be among the top 
five candidates for MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would mean a lot,'' he said. ``But that's not something I'm  
shooting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar joined the Indians so he could be reunited with his  
brother, Sandy, the Indians' catcher who has spent most of the 
season on the disabled list following knee surgery and is getting 
closer to a return. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win a World Series would top it all, 100 RBIs, MVP, all of  
it,'' he said. ``That's what I'm shooting for.''

<HEADLINE> Umpires Wear '22' As Tribute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Angry with baseball and many of his colleagues  
who didn't support the union leadership, National League umpire 
Steve Rippley said Friday he may retire next week and join the 22 
umps already out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just gets to the point where the whole thing gets to be  
mind-boggling,'' Rippley said. ``The money is not the issue here. 
It's what they've done and the principle, to see how they have been 
so ruthless, with how they treated the families, just for whatever 
reasons. It's not humane what they've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the remaining umps, including Gerry Davis, Jeff  
Kellogg, Jerry Layne, Ed Rapuano and Rich Rieker, wore ``MLUA 22'' 
on their caps Friday night in tribute to the 22 members of the 
Major League Umpires Association who were let go Thursday as a 
result of the union's failed resignation strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's to show that they are in our hearts and in our prayers,''  
Davis said. ``I haven't seen anything that stops it. We receive 
memos all the time on things that are legal. We've never received 
anything that says you can't have numbers written on your cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Hirschbeck had the initials of his son, and rightfully  
so. The Pittsburgh Pirates had `Kid' written on their hats for 
Jason Kendall. The Atlanta Braves had No. 14 for Andres 
Galarraga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations  
in the commissioner's office, wasn't pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect that at some time very shortly that practice  
will come to an end,'' he said. ``Baseball has been lenient with 
respect to cap adornments that refer to injured or seriously ill 
teammates and that kind of thing. Political statements are not 
viewed the same way, and we will take appropriate steps through the 
leagues to make sure that practice stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Montague, a supporter of the union leadership, wore ``22'' on  
his cap Thursday and missed Friday's game between Milwaukee and St. 
Louis, saying he was dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the doctor prescribes Gatorade for a malady, you have to  
be skeptical,'' Alderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian O'Nora, one of the new AL umpires, ejected Boston manager  
Jimy Williams and first-base coach David Jauss along with Damon 
Buford following an argument over a close play Friday night at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, a crew chief scheduled to work a weekend series in  
Chicago, called NL senior vice president Katy Feeney on Thursday 
and said he wanted to retire. She told the 16-year veteran to think 
it over, Rippley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Rippley spoke with Paul Runge, the league's  
executive director of umpires, who said he should take the weekend 
off, think about his decision and get back to him Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Triple-A umpire Dan Iassonga filled in for the games at Wrigley  
Field, joining a crew that included Wally Bell, Jerry Meals and 
Hunter Wendelstedt. Bell, who is in his seventh season, was one of 
three NL umpires who broke with the union leadership. Meals is in 
his third NL season and Wendelstedt is among the 25 newly hired 
umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Darling and Larry Poncino, who had been on Rippley's crew,  
were among the 22 umpires whose resignations were accepted. They 
worked their final games Wednesday and hope an arbitrator will 
order the NL to reinstate them after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My workload is going to go up, and they're not going to  
compensate me for it,'' said Rippley, scheduled to work in 
Milwaukee starting Tuesday. ``Some of these kids don't have a week 
in the big leagues. You don't have 25 qualified guys at Triple-A to 
be major league umpires. They are running the pennant races with 
unqualified umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep saying the minor-league system needs revamping. If  
the minor-league system is so bad, how can you pull 25 guys up? 
They're going around in circles. All they're doing is getting 
caught up in their own lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, a member of the union's board, said one reason to  
remain would be to provide a vote for union head Richie Phillips, 
who faces a battle from a dissident group that wants 
Baltimore-based agent Ron Shapiro to negotiate the umpires' next 
labor deal. 
</P>
<P>
	AL umpires Joe Brinkman, John Hirschbeck and Dave Phillips are  
organizing the dissidents, who are expected to try to form a new 
union by submitting a petition to the National Labor Relations 
Board. The dissidents, who caused the union's strategy of mass 
resignations to collapse in July, need at least 30 percent of 
umpires to call for an NLRB-supervised election, and they are 
convinced they have sufficient support. 
</P>
<P>
	If Rippley retires, he would receive his final paycheck in  
October and get about $310,000 in termination pay. The 45-year-old 
from Seminole, Fla., isn't sure what he would do next. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything arranged or set up,'' he said. ``I would  
think somebody would want me. Given how we travel, how we work 
under all that pressure, there's got to be a job out there where 
somebody would want me.''

<HEADLINE> Jets Receiver Out Six Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Wayne Chrebet, who didn't miss a  
game in his first four seasons with the New York Jets, will be 
sidelined for at least six weeks with a broken left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrebet was injured in the first quarter of Friday night's 38-17  
exhibition victory over the Minnesota Vikings. He wasn't touched on 
the play, which came on the artificial turf at Giants Stadium. The 
previous preseason games at the stadium this year were held on 
grass, which was removed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrebet will need surgery, in which a screw will be placed in  
the foot. He left the stadium on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big disappointment, because I felt I had myself in the  
best possible condition,'' said Chrebet, who had 75 receptions for 
1,083 yards and eight touchdowns last season. He also is considered 
one of the best third-down receivers in football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just running, I wasn't hit. All of a sudden, I felt a  
pop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets are fortunate that they have depth at the position. In  
fact, veterans Quinn Early and Dwight Stone had strong games 
against Minnesota after Chrebet was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Chrebet, who made the Jets in 1995 as an undrafted free  
agent, speedy Dedric Ward will become a starter. But the Jets use 
lots of four-receiver sets, so Early should see plenty of action, 
and Stone -- whose prospects of making the team were uncertain -- 
probably will get the fourth spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a little setback with Wayne,'' coach Bill Parcells  
said. ``But you've got to go on. Every team has them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde said he's already looking  
forward to Chrebet's return in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be back to help the team win a lot of games,''  
Testaverde said. ``No question, when you miss a player of this 
caliber, he will be missed a lot. We've worked together so much 
over the last year, and I will miss that.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Galarraga Back With the Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Big Cat is back, and so is his familiar big  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga, sidelined since  
spring training after undergoing cancer treatment, won't be playing 
this season, but his cancer is gone and he'll be on the bench for 
the remainder of the year rooting his teammates on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello everybody. I missed you guys,'' Galarraga said after  
appearing at a Turner Field news conference. ``I want to thank you, 
the fans, my family and God for praying for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing his familiar No. 14 uniform, Galarraga hung out with his  
teammates during batting practice and returned to the field shortly 
before the game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, accompanying 
coach Pat Corrales as he brought out the lineup card. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave Galarraga a standing ovation and one fan held up  
a sign that said, ``The Braves Big Cat Is Back. Welcome Back 
Andres.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for him,'' shortstop Walt Weiss said. ``I think it's  
going to be fun for him to be around the guys for a while. It's 
great to see him. He looks good. His spirits are high. They always 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Friday, Galarraga had remained home in West Palm Beach,  
Fla., while undergoing treatment. His black-and-gray hair, which 
fell out during chemotherapy, has grown back. 
</P>
<P>
	``All throughout the treatment, we've been watching his tumor  
and it actually has disappeared, so we're very, very happy and 
excited,'' said Galarraga's physician, Dr. Luis Barreras, who was 
at the first baseman's side during the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors discovered a cancerous tumor pressing against  
Galarraga's spine on Feb. 18. He underwent chemotherapy for four 
months (six treatments in all, one every three weeks) followed by 
radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chemo was the toughest part,'' said Galarraga, adding ``it  
really made me sick for 2-3 days after the treatment, but I can't 
complain. I've been positive all the time and I can play baseball 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who admitted he has added about 25 pounds to his  
6-foot-3, 235-pound frame, said he will be in uniform and travel 
with the Braves the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to be here to be with the team, at least in the  
dugout,'' he said, adding that he will provide support ``all the 
way to the World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves had a 3 1/2-game lead over the New York Mets in the NL  
East prior to Friday's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Barreras said Galarraga can begin workouts in November and is  
expected to be ready to play when spring training opens in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be able to play next year, but for right now  
he'll just be a big support for his team. I think his smile will be 
enough,'' Barreras said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who turned 38 in June, was an All-Star last year when  
he had a .305 average and led the Braves with 44 homers and 121 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling young. I feel healthy and I'm not thinking of age.  
A lot of players play past 40. Why not me?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who signed a $24.75 million, three-year contract with  
the Braves before the 1998 season, also has played with Montreal, 
St. Louis and Colorado. He has a .290 career average with 332 
homers and 1,172 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska Healthy and Ready To Roll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Bobby Newcombe and DeAngelo Evans are  
healthy. The defense is sound and coach Frank Solich is over any 
first-year jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska, it would seem, is ready to roll.  
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-ranked Cornhuskers open the season Saturday at Iowa,  
which will be playing its first game with Kirk Ferentz as coach. 
It's a tough way for a new coach to start, especially when facing 
an opponent intent on making amends after losing four games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	A season with just four losses would be a huge success at Iowa,  
which went 3-8 last fall in coach Hayden Fry's final year. At 
Nebraska, it was devastating because it came one year after the 
Cornhuskers went 13-0 and shared the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to prove something to ourselves,'' wide receiver Matt  
Davison said. ``The four losses just didn't sit well with us. We 
want to come out this year and re-establish ourselves as a 
powerhouse, that Nebraska is a team to be reckoned with every 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cornhuskers will attempt to do that against a team that's a  
bit of a mystery to Solich, starting his second season as Tom 
Osborne's successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Fry coached Iowa for 20 years and opponents knew what to expect,  
to the point that critics chirped the Hawkeyes had become too 
predictable. While Ferentz worked under Fry in the 1980s, he has 
made several other stops and spent the last six seasons as an NFL 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Ferentz's assistants are new at Iowa, including the  
offensive and defensive coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have good athletes, a lot of speed,'' Davison said.  
``We're going to have to do a lot of play action and things like 
that to make things work on offense. We need to be prepared for 
about anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferentz, on the other hand, knows what to expect from Nebraska.  
The Cornhuskers will hand the ball to their I-backs, they'll run 
some option with Newcombe, sprinkle in a few passes and depend on 
their offensive line to knock people down. The problem is stopping 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	That challenge alone should be enough to motivate his team,  
Ferentz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this doesn't get our guys' motor going, I don't know what's  
going to,'' he said. ``There are a lot of positives about this 
thing. Hopefully, our guys will play hard and have a little fun 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska appears to have the tools to handle Iowa, which had the  
worst offense in the Big Ten last year and doesn't have much depth 
on defense. For starters, Newcombe and Evans are at full strength 
after injury-plagued seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe recovered from the torn knee ligament that kept him out  
of seven games last season, and he beat out Eric Crouch in a much 
publicized battle for the starting job. Crouch also runs the option 
well and will play in both halves Saturday, Solich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferentz said it wouldn't have made any difference who the  
Cornhuskers started. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping neither one of them would be starters,  
actually, but that didn't work out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, slowed by groin, tailbone and toe injuries, has played in  
only three games since rushing for 776 yards in 1996, the 
third-best figure by a Nebraska freshman. He'll share time with Dan 
Alexander, who was impressive in preseason after running for 369 
yards in limited duty last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Kyle McCann won a three-way duel to start at  
quarterback for Iowa. McCann started five games last season and 
completed 54 percent of his passes for 1,179 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferentz said McCann will be allowed to play through his  
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan is to let Kyle go and play,'' Ferentz said.  
``Obviously, we reserve the right to make a change at any time, but 
I think at the quarterback position, you don't want a guy out there 
peeking over his shoulder all the time. I don't think that's a 
healthy thing.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Seeks All Waco Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered government lawyers to  
submit all evidence from the Branch Davidian compound siege to his 
court by Oct. 1 or face contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The order issued Thursday by Judge Walter Smith of Waco comes in  
response to a U.S. Justice Department motion this week challenging 
his authority to take control of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith next month is scheduled to begin hearing a wrongful death  
lawsuit filed against the government by Branch Davidians who 
survived the April 1993 federal raid on their compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Department of Public Safety had requested that Smith  
take control of Davidian evidence it was holding for the Justice 
Department, saying it thought the agency was being used by the 
federal government to keep evidence from public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said U.S. Attorney Bill Blagg, whose jurisdiction includes  
Waco, must appear before him on Oct. 1 to explain why the 
government should not be held in contempt if it doesn't comply with 
his order. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department contends gathering, copying and  
transferring the evidence would be ``an unwarranted and substantial 
burden'' on the government. 
</P>
<P>
	David Koresh and about 80 of his followers -- following a 51-day  
standoff -- died in the April 19, 1993 raid and subsequent fire at 
their Mount Carmel compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno is seeking an outsider to head an  
independent inquiry into the siege in the wake of reports that the 
FBI used incendiary devices. The FBI had previously denied such 
devices were used. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Caddell, a lawyer representing the Davidians in the  
wrongful death lawsuit, said ``it's clear that the Justice 
Department and the FBI are not trustworthy custodians of the 
evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department is considering an appeal of the order.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Bottenfield To Miss Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals 16-game winner Kent  
Bottenfield will miss his scheduled start Saturday to rest a flexor 
strain in his pitching elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Thompson will make his Cardinals' debut against the  
Milwaukee Brewers in the afternoon game. Bottenfield likely will 
pitch in his next scheduled start, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bottenfield, a 14-game winner at the All-Star break, has been  
stuck on 16 victories for his last three starts and has won just 
once in his last five starts. He was outpitched by Florida rookie 
Vladimir Nunez in his last start, a 4-2 loss that extended St. 
Louis' losing streak to seven games.

<HEADLINE> Child Trapeze Swings Are Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government recalled about 60,000 trapeze  
swings Thursday after six children suffered serious cuts from 
exposed bolts. 
</P>
<P>
	The injuries occurred when children dropped down from an  
overhead ladder or fell or climbed onto the bolts, the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission said. The cuts on the children's arms 
required stitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The swings were sold as part of Backyard Products gym set,  
containing various other equipment, and has a wooden bar and rings. 
The bar is attached to the swing chains by a ``U-bolt'' bracket 
with bolts that are now considered too long. 
</P>
<P>
	Trapeze sets attached by a rope-type assembly are not included  
in the recall, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	Department, toy, discount, lumber and hardware stores nationwide  
sold the backyard gyms from December 1998 through July 1999 for 
$250 to $450. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers should stop using the trapeze swing immediately and  
call 888-446-0750 to order a free repair kit, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux's Penguins Takeover Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux owns six scoring titles, two  
Stanley Cup rings and several NHL records. Now, he also owns the 
Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 2 1/2 years after playing his final game, Lemieux became  
the first retired player to own a major sports team for which he 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	It took U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz a few minutes  
Friday to complete a $95 million closing that gave the team to 
Lemieux, who turned around the once-troubled franchise and battled 
back from Hodgkin's disease. The deal ensured the Penguins will 
stay in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the puck's on Mr. Lemieux's stick, and we've all seen what  
he's been able to do with that,'' Markovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour later, Lemieux appeared in a business suit and  
was introduced to the media as the new owner. He began his new 
career by lowering ticket prices on 3,500 seats at the Civic Arena 
and announcing the creation of a section of seats where families 
can buy tickets at reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Craig Patrick will run the hockey side of the  
organization; Lemieux promised he will stay on the business side of 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless somebody wants to know what the Hall of Fame center has  
to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants me to, I'll be glad to give him my opinion,''  
Lemieux said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little to smile about in the days leading up to final  
approval of the deal. Negotiations over a deal at the Civic Arena 
were breaking down with SMG, the Philadelphia-based group that 
leases the facility and rents space to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was finalized in a conference call Wednesday among  
Lemieux's group, SMG, the governor's office and U.S. Sen. Rick 
Santorum. SMG will invest $5 million in the team and Lemieux will 
pay $1.5 million in debts to the arena management company. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG will lease space to the team until 2004, after which time  
SMG's role would be reduced -- if the team is still playing at the 
38-year-old facility. Lemieux said he wants a new facility, but 
said it was not an immediate priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to bring the team out of bankruptcy,'' Lemieux  
said. ``We have to make it viable now. Hopefully, we can make this 
a great success story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SMG attorney Daniel Shapira said the two parties, who have had a  
rocky relationship, would be forced to get along now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, the Penguins will thrive and survive in  
Pittsburgh,'' Shapira said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, former co-owner Roger Marino took the franchise  
into bankruptcy court for protection from creditors. Lemieux, who 
had sued Marino for some $30 million in salary by the Penguins, 
became the head of a committee of creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, he was putting together a bid for the team.  
</P>
<P>
	On June 24, Markovitz -- whose only options were to approve the  
Lemieux plan or sign off on an alternative proposal that could have 
moved the franchise -- gave Lemieux the go-ahead. Lemieux said at 
the time he felt ``like a rookie again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has more than a dozen investors in his group, with about  
$52 million raised so far. He has the largest stake of all the 
owners, most of it coming in the deferred salary he was owed from 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a businessman just yet, but everyone can learn,''  
Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins begin training camp Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new era,'' said Patrick, adding he was worried about  
the prospect of starting training camp without the deal being 
finalized. ``I was afraid if this wasn't done, where the funds were 
coming from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to be back,'' Lemieux said.

<HEADLINE> Pirates World Series Trophy Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Someone made off with the gold World Series  
trophy won in 1979 by the Pittsburgh Pirates, but it turned up 
today behind a church. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-year-old boy was doing cleanup work at the church found it  
in a black plastic bag outside the back door, said Detective Donald 
Pasquarelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Mark Ninehouser said two pennants were missing from the  
trophy -- the Boston Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they still don't know who took the trophy or  
how it disappeared from the lobby of the Allegheny Club at Three 
Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe somebody's conscience was bothering them and they  
decided to turn it in,'' Pasquarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of events like the annual Pirates Fest in  
March and the grand opening of Lazarus department store last year, 
the trophy has rarely left the stadium since it was donated by the 
Galbreath family, former owners of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometime between 5:15 and 6 p.m. Wednesday during a private  
corporate party at the club, the trophy disappeared from an 
unlocked glass display case. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities and a memorabilia expert estimate the value of the  
trophy at $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think it was a guest,'' club president Kevin Vaughn  
said. ``What we think is that someone somehow got into the club and 
just walked out with it.''

<HEADLINE> First Day of New Umps Goes Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball games went on, even without the 22  
umpires who lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours after the departures of the veterans became official  
at 6 a.m. Thursday, an opponent of the union leadership said the 
other umps might be locked out until next summer unless Richie 
Phillips is toppled. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a chance one more umpire would join the 22. NL  
umpire Steve Rippley called the league office and said he was 
thinking of resigning, according to several management officials 
who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year veteran didn't quit Thursday, NL senior vice  
president Katy Feeney said, but it was unclear if he had made any 
final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no problems involving the 25 new umpires during  
Thursday's eight games, and none of the veteran umps who kept their 
jobs walked out in sympathy with the terminated 22, whose best 
chance to get back on the field is winning in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Foster, who became a permanent AL ump earlier in the day,  
ejected Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild during an argument in 
the sixth inning of Thursday night's game at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was fine,'' Rothschild said. ``He gave me a chance to walk  
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Cuzzi, one of 13 new NL umps, was among three newcomers in  
his four-man crew for the Phillies-Giants game in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult,'' he said. ``I have the plate today. I'm going  
out to work the best that I can. I don't know what to expect from 
the other guys. We have a young guy coming up from Triple-A. He's 
never worked a game in the big leagues before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That umpire, Jim Wolf, was called up from the minors as a  
fill-in for union president Jerry Crawford, who was with Phillips 
on Tuesday and Wednesday at federal court in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The first game for Wolf, who isn't among the 25 permanent new  
umps, involved the Phillies, for whom his brother, Randy, pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have butterflies big-time,'' Jim Wolf said. ``I've got a  
swarm in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal agreed to Wednesday night in Philadelphia,  
the 22 stopped work, but will be paid for the rest of the year. 
Whether they resigned, as owners say, or were fired, as the union 
says, will be decided by an arbitrator at a date not yet 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia branch of the American Arbitration Association  
gave each side a list of 15 arbitrators Thursday. If umpires and 
owners can't agree on one, they will take turns crossing out names 
until only one remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's lawyers are expected to try to convince the  
arbitrator not to decide the case, arguing that even if umps were 
terminated, their labor contract leaves those decisions up to 
league presidents, with no appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the 22 umps, managers weren't sure what to expect in the  
season's remaining 4 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality may not be what we're used to,'' New York Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said. ``Ideally, you would like to understand 
what the young umpires are going through. But if something happens 
in the eighth inning of a close game, you throw that all out the 
window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL ump Joe Brinkman, a leader of the group trying to replace  
Phillips, predicted owners would lock out umpires on Jan. 1, just 
as they did in 1995 when the previous labor deal expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``If nothing changes, I don't see us going back to work next  
season until June or July,'' Brinkman said. ``If Richie is gone, 
then that will change considerably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It appears opponents will attempt to petition the National Labor  
Relations Board to form a new union, according to several baseball 
lawyers who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty percent or more of eligible union members are needed to  
petition the NLRB to conduct an organization election. Depending on 
whether the 22 count, there are either 71 or 93 umpires, meaning 22 
or 28 umpires are needed on a petition. Ultimately, the NLRB 
determines who is eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``My negotiator is still Richie Phillips and will be Richie  
Phillips, and it won't change,'' said Ed Montague, an NL ump who 
kept his job. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires' departures resulted from the union's failed  
strategy of mass resignations, designed to force an early start to 
negotiations for a contract to replace the labor deal that expires 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of negotiating, baseball accepted the 22 resignations  
and hired 25 replacements from the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a brand-new crew put together, and the first time we've  
worked together as a crew,'' AL ump Dan Morrison said after his 
game in Baltimore on Thursday night. ``It's like starting all 
over.''

	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians have  
overcome their last disagreements and forged a new West Bank 
land-for-security accord, a Palestinian cabinet minister said 
today. The agreement will be signed tomorrow, Palestinian Planning 
Minister Nabil Shaath told reporters as Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrapped up 
their talks. The deal would restart a long-delayed West Bank 
pullback by Israel and release of Palestinian prisoners and could 
clear the way for an overall peace accord within a year.

predicted earnings per share will be 34 cents to 35 cents this 
quarter, compared with analysts' predictions of 36 cents. It also 
said it will reduce earnings by an additional 2 cents to 3 cents a

<HEADLINE> Cuba Contridicts Pan Am Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro took the offensive today on  
recent scandals involving Cuban athletes, saying his country's own 
investigation shows that gold medalists who tested positive for 
drugs at last month's Pan American games were the victims of a 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all a colossal lie, an infamous and shameful lie, a  
criminal plundering of merits won through denial, tenacity, 
consecration and sacrifice,'' the Cuban leader said during a 
much-anticipated three-hour appearance on live national television 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro called for the unusual television program, which included  
the presence of 14 foreign journalists and five Cuban journalists. 
No questions will be allowed until the completion of the second 
half of the program, scheduled to resume tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, Castro, a leading sports official and a top  
sports doctor said that multiple urine tests of weightlifters 
William Vargas and Rolando Delgado conducted by Cuba and sent to 
three different laboratories in Europe all tested negative for the 
anabolic steroid Nandrolone. The tests were done four to five days 
after the two returned to the island from the games, the Cuban 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, urine tests analyzed by a Canadian lab during the games  
in Winnipeg showed Vargas and Delgado testing positive for the 
drug. Steroids are injected into the body to increase strength and 
bulk and can remain in a person's system for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 20 samples analyzed by three laboratories there was not  
a single reported presence of Nandrolone or its traces, not a 
single athlete in our weightlifting team was using drugs,'' Castro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro also defended high jump world champion Javier Sotomayor,  
who was stripped of his gold medal at the Pan Am games after 
testing positive for cocaine. The test, Castro said, was the result 
of a ``dirty political war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro questioned how the urine tests for Sotomayor and other  
Cubans were conducted at the games. The Cubans were required to 
drink water or other ``refreshing drinks'' before their tests and 
were given their tests in a room apart from athletes from other 
countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials have suggested that someone slipped the cocaine  
into Sotomayor's food or drink before the test, which was given 
shortly after won his fourth straight Pan Am gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be ``absurd'' to believe that Sotomayor consumed  
cocaine before that feat, because the large quantity found in his 
system would surely have impeded his performance, the Cuban 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials have become increasingly frustrated by what they  
believe is an orchestrated campaign by their enemies to discredit 
the communist country and its long respected sports program. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Pan Am games, they complained about Canadian news  
media that joked about and encouraged its athletes to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech followed a dispute last week in Houston at an  
International Amateur Boxing Association Championship event. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges initially awarded welterweight Timour Gaidalov of Russia  
a gold medal over Juan Hernandez of Cuba, setting off an angry 
protest by Cubans. Four of the five judges were later suspended by 
the AIBA's executive committee and the decision was reversed in 
favor of Hernandez.

<HEADLINE>  Canada Opens Francophone Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONCTON, New Brunswick (AP) -- Canada welcomed leaders from  
French-influenced countries to a three-day summit today, urging 
them to make human rights and democratic values their main goals 
heading into the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic development can only exist when there is peace, and  
basic freedoms are the foundations of peaceful societies, Canadian 
Prime Minister Jean Chretien told an opening ceremony for La 
Francophonie, an organization of French-speaking or 
French-influenced countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights has become a significant issue at La Francophonie's  
three-day summit in this eastern Canadian city, primarily because 
many of the francophone nations attending -- Congo, Burundi and 
Burkina Faso, for example -- are reported by rights organizations to 
be among the worst violators of basic freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us all work to ensure that the legacy we leave to future  
generations is a Francophonie made up of countries where democratic 
values are embraced,'' Chretien told the 52 delegates, many of them 
heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
	The francophone organization is intended to promote and maintain  
French language and culture, primarily among many of France's 
former colonies in Africa. At the 1997 Hanoi summit, though, 
delegates decided to broaden their mission to also include more 
political and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Rights activists are urging it to broaden its role further,  
putting human rights on the official agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The topic's absence from this year's agenda prompted groups like  
Amnesty International to stage their own parallel summit on the eve 
of the opening, decrying the presence of rights violators in Canada 
and the failure of La Francophonie to do anything about the issue 
that affects so many members. 
</P>
<P>
	The parallel summit put forward a list of demands asking that  
such issues as poverty, torture, political executions, sexual 
mutilation of women and the use of children as workers and warriors 
be meaningfully discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the welcoming ceremony at the University of Moncton, a  
few dozen protesters carried signs demanding Burundi's president, 
Pierre Buyoya, who staged a coup during the last francophone summit 
in Canada in 1987, be tried by an international criminal tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Canada is a country of justice,'' said Ferdinand Ngendabanka,  
chairman of a Burundian community group in Ottawa. ``They make 
justice in Kosovo, Bosnia, they should do it for countries in 
Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac said the francophone  
organization shouldn't take any steps to sanction members, but 
should be able to exclude those who seriously violate rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be well imagined that the people that don't respect  
certain rules won't be accepted in the club by people who respect 
the rules,'' he said in an interview Thursday night with 
Radio-Canada, the French-language network of the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	France has proposed that the Francophone organization take on a  
monitoring role to make sure its former colonies are respecting 
international norms of human rights. Also, the organization is 
planning to set up a series of international conferences over the 
coming year on human rights in collaboration with the Commonwealth 
of English-speaking countries.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Drops to 4.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unemployment edged down to 4.2 percent last  
month, returning to a 29-year low, as a pre-Labor Day government 
report Friday spelled good news for job seekers without re-igniting 
inflation jitters on Wall Street. Financial markets soared on the 
news and ended the week on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drop in the unemployment rate, businesses added a  
smaller-than-expected 124,000 jobs to payrolls in August, after a 
gain of 338,000 jobs in July, and reported moderate wage growth, 
the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists and investors viewed the developments as signs that  
job growth is slowing to a more sustainable pace, and wages are 
growing slowly enough to keep from touching off inflation. And 
that, economists said, could persuade the Federal Reserve to sit 
tight and not raise interest rates again at its Oct. 5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, which have been nervous about prospects of a  
third rate increase, were buoyed by August's unemployment report. 
The Dow Jones industrial average at 11,078.45, up 235.24. The 
Nasdaq composite index rose 108.34 to close at 2,842.58, according 
to preliminary calculations, surpassing the previous high for a 
one-day point gain, 103.16, set on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation-sensitive market for government bonds also  
rallied, pushing yields on 30-year Treasuries down to 6.01 percent 
from 6.13 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ``casts doubt on the need for another rate  
increase,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Standard and Poor's 
DRI. ``The economy is slowing down by itself, and inflation isn't a 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While low unemployment and strong wage growth appear to be good  
developments for workers, economists worry that it can be a recipe 
for sparking inflation. Their fear: Employers scrambling to find 
workers must woo them with higher wages and benefits, costs likely 
to drive up consumer prices if not constrained by other forces. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, economists were heartened that average hourly  
earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, grew a tiny 0.2 
percent to $13.30 in August, a 3.5 percent increase compared with a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the third consecutive monthly rise, slightly slower  
than July's revised 0.3 percent increase. The government's previous 
estimate was that average hourly earnings rose 0.5 percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``With wage inflation running at a 3.5 percent year-over-year  
pace, the argument for another Fed rate hike just doesn't make 
sense,'' said Richard Yamarone, an economist with Argus Research 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said August's unemployment report substantially  
reduces the odds of an Oct. 5 rate increase by the Fed. They didn't 
close the door to a rate increase in November, which would that 
depend on what additional economic data has to say about the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a  
second time this year and hinted that additional rate increases may 
not be necessary unless the economy shows signs of overheating or 
if inflation breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.2 percent jobless rate in August, which followed a 4.3  
percent rate in July, matched May's level. Before that, 
unemployment last touched 4.2 percent in February 1970. The 
economic expansion, the longest in peacetime history, has given the 
country a low overall unemployment rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Labor Day 1999 we have much to celebrate,'' said Labor  
Secretary Alexis Herman. ``American workers have opportunities 
unlike any they have had before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 124,000 jobs created in August occurred as gains in  
computer, data processing, health care and other jobs helped offset 
continued job losses at factories. Many economists expected around 
210,000 jobs to be created last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of service sector jobs increased by 132,000, led by  
gains in computer services which grew by 15,000 jobs. Doctors' 
offices, hospitals and other health-care facilities added 19,000 
new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall retail employment held about steady. Bars and  
restaurants dropped 38,000 jobs, but jobs added at car dealers and 
furniture stores helped offset that decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers, still feeling the lingering affects of the global  
financial crisis, cut 63,000 jobs in August. That more than wiped 
out an increase of 51,000 jobs in July. But Herman said she's 
optimistic about manufacturing's future because she said the rate 
of job loss is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction jobs, meanwhile, declined by 29,000, largely  
offsetting gains in the previous two months. Economists said job 
losses in construction as well as in other businesses could reflect 
that employers are having trouble finding qualified people in the 
tight labor market.

<HEADLINE> Romanowski Issues Apology on Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski, under  
investigation for obtaining a prescription drug through fraud, 
issued an apology after Friday night's exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't talk about any of that right now,'' Romanowski said,  
``but I apologize to my teammates, the organization and all the 
fans that support me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this won't affect me. Hopefully, somehow and some  
way I can get through this, that I can be ready to play next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the Broncos' 34-3 victory over San Francisco ``very  
much of a good break. Whenever I can go out on the field and do 
what I love to do, I have the passion for the game. It was nice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't distracted. Once I took the field I was ready to  
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski's coach, Mike Shanahan, said he has known about the  
potential legal problems for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just disappointed it all came out without going to the  
D.A. first,'' Shanahan said. ``People will eventually see that this 
is not a serious deal. I'll be surprised if there ever is a charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew about it around three weeks ago, maybe a month ago.  
We'll just have to let the courts do their job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski could be charged with felony counts of fraud and  
deceit and conspiracy, and a misdemeanor charge of unlawful use of 
a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas County sheriff's officials said Romanowski's wife,  
Julie, and another woman allegedly obtained bogus prescriptions 
from a doctor for the drug Phentermine and gave it to Romanowski 
for his personal use. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is an appetite suppressant but also acts as a  
stimulant.

<HEADLINE> Prep Football Player Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLADWIN, Mich. (AP) -- Gerald Lane, a 15-year-old high school  
football player who ran for a touchdown, collapsed moments later 
during a football game, then died at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane collapsed during the third quarter of Gladwin's game  
Wednesday night against Meridian and died after arriving at 
MidMichigan Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Charles Jones said Lane ran for a touchdown  
``unscathed, not even touched. He was walking out of the end zone 
and just collapsed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The death is the second in less than a year involving an area  
athlete. In February, Billy Geiling, a freshman basketball player 
from Meridian, fell to the court and died during a game against 
Roscommon. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of Geiling's death was ruled a rare cyst at the stem  
of his brain that cut off blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
	Gladwin County medical examiner Dr. James Sullivan planned an  
autopsy Thursday. Jones said it wasn't immediately known whether 
Lane had prior medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Gladwin athletic department and school officials were  
unavailable for comment.

<HEADLINE> Man Receives Gene Therapy Injection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A 36-year-old traffic controller has  
received a gene therapy injection for muscular dystrophy, testing 
the safety of a possible treatment for the debilitating disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muscular Dystrophy Association said Donovan Decker of Huron,  
S.D., is the first person to receive the injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerry Mendell, chairman of the Department of Neurology at  
the Ohio State University Medical Center, injected a muscle on the 
top of Decker's foot with genes for a needed muscle protein missing 
due a genetic flaw. The one-hour hospital procedure was performed 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker suffers from limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, a disease  
that he has had for more than 20 years, said MDA spokesman Jim 
Brown. He is the first of an expected six participants to receive 
the injection in the MDA-funded trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're cautiously optimistic about what this may mean for the  
future,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	In gene therapy, a working gene is inserted to compensate for  
genetic flaws like those that lead to muscular dystrophy, a 
progressive muscle disease that causes weakness. It is often fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 40 types of muscular dystrophy. The kind that  
Decker has mostly damages muscles that stabilize the hips and 
shoulders, and often leads to wheelchair use by middle age. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Decker's foot muscles received the therapeutic genes  
while the same muscle of the other foot was injected with a 
placebo. Researchers will take biopsies to compare the muscles in 
six weeks while also monitoring Decker for any adverse reactions.

<HEADLINE> S. Court Asked To Review Twins Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The threat of a move to North Carolina  
has been dead more than a year, but the Minnesota Twins might still 
be the target of an investigation into whether baseball conspired 
to get public money for a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Mike Hatch wants the U.S. Supreme Court to  
review a state Supreme Court decision that blocked such an 
investigation in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's predecessor, Hubert H. Humphrey III, launched the  
inquiry in 1997, when Twins owner Carl Pohlad was negotiating with 
a buyer who wanted to move the team to North Carolina. A sale 
agreement was to be signed only if the Legislature refused to help 
pay for a new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important to pursue the possibility that the independent  
owners of baseball may be threatening to boycott communities which 
do not increase public subsidies for ballparks,'' Hatch said in a 
statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organized baseball, unlike any other sport or industry, claims  
to have a complete and blanket exemption from antitrust laws,'' 
Hatch said. ``The state of Minnesota believes it has the right to 
look at professional baseball to see if they have violated 
antitrust laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twins president Jerry Bell said the organization was surprised  
by Hatch's request because the state Supreme Court decision was 
unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said neither the Twins nor major league baseball could  
be forced to comply with the investigation. Humphrey had asked for 
papers going back to 1959 to determine whether baseball officials 
illegally conspired by threatening to move franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins and the commissioner's office argued their conduct was  
exempt from state and federal antitrust laws because the U.S. 
Supreme Court held in 1922 that professional baseball was not 
interstate commerce and was exempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court followed that decision in its April  
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the sale and relocation of a baseball  
franchise ... is an integral part of the business of professional 
baseball and falls within the exemption,'' Justice Paul H. Anderson 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson wrote that the exemption ``may be an aberration''  
carved out by the U.S. Supreme Court, but the nation's highest 
court should retain the exclusive privilege of overruling its own 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court reviews only a fraction of the cases that  
come through its office. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey's request was for all documents related to revenue  
sharing, potential relocation and sale of major league baseball 
teams, and the construction and methods for obtaining new ballparks 
in Minnesota and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's an historic time for the court to take this  
case,'' said Jim Jacobson, assistant attorney general who manages 
the antitrust division. ``A number of factors are all coming 
together.''
