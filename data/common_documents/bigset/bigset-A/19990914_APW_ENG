<HEADLINE> Some Firms Exit Vitamin Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Several big agricultural and food companies say  
they will pursue their own claims for damages and have opted out of 
a $1.1 billion proposed settlement of a price-fixing case against 
vitamin manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the world's biggest vitamin makers are close to settling  
a complaint that they engaged in a nine-year conspiracy that 
allegedly resulted in artificially higher prices for hundreds of 
products from peanut butter to milk. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the biggest food companies that could win money in  
such a settlement have decided instead to go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill, Inc. filed its own suit last month, and Kellogg Co.  
filed in July. Mark Dollins, a spokesman at Quaker Oats Co., said 
Monday that the cereal maker ``is in fact opting out of the 
class-action'' settlement. But he declined to say whether the 
company will pursue its own action. ContiGroup Companies, formerly 
Continental Grain, had pulled out of the negotiations, according to 
a report in The Wall Street Journal, but declined to comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed settlement would be the largest ever paid in such a  
civil case. Last May, the Justice Department won a record $725 
million in criminal fines from two vitamin manufacturers -- Roche 
Holding AG of Switzerland and BASF AG of Germany -- to settle 
charges they colluded to divide up markets and set wholesale 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two companies, plus Rhone-Poulenc SA of France, and Eisai  
Co., Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. and Takeda Chemical Industries 
Ltd., all of Japan, are part of the tentative civil settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Hausfeld, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said he  
believed most of the companies that would be entitled to a 
settlement will remain in the case ``once they see the benefits of 
the settlement and once they see their shareholders' reaction to 
turning it down on the hopes that they can get something better on 
their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expected a settlement to be concluded within a few  
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the six defendants account for about 80 percent of  
bulk sales of the most popular vitamins. But under the agreement, 
nearly 1,000 corporate buyers of bulk vitamins would receive more 
than $1 billion, and 50 law firms would divide an additional $125 
million.

	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Associated Press, in a Sept. 10 story  
about the end of court-ordered busing to achieve racial balance in 
Charlotte schools, misreported the year of a U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling in the case.

	A federal judge's decision had launched the busing in 1969. The

<HEADLINE> IOC Apologizes to Olympic Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- IOC vice president Dick Pound  
apologized to Sydney Games sponsors on Tuesday for any negative 
fallout because of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound, who also heads the IOC marketing commission, defended  
recent reforms and stressed how much money the international body 
generates for local organizers such as the Sydney Organizing 
Committee for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG is still about $90 million short of reaching its record  
marketing revenue target of about $550 million, but Pound said he 
believed the shortfall could be made up as the IOC recovered from 
the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members resigned or were dismissed because of the  
bribery disclosures involving Salt Lake City's successful bid for 
the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have asked how we let this happen in the first  
place. I think the simple answer is we took our eye off the ball,'' 
said Pound, who chaired the IOC's ad hoc Salt Lake commission of 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, it was a breach of trust on our part and we accept  
full responsibility for the conduct of our members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian lawyer told a sponsors' workshop, ``We will try and  
make sure that it is temporary and demonstrate that your investment 
is one of the best marketing decisions you've ever made.''

<HEADLINE> Cornhuskers Starting New Backfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- It's mid-September, and already Nebraska  
coach Frank Solich has had a long season. 
</P>
<P>
	He's had to overhaul an already powerful offense that has scored  
87 points in two games. One change was his choice, the other was 
not, leaving the fourth-ranked Cornhuskers (2-0) with a reworked 
backfield headed into Saturday's game against Southern Mississippi 
(2-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Bobby Newcombe is switching to wingback, and Eric  
Crouch is taking over at QB. And frustrated running back DeAngelo 
Evans has quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably been the toughest couple of weeks, maybe months,  
of coaching for me,'' Solich, in his second year as a head coach, 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe and Crouch have been jockeying for the QB job since  
practice began in August. Newcombe got the first two starts, and 
although he wasn't as effective as Crouch, Solich gave no 
indication a change was coming. The overhaul is surprising for a 
team that has outscored opponents 87-7 this year and is tied with 
Florida at No. 4 in the AP Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Alexander, Nebraska's leading rusher with 121 yards this  
season, will replace Evans, who is the second player to leave the 
team this year. Solich said the departures are a sign of the times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very much in control of this football team and this  
program. Right now, I like where we're at. We're 2-0 and we're 
moving on into the third week,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those days are going to come along. You ask your players just  
to work through things and you do that as a coach also. We're 
moving forward. I feel comfortable about things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solich, who has fielded questions about his quarterback rotation  
since announcing it two weeks ago, hopes his decision to move 
Newcombe to wingback, where he played two years ago as a freshman, 
and start Crouch puts any quarterback controversy to rest before 
Nebraska plays the more difficult games of its schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will make the defense prepare in a much different fashion  
with both those guys on the field at the same time,'' Solich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Evans, thought to be Nebraska's next great running  
back before he was slowed by injuries, shocked the Cornhuskers and 
Solich. The injuries, which kept Evans out of all but three games 
last year, and the poor start this season upset him to the point 
where he no longer wanted to play, Solich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans and Solich met over the weekend, and the player's mind  
``seemed to be pretty well made up when we talked,'' Solich said. 
``In general, it really came down to the role he was playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska defeated California 45-0 on Saturday, but Evans  
finished with 5 yards on six carries as the Bears shut down the 
pitch on the Cornhuskers' option plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a normal day, when we run as many options as we did in that  
game, the I-back will end up with the football on numerous 
occasions and will have an opportunity for some big plays and a lot 
of yards. That did not happen in that ball game,'' Solich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches say sometimes there just isn't enough playing time to go  
around and keep everybody happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got the same problem here,'' Florida State coach Bobby  
Bowden said. ``I have two or three kids a week who come in to see 
me and say they aren't getting the ball enough. But it beats the 
alternative -- not having enough guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was unavailable for comment. He didn't attend Tuesday's  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Correll Buckhalter, thought to be leaving the team a week ago  
over a lack of playing time, is now the No. 2 I-back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I heard the rumor I didn't believe it,''  
Alexander said of Evans' departure. ``It's surprising, but at the 
same time there's nothing we can do about it as a team. That's 
DeAngelo's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans' decision was the latest development in a season of  
turmoil for the Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup quarterback Jay Runty transferred to NCAA Division II  
Nebraska-Omaha after Solich announced the preseason depth chart. 
Before the season opener at Iowa, Crouch was rumored to be leaving, 
though he and Solich said, while the quarterback was disappointed 
to be a backup, he hadn't considered quitting the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Buckhalter, who had just three carries in a 42-7  
blowout at Iowa in the season opener, was a no-show at practice for 
three days. Buckhalter said Tuesday he was frustrated by the lack 
of playing time, but also hadn't planned to leave school. 
Buckhalter was suspended for the Cal game, but will be back on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10, 215-pound Evans was considered a top prospect out  
of high school in Wichita, Kan., where he surpassed many of fellow 
Wichita native Barry Sanders' rushing records. 
</P>
<P>
	After running for 776 yards and 14 touchdowns as a freshman in  
1996, Evans sparked hope among Huskers fans that he would put up 
numbers comparable with such former greats as Mike Rozier and Roger 
Craig. A pelvic injury sidelined Evans in 1997, and last year he 
had knee surgery before the season and played in just three games, 
finishing with 227 yards on 38 carries.

<HEADLINE> 3 Lead In Baltimore Mayoral Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A white city councilman took an early lead in  
Tuesday's Democratic mayoral primary in Baltimore, a predominantly 
black city struggling with poor schools, a high drug-driven murder 
rate and a fleeing populace. 
</P>
<P>
	With 48 percent of precincts reporting, Martin O'Malley, who  
promised to clean the streets of open-air drug markets with a 
zero-tolerance policing strategy, had 27,042 votes, or 55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Former City Councilman Carl Stokes had 13,085 votes, or 27  
percent, and City Council President Lawrence Bell had 8,170 votes 
or 17 percent of the vote. Both are black. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were among 17 Democrats running in the primary, the  
election to win in this city where Republicans are outnumbered 9 to 
1. There were six candidates in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest poll showed Stokes and O'Malley in a statistical dead  
heat, with Bell not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1971, an incumbent was not on the  
ballot. Mayor Kurt Schmoke, the city's first elected black mayor, 
decided not to run for a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was almost comic. Among the original list of candidates  
were six with arrest records and three who had filed for 
bankruptcy. Police arrested one candidate on burglary charges after 
recognizing her on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, the best-known candidate, was damaged by revelations of  
his personal financial troubles and by an incident in which his 
supporters disrupted an O'Malley event. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes weathered revelations that he failed to pay taxes for  
several years and that his campaign literature falsely said he 
graduated from college. 
</P>
<P>
	Race is a key factor in Baltimore, where two out of three  
residents are black. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley has the support of prominent black state lawmakers, and  
Bell has been endorsed by the mostly white police union. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Jackson, who is black, was driving a van Tuesday plastered  
with O'Malley posters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken some flak from my friends,'' he said. ``This is the  
worst election I've seen in 25 years. It's been really divisive, 
and for no real reason other than, `Hey, we're black and let's keep 
it black.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the primary, Schmoke said the city's estimated  
59,000 drug addicts -- and the crime they create -- are the next 
mayor's key problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they focus their attention like a laser beam on that issue,  
then we may see a significant turnaround,'' said Schmoke, who did 
not endorse any candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	But he criticized the zero-tolerance policing strategy that  
O'Malley has made a centerpiece of his campaign and which Bell also 
supports. Schmoke said it could give police license to be overly 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	The general election is in November.

<HEADLINE> GOP Fuming About U.S.-Russia Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers are criticizing the  
Clinton administration's support for aid to Russia, as 
investigators widen their inquiry into allegations that Russian 
gangsters laundered billions of dollars through a major U.S. bank. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, called the Clinton  
policy toward Russia ``the greatest U.S. foreign policy failure 
since Vietnam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The unparalleled financial graft in Russia -- much of it  
apparently involving money from U.S. taxpayers -- marks the 
effective end of the Clinton-Gore administration's approach to 
Russian reform,'' Armey said Tuesday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stated purpose of the Clinton-Gore policy was to help  
Russia become a peaceful and productive free-market democracy. 
Instead, Russia has become a looted and bankrupt zone of 
nuclearized anarchy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman David Leavy said Armey's remarks were  
irresponsible and ignored ``the events that have happened in Russia 
in the last 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has ``made important strides'' in promoting  
``Russia's transition toward a free-market democracy,'' Leavy said. 
He cited Russia's voluntary disabling of nuclear weapons and the 
rise of personal and press freedom and an independent judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been put on the defensive by suspicions,  
arising from allegations of the money-laundering scheme using the 
Bank of New York, that International Monetary Fund loans and U.S. 
food aid to Russia may have been illegally diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican criticism came as Russian investigators were in  
Washington meeting with State and Justice Department officials to 
discuss the money-laundering case and ways they can cooperate in 
their inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators and prosecutors in France, Austria and Switzerland  
also have taken actions recently related to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, as the IMF's biggest member, has delayed  
deciding whether it should approve new loans to Russia from the 
international lending agency until a full accounting is made of the 
money already lent. The 182-nation IMF has lent Russia some $22 
billion since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore is coming under fire from Republicans for  
his close relationship with Russian leaders and his hands-on role 
in U.S.-Russian diplomacy, particularly as chairman of a joint 
commission on bilateral ties with former Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a congressional GOP strategy, Rep. Benjamin Gilman,  
R-N.Y., chairman of the House International Relations Committee, 
announced that he would hold a series of hearings on U.S. policy 
toward Russia, including the bilateral commission headed by Gore 
and Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's support for Russia ``has apparently gone  
hand in hand with a willing disregard for the high-level corruption 
within the (Russian) government,'' Gilman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Banking Committee plans hearings next week on the  
alleged money-laundering scheme involving as much as $10 billion at 
the Bank of New York, the 15th-largest U.S. bank. The Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee also plans to hold hearings soon, with 
topics to include corruption in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the House passed a measure, 419-0, aimed mainly at  
Russia that would impose sanctions on countries helping Iran 
develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said President Clinton's senior advisers  
would recommend he veto the bill because it would ``have the effect 
of undermining multilateral support that is vital to effectively 
fight proliferation.'' Clinton vetoed a similar bill last year.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Carver, 24, Dies After Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- NABF supermiddleweight champion  
Randie Carver died Tuesday, two days after losing consciousness in 
a title defense at Harrah's North Kansas City Casino. He was 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Carver, who had been in critical condition since undergoing  
emergency brain surgery late Sunday, went down in the 10th round of 
a 12-round bout with Kabary Salem. Family and friends had huddled 
at North Kansas City Hospital as Carver was kept on life support 
until he died Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pretty shaken, of course. This is something we've been  
dealing with since Sunday,'' said Sharon White, Carver's aunt who 
has been acting as family spokeswoman since the incident. ``What 
we'd like to do now is go home and get ourselves together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salem's manager, Scott Massoud, was stunned by the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, God. ... Oh, my God. I'm speechless,'' Massoud said from  
Brooklyn, N.Y. ``My thoughts and wishes go out to him and his 
family. God, what a loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carver, who was repeatedly head-butted in the early rounds of  
Sunday's fight, fell sluggishly to the canvas in the 10th round 
after taking an overhand right and a straight left from Salem. He 
tried on four occasions to get up, but could not even get up on his 
knees as he lost for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	After referee Ross Strada ruled a knockout, Carver's eyes  
appeared to go back in his head, and he lost consciousness. He was 
rushed to the hospital after paramedics worked on him for about 20 
minutes in the ring. Carver did not appear to ever regain 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Carver's supporters were upset by the head butts. Strada said he  
warned Salem twice but ruled the head butts accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	According to North American Boxing Federation rules, a fighter  
can lose points for intentional head-butting, but he must be warned 
at least twice before he can be disqualified. Salem was not warned. 
</P>
<P>
	A.D. ``Spider'' Bynum, a Dallas-based legal adviser to the NABF,  
said the federation would review tapes of the fight and aid any 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As horrible as it may sound, we try to learn from these type  
of tragedies so it won't happen again,'' Bynum said. ``We will 
certainly review the tapes and work with the Missouri (Athletic) 
Commission in every way possible to aid them in any investigation 
they undertake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Strada disputed the number of head butts some claim  
were delivered by Salem, who was penalized twice in the early 
rounds for holding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hard fight to referee,'' Strada said. ``But if there  
was something excessive, I would have stopped it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strada suggested Carver looked exhausted in the middle rounds.  
</P>
<P>
	``There weren't 20 hard punches thrown in the fight,'' Strada  
said. ``I've never seen Randie that physically out of shape. But I 
can't call a fight because a fighter is tired. That's the job of 
(the fighter's) corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the eighth round, Carver looked noticeably tired, and had a  
hard time getting off the ropes when Salem pushed him. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fight, Salem, 31, with a 12-1 record, expressed  
concern for Carver's well-being but had no regrets about the way he 
fought. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's his hometown, you know?'' Salem said. ``If it goes 12  
rounds, he wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he's fine,'' he said. ``I feel bad. What can I say?  
It's a fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carver, who billed himself as ``the Natural,'' was a former  
Golden Gloves champion who won the NABF super middleweight 
championship at the casino last year. He brought a 23-0-1 record to 
Sunday night's championship fight, which was televised on the Fox 
Sports Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven St. John, a close friend of Carver who sometimes worked  
in his corner during fights, said Carver ``was a kid who grew up 
the hard way, and he wanted to help kids grow up right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He honestly believed he could make a difference in their  
lives. As great a boxer as he was, he was an even greater person,'' 
St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrah's said a boxing card scheduled for Oct. 3 has been  
canceled out of respect for Carver. 
</P>
<P>
	White, the aunt, said Carver's vital organs were being prepared  
for donation.

<HEADLINE> Gore Courts Hispanic Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore made the most of his  
limited Spanish-speaking skills as he began a week of wooing 
Hispanic voters and showing off his rapport with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore addressed a gala for the National Hispanic Foundation for  
the Arts on Monday. Today, he was expected to launch his ``Ganamos 
con Gore,'' or, We Win with Gore, campaign with endorsements from 
dozens of Latino elected officials and community activists. The 
vice president also is scheduled to attend the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus dinner on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	All the events are intended to show growing support among  
Hispanics for Gore's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president sprinkled Spanish words and phrases during  
his speech to the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts at a 
downtown hotel Monday night. He told the group he shared the 
organization's mission of reaching the day when ``our American 
culture fully reflects the full diversity of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hispanic American culture has already left an indelible stamp  
on our culture and on our society. The question is -- will we do 
more as a nation to recognize it and embrace it?'' he said to a 
crowd that included actors Jimmy Smits and Sonia Braga and singer 
Jon Secada. ``Will we swing open the doors of opportunity so more 
talented young Latinos and Latinas can achieve their full 
potential?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore deplored the lack of diversity in the mainstream media. He  
said Latinos made up only 3 1/2 percent of last year's movie and 
television roles -- and ``that's unacceptable to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The portrayal of Latinos in the media must be expanded because  
``children spend much more time -- much more time --in front of the 
television set than in the classroom,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the quality of our schools, the images we project into  
our living rooms and in our movie theaters send a powerful and 
unspoken message,'' he said. ``If they present only part of our 
society, then we risk giving the message to everybody else -- you 
don't have a place here, you don't have anything to contribute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore attended the gala after spending the day in Tennessee,  
where he garnered support from union members at the state's AFL-CIO 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, along with his leading Republican  
counterpart, George W. Bush, have taken advantage of what Spanish 
they know while campaigning for the White House. Both candidates 
have said their use of the language was intended to show respect 
for the Hispanic culture.

<HEADLINE> Issel To Coach Nuggets Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After painfully watching the Denver Nuggets'  
bewildering transformation from a rising franchise to an NBA 
also-ran, Dan Issel couldn't take it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Issel, Denver's vice president and general manager, added  
another title Tuesday as he introduced himself as Nuggets coach, 
replacing Mike D'Antoni. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this wasn't a day when I had to part company with a good  
friend, it would be a happy day for me,'' Issel said. ``Although it 
doesn't seem like it today, we're trying to bring stability to the 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel's announcement comes four years after he retired as  
Denver's coach. At that time, he vowed never to coach again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I am better suited for the situation this time  
around,'' he said. ``We did have some success. I felt that was an 
uncompleted chapter. If I'm not right about this, this will be the 
final chapter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets have gone through five coaches with minimal success  
since Issel led them to the Western Conference semifinals in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	They chased the NBA futility mark before finishing 11-71 in  
1997-98 and went 14-36 under D'Antoni in last year's 
lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many games, we just couldn't even turn the TV on or read the  
paper the next morning,'' Issel's wife, Cheri, said of her 
husband's time away from the Nuggets. ``If you've been in Denver as 
long as we have or been associated with the Nuggets as much as we 
have, it really hurts to see the Nuggets get to the point they got. 
We want to be a part of rebuilding that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though highly successful as a coach in the Italian League,  
D'Antoni seemed to have trouble winning the respect of his players. 
Issel said D'Antoni's overseas experience didn't carry much weight 
with players in the image-conscious NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that being here for a shortened season certainly didn't  
give Mike the biggest opportunity,'' Issel said, ``but I don't 
think we have a long opportunity to turn this franchise around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel said Nuggets owner Donald Sturm has given him a three-year  
contract with an option for a fourth year if the team is 
successful. D'Antoni had two years left on a three-year contract 
and will not remain with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his first coaching retirement in January 1995, Issel has  
worked in radio and television as a basketball analyst, and he 
returned the team as vice president and general manager in March 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	His major moves in the past year have included signing free  
agent forward Antonio McDyess and making trades for all-star point 
guard Nick Van Exel and Denver native Chauncey Billups. He also 
orchestrated a multiplayer trade with Boston this summer that 
brought talented swingman Ron Mercer to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good situation,'' Mercer said. ``I really  
didn't know the former coach too well. I think Dan hit a key point. 
The players have to respect the coach. That's one thing that stands 
out the most. I respect Dan. He's a straightforward guy. I respect 
that a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all his front office maneuvering, Issel still inherits a  
young team with several unproven players, but he said his work in 
the media has helped him learn to accept criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Issel also told his family he would try to avoid the stress that  
drove him from coaching in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to promise them I wouldn't get so red in the face and  
that I would leave it here when I left this building,'' he said. 
``I'm safe because as nice as my office is here, I'm moving in full 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel was one of Denver's most popular players in his 11 seasons  
with the Nuggets from 1975-85. He was inducted into the Basketball 
Hall of Fame in 1993 and is still Denver's career rebounding 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Issel's return to coaching is the latest step in a summer  
makeover for the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, a Denver billionaire and banker, took over ownership of  
the Nuggets, the NHL's Colorado Avalanche and the Pepsi Center 
arena in July, after bidding $461 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Issel said Sturm did not force him to take over as coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about titles and who has all the power,'' Issel said.  
``It's about getting the Denver Nuggets back to being a respectable 
franchise -- something I don't think we have been, with the 
exception of a year or two in the '90s.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Removed From Waco Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has removed the federal  
prosecutor who first raised concerns about a cover-up at Waco from 
further involvement in the case, saying he and his colleagues are 
potential witnesses in the independent inquiry into the government 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials said there could be additional removals of  
lawyers involved in the case, including some who are helping to 
defend the government against civil suits brought by the Branch 
Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston, who helped handle the  
criminal prosecution of Branch Davidian survivors, was removed 
Friday from the Waco case along with his boss, U.S. Attorney James 
W. Blagg, and the rest of the federal prosecutor's office for 
western Texas, according to court documents made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm trying not to be  
paranoid,'' Johnston said in an interview with the Associated 
Press, adding that he hasn't been involved lately in court 
developments related to the Branch Davidian case. ``Nothing in this 
case surprises me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials said they made the move at Blagg's request to  
avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. The special counsel 
for Waco, John Danforth, the former Republican senator from 
Missouri, is beginning his investigation into whether the 
government killed any Branch Davidians during the fiery end of the 
1993 siege and then tried to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of my office advised law enforcement agencies before  
and during the siege, and handled the criminal trial in 1994,'' 
Blagg said. ``Because of their roles in matters that may be under 
investigation, my office has been recused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that renewed  
congressional inquiries into Waco should expand to other instances 
in which Justice officials may have withheld information about 
government conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to have to be broader than just Waco  
itself,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters. ``There are a number of 
investigations that they are basically either not doing or they 
have stiffed us on. So we need to find out what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The removal of Johnston from the case came to light less than 24  
hours after the public release of a letter he had sent to Attorney 
General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have formed the belief that facts may have been kept from  
you -- and quite possibly are being kept from you even now -- by 
components of the department,'' Johnston wrote Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	One frequent critic of Justice's conduct, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.,  
a member of the House Judiciary Committee, charged that the 
department acted to shut Johnston up. ``The department has swiftly 
and quietly silenced the one internal voice of opposition to the 
party line, publicly embarrassed him and damaged his career,'' Barr 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin, asked whether  
removing Johnston was a reprisal for his outspoken criticism in the 
Waco case, said: ``Absolutely not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has already removed herself from further involvement in the  
Waco matter because she, too, is a likely witness. Additional moves 
are possible, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of lawyers in the civil division has been defending the  
government in a wrongful death suit that goes to trial Oct. 18 in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been recently revealed that the FBI used potentially  
incendiary tear gas during the final day of the siege. The bureau 
had denied the use of such devices for years and failed to turn 
over to Congress videotapes that may have pointed to such use. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials maintain that Branch Davidians, and not  
federal agents, set the fatal fire on April 19, 1993, when cult 
leader David Koresh and an estimated 80 followers perished. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials are considering recusal for lawyers in the  
civil division, whose torts branch acknowledged that the department 
failed to provide Congress the one page of an FBI report that 
referred to a military tear-gas round being fired at Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder has appointed the U.S.  
attorney in a neighboring Texas district to take over for Johnston 
and his colleagues in any further Waco matters. 
</P>
<P>
	That U.S. attorney, Michael Bradford, expressed hope the  
appointment will help restore public confidence in the Justice 
Department. ``We have a fresh look at this matter with a group 
that's not had any involvement or any potential conflict in the 
matter, and that's why we were asked to come in,'' he said in an 
interview with The Associated Press after meeting with Blagg's 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston had been at odds with Blagg, his superior, and other  
Justice officials over the investigation of the government's 
actions during the standoff with the Davidians at their compound 
outside Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston had pressed Justice officials to allow independent  
filmmakers to review evidence sifted from the charred ruins of the 
Davidians' compound -- evidence that led to the FBI's recent 
admission that the potentially incendiary tear gas canisters were 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	That disclosure sparked congressional inquiries and Reno's  
appointment of Danforth. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are discussing the number and scope  
of their own investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for an initial flurry of hearings by various committees  
have narrowed to two, conducted in the House by Government Reform 
Committee Chairman Dan Burton and in the Senate by the Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said that Sen.  
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., probably will lead the latter proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Floyd Lashes the Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd vented its fury on the  
Bahamas on Tuesday -- toppling trees and power lines, stripping 
roofs off homes and shoving a roiling sea into streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bearing down on Florida, Georgia and South Carolina -- where  
nearly 2 million people were urged to leave its path -- Floyd flung 
trees and debris into buildings in the Bahamas and chased 
frightened tourists from exposed hotel rooms to more enclosed 
space. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, the capital, authorities lost telephone links  
throughout the vulnerable, low-lying archipelago -- including 
Eleuthera, San Salvador and Cat Island -- where winds reached 110 
mph and damage was feared to be extensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't get through to San Salvador or Cat Island, but we  
expect it to be bad,'' said Melanie Roach, an official at a 
government command center. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd ripped roofs off homes and flooded some streets in  
Eleuthera Island, which has a population of 10,000, Roach said. 
Most residents were safely inside shelters; the island's popular 
Club Med resort had closed for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 380 Club Med guests of vacation chain's 11-story glass  
building in San Salvador were sitting out the storm, and there were 
no injuries reported, the main office in Miami said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Bahamas most populated island, New Providence, rescuers  
fought through driving rain to reach residents of battered homes. 
But the debris-strewn streets and 3-foot-high flooding in places 
made the job difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane uprooted 30-foot trees and sent blinding,  
horizontal sheets of rain through deserted streets. It shoved cars 
around and snapped palm trees in half. High winds set car alarms 
screeching throughout the capital, Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people in Nassau, which is on New Providence, were  
reportedly being treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's winds eased somewhat to 140 mph, down from 155 mph, but  
it was still a dangerous Category 4 storm capable of causing 
extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Nassau, residents reported flooding a quarter-mile  
inland. Officials warned that storm surges up to 20 feet could 
inundate parts of New Providence six miles inland, a daunting 
prospect for an island just seven miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 p.m. EDT, Floyd's center was over the Abaco Islands, or  
about 235 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The hurricane 
had turned to the northwest and was moving at 12 mph, the U.S. 
National Hurricane Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacationers throughout the Bahamas sought shelter inside secure  
hotel lobbies and enclosed rooms. As the power flickered on and 
off, they dozed on couches and floors, sipped coffee, played cards 
and waited for the storm to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	On Grand Bahama, worried residents took rooms at Freeport's  
Victory Inn, 2 miles from the nearest shore, which had been vacated 
by tourists fleeing the storm. Most brought their own canned food. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be really bad,'' said the inn's manager,  
Wenzel Armbister. To get through it, he said, ``we're having a 
hurricane party. We've got the bar open and everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Paradise Island, 2,000 guests at the sprawling Atlantis  
Resort sought refuge inside a convention center, along with 500 
resort workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's really cooperative. They know how serious this  
is,'' said Atlantis spokesman Ed Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	With one exception -- a man who watched the hurricane from his  
8th-floor balcony -- residents evacuated their beachfront homes and 
passed the hours with tourists inside the ballroom of Nassau's 
Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough! Let's get this over with,'' said a bored Paul Rodamol  
of Cannes, France, who tried and failed to get a flight out on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most hotel guests were frightened out of their rooms when  
Floyd's winds began howling and pelting the windows with tree limbs 
and debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was woken by what sounded like tin crashing down and got  
worried when I could feel the whole bed shaking,'' said Jeannine 
Bixby of Rumney, New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd also has forced hundreds of flights to and from Florida to  
be canceled, disrupting air traffic throughout the Caribbean.

<HEADLINE> Russell Stands Alone on ESPN List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bill Russell is in a class by himself. Of all of  
the living athletes on ESPN's ``SportsCentury'' list, he is the 
only one to refuse an interview for the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable network released the names of the top 20 athletes  
Tuesday at the opening of its newest ESPN Zone restaurant in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell was among the elite 20 -- a list presented in  
alphabetical order -- and surprisingly showed up for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Russell won't do an interview, but we did speak to his  
daughter, Karen,'' said ESPN's Mark Shapiro, who heads up the 
project. ``He has chosen to decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Boston center, who won 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons  
with the Celtics, always had a rocky relationship with media and 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't necessary to do an interview,'' Russell said. ``For  
the last 15 years, I haven't done any. The only reason I am here is 
because my daughter convinced me to and she is my best friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell joined Jim Brown, Wayne Gretzky, Carl Lewis and Martina  
Navratilova at the Times Square restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The others on the list: Hank Aaron, Muhammad Ali, Wilt  
Chamberlain, Ty Cobb, Babe Didrikson, Magic Johnson, Michael 
Jordan, Joe Louis, Willie Mays, Jack Nicklaus, Jesse Owens, Jackie 
Robinson, Babe Ruth, Jim Thorpe and Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb is No. 20 and a 30-minute show will air Friday at 10:30  
p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the top 20 are baseball players, while four come from  
basketball and track and field. Just two women, Navratilova and 
Didrikson, made the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of voters consisted of broadcasters, writers,  
historians and ESPN personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN will begin two shows a week in December on the list. The  
final one-hour program, featuring the top two athletes on the list, 
will be shown Dec. 26 on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said being selected ``doesn't mean much'', but his  
choice for the century's top athlete would be Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``This list gives us a lot of conversation,'' Russell said. ``I  
never put myself in a class with these people because my agenda was 
different. It was winning games and that was all. Jim Brown is the 
best player ever to play football and was far and away the best 
lacrosse player ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was surprised that a fellow ex-Celtic, Larry Bird, was not  
closer to Johnson on the list. Bird was No. 30 and Johnson is among 
the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason they do that is because Magic won five titles  
and Larry won three,'' he said. ``I think they should be a tie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro estimates more than 1,500 interviews have been done  
since the project began two years ago. He said Russell is the only 
player to decline an interview, but he has had a few strange 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar Ray Leonard's manager would grant ESPN an interview only  
if he was the second boxer on the list after Ali. However, Leonard 
didn't even crack the top 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the others that didn't make the cut are John McEnroe,  
John Elway, Frank Robinson, Nancy Lopez and Pete Maravich.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Keeping Princeton Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes  
has criticized Princeton University for hiring a professor who says 
parents should be allowed to euthanize severely handicapped 
newborns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Forbes this week rejected entreaties from allies on the  
issue to cut ties to his alma mater and withhold charitable 
contributions unless the professor, Peter Singer, is removed. 
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful Gary Bauer attacked  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's abortion stance Tuesday in a speech to 
the American Association of Christian Schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said the GOP front-runner's refusal -- if elected -- to  
impose an antiabortion litmus test on Supreme Court nominees would 
undermine the possibility of reversing Roe vs. Wade during the next 
presidential administration. 
</P>
<P>
	With several Supreme Court justices about to retire, Bauer said,  
the next president could appoint justices who would rapidly reverse 
the nation's abortion law. He criticized fellow Republican 
candidates -- Bush and former American Red Cross president Elizabeth 
Dole among them -- who have said they personally oppose abortion but 
do not believe the nation is ready to reverse abortion rights law. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the next three years you could wake up and the headline  
could be, 'Court overturns Roe; finds right to life,''' Bauer said. 
``It is that close to our grasp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said Bush's father, former President Bush, did not ask his  
nominees enough questions about policy positions, and that ended up 
costing conservatives a guaranteed vote on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is how we got stuck with David Souter -- his Dad's  
appointee -- who is a reliable vote for Clinton-Gore,'' said Bauer.

<HEADLINE> NFL Vagabond Mirer Gets His Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Jets coaches have no choice but to go  
with Rick Mirer. Jets players have no choice but to have faith in 
Mirer as the replacement for injured quarterback Vinny Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mirer need look back no further than last season to see a  
similar situation involving none other than Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the 1998 season, the Jets signed Testaverde so they'd  
have a veteran backup for Glenn Foley. When Foley faltered, 
Testaverde was elevated to starter and responded with the best 
performance of his dozen NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Testaverde, an underachiever for much of his first 11 years  
as a pro, is sidelined with a ruptured Achilles' tendon. Mirer, 
acquired three weeks ago, has been thrust into the spotlight far 
sooner than he expected. 
</P>
<P>
	How will Mirer, who has been with four teams in the last four  
seasons -- he did next-to-nothing for the Seahawks, Bears and 
Packers -- handle it? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty big challenge,'' Mirer said of replacing the  
AFC's leading passer of last season and one of the Jets' prime 
leaders. ``There are high expectations for this team. I need to do 
my best to do what Vinny would have done and pick up where he left 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could be in a little more of comfort zone. I understand it  
is a tough situation for me, but good things could happen. It's 
just a matter of getting off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not something the Jets have done. They will be without  
Testaverde and running back-kick returner Leon Johnson (torn knee 
ligaments) for the rest of the season. Star receiver Wayne Chrebet 
won't be back until mid-October and starting cornerback Otis Smith 
is out for another few weeks. Nose tackle Jason Ferguson's ankle 
almost certainly will sideline him for Sunday night's game at 
Buffalo, and tight end Eric Green has a pinched nerve in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, they claim they will put all that aside and prosper  
with Mirer at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to keep rolling and Rick is going to get it  
done,'' Keyshawn Johnson said. ``Rick has obviously had some bad 
times in the past as a quarterback, but he is starting new. He has 
the weapons and the players who want to play for him. As long as he 
realizes that, he'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer struggled in Sunday's opening loss to New England, going  
4-for-11 for 28 yards and being intercepted twice in the fourth 
quarter, which was all he played because he was listed as the third 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers were in keeping with a career in which he went  
from the No. 2 overall draft pick in 1993 to a bust in Seattle and 
Chicago and virtually unused in Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting for an opportunity to fix some things,'' he  
said, ``but this happened before I thought it would. I'd like more 
time to get comfortable, but that is not true right now. I feel 
pretty good about a lot of things we are doing; it is reacting at 
game speed. But I can't hesitate, and that is what happened 
(against the Patriots). 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it is time to play. Every head coach and city is  
different, and this is a coach who does not hit the panic button 
like others I have been with who were on the hot seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it is Mirer who is on a very hot seat.

<HEADLINE> TWA Flight 800 Wreckage Is Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALVERTON, N.Y. (AP) -- The wreckage of TWA Flight 800 was being  
moved to a smaller hangar Tuesday as investigators continued to try 
to find what sparked the fuel explosion on the plane in 1996, 
killing all 230 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	National Transportation Safety Board Chairman James Hall,  
speaking on NBC's ``Today'' show from the Long Island facility, 
said the move to a smaller hangar will save taxpayers about $4 
million.

<P>
	Hall said investigators were searching the wiring systems of 25  
airplanes, looking at ignition sources that investigators believe 
may have caused the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA Flight 800, en route to Paris, exploded off the coast of  
Long Island shortly after takeoff from New York on July 17, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Court Mulls Father's Spanking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts' highest court is weighing whether a  
father's spanking of his young son is proper discipline or abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue came before the Supreme Judicial Court on appeal by  
attorneys for Donald Cobble, a minister from Woburn, who has 
admitted using the end of a leather belt to spank his fully clothed 
son, Judah, once or twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a lower court sided with state Department of Social  
Services officials who filed abuse charges against Cobble in March 
1997 after the boy told a teacher about his father's spankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from the seven-judge panel Monday, State  
Assistant Attorney General Juliana Rice said the agency filed a 
report on Cobble after determining his methods raised a 
``substantial risk of physical injury'' to Judah, now 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobble's attorney, Chester Darling, said there is no evidence  
his client inflicted abuse. He said the punishment is ``mild, 
loving, routine, structured'' spanking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every scrap that's in that record supports the fact there was  
no injury to this child,'' Darling told the judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The court has taken the case under advisement.  
</P>
<P>
	The state had filed abuse charges against Cobble but offered to  
drop the charges if he agreed to stop spanking. He refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobble, a pastor at the Christian Teaching and Worship Center,  
has quoted Biblical passages to justify why he spanks and has 
argued that the state is interfering with his religion if it 
interferes with his spanking.

<HEADLINE> Retirees Settle Buyout Suit vs. IBM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- About 340 former employees of IBM's  
Lexington plant will receive $15.5 million to settle a lawsuit 
alleging the company misled them about an early retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, approved in federal court in Lexington on  
Monday, will include some lump-sum payments of past-due benefits to 
retirees. The rest of the settlement will be added to future 
benefit payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Former workers will receive anywhere from $2,000 to $150,000,  
depending on their age, salary, length of service and the date of 
their retirement, said plaintiffs' lawyer Ken Hall of the 
Louisville firm of Middleton &AMP; Reutlinger. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement comes amid another benefit controversy at IBM.  
The Armonk, N.Y.-based company is one of more than 300 companies 
that have recently converted to new cash-balance pension plans, 
which can reduce costs by cutting future benefits to middle-aged 
workers while allowing younger workers to take a larger payout if 
they depart before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say that the plans violate age-discrimination laws.  
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chairwoman Ida Castro said 
Tuesday the commission will review the plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 suit stemmed from IBM's 1990 sale of its  
Lexington-based information services division, which later became 
Lexmark International Inc., a manufacturer of computer printers and 
their components. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to trim its work force, IBM offered a package of  
incentives to employees who wanted to retire by the end of 1990. 
The suit alleged that the company told workers that there would be 
no financial advantage to extending their length of service with 
IBM by taking leaves of absence prior to retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a month after those early retirements took effect, the  
suit contended, IBM amended its retirement plan to offer enhanced 
benefits that were not available to those who had already retired -- 
and which would have been available had the retirees taken leaves 
of absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said information exchanged during litigation of the suit  
showed IBM officials contemplated enhancing the retirement benefits 
as early as October 1990, but did not inform the workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Former IBM worker Don Adams of Lexington, who will share in the  
settlement, said he is glad to finally have the suit settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, now 61, worked for IBM for 33 years and 11 months and was  
the superintendent of an assembly area when he took early 
retirement at the end of 1990. He said he would not have retired if 
he had known he could take a one-month leave of absence and qualify 
for improved benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams declined to discuss how much he will receive from the  
settlement, but said he does not harbor ill will toward his former 
employer. ``I just feel like there was some people there that made 
some bad decisions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said he thought the case was lost in 1996, when U.S.  
District Judge Karl Forester in Lexington granted a summary 
judgment to IBM. That ruling was overturned in January by the 6th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, which said that an 
employer who considers changes to a retirement plan has an 
obligation to make retirees aware of those possible changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th Circuit ruling prompted IBM to negotiate the settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	``The case had been in the courts for many years and we thought  
that rather than litigate, it would be prudent for us to settle on 
terms that we thought were reasonable, given how old the case 
was,'' IBM spokeswoman Jana Weatherbee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the $15.5 million settlement amounts to 87.5 percent  
of the amount the plaintiffs sought when they filed the 
class-action suit. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, IBM also agreed to drop its appeal of  
the 6th Circuit ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, Hall said.

<HEADLINE> Dems To Blame GOP for Tax Cut Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After President Clinton vetoes the  
Republicans' $792 billion tax cut, the Democrats are going to blame 
them for the lack of any break for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Or try.  
</P>
<P>
	That backspin argument from the Democrats will be the next phase  
of the maneuvering over tax cuts, with Clinton waiting to veto the 
GOP bill he calls excessive, a risk to vital programs, the surplus 
and the economy itself. The Senate Republican leader now says 
that's it, no fallback compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton says he's for ``sensible tax cuts,'' less than half the  
size of the GOP measure, and designed to benefit lower and middle 
income Americans. The administration is willing to bargain up to 
$300 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, that would be over 10 years, and taxpayers  
wouldn't see any big breaks immediately under either version. 
</P>
<P>
	There's always the possibility of compromise, but Clinton balked  
earlier at a $500 billion cut, which had some Democratic support, a 
fallback GOP tax cut advocates weren't buying anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
	So it's the veto, perhaps later this week, Republican leaders  
having held the bill since it passed on Aug. 5 so that Clinton 
wouldn't be able to reject it while Congress was in its summer 
recess and he had the stage to himself. Besides, the Republicans 
said they'd spend the late summer building taxpayer support for 
their tax cut to put more pressure on Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a month of trying, the polls still put tax cuts far  
down the list of voter concerns, and showed more people more 
interested in reducing the national debt. When the question is put 
as Republicans put it, lower taxes or increased spending, 
majorities prefer tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	So that is the GOP argument, as it has been all along.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's is that the GOP bill would irresponsibly risk vital  
programs, costing revenues needed for Medicare and the long-term 
financing of Social Security, and eventually swallowing the 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he is open to negotiations, and that if the  
Republicans won't work on compromise, it will prove that their real 
motive is not a tax cut but an issue for the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	There will have to be at least one tax bill this year, to renew  
provisions that expired on June 30, and that could become a vehicle 
for attempts at a broader measure. 
</P>
<P>
	But that would require bargaining for compromise, and while Sen.  
Trent Lott, the GOP leader, said he'll never give up on a tax cut, 
he sounds as though he has for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weekly radio address Republicans had been using to  
promote their tax cut, Lott said there won't be one. ``No tax cut 
this year because as far as Mr. Clinton is concerned, your refund 
is already spent here in Washington,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats counter that there can be a cut, but only with  
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	The minority leaders, Rep. Richard A. Gephardt and Sen. Tom  
Daschle, said the Republicans' summer tax campaign showed that the 
voters don't want the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe instead of the partisan back and forth that we've had  
all summer long, we ought to sit down and see if we can find places 
where we do agree,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta said 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott had a different description.  
</P>
<P>
	``If our past experience with this administration is any guide,  
in a few weeks ... President Clinton will want to make a deal,'' he 
said. ``He will agree to some throwaway tax fixes in return for a 
massive hike in spending for all his pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be impolite to call that blackmail, but we've been  
through this routine before, and we know where it ends up,'' Lott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His problem is that it has ended up to Clinton's advantage. He's  
used his veto power, and the threat of it, more effectively than 
the Republicans have used their majorities in the House and Senate. 
That's how he won spending for his priorities as the price of a 
budget deal in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Clinton's vetoes of Republican-drawn appropriations  
bills led to the shutdown of federal agencies for lack of money, 
saying they'd forced him to it. GOP leaders defied his veto 
warnings, figuring he'd be blamed for the mess. Instead, they were. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the hand the Democrats hope they can play again on tax  
cuts.

<HEADLINE> Congress Fights Over Oil Royalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oil-state senators expressed confidence that  
they will be able to break a logjam and block an Interior 
Department proposal that would revamp the way the government 
collects royalties from oil companies pumping on federal land. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed changes, designed to end what critics say has been  
a longtime practice by oil companies to shortchange the government 
in royalty payments, has been in limbo for two years. A proposed 
amendment to Interior's spending bill would bar action for another 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has refused since last  
Thursday to allow a vote on the amendment, and an attempt to 
overcome her delaying tactic fell short, 55-40, Monday. Sixty votes 
were needed to end debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, the leading critic of the  
Interior proposal to revamp the way oil royalties are collected, 
said she would not withdraw her amendment, setting the stage for 
another confrontation later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the 60 votes if everybody would have been here,'' said  
Hutchison in an interview. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., indicated he would call for another vote to try to get 
Hutchison's amendment up for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxer accused major oil companies of engaging ``in a scheme to  
essentially rob the Treasury of millions upon millions of dollars'' 
by undervaluing oil pumped from federal land and offshore fields. 
``The big oil companies ... are cheating the taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department wants to peg the royalties to market  
indicators, arguing that oil companies have been valuing oil at 
artificially low prices at the wellhead, depriving the federal 
government and states of as much as $68 million a year in 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaying the royalty reforms another year ``will result in  
losses to the federal treasury, states and Indians of $5.56 million 
per month,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt wrote senators last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	But oil industry supporters argue the Interior Department's  
proposal, which has been ready since mid-1998, would be difficult 
to manage and likely overstate the value of the oil. It amounts to 
a new tax on an industry that already is facing hard economic 
times, argues Hutchison. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the large oil companies might be able to absorb these  
costs, hundreds of small independent producers probably will not,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxer maintains the royalties are being underpaid largely by the  
5 percent of the industry that is made up of the large, more 
prosperous oil companies -- not struggling independents. 
</P>
<P>
	These same companies have had $8.4 billion in profits this year,  
says Jill Lancelot of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ``This notion 
that these are poor oil companies is nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About $1.2 billion a year is collected by the Interior  
Department from the 12.5 percent royalty fee. The oil companies say 
they're not opposed to simplification of the royalty calculations. 
They have proposed paying the government with oil, so-called ``in 
kind'' payments, instead of trying to find a market price. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department has said ``in kind'' payments might be  
suitable in some cases, but not all.

<HEADLINE> Shortcomings Found at Uranium Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Federal investigators at a cleanup site  
in Kentucky found shortcomings at a uranium plant but no impending 
hazards to workers or the public, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department investigation follows the recent  
revelation of a federal whistle-blower lawsuit filed by three 
workers at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Ky. The 
suit alleges that plant workers were unknowingly exposed to 
plutonium for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also claims that former plant operators falsified  
documents regarding the disposal of contaminated waste and records 
involving environmental contamination at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the team's initial observations, Richardson said  
investigators also reported that general radiation risks are low at 
the plant and radiation-protection programs there have improved 
during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, we don't have to wait for their final report  
to start work on corrective actions in the areas where the team has 
identified room for improvement,'' he said in a news release in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The team found that managers of cleanup operations at the site  
need to keep a closer eye on radiation-exposure levels and tighten 
contamination-control practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased that the team confirmed basically what we felt,  
that there are no imminent health risks and that the risk to health 
from the uranium activities is extremely low,'' said Mark Musolf, a 
spokesman for Bechtel-Jacobs Co. LLC, the plant's environmental 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department owned and operated the plant until 1993,  
when production was turned over to the United States Enrichment 
Corp., an entity created by Congress under the National Energy 
Policy Act of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The department now focuses its efforts on the environmental  
restoration of the plant site and the management of waste generated 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant has been producing enriched uranium since 1952. The  
uranium, once used in the manufacture of atomic weapons, now is 
used in nuclear reactors in the United States and around the world. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Germany To Replace Rail Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Transport Minister Franz Muentefering has fired  
the head of the German Railway, Johannes Ludewig, the ministry said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludewig has been under growing criticism for his management of  
the nation's vast rail system, which has suffered financial 
setbacks and a loss of prestige in the wake of a series of 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludewig is to be replaced Jan. 1 with Hartmut Mehdorn, head of  
the board of directors for Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG and a 
longtime Airbus executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Muenterfering, who is leaving the ministry to take over daily  
management of the Social Democratic Party, approved the changes 
recommended by the railway's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The railway, Deutsche Bahn, also plans to replace the head of  
the head of the tourism subsidiary, Axel Nawrocki, with Christoph 
Franz, currently head of company development at the railway. 
</P>
<P>
	Morale at the railway has been spiraling since June 1998 crash  
of a high-speed train that killed 101 people. Railway workers 
complained about Ludewig's handling of the aftermath of the crash, 
blamed on a faulty wheel, saying he did not make clear that it was 
an equipment problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of other accidents following the disaster further  
tarnished the railway's image. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales and profits also were down last year, largely due to the  
impact of the crash. Deutsche Bahn's sales were flat 1998, while 
profits dropped to 334 million marks, or $191 million, from 533 
million marks in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in management was welcomed by railway unions and  
consumer groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no real forward-looking strategy under Ludewig,''  
said Holger Jansen, spokesman for the Pro Bahn passenger advocacy 
group. He added, however, that some of Ludewig's difficulties were 
related to the railway's privatization process after decades under 
state control. 
</P>
<P>
	Union chief Norbert Hansen said he hoped the shakeup changed  
would bring more creativity to management.

<HEADLINE> Boston Globe Changes Publishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Globe will begin publishing an early  
Sunday edition next month in an effort to stem shrinking 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Available at stores on Saturdays starting Oct. 23, the early  
Sunday edition will contain features and non-breaking news from the 
regular Sunday edition, as well as supplemental sections such as 
the Help Wanted, Real Estate, TV Week and Parade Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to increase Sunday circulation by giving consumers  
more time on the weekend to spend with the Sunday Globe,'' said 
Boston Globe Publisher Richard H. Gilman in a statement. ``It's 
another way we're trying to meet the changing needs of our 
readers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday circulation has been declining in recent years at many  
major metropolitan newspapers, including The Globe, a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of The New York Times Company. The Globe's latest 
circulation figures, for the six-month period ending March 1999, 
put Sunday circulation at 730,420, a decrease of 2.4 percent 
compared to the same period a year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Early editions have been published successfully in such markets  
as Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Miami, Los Angeles, 
Dallas-Fort Worth and New York. Early edition sales in those 
markets range from a few thousand to more than a hundred thousand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe's early Sunday edition would be delivered to stores  
between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Saturdays. The initial press run is 
expected to be nearly 40,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
	Home delivery subscribers, which account for 60 percent of  
Sunday Globe circulation, will be unaffected and will continue to 
receive the latest edition on Sunday morning.

<HEADLINE> Lie Detector Use Opposed at Labs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- More than a dozen scientists at one of  
the nation's top nuclear weapons labs on Tuesday spoke against the 
government's plan to require top-security researchers to take lie 
detector tests in an effort to catch spies. 
</P>
<P>
	Angry researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  
criticized the idea that polygraph tests were needed and questioned 
their accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're coming here to threaten our honor and integrity, to  
require us on effective threat to our employment to volunteer for 
an even deeper intrusion to our right to privacy,'' said David 
Dearborn, a lab scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Douglass E. Post, a lab physicist, warned that the tests  
will make it even harder to recruit and retain talented scientists, 
since the private sector does not require them and offers higher 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Energy Department announced plans to give polygraph  
tests to some 5,000 workers in sensitive nuclear weapons jobs, part 
of a broad initiative to beef up security after widely publicized 
accusations of leaks to the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers will be asked if they have committed espionage,  
committed sabotage or terrorism, illegally disclosed classified 
information, and if they had any unauthorized contact with any 
foreign intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
	If any of the four answers raises a red flag, the person tested  
would have to take a more complex test and then be the subject of 
an FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lab workers objected to the polygraph testing, fearing that  
errors might incriminate innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of four members heard the testimony. The panel will also  
hold hearings in Albuquerque, N.M., Los Alamos, N.M., and in 
Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence M. Small, a leading figure in the  
financial world, is taking over leadership of the 16 museums of the 
Smithsonian Institution and the National Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Small, 58, was named Monday as the 11th secretary of the  
Smithsonian in January. He is leaving his job as president of 
Fannie Mae, one of the principal U.S. home mortgage financing 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian, founded in 1846, runs the national museums of  
American History, American Art, Natural History, Air and Space and 
others in the capital. It employs 6,400 people and annually hosts 
more than 30 million visitors at its 17 facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Small will succeed I. Michael Heyman, 69, a former law professor  
and university chancellor, who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Small, who studied Spanish literature at Brown University and  
the flamenco guitar in Spain, is a longtime collector of art from 
the rain forests of South America and Africa. He has served on the 
boards of the Joffrey Ballet, the National Building Museum and on 
the council of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial, and he was treasurer of 
Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Philly Gets Arena Football Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ron Jaworski, a 17-year NFL veteran, is part of  
an investment group that purchased an Arena Football League 
expansion team Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaworski, who quarterbacked the Philadelphia Eagles to the 1981  
Super Bowl and now is a sportscaster for ESPN, is joined by former 
Arena League commissioner Jim Drucker, and Craig Stein, owner of 
the Double-A Reading Phillies baseball club. 
</P>
<P>
	The location for the league's 19th team, which will begin play  
no later than the 2002 season, has not been determined, AFL 
commissioner David Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena Football recently awarded expansion teams to Los Angeles  
and Raleigh, N.C., for next season, and Chicago for 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaworski, Drucker, Stein and their partners are another  
ownership `Dream Team' for the Arena Football League,'' Baker said. 
``Ron brings a vast knowledge of pro football to Arena Football, 
and he's highly respected by NFL owners, coaches and players. Jim 
Drucker was AFL commissioner for three seasons and was commissioner 
of the CBA for eight years and has a successful track record with 
growing national leagues. Craig Stein brings experienced team 
ownership to the AFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drucker, AFL commissioner from 1994-96, said his group evaluated  
17 potential areas before narrowing the list to ``five top 
cities.'' Three of those cities are Philadelphia, Washington and 
Salt Lake City. He hopes to announce a decision on the site of the 
franchise by March 15.

<HEADLINE> FTC Warnings for Credit Cardholders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Federal Trade Commission guidelines warn credit cardholders to  
be wary of those promoting protection plans who: 
</P>
<P>
	--Say you are liable for more than $50 of unauthorized charges on  
your credit card account. 
</P>
<P>
	--Say you need credit card loss protection because computer  
hackers can access your credit card number and charge thousands of 
dollars to your account. 
</P>
<P>
	--Say that the Y2K computer bug will make it easy for thieves to  
place unauthorized charges on your credit card account. 
</P>
<P>
	--Say or imply that they are calling from ``the security  
department'' and want to activate the protection features on your 
new card. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC also advises consumers not to give out personal  
information -- including credit card or bank account numbers -- 
unless they have initiated contact or are very familiar with the 
business involved. People who find unauthorized charges on credit 
cards should call the issuers.

<HEADLINE> Emmy Voters Gunshy on 'Sopranos' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Sopranos'' may have been the critical  
darling of the Emmys, but the mafia drama faced enough hurdles to 
fill the trunk of a mobster's car by the time the ceremony rolled 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	The HBO series about a New Jersey crime family led the field  
with 16 nominations yet came away with just four Emmys, two at the 
Sunday awards show and two technical awards given earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first cable program nominated for best dramatic  
series, but lost to last year's winner, ABC's legal drama ``The 
Practice.'' David E. Kelley, creator of ``The Practice,'' also went 
home with the award for best comedy series, ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' went into the awards with great reviews and  
hardcore fans among HBO subscribers. But its dark tone and cast of 
unsavory characters may not have played well with television 
academy voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``What drives the shows that win Emmys is sentiment,'' said  
Thomas O'Neil, author of ``The Emmys.'' ``The thing that makes 'The 
Sopranos' work so well is cynicism, not sentiment, while David E. 
Kelley is a master of sentiment and impacting voters and grabbing 
hold of voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmy voters generally look for characters and situations they  
can relate to, and a mob drama laced with graphic violence and 
profanity doesn't quite fit the bill, O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Chase, creator and producer of ``The Sopranos,'' said  
Monday the show ``does flaunt some pretty basic rules about 
television, like the likeability factor. I don't know that our 
characters are very huggable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series had five acting nominations, yet won just one -- for  
the most upright ``Sopranos'' character. Edie Falco, who plays a 
soul-searching mob wife, took home the award for best actress in a 
drama series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emmy voters in general want to like who they're voting for,''  
O'Neil said. ``Look who did win. Edie Falco, the woman who is the 
moral center of that series, the moral center of that immoral 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other major award ``The Sopranos'' won Sunday was for  
dramatic writing, a category the series dominated with four of the 
five nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters who pick Emmy winners also tend to gravitate more toward  
the familiar and traditional. The three other drama nominees, 
``NYPD Blue,'' ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order,'' all have been perpetual 
nominees, and each has won the dramatic series award in past years. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran series also dominated the acting awards, with such  
perennial winners as Dennis Franz of ``NYPD Blue'' and Helen Hunt 
of ``Mad About You'' going home with more awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The television academy membership does tend to be reasonably  
conservative in terms of embracing new media,'' said Gerald 
Isenberg, a former producer who is a film and television professor 
at the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Albrecht, HBO president of original programming, said  
there may have been some backlash against ``The Sopranos'' because 
of the wide press coverage the show had gained. The explicit 
violence, language and sex also may have worked against the series, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than likely there are people who are offended by some of  
that content when they're in the voting room,'' Albrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even ``The Practice'' creator Kelley conceded afterward that  
he had gone into the Emmys with a hunch ``The Sopranos'' would win 
best drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's such a terrific show,'' Kelley said. ``I don't think  
it's one that approximates anything that I've seen before on 
television or anything that I've done before.''

<HEADLINE> Morning Off-Hours Trading Offered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The race to bring off-hours stock trading to  
regular investors is about to stretch from the late afternoon and 
evening to the morning before most markets open. 
</P>
<P>
	Island ECN, an electronic exchange owned by Web broker Datek  
Online, said Monday it will expand its late-afternoon session to 
four hours and introduce a new mini-session before the traditional 
9:30 a.m. start of trading on the New York Stock Exchange and 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanded schedule -- from 8 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and from 4 p.m.  
to 8 p.m. -- will begin Wednesday through smaller broker-dealers, 
but no major broker is set to offer the Island service yet. A Datek 
spokesman said the firm expects to introduce morning and evening 
trading soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, individual investors are expected to gain  
round-the-clock access to the after-hours market, which until 
recently was open only to major money managers. And like most 
things Internet-related, the mainstreaming of that market has been 
quicker than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Island and Datek broke the after-hours barrier in late July when  
they launched a mini-session from 4 p.m. to 5:15 p.m., prompting a 
stream of announcements by the likes of ETrade Group, Instinet, 
Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments and America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	In late August, Discover Brokerage and Dreyfus Brokerage  
Services introduced the first real evening session, from 6 p.m. to 
8 p.m., through a new electronic exchange named MarketXT. 
</P>
<P>
	Island's new schedule goes a step farther by offering four  
continuous hours of late trading rather than shutting down for two 
hours after the normal 4 p.m. close of traditional markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Many online investors have shown an interest in making portfolio  
decisions at home, where they have more privacy and time to think. 
An estimated 20 percent to 25 percent of online trades are 
currently placed outside normal hours, and then executed when 
regular trading resumes in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investment experts worry that after-hours trading will  
expose individual investors to sharp price swings if there isn't 
sufficient demand to buy or sell a stock. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, many of the first after-hours services are  
limiting trading to only major companies and requiring investors to 
specify the highest price they're willing to pay when buying a 
stock or the least they're willing to take when selling.

<HEADLINE> Fergie New 'Today' Show Reporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The ``Today'' show has a new royal reporter: the  
Duchess of York. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Sarah Ferguson has been hired as a London-based  
correspondent for the top-rated morning news show. She'll 
contribute human interest stories, features and interviews, NBC 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the first time she appeared on `Today,' Sarah struck me  
as someone with a natural ease in front of the camera and the 
ability to tell a good story -- two key components in the job of a 
television correspondent,'' said ``Today'' executive producer Jeff 
Zucker. 
</P>
<P>
	The duchess, the ex-wife of Prince Andrew, said she will  
contribute about one report a month to the show. She's interested 
in reporting, for example, on health and weight issues and how 
children have coped with the war in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always for a long time wanted to be in television,''  
she said in a telephone interview. ``There's no better place to 
gain experience than to work with Katie (Couric) and Matt 
(Lauer).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, she was host of a talk show on a British television  
network. The show, ``Sarah ... Surviving Life,'' ran for 10 
episodes and she's considering other TV work over there. 
</P>
<P>
	On her first show there, Fergie, as she is popularly known in  
Britain, sat on a couch and discussed life's crises with guests who 
included a woman raped by a serial killer and a hit-and-run driver 
who had confessed 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first time I really felt comfortable with my job,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' dominates the ratings for morning news shows, but is  
facing energized new competition this fall from ABC and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time ``Today'' hired a British notable:  
Princess Diana's brother, Charles, was a reporter for the show for 
a time a decade ago.

<HEADLINE> Date of 1st Traffic Fatality Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The great-granddaughter of Henry Hale Bliss  
placed roses Monday on the spot where he died, marking the 100th 
anniversary of the first recorded automobile accident in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, more than 30 million people worldwide have met a  
similar fate, according to a safety group. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 13, 1899, Bliss was struck by an electric automobile  
after he exited a trolley car at 74th Street and Central Park West 
and turned to help a woman out of the trolley, according to a 
report in The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The electric automobile was driven by the chauffeur for a  
prominent physician. The physician assisted at the scene, but 
Bliss, a real estate dealer, later died at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Bliss Salisbury of Fairfield, Conn., joined safety  
officials and others at Monday's commemoration, which was sponsored 
by the Safety Sense Institute, a U.S.-Canadian non-profit 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Salisbury said she attended to increase awareness of  
traffic safety. ``It's time this problem is addressed and steps are 
taken to curb these preventable deaths,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Troops Loot UN Compound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian soldiers looted the abandoned  
U.N. mission in East Timor on Tuesday, just hours after 110 U.N. 
personnel and 1,300 East Timorese were evacuated and flown to 
safety to end a 10-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Office equipment and computers were carted away and vehicles  
were trashed by the soldiers -- ``the very people we asked to secure 
the compound when U.N. staff moved to the Australian consulate,'' 
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports Tuesday that the compound was also torched,  
but Eckhard said he was told that it was not the compound but a 
small house nearby that had been burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining U.N. staff members, holed up in the Australian  
consulate, reported that a black plume of smoke was rising from the 
direction of the compound in the provincial capital of Dili, said 
Fernando del Mundo, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff feared their headquarters had been set ablaze by  
pro-Indonesia militiamen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dozen U.N. personnel who stayed behind in Dili were to  
prepare the way for an international peacekeeping force, the makeup 
of which was being negotiated by Indonesian and U.N. officials 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But time appeared to be running out, with more than 200,000 East  
Timorese risking starvation because they are cut off from food 
supplies and drinking water, a U.N. agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7,000 people have been killed and 100,000 have been  
forcibly relocated to West Timor since anti-independence militias 
and Indonesian soldiers began a rampage of violence following the 
province's vote Aug. 30 to break away from Indonesia, the 
Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization said. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is impossible to confirm the number killed in the past  
week, previous estimates have ranged from 600 to 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some refugees have been brought to camps near Darwin, Australia  
by the United Nations. But authorities there said Wednsday that 
suspected militiamen have been identified among hundreds of 
refugees sheltering in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have separated a small group of people who have been  
identified as either militia or military off from the main group,'' 
said Northern Territory police spokeswoman Jane Munday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, nearly 1,000 students  
tried to march on parliament Tuesday, demanding the resignation of 
President B.J. Habibie and the end of military involvement in 
politics -- and blaming both for the bloodshed in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students were wounded by plastic bullets after the crowd  
damaged two police cars and set fire to an army vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the U.N. Security Council worked into the night  
Tuesday to finalize a draft resolution authorizing international 
troops to do whatever it takes to restore peace to the troubled 
territory. 

</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said peacekeepers could be on  
the ground by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	An Australian aid-drop of food and other supplies could start as  
soon as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based Carter Center, which monitors international  
political crises, said militiamen, backed by the Indonesian 
military, continue to terrorize and kill refugees in camps set up 
in West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, East Timor's spiritual leader said he had asked Pope  
John Paul II to pressure President Clinton for quick action.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Troops Loot UN Compound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian soldiers looted the abandoned  
U.N. mission in East Timor on Tuesday, just hours after 110 U.N. 
personnel and 1,300 East Timorese were evacuated and flown to 
safety to end a 10-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Office equipment and computers were carted away and vehicles  
were trashed by the soldiers -- ``the very people we asked to secure 
the compound when U.N. staff moved to the Australian consulate,'' 
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports Tuesday that the compound was also torched,  
but Eckhard said he was told that it was not the compound but a 
small house nearby that had been burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining U.N. staff members, holed up in the Australian  
consulate, reported that a black plume of smoke was rising from the 
direction of the compound in the provincial capital of Dili, said 
Fernando del Mundo, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff feared their headquarters had been set ablaze by  
pro-Indonesia militiamen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dozen U.N. personnel who stayed behind in Dili were to  
prepare the way for an international peacekeeping force, the makeup 
of which was being negotiated by Indonesian and U.N. officials 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But time appeared to be running out, with more than 200,000 East  
Timorese risking starvation because they are cut off from food 
supplies and drinking water, a U.N. agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7,000 people have been killed and 100,000 have been  
forcibly relocated to West Timor since anti-independence militias 
and Indonesian soldiers began a rampage of violence following the 
province's vote Aug. 30 to break away from Indonesia, the 
Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization said. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is impossible to confirm the number killed in the past  
week, previous estimates have ranged from 600 to 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some refugees have been brought to camps near Darwin, Australia  
by the United Nations. But authorities there said Wednsday that 
suspected militiamen have been identified among hundreds of 
refugees sheltering in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have separated a small group of people who have been  
identified as either militia or military off from the main group,'' 
said Northern Territory police spokeswoman Jane Munday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, nearly 1,000 students  
tried to march on parliament Tuesday, demanding the resignation of 
President B.J. Habibie and the end of military involvement in 
politics -- and blaming both for the bloodshed in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students were wounded by plastic bullets after the crowd  
damaged two police cars and set fire to an army vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the U.N. Security Council worked into the night  
Tuesday to finalize a draft resolution authorizing international 
troops to do whatever it takes to restore peace to the troubled 
territory. 

</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said peacekeepers could be on  
the ground by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	An Australian aid-drop of food and other supplies could start as  
soon as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based Carter Center, which monitors international  
political crises, said militiamen, backed by the Indonesian 
military, continue to terrorize and kill refugees in camps set up 
in West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, East Timor's spiritual leader said he had asked Pope  
John Paul II to pressure President Clinton for quick action. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Military Clears Fields for Floyd </HEADLINE>

<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Navy ships headed out to sea and  
military aircraft were flown to the safety of airfields inland 
Tuesday as Hurricane Floyd took aim at the Southeast coast from 
Florida to the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS John F. Kennedy, an aircraft carrier with about 5,000  
aboard, and the RFA Gold Rover, a visiting British ship, sailed 
from Mayport Naval Station near Jacksonville early Tuesday to join 
12 other Navy ships that left port Monday to ride the storm out at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 airmen, family members and civilian contractors at  
Patrick Air Force Base and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in 
Florida coast were ordered out, as were about 1,000 sailors and 
their families at Mayport. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine boot camp at Parris Island, S.C., was preparing  
school buses to move 7,000 recruits to shelter inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy and Air Force installations in Florida and the Carolinas  
also began flying helicopters, air tankers, cargo planes and 
fighter jets out of Floyd's path, positioning them at bases from 
Maine to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected installations also included Tampa's MacDill Air  
Force Base and Jacksonville Naval Air Station in Florida; Seymour 
Johnson Air Force Base near Goldsboro, N.C.; and Shaw Air Force 
Base in Sumter, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida National Guard went on alert to help secure damaged  
areas and provide other assistance. By Tuesday morning, 990 Guard 
members in southern and central Florida had been told to report to 
their armories.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Movies Showcased in Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- When Ramiro Puerta, an official for the Toronto  
film festival, first thought of a series on new Spanish movies he 
assumed Pedro Almodovar's latest would be included. The deal fell 
through, and Puerta insists he isn't sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, part of the purpose of this series is to show that  
Spanish movies can hold their own even without Almodovar,'' Puerta, 
the festival's international programmer, said Monday. ``Spanish 
cinema is bursting at the seams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almodovar is not only among the world's most famous directors,  
but probably the only living foreign-language filmmaker whose name 
alone can sell a movie in the United States. His upcoming release, 
``All About My Mother,'' won the prize at Cannes for best director 
and will open the New York Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	But Spain is home to a variety of talented directors. Their work  
ranges from the meditative style of Carlos Saura to the comedy of 
Fernando Colomo to the social realism of Benito Zambrano. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was young, the idea of going to a Spanish movie never  
crossed my mind,'' said Fernando Trueba, born in 1955 and director 
of the Academy Award-winning ``Belle Epoque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But young people now are not ashamed. A lot of things have  
changed. For all the problems we've had our quality of life has 
changed for the better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three generations of Spanish directors are represented at the  
10-day Toronto International Film Festival, which ends Saturday. 
Saura, a three-time nominee for the Academy Award, has been making 
movies since the 1950s, when Gen. Francisco Franco was in power. 
Trueba began working not long after Franco died in 1975. Benito 
Zambrano, born in 1965, has just completed his first feature, 
``Alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some directors who barely know who Franco is,'' said  
Saura, whose films include ``Carmen,'' ``Tango'' and his new 
feature, ``Goya in Bordeaux,'' which imagines the painter's final 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Spanish filmmakers have been acclaimed internationally  
at least since the 1920s, when Luis Bunuel emerged, modern Spanish 
cinema essentially took off after Franco's death. For American 
art-house audiences, Almodovar films such as ``Law of Desire'' and 
``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' defined the 
uninhibited style of post-Franco Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``His coattails have been very strong in the United States.  
Almodovar opened the door for a lot of Spanish filmmakers,'' said 
Jason Blum, co-head of the acquisitions department of Miramax 
Films, the U.S. distributor for Almodovar's ``Time Me Up! Tie Me 
Down!'' and other Spanish movies. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Spanish films began the festival with deals for the  
U.S., but Puerta said there has been strong interest in at least 
three: ``Goya in Bordeaux,'' Trueba's ``The Girl of Your Dreams'' 
and Manuel Gomez Pereira's ``Between Your Legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trueba's film, winner in seven categories of Spain's Goya award,  
is set during the Spanish Civil War and tells the story of a 
pro-Franco production company at the UFA studios in Nazi Germany. 
For one onlooker, according to Trueba, the film proved much too 
vivid. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an old man on the set and he was in a panic. He was  
an electrician back in the '30s and he had met Joseph Goebbels a 
few times,'' Trueba said. ``And when he saw our actor dressed as 
Goebbels and talking like him, he was shocked. He thought Goebbels 
had come back from the dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almodovar fans should love ``Between Your Legs,'' especially the  
opening sequence: A doctor arrives home from work. His wife is 
away, his daughter asleep. His only company is the housekeeper, the 
beautiful housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes, the two are on the couch, screaming with  
pleasure. In a flash, they're screaming with pain. The daughter 
stands over them. She's holding a knife. She's using the knife. 
</P>
<P>
	Cut to a closeup of the doctor, years later, confessing his sad  
story. His family has left him, his career is in ruins. The camera 
pulls back. He's addressing an audience, and not just any audience, 
but the Association of Sex Addicts Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the listeners are a handsome man and an attractive woman.  
</P>
<P>
	Before long, their eyes meet.

<HEADLINE> Texas Tech Waits for Ricky's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Both Ricky Williams are nursing leg  
injuries and their status for next weekend is doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's Heisman Trophy winner from Texas hurt his ankle in  
his NFL debut last weekend. And Texas Tech's Ricky Williams had to 
miss last week's 38-17 victory over Louisiana-Lafayette because of 
a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating matters for Tech coach Spike Dykes is that his  
Williams isn't around to have his leg tested. He's been in Dallas 
since Sunday with his ailing mother and hasn't undergone a medical 
exam since last week. 
</P>
<P>
	As of late Tuesday, the team was uncertain when or if he will  
play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm no doctor, so I don't like to step out on a limb and try  
to say whether I think he is going to come back or when,'' Dykes 
said. ``We have to let the doctors look at him and until he gets 
back from Dallas, we don't know when that's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had played every game at Tech (1-1) the past two  
seasons, rushing for 1,582 yards and 13 touchdowns last year. He 
also was on pace to eclipse the career rushing record set last year 
at Texas by the other Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech's Williams injured his knee in the first half of the opener  
against Arizona State. The prospect of playing without him has the 
team worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always wish you had your best option available and on the  
field,'' quarterback Rob Peters said. ``We don't know for sure what 
we are capable of without him. But we've got to play football and 
win, not worry about people who aren't on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tech managed a convincing victory without Williams last weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	James Easterling rushed for 114 yards and two touchdowns against  
Louisiana-Lafayette, formerly Southwestern Louisiana, and Peters 
threw for two TDs.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball officials will examine the idea of a  
World Cup more closely in the next two months before deciding 
whether to go ahead with a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know more in about six weeks,'' union head Donald Fehr  
said Tuesday after the annual meeting of the international 
committee established by players and owners in their 1996 labor 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials have talked for a decade about a World Cup, a  
tournament with major leaguers who would play for national teams 
from the United States, Japan and other countries. Fehr said 
discussions had not yet progressed to the point where the sides had 
even begun to think about when to start the event or even a format. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball plans to increase its international presence by  
starting the 2000 season in Tokyo with two games between the 
Chicago Cubs and New York Mets on March 29-30. They would be the 
first regular-season games played outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
	After having the Baltimore Orioles play an exhibition game in  
Cuba in March, the first by a major league team in 40 years, 
baseball opened outside the United States and Canada for the first 
time when San Diego played Colorado in April at Monterrey, Mexico. 
The Padres and Mets played a three-game series in Monterrey in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials are discussing a more widespread program of  
exhibition games in the Caribbean next spring, but it's too early 
to determine if there will be a return trip to Cuba, according to 
one official familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition 
he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, management officials headed to Cooperstown,  
N.Y., for two days of owners' meetings that will be dominated by 
franchise sales and a restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The $67 million sale of a controlling interest in the Cincinnati  
Reds from Marge Schott to three of the team's limited partners will 
be approved, one high-ranking baseball official said Tuesday on the 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindner, who owns the Great American Insurance Co., will  
take over as the controlling owner from Schott, who repeatedly has 
infuriated baseball with inflammatory statements about minorities 
and women. The deal, in which 36.7 percent of the Reds' shares 
would be sold, values the franchise at $181.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	George Strike and William Reik, two of the Reds' current limited  
partners, are helping fund Lindner's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners will not vote on the proposed sale of the Montreal Expos  
from a group headed by Claude Brochu to one headed by New York art 
dealer Jeffrey Loria, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig has said the Expos need a new  
ballpark to survive, and stadium financing is not fully in place. 
</P>
<P>
	While a group in northern Virginia has been interested in buying  
the Expos, Selig has said his first choice is to keep the team in 
Montreal. Loria has been negotiating with team chairman Jacques 
Menard and president Claude Brochu since early this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether owners would vote on the proposed sales  
of the Oakland Athletics or Kansas City Royals, which are on the 
agenda for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Dolich, a former Athletics executive, heads a group that  
agreed in May to buy the team from Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann for 
$122.4 million. Save Mart Foods chairman Bob Piccinini is the lead 
investor, providing the group's $12 million deposit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolich's group, which includes Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson,  
must close on the deal by Sept. 21 or it expires. Oakland Mayor 
Jerry Brown has lobbied Selig and even considered going to 
Cooperstown but decided against it, Brown spokeswoman Stacey Wells 
said.

	New York investor Miles Prentice agreed last Nov. 13 to buy the  
Royals for $75 million from a trust that acquired the franchise 
following the death of founder Ewing Kauffman in 1993. But some 
baseball officials are concerned Prentice's group doesn't have 
enough money to operate the team successfully and some are worried 
his group, which has more 40 investors, is too large. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are expected to vote on a restructuring plan that would  
reduce the American and National league presidents to figureheads 
by shifting control of umpires, player discipline and scheduling to 
the commissioner's office.

<P>
	NL president Len Coleman, angry with the change, intends to  
resign after the World Series, several high-ranking baseball 
officials said last week and an announcement could be made at the

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Bears Down on Southeast U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Authorities urged nearly 2 million people to  
evacuate coastal areas stretching from Florida to North Carolina 
today as Hurricane Floyd, one of the most powerful and biggest 
storms to ever threaten the United States, roared through the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's eye was expected to pass within 90 miles of southern  
Florida today, and perhaps come within 50 miles of north Florida's 
coast by Wednesday morning, before striking land somewhere farther 
north. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this thing parallels us, it could act like a weedeater  
going up the coast,'' said Craig Fugate of the Florida Emergency 
Operations Center in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's top sustained wind eased today to 140 mph -- down from  
Monday's 155 mph but still a Category 4 storm, the second most 
powerful designation for a hurricane. Forecasters, however, said 
fluctuations in speed were expected. It would be Category 5 if wind 
speed reached 156 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Storm surges in the Bahamas were reported at 20 feet above  
normal as trees were snapped by the wind and communications lines 
were knocked out. Showers and sustained 36 mph from the 
600-mile-wide storm reached the Florida coast today. Gusts reached 
42 mph south of West Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those fleeing were Phyllis Cusack and her daughter, Lynda  
Patton. Caught in bumper-to-bumper traffic as they headed west out 
of Daytona Beach on Interstate 10, they didn't know where they were 
going to end up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting out of Dodge,'' Cusack said.  
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, Floyd was about 195 miles east-southeast of Palm  
Beach, or near Abaco in the Bahamas, and moving to the 
west-northwest at about 14 mph. A gradual turn toward the northwest 
was expected later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was most likely to make landfall in Georgia or the  
Carolinas, but ``we're so close to the coast that just about any 
small deviation could bring the hurricane onshore anywhere from 
central Florida northward,'' hurricane specialist Miles Lawrence 
said at the National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force wind of at least 75 mph extended 125 miles from  
Floyd's center. Tropical storm-force wind of 39 mph was expected to 
reach Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach County this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	At Orlando, Walt Disney World was closing today for the first  
time because of weather. Universal Studios also was closing and 
SeaWorld shut down. Airlines canceled virtually all flights into 
and out of southern Florida, and the military sent aircraft inland 
and ships out of port to ride out the storm at sea. Crews of big 
civilian ships were told to get ready to leave port at Charleston, 
S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Corps was moving 7,000 recruits out of its Recruit  
Depot at Parris Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a skeleton crew was left at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.  
Three space shuttles were in the shuttle hangar, which is designed 
to withstand wind of only up to 105 mph, and the fourth was in the 
Vehicle Assembly Building, built to withstand 125 mph wind. Four 
multimillion-dollar rockets stood exposed on launch pads. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was much larger than Hurricane Andrew -- another Category 4  
storm -- which smashed into South Florida in 1992, causing $25 
billion in damage, killing 26 people and leaving 160,000 homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect today from Florida City, south  
of Miami, to Brunswick, Ga., about 400 miles. A warning means 
hurricane conditions could be felt within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane watch stretched northward to North Carolina, and a  
tropical storm warning was in effect for most of the Florida Keys. 
High surf advisories were in effect as far north as New York's Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1.8 million people were told to seek shelter along the  
coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, including all of 
Savannah, Ga. Nursing homes in coastal South Carolina started 
moving residents inland on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason for anyone to stay,'' said Charleston, S.C.,  
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Highways were jammed today as coastal residents headed inland.  
Georgia closed a 90-mile stretch of Interstate 16 to eastbound 
traffic so people fleeing inland from Savannah could use every 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges said shelters would be open as  
far inland as Columbia, about 100 miles from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, residents of North Carolina's Ocracoke Island,  
still drying out from Hurricane Dennis a week earlier, also were 
urged to evacuate, along with Bald Head Island at Cape Fear, 
because both are reachable only by ferry. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Ocracoke's 700 residents had stayed to ride out Dennis.  
However, said Hyde County Manager Jeff Credle, ``I think most 
people are going to leave this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard forces were being activated in Florida, Georgia  
and both Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina residents with memories of Hurricane Hugo 10  
years ago packed up as best they could. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you prepare for a storm that's going to wipe you out?''  
asked Buster Browne, a McClennanville, S.C., resident who rode out 
Hugo's Category 4 wind of 135 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Category 1 or 2, you run out and buy plywood and do what you  
can,'' he said. ``If a Category 5's going to hit you, what the hell 
are you going to do? Get the stuff you want to save and leave 
town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States since  
record-keeping started: the 1935 Labor Day storm that slammed the 
Florida Keys, killing 423 people, and Hurricane Camille, which 
killed 256 people in Mississippi and Virginia in 1969.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Division Head Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The head of DaimlerChrysler's Smart  
operation has resigned over differences in how to market the 
micro-compact auto. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Tuesday came on the same day that Smart  
unveiled new convertible and diesel models at the Frankfurt 
International Motor Show. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler board member Juergen Hubbert said that Lars  
Brorsen's resignation will take effect Oct. 1. A successor to lead 
Micro Compact Car, a DaimlerChrysler subsidiary, will be made later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials declined to elaborate on the differences that  
led to Brorsen's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	However, sales of the two-seater Smart, marketed for Europe's  
crowded cities, have fallen well behind initial forecasts of 
140,000 for the first year -- reaching 70,000 at the end of August. 
The car is not sold in the United States and DaimlerChrysler said 
it has no plans for U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbert acknowledged sales of the Smart were ``much less than  
originally planned,'' but said that sales have been increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders have risen from just about 2,000 a month to 2,500 a week,  
said Christoph Walther, DaimlerChrysler's senior vice president of 
communications. The company also predicts sales will rise 25 
percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker has lowered the price of the Smart and beefed up  
its marketing campaign, including offering free test drives to 
passersby in an attempt to turn sales around. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbert said the company plans to expand the Smart brand in the  
near future, also cooperating with other divisions of 
DaimlerChrysler in production. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the company unveiled a new convertible version of  
its coupe, called the City-Cabrio, that will be available in March 
2000. The car comes with a soft top that is electrically operated 
and can be opened in three ways -- from partially folded back to 
completely concealed in the trunk on the car. 
</P>
<P>
	No price for the model has been set.  
</P>
<P>
	The Smart coupe will also be offered in a diesel version that  
gets 90 miles per gallon from a 0.8 liter direct injection diesel 
engine. It will sell for $10,250. 
</P>
<P>
	A vision of the future for Smart was showcased in a concept  
roadster shown for the first time at the Frankfurt show. The 
convertible breaks out from the boxy Smart body with a longer, 
10 1/2-foot profile. But it still stands just shy of 4 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	The car incorporates the engine and other elements of the Smart  
coupe, meaning that it could placed into production more quickly, 
said Helmut Wawra, Smart's director of technical development. 
Company officials declined to speculate on when that might happen.

<HEADLINE> Expert Speaks At Amtrak Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A railroad signals expert testified today he  
found no evidence that a crossing gate hit a steel-loaded truck 
that drove into the path of an Amtrak train, setting off a crash 
that killed 11 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony of John Sharkey, a communications and signals  
general manager for Canadian National-Illinois Central Railroad, 
contradicted a witness who told of watching the descending gate hit 
the truck as it tried to beat the train across the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharkey's account came on the second of three days of public  
hearings called by the National Transportation Safety Board to seek 
clues in the March 15 crash of the City of New Orleans train near 
Bourbonnais, about 50 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 11 deaths, 122 people were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Luis A. Nieves, who claims he was driving the second  
of two cars stopped behind John R. Stokes' tractor-trailer, told 
board members through an interpreter that he saw he saw a crossing 
gate strike Stokes' truck as he attempted to drive it around the 
barrier, shortly before it was struck in the rear by the train. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sharkey said today that he investigated the crossing gate at  
the crash site and saw no markings indicating it hit the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	And truck driver Aubrey Fosburgh -- who was picking up cargo  
about 75 to 100 yards from the crash site -- said Monday the 
crossing gate was up when Stokes crossed the railroad, adding that 
he ``never (saw) the gate down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also described the ball of flame that shot into the air  
shortly after the crash. ``It was a mess,'' Fosburgh said, who 
rushed to the scene to help passengers escape a mangled train car. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflicting accounts did little to clear up two key  
questions: Was Stokes trying to drive his fully loaded truck around 
the railroad's crossing gates and beat the oncoming locomotive? Or 
did the crossing's warning signals activate too late -- or not at 
all -- leaving him unaware that the train was rumbling toward him at 
79 mph? 
</P>
<P>
	Following the conflicting testimony Monday, George Black, the  
NTSB member who is chairing the hearing said , ``I don't know that 
there's anything that is clear one way or another as a result of 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the NTSB probably won't make any final determinations  
until March. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, who was not hurt in the crash, refused to testify  
Monday. He told authorities after the crash that he didn't see the 
train approaching, and claimed the crossing's warning bells, lights 
and gates activated after he was on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony Monday, train engineer Angel Flores said he  
sounded the whistle and activated the emergency braking system as 
the train neared the truck, but said he didn't remember whether 
lights at the crossing were flashing.

<HEADLINE> Post-Elway Era Off to Rough Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The powerful offense looked ordinary. The  
risk-taking defense looked vulnerable. The usually reliable special 
teams? Don't even go there. 
</P>
<P>
	After one game, it's clear that life is going to be more  
difficult for the Denver Broncos without longtime leader John 
Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We let everyone down,'' linebacker Bill Romanowski said after  
Denver's season-opening 38-21 loss to the Miami Dolphins. ``We 
weren't playing for John Elway. He won't be forgotten, but he's not 
playing anymore. We have to play for everyone in this locker 
room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Elway, who engineered 47 game-winning or game-tying  
fourth-quarter drives in 16 seasons, would have been hard-pressed 
to make the Broncos look like two-time defending Super Bowl 
champions Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	His successor, second-year pro Brian Griese, was serviceable,  
but Denver repeatedly broke down defensively and had big problems 
with its kicking game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Elam, one of the NFL's most consistent kickers the past  
five seasons, had a field goal blocked and missed a 41-yard attempt 
that would have pulled Denver within two scores in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Miami blocked a punt and averted trouble when the  
Broncos failed to pounce on a muffed punt by Terrell Buckley in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting debacle -- Denver's worst home loss in five seasons  
under coach Mike Shanahan -- left many Broncos players stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what happened,'' defensive end Harald Hasselbach  
said. ``We felt great before the game. The atmosphere was great. 
Then, I just don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos weren't lacking motivation. They were playing on the  
night Denver retired Elway's jersey and inducted him into the 
team's Ring of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver also was trying to preserve its streak of 24 straight  
regular-season home wins. As it turns out, the Broncos fell three 
games short of the NFL record held by Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for any remaining air of invincibility.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no sense of doubt,'' said fullback Howard Griffith,  
``but we can't just show up at home and think that's going to do 
it. We have to take a good hard look at ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have a short week to prepare for Sunday's game at  
Kansas City, and Shanahan is confident Denver will recover from the 
Miami loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I expect our team to play at a higher level,''  
he said. ``I believe we're capable of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, the Broncos learned that Griese can handle the  
pressure of replacing Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing an aggressive pass rush, Griese completed 24 of 40 passes  
without an interception and played well enough to head off any talk 
of losing his job to Bubby Brister, who was demoted after four 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was my first game. I got into the fire. Nobody can say I  
don't have at least one game of experience anymore,'' Griese said. 
``From here on out, it can't get much harder than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to get a lot better and our team to get a lot better.  
This team has character. I guarantee you, we'll be back.''

row of Texas lawmen, all wearing cowboy hats and jeans and holding 
guns, staring straight into the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a fitting image of how he's seen by those who know him  
well: strong, confident, fearless before any opponent.

	Fellow prosecutor Don Cantrell says his friend has a clear moral  
code. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy that's got a sense of right and wrong and he's  
going to do only what's right,'' said Cantrell, county/district 
attorney of Limestone County, who has known Johnston, 40, since the 
early 1980s. ``There's no doubt he's a straight shooter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, appointed a federal prosecutor in 1987 at age 28, now  
stands at the center of a controversy over how the federal 
government handled the 1993 siege and fire at the Branch Davidian 
compound at Waco and the ensuing investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days after Johnston wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet  
Reno raising questions about a possible Justice Department cover-up 
in the Waco standoff, Johnston and his boss, U.S. Attorney James W. 
Blagg, were abruptly removed from the case, according to a court 
filing made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials said the federal prosecutors could be  
potential witnesses in the independent inquiry into the government 
siege and were removed to avoid the appearance of a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston told The Associated Press he wasn't sure what to make  
of the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying not to be paranoid,'' he said. ``I don't know how  
to characterize it. Nothing in this case surprises me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a comment likely to surprise few who know him, he added: ``I  
will continue to do what I think is right about this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston is the son of career Dallas County prosecutor Wilson  
Johnston, who helped try Jack Ruby for shooting Kennedy assassin 
Lee Harvey Oswald. He hung around the courthouse as a boy, watching 
trials and getting an early start on the career he pursued upon 
graduating from Baylor Law School in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a McLennan County prosecutor in Waco and later worked  
as police adviser and in private practice. After the Waco police 
became frustrated by the slow pace of drug prosecutions, city 
officials pressured U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm for a local branch of the 
San Antonio-based U.S. Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was tapped for the job. Locals say he was willing to  
take on crimes some federal prosecutors might have passed on. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he got in, he filed all these cases that had been thrown  
out of the DA's office and sent a bunch of people to the pen,'' 
said David Smith, a retired Waco city manager. ``I put my money on 
him always coming down on the right side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the best-known case of Johnston's career, he helped draft the  
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms search warrant that became 
the basis of the Feb. 28, 1993, raid and ensuing 51-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Johnston assisted in the 1994 criminal trial that  
resulted in manslaughter and weapons convictions of nine Branch 
Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	He made headlines in recent weeks after sending the Aug. 30  
letter to Reno in which he warned that he had seen documents 
indicating that other Justice lawyers had known for years about 
pyrotechnic grenades being used during the standoff. The FBI has 
now admitted after six years of denials that incendiary devices 
were used, but continues to deny they started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston said he doesn't regret his stand against the Justice  
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did what I did based on the facts presented to me and what I  
thought I had to do,'' he said. ``In August, the department 
continued to deny there were any issues ... I just had to do 
something.''

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Goes to Bat for Aparicio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelans want one of their own on  
major league baseball's Team of the Century -- Luis Aparicio. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by President Hugo Chavez, a big baseball fan, the country is  
waging a last-minute write-in campaign to get the former Chicago 
White Sox shortstop on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect so much enthusiasm over this,'' Aparicio told  
The Associated Press, acknowledging that current Venezuelan stars 
Andres Galarraga and Omar Vizquel have always been bigger favorites 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never doubted the affection of the people, but the  
Venezuelan fan is real tough,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aparicio, who won nine Gold Gloves and was an excellent base  
stealer, played on the 1959 White Sox team that made it to the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, he became the third Latin American elected to the Hall  
of Fame following Roberto Clemente of Puerto Rico and Juan Marichal 
of the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet for years, many in his home country weren't all that  
impressed. They remembered Aparicio as someone with a modest 
batting average while playing on mediocre teams in Venezuela's 
winter league. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Chavez, who threw out the first pitch at a New York  
Mets game this year, cast his vote for Aparicio and urged his 
countrymen to follow his lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm making a call to all Venezuelans to vote for Aparicio,''  
said Chavez, who voted on a laptop computer set up on a baseball 
field near the presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still time to help with your votes for this compatriot  
who has been a true glory for us, for Latin America and for the 
entire world,'' Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
	There isn't much time though, with voting to end in less than a  
week. In results released Tuesday, Aparicio was in sixth place 
among shortstops with 121,535 votes. Cal Ripken Jr., with 640,995 
votes, leads the group in which the top two will be selected to the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuelans aren't discouraged, however. They think they can  
fill the gap with a flurry of write-in votes. Local newspapers and 
TV stations also have been urging Venezuelans to get out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aparicio already did his part with his performance in the  
major leagues. Now with the magic of the Internet we have made the 
strength of Venezuelans known,'' said Cecilia Briceno, a college 
student in Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Gold Glove was created in 1957, Venezuelan shortstops  
have dominated. Aparicio was the first winner, and he was followed 
by Cincinnati's Dave Concepcion, who won five times in the 1970s. 
Vizquel of the Cleveland Indians has won the AL Gold Glove the last 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Aparicio played for the White Sox, the Baltimore Orioles and the  
Boston Red Sox in an 18-year career that ended in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	His lifetime average was only .262, but he scored 1,335 runs and  
drove in another 791. He also led the AL in stolen bases for nine 
straight years from his rookie season in 1956 through 1964. His 506 
career steals puts him in 30th place. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't enough to overcome Venezuelans' memories of his  
performances at home. In 13 winter league seasons, Aparicio hit 
.247 and never played on either of the two most popular teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows that's a big reason he was never a big star there, but  
he's touched by the belated support. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful to feel this support and above all to know that  
I was nominated and that my name appears among so many baseball 
greats,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  LSU Captain Arrested for Stealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Larry Foster, a captain on LSU's  
football team, was arrested Tuesday on a purse-snatching charge 
after being chased down and identified by several students. 
</P>
<P>
	The starting wide receiver was booked into the East Baton Rouge  
Parish Jail, LSU Police Capt. Ricky Adams said. Bail was set at 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gerry DiNardo said Foster would not play in Saturday's  
game against Auburn in Tiger Stadium. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have tremendous concern for Larry in this situation,''  
DiNardo said in a statement Tuesday night. ``As a football team 
right now we are moving on, but as a family we are concerned about 
Larry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A student said her purse was stolen Monday as she sat on a  
campus bench. Several other students said they saw the theft and 
chased Foster into a bathroom in the music building about a 
half-mile from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster was confronted as he left the bathroom and he identified  
himself before walking away, Adams said. The purse, missing about 
$20, was found in the bathroom, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses identified Foster from photos.  
</P>
<P>
	The senior was expected to be one of the Tigers' leading  
receivers this year. As a junior, he caught 56 passes for 722 yards 
and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, one of four team captains, missed last weekend's game  
against North Texas with a pulled hamstring. He returned to 
practice Monday and had been expected to play against Auburn on 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Kris S. Colt Sells for Record $3.9M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A bay yearling colt by Kris S. sold for a  
record $3.9 million Tuesday during the second day of the Keeneland 
September Yearling Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheikh Mohammed, crown prince of Dubai, United Arab Emirates,  
and owner of Godolphin Racing stable, bought the colt, who was 
consigned by Dixiana Farm as agent for Harold Harrison. The colt is 
out of the Mr. Prospector mare Mr. P's Princess. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the highest price paid for a yearling at Keeneland in  
September since the sale began in 1944. The previous record was set 
in 1997 when Satish Sanan and his Padua Stables purchased a son of 
Mr. Prospector for $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first day of the 11-day sale, Keeneland sold seven  
yearlings for $1 million or more. On Tuesday, 14 yearlings went for 
$1 million or more, three more than in the entire September 1998 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Keeneland sold 254 yearlings for $69,727,000. The  
average was $274,516 and the median was $147,500. A year ago, 
Keeneland sold 272 yearlings for $46,495,000. The average was 
$170,938 and the median was $100,000. This year's average is up 
60.6 percent and the median is up 47.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the first two days of the sale, Keeneland has sold 471  
yearlings for $120,889,000. The average is $256,665 and the median 
is $150,000. A year ago, Keeneland sold 523 head for $90,016,000 
for an average of $172,115 and a median of $105,000. The average is 
up 49.1 percent and the median is up 42 percent over the two days.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Ricardo Lopez, the unbeaten WBC 105-pound  
champion, will challenge Will Grigsby for the IBF 108-pound title 
Oct. 2, on a card that will also feature Julio Caesar Chavez, a 
former champion in three weight classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, of Mexico, will box Willy Wise, of Westbury, N.Y., in  
10-round bout, and if he wins he will challenge WBC champion Kostya 
Tszyu of Australia for the WBC super lightweight (140 pounds) title 
early next year, promoter Don King said Tuesday at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The show at the Las Vegas Hilton will be televised by Showtime.  
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, of Mexico, will take a 47-0-1 record, with 35 knockouts,  
into the fight against Grigsby, of St. Paul, Minn., who has only a 
14-1-1 record, with six knockouts, since turning pro in 1988. He 
did not fight from 1990 to '93. It will be Lopez's second title 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez (101-3-2, 84 knockouts) has two losses and a draw in his  
last three title fights. He was stopped in the fourth round by 
Oscar De La Hoya when he lost the WBC super lightweight title, 
fought to a draw when he tried to regain that title against Miguel 
Angel Gonzalez in 1998 and was stopped in the eighth round by De La 
Hoya in a bid to win the WBC welterweight title last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise has a 23-6-4 record, with seven knockouts.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Still Not Viable for NFL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The nation's second-largest city is back  
where it started six months ago -- without an NFL team or a place to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	An initial deadline to reach a stadium plan for Los Angeles had  
been set by the league for Wednesday. But that deadline is passing 
without action. 
</P>
<P>
	With great fanfare last March, the NFL spurned Houston and  
announced its intention to put an expansion team in the Los Angeles 
area. But there had to be an acceptable stadium and financing 
proposal by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The following month, the league turned its back on one of the  
two competing sites in Southern California -- Carson -- and chose the 
Coliseum as the preferred spot. 
</P>
<P>
	That relationship soured in July, when the NFL complained about  
a lack of public funding for the project at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The league then encouraged other suitors in the area to step up.  
Houston, which waited patiently while the NFL attempted to work out 
the LA deal, now seems to be back in the forefront of the muddled 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing has more lives than a cat,'' said Zev Yaroslavsky,  
a member of the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's deadline wasn't much of a deadline, with the NFL  
expected to entertain offers until the owners' meetings in Atlanta 
the week of Oct. 5 -- and possibly beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the expansion franchise goes to Houston, the league  
still hopes to put a team in Los Angeles at some point. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the bottom line for the NFL's 31 owners appears to be  
just that -- they want as much money for a team as they can get. 
</P>
<P>
	A new owner would have to pay the league a franchise fee, which  
could reach $600 million or more for the expansion team, in 
addition to the costly investment for a new stadium or for 
revamping an old one. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz, who initially backed a  
stadium-shopping mall complex in Carson and later joined the 
Coliseum effort, noted early on that the league's team owners 
didn't get where they are by being bad businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Wachs said the team owners  
``want to get their first billion-dollar deal here. It's not going 
to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public funds aside, the league might eventually do its first  
billion-dollar deal in LA since three billionaires seem eager to 
bring a team to town. 
</P>
<P>
	Grocery magnate Ron Burkle is a member of the team headed by  
Ovitz, who at one time seemed favored by the league as a potential 
team owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Backing the idea of renovating the Coliseum was Eli Broad, who  
made his money in housing construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Oilman Marvin Davis joined the game later, approaching the  
league about building a stadium at Hollywood Park, reviving another 
old proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	After representatives from LA and Houston met separately with  
NFL officials in New York this week, league spokesman Greg Aiello 
said it was still a ``four-horse race'' for the new franchise. He 
noted that because of the land and parking around Hollywood Park, 
it was the ``most doable'' of the three LA sites. 
</P>
<P>
	No one outside the NFL, however, seems certain what the league  
will do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for them to predict where 31 people are going to  
come from, especially this group of 31,'' Carson City Manager Jerry 
Groomes said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Roski, co-owner of the NHL's Los Angeles Kings and leader of  
the drive to build the New Staples Center downtown, revived the 
idea of bringing the NFL back to the Coliseum, without an NFL team 
since the Raiders following the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he and Broad have asked NFL officials to tell them  
exactly what they need to make a deal happen at the Coliseum, 
apparently the only firm demand was for more tax money -- something 
out of their control. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski, a real estate developer, is familiar with the negotiating  
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every deal I've done has it's ups and downs,'' he said  
recently. ``You just have to keep going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also thinks there are several alternatives for the league.  
</P>
<P>
	``They can award the team to Houston. They could move another  
team into the Los Angeles market. They could say to Houston, `Build 
a stadium and we will either give you the 32nd team or relocate a 
team,''' Roski said.

<HEADLINE> La. Officials Warn Vs. Encephalitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- People in and around Louisiana's capital  
are being warned to wear long pants, long-sleeved shirts and insect 
repellent because Eastern equine encephalitis -- the disease's 
deadliest strain -- has shown up in the area's mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Although only two people have been infected and both recovered,  
Eastern equine encephalitis kills 30 to 60 percent of the people it 
strikes, according to Dr. Jerome Goddard, medical entomologist for 
the Mississippi Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak has killed dozens of horses and emus in Louisiana,  
and officials are trying to contain the disease by spraying 
pesticides by plane. Ponds are being treated regularly to kill 
mosquito larvae. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern equine is the worst form of mosquito-borne encephalitis  
in North America. The St. Louis strain, which has killed three 
people in New York City in the past month, generally kills 3 to 20 
percent of its victims, Goddard said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Tuesday 90 percent of  
the city's mosquitoes have been killed by aerial and ground 
spraying of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has reported a total of 11 cases of St. Louis  
encephalitis; officials are awaiting lab results for 74 other 
people who may have been infected.

<HEADLINE> Northwest, Cyprus Airways To Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Cyprus Airways, this island's national  
carrier, has agreed to share flight information with Northwest 
Airlines in a deal that could boost tourism to Cyprus and give 
Northwest a stronger foothold in the east Mediterranean and Middle 
East markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The cooperation deal announced today allows Cyprus Airways to  
share flight codes with Northwest in a way that could give Cyprus 
Airways greater access to the U.S. market and make the island more 
accessible for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Birdsall, Northwest's senior vice president of Alliances  
and Strategic Planning, said Northwest would benefit by gaining an 
important gateway to major cities in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is to be noted that Northwest is the first American carrier  
that has chosen to have its code use on services to Cyprus,'' said 
Cyprus Airways Chairman Takis Kyriakides at the signing on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest, based in Eagan, Minn., has a fleet of 419 aircraft  
and more than 5,200 employees. It operates more than 1,700 flights 
a day to 150 destinations, and generates annual revenue of $9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus Airways, with 2,000 employees, flies its 12 planes to 32  
destinations. Its 1998 gross revenue was $146.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Pay to Former Bikini Residents OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House agreed Monday to a one-time payment  
of some $3.8 million to former residents of the Pacific Ocean atoll 
of Bikini, which was used as an atomic bomb testing site after 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved by a voice vote, was in recognition of the  
hardships suffered by the Bikini people, who were moved from their 
home in 1946 and are still unable to return because of high 
radiation levels. The measure requires Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	Relocations first to the island of Rongerik and later to Kili,  
400 miles south of Bikini, were ``the worst calamity imaginable for 
the Bikinian people'' said Robert Underwood, Guam's delegate to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds would come from a Bikini resettlement trust fund  
established in 1982. Over the years, Congress has appropriated $110 
million for the fund, which, through investments, has grown in 
value to about $126 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be distributed through a Bikini citizens' counsel  
primarily to 90 surviving elders who lived on the atoll at the time 
of the 1946 relocation. They are expected to spread the money to 
others in the community of some 2000 Bikinians living in Kili and 
other islands of the Marshall Islands group where Bikini is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
	Bikini is made up of a 54-mile-long reef encircling a lagoon and  
covering only 2.3 square miles. Between 1946 and 1958, there were 
23 atomic tests on the atoll that made it uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, the radiation levels were pronounced safe and some  
people returned, but they were resettled again in 1979 after new 
studies found the atoll unfit for human life. It is expected to 
take at least another decade of cleanup before people are allowed 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2368.

<HEADLINE> Senate Denounces Clemency Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate denounced the Clinton  
administration's clemency deal with Puerto Rican separatists on 
Tuesday, and one Republican accused the administration of blocking 
FBI testimony at a hearing on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 95-2 vote, the Senate criticized the arrangement that  
allowed 11 Puerto Ricans on Friday to leave federal prisons where 
they had been held for nearly two decades. The House approved a 
similar resolution last week 311-41. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat and Clinton  
administration loyalist, said he voted for the resolution because 
the administration failed to give him a reason to vote against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have repeatedly requested information on these cases. I have  
been given no such information,'' Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of how politically charged the measure was, Democrats  
barely discussed it in the floor debate, instead focusing on the 
Senate's failure to act on education initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate resolution's author, Sen. Paul Coverdell, R- Ga.,  
also accused the administration of stonewalling his hearing Tuesday 
on the clemency grant by yanking scheduled FBI testimony at the 
last minute and failing to provide requested documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell said an FBI agent was scheduled to testify at the  
Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism hearing he was holding 
Tuesday but that the FBI backed out Monday night at 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's pretty clear that the White House is behind  
this,'' Coverdell said. ``I think their silence is almost as 
damaging as the decision itself because it reinforces every 
conclusion their adversaries make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and some members of the law enforcement community  
have accused Clinton of offering clemency to boost his wife's 
all-but-announced Senate candidacy from New York, home to some 1.3 
million Puerto Ricans. The issue has turned into a political 
headache for Hilary Rodham Clinton, who later publicly opposed the 
clemency offers and angered New York's Puerto Rican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said agent Neal Gallagher was  
prepared to testify and submitted his prepared testimony to the 
Justice Department for approval, as is common practice. The Justice 
Department then pulled the plug, Bresson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Chris Watney responded by  
pointing to a letter to Coverdell, which explained that because the 
power to grant clemency is the president's exclusively, there are 
constitutional questions about whether it would be appropriate for 
FBI officials to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still being reviewed,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House counsel's office,  
denied the administration had ordered the FBI not to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell and others in Congress are requesting records the  
White House used in making the decision to grant clemency, such as 
prison records and other documents that are reported to show that 
the Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies were 
opposed to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month President Clinton offered clemency to the 11  
prisoners freed Friday, two prisoners who rejected the offer, one 
who accepted a deal to serve five more years and two who had 
already served out jail sentences and were forgiven outstanding 
fines. To accept the offer, they were required to renounce violence 
and meet other parole conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those offered clemency were members of the FALN -- the  
Spanish initials for Armed Forces of National Liberation -- which 
was responsible for some 130 bombings in the late 1970s and early 
1980s that left six dead and scores wounded. None of the 16 offered 
clemency was convicted of killing or wounding anyone, officials 
say.

<HEADLINE>  Greek Minister Dies in Plane Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Greece's top official for Europe and  
Cyprus and five others were killed Tuesday when their executive jet 
hit heavy turbulence and plummeted 19,000 feet before leveling off, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Foreign Minister Yiannos Kranidiotis, his 23-year-old son  
Nikos, were among the dead, said the Greek press ministry. Three 
others were hospitalized, including two with serious injuries, 
while the four others aboard were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot and co-pilot were unhurt and were able to land the  
government-owned Falcon executive jet in Bucharest, Basescu said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the deaths wasn't immediately clear, but those  
killed were apparently not strapped into their seats. Greek 
journalist Alfonso Vitalis, who was on board, told Greek state 
television that Kranidiotis was standing and briefing reporters 
when the plane suddenly lost altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Kranidiotis, 51, was on his way from Athens to Bucharest,  
Romania, for a meeting of Balkan foreign ministers when the 
aircraft apparently hit turbulence and rapidly dropped from 23,000 
feet to just 4,000 feet before the pilot regained control, said 
Gabriel Dumitrescu, the head of Romania's civil aviation authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred shortly after the plane entered Romanian  
airspace near Giurgiu, 40 miles southeast of Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from the deputy minister and his son, two journalists,  
Kranidiotis' bodyguard and the plane's engineer were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very shaken, the whole government, the whole ministry''  
said Foreign Minister George Papandreou, visibly upset. ``I 
personally can't believe it. We lost people giving a battle for 
peace in the Balkans. I've lost a friend. ... Greece and Cyprus 
have lost a tireless worker for human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer, the Cypriot-born Kranidiotis was general secretary of  
the foreign ministry for European affairs from 1994-1995, and then 
became deputy foreign minister. Earlier this year, he was promoted 
to the number two position in the ministry, and concentrated on 
European and Cypriot affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kranidiotis studied at Harvard University and Sussex University  
in Britain and authored of several books on Greece and Cypriot 
politics. Nikos was his only son.

<HEADLINE> 3 Hospitals Workers Die in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A gunman said to have been angered by his  
mother's death stormed into a hospital Tuesday and opened fire, 
authorities said, killing three employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the rampage ended when the suspect, identified as  
Dung Trinh, 43, was grabbed by people inside the hospital and held 
until police arrived. A gun was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinh was apparently angry at the West Anaheim Medical Center  
over the death of his mother at another hospital earlier that day, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mot Trinh, 72, had been treated at West Anaheim Medical Center  
in June for an undisclosed illness. She was taken to Anaheim 
Memorial West Hospital early Tuesday and died about five hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	After her death at about 10:30 a.m., police Lt. Steven Walker  
said Trinh drove a few blocks to West Anaheim Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suspect Trinh, armed with a handgun, opened fire, killing  
three victims,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness said one of the three was shot once when he tried to  
close the doors to a lobby and twice more when he struggled with 
the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when I grabbed my children and we ran out,'' said Faith  
Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd just like to thank him and say God bless him for what he  
tried to do for us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the victims as Marlene Mustaffa, 60, of Buena  
Park; Vincent Rosetti, 51, of Seal Beach; and Ronald Robertson, 51, 
of Fullerton. All worked at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the victims died where they fell. The third died a short  
time later in the hospital's emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said it appears the gunman fired off numerous rounds  
before he was disarmed, although they wouldn't say how many. The 
shootings occurred on two different floors.

<HEADLINE> NASA Evacuates Kennedy Space Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Just over 100 workers volunteered to  
stay behind at the evacuated Kennedy Space Center on Tuesday to 
ride out Hurricane Floyd, which NASA feared could destroy the 
launch pads and shuttle hangars. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters warned the storm could pass 40 miles offshore,  
bringing wind of 114 mph on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA evacuated its approximately 12,500 workers Monday and  
closed down the space center. It also reduced its skeleton staff to 
102, instead of the usual 120. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody else is gone. It's kind of eerie out here,'' NASA  
spokesman George Diller, one of the volunteers, said by telephone 
from a fortified building at the space center. ``I kind of can feel 
the concern growing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA feared not only the wind, but the storm surge. The space  
center is only 9 feet above sea level. And its space shuttle 
hangars and launch pads are designed to withstand wind of no more 
than 125 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	All four shuttles, worth $2 billion apiece, are parked indoors.  
At the nearby Cape Canaveral Air Station, four rockets stood 
exposed on launch pads. 
</P>
<P>
	The next shuttle mission is scheduled for the end of October but  
will probably be delayed because of the interruption in work.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Tours Pregnancy Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate  
Steve Forbes said Tuesday that one of his first acts, if elected 
president, would be to sign a ban on a type of late-term abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life begins at conception and should end only at natural  
death,'' Forbes said during a campaign stop at a Christian-based 
pregnancy counseling center. ``The law protects all of us, not just 
the healthy, strong, the rich, but also the elderly, the infirm and 
the unborn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the late-term procedures, which critics call ``partial  
birth'' abortions, should be banned, except in the case where the 
life of the mother was at stake. He said he would sign the ban 
regardless of whether it included exceptions for cases of rape or 
incest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Congress is ready to do it,'' he said. ``The ground is  
shifting, and I can feel it across America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before touring the Compassion Pregnancy Center of Macomb County,  
Forbes also reiterated his support for school choice, a flat-rate 
income tax, and changes in Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be such a contrast from what we've had in the last  
eight years,'' said Caroline Viviano, 33, of Clinton Township. 
``There's been so much deception and doubletalk. He's forthright 
and has a lot of courage in his convictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is Forbes' third trip to Michigan since March. He visited  
Lansing and Kentwood on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes faces an uphill fight in his quest for the Republican  
presidential nomination. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has the 
backing of Michigan Gov. John Engler, has a big lead in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm not worrying about polls,'' Forbes said. ``I  
worry about getting the message across.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that message includes support for school voucher  
proposals to allow parents to choose which school their children 
will attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``No mother should be forced to send her child to a lousy  
school,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also trumpeted his proposal to let individuals put their  
Social Security money into retirement accounts and his proposal to 
reduce taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Carl, director of Christians for Life, spoke to Forbes  
outside for a few minutes about his support of exceptions for a ban 
on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not endorsing him at this point,'' she said. ``We knew  
we weren't going to change his mind in an instant, but we wanted to 
give him food for thought and ask him to please change his 
position.''

<HEADLINE> New JonBenet Panel Being Seated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With the grand jury considering the JonBenet  
Ramsey slaying set to expire, the prosecutor said Tuesday he will 
seat a new jury without prequalifying its members to consider the 
case, which means it probably won't work on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The new panel will replace a jury that has been considering the  
Ramsey slaying and unrelated crimes for nearly 18 months. When that 
panel was seated, its members were questioned extensively about the 
1996 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike the 1998-1999 grand jury, these jurors will not ... be  
qualified to investigate the homicide of JonBenet Ramsey,'' said 
Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for Boulder County District Attorney 
Alex Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the new grand jury could work on the JonBenet case, Ms.  
Laurion said, ``The possibility is there, but it is remote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She declined additional comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The current grand jury, which will mark the first anniversary of  
its investigation into the slaying on Wednesday, has not met since 
May 25. Its term will expire Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The new grand jury selection is slated to begin Sept. 29.  
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled in the basement of  
the family's home on Dec. 26, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	John Ramsey found his daughter's body about eight hours after  
his wife, Patsy Ramsey, told police she had discovered a ransom 
note seeking money in exchange for JonBenet's safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said the Ramseys are under suspicion, while the  
couple has repeatedly proclaimed innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver defense attorney Scott Robinson, who has followed the  
Ramsey case closely, said he believes Hunter's announcement makes 
it clear there will be no rush to an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all along nobody's going to be indicted in this,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Cocoa Beach Residents Evacuating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COCOA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Jeff and Robin Ellenburg are veterans  
of natural disasters. They lived in Washington state when Mount St. 
Helens erupted, and stuck it out in Los Angeles during the 1994 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Hurricane Floyd barreled toward the Florida coast and  
this beach community, the Ellenburgs -- like most others in this 
beach community -- weren't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're out of here,'' said Ellenburg, who planned to go to  
Tampa with his wife and their 4-year-old daughter, Bayley, to ride 
out Floyd's fury. 
</P>
<P>
	All over Cocoa Beach on Monday, stores and restaurants were  
boarded up with plywood and normally clogged roads were thin with 
traffic as residents obeyed a mandatory evacuation order. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said Floyd -- one of the most powerful storms ever to  
threaten the United States -- could make landfall in the next couple 
of days between central Florida and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go away for a few days and come back and see  
what's left,'' Ellenburg said Monday, packing his car with 
computers, televisions, clothes and pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa Beach was like a ghost town late Monday as hotels and  
shops were shuttered and the Cocoa Beach Pier was roped off from 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Jon Surf Shop, famous for being open 24 hours a day, 7 days  
a week, was closed and sandbags packed around its glass doors. 
</P>
<P>
	A sign in the window at the Days Inn read, ``Sorry, we are  
closed for Floyd.'' Three maintenance golf carts were placed in the 
hotel lobby for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal residents from Miami to Daytona Beach were urged to  
evacuate Monday as well as those in low-lying areas and in mobile 
or manufactured homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brevard County residents who stayed would not be fined, but they  
wouldn't receive any help from policeman or firefighters should 
they want to be evacuated later, said Joan Heller, a county 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Sale, owner of Pete's Pawn Shop and East Coast Music on  
Route A1A, boarded up his store, located about a block from the 
beach, with metal shutters and was making plans to drive north. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a Florida native. I've lived here all my life,'' he said.  
``I've never run from a hurricane, but if this one looks like it's 
going to land, I'm out of here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dmitri Zourdos used an electric drill to attach plywood to the  
front door of his Sunrise Restaurant Diner in Cocoa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm scared,'' Zourdos said. ``I hope I'm doing this all for  
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby Port Canaveral was ordered closed and the port's 200  
ships were ordered to evacuate. Unlike during Hurricane Dennis last 
month, shrimpers and fisherman were heeding the order. The port 
authority also planned to issue fines of $1,000 per hour to any 
violators starting today at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some residents were taking a wait-and-see attitude  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big storm,'' said Sal Salvaggio, sipping a bottle of  
beer and smoking a cigarette in his front yard. ``But I'll evaluate 
the situation in the morning.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Nurses Upset Over Reprimands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Five years after a Boston Globe columnist died  
from a chemotherapy overdose at the prestigious Dana-Farber Cancer 
Institute, 13 nurses have been formally reprimanded by the state, 
even though they were delivering a dosage prescribed by a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	The nurses agreed to accept the reprimands, which force them to  
undergo retraining or re-certification. Three others involved in 
the case are fighting the charges, and two more accepted probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurses elsewhere said the punishment just increases the  
demoralization in a grueling profession. ``It's not right and it's 
not fair,'' said Margaret O'Malley, a nurse in Gloucester. 
</P>
<P>
	Dana-Farber officials have stood steadfastly behind the nurses,  
saying there was no way they could have known the medications were 
incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, two patients were given four times the appropriate  
dosages of a radical chemotherapy treatment. The overdoses killed 
Globe health columnist Betsy A. Lehman and damaged the heart of 
North Andover teacher Maureen Bateman, who later died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Distel, Lehman's husband, received a multimillion-dollar  
settlement from the hospital. The Batemans sued Dana-Farber and 
settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Board of Registration in Nursing cited 18  
Dana-Farber nurses who were connected with the overdoses. While 13 
agreed this summer to accept a reprimand, the three who are 
fighting the charges face a disciplinary hearing scheduled for Oct. 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more accepted a year's probation to avoid formal charges and  
a full-scale hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there was a bad result in the treatment of these two  
patients,'' said Anne Collins, general counsel for the Division of 
Registration, which oversees the nursing board. ``It's the board's 
concern that doesn't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No external or internal reviews -- including one by the state  
Department of Public Health -- found the nurses to be at fault, and 
Dana-Farber has since taken steps to prevent similar mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Reardon, an attorney who represents the nurses, said the  
13 agreed to the sanctions because they wanted the matter to 
finally end. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, ``There is a general sense that they shouldn't  
be held responsible for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The physician who wrote the erroneous chemotherapy order, Dr.  
James Foran, was training in oncology at the time and did not 
reapply for his license to practice medicine in Massachusetts. He 
now does cancer research in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The state pharmacy board also reprimanded three Dana-Farber  
pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurses elsewhere said the reprimands make a tough job tougher.  
They pointed to the grueling aspects of nursing: long hours, dirty 
and often unappreciated work and low pay. The average pay for 
Massachusetts nurses is $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Karen Daley, president of the 20,000-member Massachusetts  
Nurses Association: ``It's a very tough time to be a nurse.''

<HEADLINE> Biggest Italia Insurer Wants No. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Italy's biggest insurance company,  
Assicurazioni Generali, on Tuesday made an unsolicited bid for the 
country's No. 2 insurer, INA, the Italian stock market regulatory 
body said. 
</P>
<P>
	Generali, saying it was going after all of the share capital in  
INA, or Istituto Nazionale dalle Asicurazioni SpA, in a deal valued 
at about $12.7 billion. It said it would offer the euro equivalent 
of 86 cents plus 0.7 of a Generali share for each INA share. 
</P>
<P>
	Generali called an extraordinary shareholders meeting for Nov.  
4-6 to approve a capital increase to cover the offer. It said it 
wants two-thirds plus one share of INA's capital but would consider 
amounts as small as 34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week San Paolo IMI, Italy's largest bank in terms of  
assets, and INA had said they agreed to work rapidly at studying a 
possible merger. INA already controls Banco di Napoli SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Should either of the mergers come off, it would create Italy's  
largest banking-insurance group. 
</P>
<P>
	Generali's move was immediately branded as hostile by INA.  
</P>
<P>
	The bid is ``hostile from the start,'' said INA chairman Sergio  
Siglienti. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Unicredito Italiano bettered its position for a  
takeover of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by signing on as one of the 
banks which would finance Generali's takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	INA owns 7.4 percent of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, and should  
Generali win a takeover battle against San Paolo, Unicredito's 
bonus could be INA's stake in Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. 
</P>
<P>
	Banca di Roma last April rejected an unsolicited takeover offer  
from San Paolo. That sparked speculation that San Paolo would shift 
its sights to INA and its Banco di Napoli holding.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Slave Labor Talks Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Compensation negotiations with 16 German  
companies that used Nazi slave labor will go forward despite the 
dismissal of several related lawsuits, a top Treasury Department 
official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies have assured us formally that they wish to  
continue participating,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. 
Eizenstat told a hearing of the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said that while the companies want a legal conclusion,  
they also have always viewed it as ``primarily a moral issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In two separate rulings Monday, federal judges dismissed cases  
against Ford Motor Co. and two German companies. But under 
international negotiations being overseen by Eizenstat, German 
industry and the German government are planning to set up two 
foundations or funds to handle survivor claims -- a system Eizenstat 
said would be faster and cover more people than pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	And he urged both the companies and attorneys for survivors to  
compromise on a settlement amount, a figure on which he said they 
remain ``far apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The German companies have time and again denied any legal  
liability in U.S. courts, but have clearly indicated their moral 
responsibility for the gross abuses inflicted on millions of forced 
and slave laborers,'' Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now time that they make a proposal to settle the suits  
in a fashion consistent with their moral responsibility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to describe the amounts of money under negotiations  
but said the two sides will have to ``give considerably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for survivors at one time reportedly demanded $20  
billion. German industry has offered $1.7 billion to compensate for 
using Nazi camp inmates for slave labor during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that plaintiffs' attorneys are aware that the initial  
monetary demands they have put forward in this negotiation are not 
considered realistic by German industry or the German government,'' 
Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those attorneys will need to show flexibility if these cases  
are to be settled within the lifetimes of the survivors they 
represent,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jags Not Overconfident After Rout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars face one  
mind-numbing question: How do they top that? 
</P>
<P>
	Only minutes after the Jaguars left the field following a 41-3  
pounding of San Francisco, coach Tom Coughlin and the rest of the 
team started trying to figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is terrified of complacency,'' defensive lineman  
Seth Payne said. ``I'm sure we'll come out and practice twice as 
hard this week as we did last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could be a good idea for a team that has traditionally had  
trouble dealing with such resounding success. 
</P>
<P>
	A few examples from last season include:  
</P>
<P>
	--A 17-16 loss at Buffalo in the game that triggered Flutiemania.  
It came on the heels of an emotional Monday night victory over 
Miami that pushed the Jaguars to 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 30-15 loss at Pittsburgh after a come-from-behind win at home  
over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 34-24 playoff loss at the Jets after winning the first home  
playoff game in team history over New England. 
</P>
<P>
	This week sets up very much the same. The Jaguars will be big  
favorites when they play the Carolina Panthers in their home 
opener, a game in which defensive coordinator Dom Capers will face 
the team that fired him as head coach after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes after the biggest blowout in the team's five-year  
history, a victory that did nothing but feed the Super Bowl 
aspirations that were already flowing freely. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is no time to be reflective,'' Coughlin said. ``We can be  
happy, excited about a good victory. But we've got to keep it in 
perspective. It's a 16-game season. There are still 15 more 
mountains to climb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of them are bound to be steeper than what the Jaguars faced  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second half that will be long remembered in this town,  
Jacksonville outscored the five-time Super Bowl champions 35-0. 
Capers' revamped defense made future Hall of Famers Steve Young and 
Jerry Rice look old and average. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Brackens began the final year of his contract in style with  
a sack and a forced fumble on one play, a key fourth-down tackle of 
Young on another. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Aaron Beasley had two interceptions and six pass  
deflections against what was supposed to be the best trio of 
receivers in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco gained only 205 yards and converted just one of 14  
third downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you win the way we won, you don't want to get  
lackadaisical, you don't want to have a letdown,'' said rookie 
cornerback Fernando Bryant, who held Rice to two catches. ``I've 
heard this team has had a thing about getting complacent after 
having a good showing. They've had trouble putting a good run 
together. We want to put a good run together this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About the only bad news to come out of the game was a sprained  
left foot sustained by running back Fred Taylor. He limped around 
Monday wearing an air cast. Coughlin said it was too early to tell 
how severe the injury was.

<HEADLINE> Senators Give 'Silver Sewer' to Fox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two days after Fox television's ``Ally  
McBeal'' won an Emmy for best comedy, the network was singled out 
by Sen. Joseph Lieberman and William Bennett for what they said 
were too many shows with vulgar, sexual content. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and Lieberman -- culture critics who for years have tried  
to persuade the music, TV and video game industries to produce more 
wholesome fare -- gave Fox their third annual ``Silver Sewer'' award 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing seems too cheap or degrading to be played for a  
laugh,'' said Lieberman, D-Conn. He and Bennett asked News Corp. 
Chairman Rupert Murdoch, in a letter, to use his influence to 
improve the network's programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch's News Corp. is a worldwide media conglomerate that  
includes newspapers, Fox television, 20th Century Fox film studio 
and satellite networks in Europe and Asia. Through Fox Sports, 
Murdoch also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, a conservative who was a top official in the Reagan and  
Bush administrations, said the American public should reconsider 
its viewing preferences, so that shows with smutty content don't 
garner high ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	But entertainment executives should also bear responsibility for  
a barrage of sexual and violent imagery that is difficult to 
escape, especially for parents who can't constantly police their 
children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't keep it away from the kids ... It's a siege. If you  
turn it off at your house, they'll see it at somebody else's 
house,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and Lieberman singled out several of Fox's new fall  
shows, including the family drama ``Get Real,'' the sitcoms 
``Manchester Prep'' and ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' and ``Action,'' 
a satire of the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, in a statement, said it supports voluntary content ratings  
-- ``Action,'' for instance, is rated for mature audiences only -- 
and stressed that viewers can always turn off shows they don't want 
to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average American television home now receives more than 57  
different television channels,'' said the statement. ``That means 
when any program airs, the typical viewer commands another 56 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents will have more power to block out objectionable  
programming by the year's end, when all new TV sets 13 inches and 
larger are required to have v-chip technology. Broadcast and cable 
networks are developing electronically coded TV ratings necessary 
for the v-chips to work. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the ``Silver Sewer'' has gone to CBS for airing a  
``60 Minutes'' broadcast of euthanasia by Dr. Jack Kevorkian and 
shock jock Howard Stern's raunchy television show, and to Seagram 
Inc. for supporting Jerry Springer's talk show and shock-rocker 
Marilyn Manson.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Home-Schooling Mom Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- A home-schooling mother was released from  
jail Tuesday after spending nearly two weeks behind bars in a 
dispute with public school officials over her son's special 
education needs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case closely watched by advocates of school choice, Karen  
Maple was set free by the judge who had jailed her on contempt 
charges on Sept. 1. She had refused to follow an order to take her 
15-year-old son, Trevor, to Vermont's child protection agency so 
his education needs could be evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	In setting Ms. Maple free, Judge Michael Kupersmith threatened  
to fine her $100 a day if she doesn't take Trevor to the agency on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maple said she didn't know where her son was, although she  
believed he was staying with friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want my son locked up and treated the way I've been  
treated for the last two weeks,'' the 36-year-old single mother 
said, weeping, after the hearing. ``He's now considered a fugitive 
and he's just a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Young, the commissioner of the child welfare agency,  
said officials had no intentions of locking up Trevor. ``Many of 
the children in our custody are at home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has drawn wide attention and sympathy for Ms. Maple.  
About 30 people demonstrated in her support outside the courthouse 
Tuesday and then lined the spectators' gallery during her hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial last Friday in The Wall Street Journal said cases  
like Ms. Maple's extend ``beyond the issue of home schooling to the 
fundamental rights of families to raise their children the way they 
see fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont parents are allowed to school their children at home but  
must submit an annual report to the state Department of Education 
describing the academic program. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Maple and her local school district in Bakersfield were  
unable to agree on an education plan for Trevor, and administrators 
decided Trevor needed special education services because he was 
behind on reading and other language skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maple says her son loves science, is a whiz at math and that  
they're working on his language skills. She said she's agreed to 
have a tutor brought in to help Trevor with language skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maple has said she resented school officials' intrusion into  
her family's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Kupersmith granted Ms. Maple's release Tuesday on a motion by  
the state Department of Corrections, which argued that the state 
needs its scarce jail beds for violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is supposed to be about the best interests of the  
child,'' the judge said. ``While Ms. Maple is incarcerated, all of 
T.M.'s (Trevor Maple's) interests are being ignored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kupersmith also acknowledged that continuing Maple's  
incarceration ``is not likely to ensure the appearance of her 
son.''

<HEADLINE> American Bags Some New Year Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Whatever people have planned for the last New  
Year's Eve of the millennium, apparently sitting aboard a jetliner 
isn't high on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines said Tuesday it will scrap 20 percent of its  
flights on Dec. 31 and 5 percent on Jan. 1 because of slow ticket 
sales. Officials blamed the calendar while discounting the 
possibility of travelers being worried about the Y2K computer bug 
fouling airline operations or safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Smith, a spokesman for American, said the airline has  
completed its Y2K compliance and is now running tests to check 
compatibility with computer systems in airports and air-traffic 
control centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for the cancelations simply is we're not seeing the  
business,'' Smith said. Advance reservations for Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 
-- almost always slow travel days -- are way off, he said. So instead 
of canceling about 10 percent of its New Year's Eve flights, as 
American did last year, the No. 2 U.S. carrier is canceling double 
that number. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said bookings are ahead of pace for other days around the  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agent Joe Galloway wasn't surprised by the New Year's Eve  
cancelations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants to go anywhere because it's party time,'' said  
Galloway, who owns Transcontinental Travel in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	As for travelers' fears of the much-ballyhooed Y2K bug: ``We  
haven't had anyone that is worried about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts said there might be at least an indirect  
connection between slow airline ticket sales and Y2K fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Neidl of ING Barings said he knows stock-portfolio managers  
who got memos to stay near the office over New Year's in case their 
own computers encounter Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, with all the stories about jets falling out of the sky  
on New Year's, I can see why maybe people are booking away,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Engel, an airline analyst for Goldman Sachs, got a memo  
warning about expected travel delays on New Year's weekend. For 
employees planning on working the next Monday or Tuesday, the 
investment-banking firm recommends against travel after Thursday, 
Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	American is believed to be the first major U.S. carrier to  
announce New Year's weekend cancelations, although British 
billionaire Richard Branson announced that his Virgin Atlantic 
Airlines jets won't fly so that employees can celebrate the turn of 
the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines is reviewing its advance sales for the New  
Year's weekend, but a spokeswoman said any decision on cancelations 
is probably two weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Killian, a spokesman for Northwest Airlines, said the  
airline usually reduces flights on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1, and added, 
``We expect to do the same this year.'' Other major U.S. airlines 
couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration says it has repaired its  
critical equipment to handle the new century. Some older computers 
read years by only the last two digits, leading to fear that they 
would malfunction by reading Jan. 1 as 1900 instead of 2000.

<HEADLINE>  Princess Diana's Necklace Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stunning 178-diamond and pearl necklace  
Princess Diana wore at her last official engagement was unveiled 
Tuesday prior to an auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The piece, along with a pair of matching earrings that were made  
for Diana but never worn, is set to be auctioned Dec. 16 by the New 
York-based auction house Guernsey's. 
</P>
<P>
	The minimum opening bid is $500,000. There was no estimate on  
what it would fetch. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlan Ettinger, president of Guernsey's, said the set is the  
only jewelry worn by the princess likely to be sold because the 
rest of her jewels are owned by her family or the British crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Diana wore the necklace to The Royal Gala Performance  
of Swan Lake at the Royal Albert Hall on June 3, 1997. She died in 
a car crash in Paris nearly three months later. 
</P>
<P>
	It was made by the crown jeweler, an English firm known as  
Garrard, which has since joined with another company to form Asprey 
&AMP; Garrard's. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months before her death, the princess returned the  
necklace to Garrard's so the earrings could be made. The royal 
family eventually decided to have Garrard's sell the pieces to 
benefit Diana's memorial fund.

since it was introduced in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 24-26 match will be played on a clay court at the  
Austrian city of Klagenfurt, with the winner qualifying for the 
World Group in next year's competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the match is being played on clay, Sweden's top-ranked  
player, Thomas Enqvist, will not play. Also missing the tie are 
Thomas Johansson and Jonas Bjorkman, both out with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hageskog nominated Magnus Gustafsson and Magnus Norman for

	FERRUM, Va. (AP) -- Ferrum College basketball player Brian Reed  
died Tuesday from a brain aneurysm, a day after collapsing in the 
college's weight room. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said the aneurysm was natural and not brought on by the  
workout, the school said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, 19, died shortly before 8 p.m. when he was taken off life  
support at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, school spokesman 
Matt Conn said. Reed had collapsed while working out in the weight 
room at about 4:23 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency personnel responded to a call for help at 4:30 p.m.,  
said Claude Webster, director of public safety for Franklin County. 
Rescue workers found Reed, of Virginia Beach, unconscious but 
breathing on the floor, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed's breathing became labored as he was transported to  
Carilion Franklin Memorial Hospital, and he was immediately 
airlifted to Roanoke Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, a 6-foot-5 forward on the basketball team, was studying  
for a dual major in computer science and information systems. He 
also played football last season.

<HEADLINE> GOP Considers Delaying Tax Credits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are considering delays in  
mailing tax credit checks to millions of poor families as part of a 
search for money to help pay for big spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than receiving their earned-income tax benefits in a lump  
sum after they file -- as most of the 20 million recipients 
currently do -- people receiving the payments would get them in 
quarterly or monthly installments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't hurt anybody,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``It's just spreading out the 
payments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials and congressional Democrats  
accused Republicans of unfairly taking money from low-income 
American families to finance federal agencies' budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the GOP idea would hurt the poor because many of them  
rely on the lump-sum payments to buy used cars and other big-ticket 
items. The proposal would force many of them to rely instead on 
costly loans, Democrats said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is ``tantamount to a tax increase on working  
families,'' said Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the president will not let the Republicans dramatically  
cut taxes on the rich, they have decided to get back at Democrats 
in Washington by raising taxes on the hard-pressed working 
families,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., referring to 
President Clinton's promised veto of the GOP's 10-year, $792 
billion tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan drew a mixed reaction from Senate Republicans, casting  
doubts on its viability. While some conservatives embraced the 
idea, moderates criticized it. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,  
said he considered the idea ``dead on arrival,'' saying, ``I don't 
think we should ration things like'' the earned income credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever its fate, the proposal underlined the lengths to which  
Republicans are hunting for ways to pay for must-pass spending 
bills without spending the Social Security surplus, which both 
parties have pledged to leave untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Congress has sent Clinton just two of the 13 annual  
spending bills for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. Their overall 
price tag is more than $500 billion, or nearly one-third of the 
overall federal budget, and Republicans need to find tens of 
billions in savings for bills that can pass Congress and get 
Clinton's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the measures, GOP leaders have already said they will  
use all $14 billion of the projected budget surplus excluding 
Social Security. Their desire to avoid using Social Security money 
for the spending bills -- until now a routine Washington practice 
for decades -- has led them to plans like delaying the earned income 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Another idea popular with Senate Republicans for coping with the  
spending problem is so-called forward funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Under this perennially used practice, money is approved that is  
mostly not available until the following fiscal year. That has the 
effect of pushing spending pressures from one year into the next. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said that Clinton's 2000 budget proposed $19 billion  
of such expenditures and that there was $11.6 billion of such money 
in this year's budget. Stevens said Republicans would slightly 
exceed that amount for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders have also been hoping to reap savings by  
getting unspent money back from the states for welfare, Medicaid 
and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Governors have been reluctant to return the money, but might do  
so if Congress increases states' flexibility to use federal funds, 
said Clinton Keyes, executive director of the Republican Governors' 
Association. Keyes said some GOP governors plan to discuss the 
situation Thursday with congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Enacted in 1975 under President Ford, the earned income credit  
is designed to discourage low-income families from falling back 
onto welfare. Its benefits have been improved several times, and 
the program has been a frequent battleground between liberals 
trying to expand it and conservatives hoping to curtail it. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit averages $1,890 annually for families with children,  
and is expected to cost nearly $32 billion next year, according to 
Treasury Department figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Feehery said the GOP proposal would save up to $8.7 billion in  
fiscal 2000, which begins on Oct. 1. The savings would come mostly 
from delaying some of the payments into the following fiscal year, 
a problem lawmakers would have to deal with then.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Work Out Before Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- The early Hurricanes get the work.  
</P>
<P>
	Racing to beat the effects of Hurricane Floyd's passing, No. 8  
Miami was on the practice field shortly after dawn Tuesday to get 
in a full workout in preparation for Saturday's showdown against 
No. 3 Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh man,'' said tackle Robert Hall, who estimated he got four  
hours of sleep before hitting the practice field at 7:30 a.m. ``I 
didn't do too well today. But I think overall we had a good 
practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the second straight day the Hurricanes adjusted their  
practice schedule to account for Floyd, a massive storm looming off 
Florida's Atlantic coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Butch Davis called an unscheduled workout for Monday  
afternoon, usually a day off, before giving the team an early 
wakeup call Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not always easy ... to take the time this morning, get up  
early and come in and take this small window of opportunity with 
the weather and have as good a practice as we possibly could 
have,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though tropical storm-force winds and scattered rain arrived  
around midday, Floyd proved to be little threat to the campus. 
Hurricane warnings were reduced to tropical storm warnings by late 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the Hurricanes would resume their usual practice  
schedule Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tricky,'' quarterback Kenny Kelly said of the changes.  
``You never know what tomorrow's schedule is going to be. So we 
play and see what happens tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly and his teammates certainly don't seem to be fazed by  
hurricane upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, the threat of Hurricane Georges forced Miami  
into a last-minute postponement of its game against UCLA. 
Rescheduled for early December, Miami handed the Bruins their first 
loss with a 49-45 upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``To some extent, last year's UCLA preparation was a little bit  
of a dry run for these kind of situations,'' Davis said. ``All of 
our players got an opportunity to get home last night, help their 
families board up if they needed to and spend some time with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, the UCLA win has led to lighthearted suggestions  
that hurricane postponements could be something of a secret weapon 
for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At last month's kickoff luncheon, Davis joked that he and  
athletic director Paul Dee were discussing which game on the 
schedule needed to be moved to the end of the season. And earlier 
this week, Dee referred to the first Saturday in December as ``our 
annual hurricane makeup day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis took a more serious tone Tuesday. He recalled the 1996  
season, when preparations for a game against East Carolina were 
hampered by four days of rain and lightning. Miami lost 31-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the most atrocious weather that you've ever seen,''  
Davis recalled. ``We tried to watch film, we tried to practice in 
the gym, we had a halfway sloppy practice one day, then we went 
back to the gym the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got beat and I vowed then that whatever we had to do --  
practice at 6 a.m., midnight, whatever -- we were going to practice. 
You don't play very well if you don't prepare well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what would it have taken for Davis to forgo practice  
Tuesday? 
</P>
<P>
	``The National Guard dragging us off the field,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Gretzky Could Have Arthritis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Recently retired hockey great Wayne Gretzky seems  
to be suffering from arthritis and will become the official 
spokesman for the Osteoarthritis Early Awareness Campaign, 
according to a newspaper report today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that he was quite surprised about it'' when told by  
doctors he could have arthritis, Annie Beauchemin, manager of 
public relations in Canada for Johnson's McNeil Consumer 
Healthcare, told the Toronto Globe and Mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The healthcare group is launching the public-relations project  
to make people more aware of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Beauchemin said that, in a videotaped interview, Gretzky said he  
was taken aback that the disease could strike people at such a 
young age. 
</P>
<P>
	``The critical thing here is that he will raise awareness that  
if someone at an early age is feeling pain they should ask their 
doctors about it. ... The earlier they can diagnose what kind of 
arthritis it is, the quicker they can decide on a plan of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denis Morrice, president of the Toronto-based Arthritis Society,  
said he learned last week that Gretzky is showing early signs of 
osteoarthritis in his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who had examined Gretzky after he complained of pain had  
told him it could be caused by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Osteoarthritis, which generally hits people about the age of 55,  
is a painful condition that results from wear and tear of the 
joints that causes cartilage to degenerate, leaving bone to rub 
against bone. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear what impact the arthritis -- the most common  
cause of long-term disability in Canada -- may have had on the 
38-year-old Gretzky's decision to retire from the NHL last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthritis, Morrice said, is hardly uncommon among hockey  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't have the early signs of it already,'' he said,  
``they will have it later on ... what with the battering these guys 
take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months before retiring, Gretzky acknowledged the physical  
toll that the game was taking on his body. He said he was 
experiencing pain, stiffness and numbness in his upper back, lower 
neck and right shoulder and arm.

<HEADLINE> Protection Schemes Bilk Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chris Weddle, a college student with just one  
credit card, had received numerous calls from telemarketers 
offering plans that would supposedly protect him from being held 
liable for charges he did not make. 
</P>
<P>
	He resisted time and again, saying he did not need additional  
safeguards beyond those guaranteed by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them would just keep pushing,'' said Weddle of Santa  
Maria, Calif. ``There were a couple of times where I just had to 
hang up on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one company didn't take ``no'' for an answer -- and  
ironically, charged Weddle an unauthorized $240 on his credit card 
bill for a plan to protect against unauthorized charges. After he 
protested, the company forgave the $240. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators say credit card protection scams have become  
big business for fraudulent operations who target people unaware of 
the rights they already have. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission was announcing cases against  
several such companies today, who are accused of bilking consumers 
out of $25 million by exploiting concerns about card theft, loss or 
Y2K-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``These companies took advantage of students, seniors and others  
scared into thinking they were vulnerable,'' said Jodie Bernstein, 
director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general in Illinois, Ohio, Arizona, Florida, West  
Virginia and Wisconsin planned similar actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card holders already are entitled to certain protections  
without having to pay for them. Federal law caps at $50 the maximum 
a credit card customer can be held liable for as a result of 
unauthorized charges. Lenders often opt to waive this fee as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Visa, for example, has a ``zero liability'' policy for customers  
who report fraudulent charges within two business days of 
discovering them. Customers might realize their credit card is 
missing right away or might not discover the fraudulent charges 
until they notice them on their monthly bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In some instances, the telemarketers posed as representatives of  
major credit card companies and would scare cardholders into 
thinking that they should pay for additional protection because 
criminals were stealing card numbers over the Internet, the FTC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telemarketers also told consumers they could be held fully  
liable for charges they did not consent to on their bills. In 
another twist on the scam, telemarketers called credit cardholders 
to warn them that the millennium bug could expose their card to 
fraud that the offered protection plan would avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	According to regulators, telemarketers sometimes trick consumers  
by reciting parts of their credit card number and asking for the 
rest of the digits, claiming they need to verify the security of 
the card. With the full number in hand, the companies could bill 
directly to the credit card, with charges ranging from $200 to 
$400. Some consumers, like Weddle, had not consented to any 
services but were billed for them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and credit card issuers say the red flags should go up for  
cardholders if they are asked to provide their number. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers should never need to provide their account  
information over the phone unless they initiated the call,'' said 
Charlotte Birch of the American Bankers Association. If customers 
have doubts about plans being touted as from their bank, she said, 
they should call the bank directly and ask if the service is 
sponsored by them. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates also warn credit cardholders against getting  
trapped into paying an unneeded expense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Credit card protection is a racket,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski,  
consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research 
Group. The programs ``are overpriced and aggressively and 
deceptively marketed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardholders could be using the money to pay down their  
principle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said today it has filed complaints against the Arizona  
corporations of Source One Publications Inc., Liberty Direct Inc. 
and The Ascendix Group Inc. It also announced a settlement with 
Credit Mart Financial Strategies Inc. of Montreal. Under the 
consent agreement, Credit Mart will provide $100,000 in refunds to 
consumers.

<HEADLINE>  Dundee Likes Trinidad in Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Angelo Dundee thinks Felix Trinidad will stop  
Oscar De La Hoya, just as Sugar Ray Leonard stopped Thomas Hearns 
18 years ago -- only quicker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Trinidad is going to stop De La Hoya in about six  
rounds,'' said the veteran trainer, who was in Leonard's corner 
when Sugar Ray stopped the Hit Man in the 13th round Sept. 16, 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard-Hearns outdoors at Caesars Palace was a truly great  
fight between two welterweight champions that lived up to its hype. 
</P>
<P>
	The hype for De La Hoya and Trinidad probably doesn't rival that  
of the Leonard-Hearns match, but it is big -- and deservedly so. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya (WBC) and Trinidad (IBF) are unbeaten welterweight  
champions, who can box and punch with power. It would be surprising 
if their 12-round bout indoors at Mandalay Bay was not 
action-packed. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, like Leonard, won an Olympic gold medal, then  
launched a lucrative pro career that, enhanced by a winning 
personality, has made him a celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, like Hearns, feels unfairly overshadowed by a more  
popular opponent and sees the fight as a chance to square accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel strongly Trinidad has the style to beat De La Hoya,''  
Dundee said. ``He's shorter (5-foot-10) than De La Hoya (5-11), but 
he stands taller. De La Hoya spreads (his feet) because he looks to 
load up with a counter left hook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking for a knockout after he had Hearns in trouble in the  
sixth and seventh rounds almost cost Leonard the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember vividly Ray stopped doing what he was supposed to  
do,'' Dundee said. ``He started to load up.'' And he started to get 
outboxed the tall and lanky Hearns. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the 13th round, Dundee could be heard on  
television imploring, ``You're blowin' it now, son. You're blowin' 
it.'' Leonard was behind by two, three and four points on the three 
official cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard knocked Hearns down in the 13th round, then stopped him  
in the 14th to add the WBA welterweight title to his WBC 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	If Hearns had gotten through the 14th round, it would have been  
a two-point round for Leonard, making him even on one card and one 
and two points behind on the other two. It would still have been 
possible for Leonard to win a decision with another two-point round 
in the 15th. A one-point round would have made it a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	There was controversy over the scoring, with Leonard's camp  
complaining that the rounds Leonard won were not as close as the 
rounds won by Hearns. The sixth and seventh rounds appeared to have 
been legitimate 10-8 rounds, but all three judges scored them 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Trinidad expressed concern over the judging for  
Saturday night's fight. Sixteen of the wins on De La Hoya's record 
(31-0, 25 knockouts) were in Las Vegas. Trinidad (35-0, 30 
knockouts) is 6-0 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, promoted by Don King, also noted that Bob Arum, De La  
Hoya's promoter is based in Las Vegas. King is based in Florida, 
but he maintains a home at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Ratner, the executive director the Nevada State Athletic  
Commission, said both camps have agreed to the officials. They will 
be referee Mitch Halpern of Las Vegas and judges Jerry Roth of Las 
Vegas, Glen Hamada of Tacoma, Wash., and Bob Logist of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the 1999 FightFax record book, Roth has not scored  
for the loser in 45 title bouts in which there was a decision 
winner. That means he agreed with at least one other judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth also was in five draws, with one of them being the second  
Leonard-Hearns fight, which he scored for Hearns. Hamada has scored 
for the winner in all seven decision fights he has worked and 
Logist is 12-for-12.

	Nick Davis likes a challenge, which is why he wants Wisconsin to  
begin its Big Ten Conference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and the ninth-ranked Badgers (2-0) have to wait another  
week: it's Cincinnati on Saturday before their two biggest games of 
the season -- No. 6 Michigan at home on Sept. 25; at No. 13 Ohio 
State the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some momentum, but I think the next game we can get  
even more momentum,'' Davis, the Badgers' kick and punt return 
whiz, said. ``Playing the Big Ten teams, that's our conference, and 
we want to get rolling. We are really on a roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Badgers' Ron Dayne chases Ricky Williams' year-old  
career rushing record, Davis was on a roll of his own last week in 
a 50-10 rout of Ball State. He ran up 227 all-purpose yards, 
including a 77-yard TD run on a free kick following a safety. He 
also had four catches for 91 yards subbing at wide receiver for the 
injured Chris Chambers.

jumped back into the college ranks this season: 
</P>

Southern California coach, is 2-0 at UNLV, a team that had a 
16-game losing streak when he took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Erickson, former Seattle Seahawks and Miami Hurricanes  
coach, is 2-0 at Oregon State, which is after its first winning 
season since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	June Jones, former Atlanta Falcons and San Diego Chargers coach,  
is 1-1 at Hawaii, which just beat Eastern Illinois 31-27 to end 
major college's longest losing streak at 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's Kevin Steele, former Carolina Panthers  
assistant, who is 0-2 at Baylor. One loss came on a missed extra 
point in overtime, the other last Saturday when the Bears fumbled 
on the last play of the game only to have it returned 99 yards by 
UNLV for the winning points.

<HEADLINE> Group Sues To Oppose School District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Several community groups and individuals contend  
a takeover of the city's troubled school system stripped them of 
their right to vote and are asking a federal judge to declare the 
replacement of the elected school board as unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court here seeks an  
injunction halting efforts by the reform-minded school board 
authorized by the state Legislature and appointed by Mayor Dennis 
Archer earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago and Cleveland have gone through similar school  
takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the lawsuit contends the state's takeover of  
the district illegally counteracted residents' voting rights by 
replacing the city's elected school board with Archer appointees. 
</P>
<P>
	Reforms proposed by the new board were among the issues at the  
heart of a teachers strike that delayed the start of school for a 
week. Last Wednesday, the teachers voted to return to school while 
awaiting results of a vote on a new contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The citizens of Detroit have a right to vote for their school  
board members just like everyone else in the state,'' said Sharon 
McPhail, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, who include a 
teacher, a parent and a group of Baptist ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	In approving the takeover in March, Gov. John Engler said the  
nation's 10th-largest city needed the reform plan because of 
lagging test scores, chronically low attendance and graduation 
rates, and fiscal mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants of the lawsuit include Engler, Archer and the chief  
executive of Detroit schools, David Adamany.

previously secret Coast Guard operation that has started to 
interdict drug boats in international waters. It is the first time 
the Coast Guard has been authorized to fire from the air at water 
craft since Prohibition in the 1920s, when fixed-wing aircraft went 
after liquor smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
	Top officials of the Transportation Department, the Coast Guard  
and the White House anti-drug office disclosed the new tactics at a 
news conference Monday outside the Transportation Department. They 
spoke in front of an MH90 Enforcer helicopter, one of several 
specially equipped commercial helicopters leased for the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Commandant Adm. James E. Loy ruled out any chance  
that commercial fishermen or pleasure boaters will be targeted by 
the sharpshooters, who officials said are operating only in 
international waters south of Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican 
Republic. Rules require identification and extensive warnings 
before aggressive tactics are employed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This special show is not going to be coming to a theater near  
you,'' Loy said as an assurance to private boaters. 
</P>
<P>
	And Hopkins, a petty officer second class from Winslow, Maine,  
said he fired only at the smugglers' engines in a successful 
assault Aug. 16. He got his nickname, Spanish for ``the devil,'' 
because his .50-caliber Robar rifle bears the packing number 999. 
``Depending on which way you hold it, it carries the sign of the 
devil (666,)'' Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still humanitarian. We just want to stop the flow,'' he  
said in an interview. He said the helicopters carry life rafts for 
the smugglers in case a shot accidentally causes a fire or sinks 
their vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins said his powerful rifle can hit a target from more than  
a mile away, but the helicopters hover much closer as they chase 
the open-hulled, low-profile ``Go-Fasts'' or ``Super Smugglers'' 
across the Caribbean. Officials say the drug-running craft are 
rarely armed, and none of the intercepted smugglers have fired on 
the helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Threatening action would allow Coast Guard sharpshooters to use  
defensive deadly fire in return. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of the small boats, which carry about a ton of cocaine and  
enough fuel to travel 700 miles, has doubled since 1996, officials 
say. They now carry more than 85 percent of all maritime drug 
shipments with an average of a trip a day over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	The sea encounters have led to capture of 13 crew members and  
netted more than three tons of cocaine destined for U.S. streets, 
said Barry McCaffrey, White House drug control director. 
</P>
<P>
	He said those and other operations in the past year brought  
cocaine confiscation to a record 53 tons, with a street value of 
$3.7 billion. More than 400 tons is estimated to reach U.S. shores 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made the drug smugglers afraid. We will now make them  
disappear,'' McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Aug. 16 incident, helicopters stopped boats  
on Aug. 26 and on Sept. 3. An initial operation on May 28 
frightened two smugglers into jettisoning their cargo before shots 
were fired but also led to their arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who oversees the Coast  
Guard, said the effort dubbed Operation New Frontier will lead to 
other high-tech moves against drug smuggling. The Clinton 
administration is asking for $17.8 billion to fight illegal drugs 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard background briefing provided descriptions of the  
dramatic encounters, and released videotape of two incidents showed 
helicopters as they stopped speeding vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of nonlethal force also included machine-gun fire across  
boats' bows, use of a ``stingball'' that exploded into a shower of 
rubber pellets and deployment of a special net to entangle a boat's 
engines. Use of the sharpshooter is a last resort to stop the 
boats.

<HEADLINE> Details of Atlanta Games Bid Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee, still mindful  
of the Salt Lake City payoff scandal, will have its newly appointed 
ethics panel study allegations of any improprieties during 
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get the information, it will be passed on to the  
ethics commission,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said 
Tuesday. ``Right now, the only document the IOC has is what it 
reads in the press. For us, it's still at a level of allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that we have seen so far in the press shows that  
the bid from Atlanta did not cross the line that was crossed in 
Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber made the comments to The Associated Press by  
telephone from Sydney, Australia, where he is attending meetings 
related to the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC will write the U.S. Olympic Committee this week,  
asking for information on the lobbying tactics contained in 
Atlanta's bid files. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously secret records turned over to U.S. congressional  
investigators have revealed that Atlanta bidders offered or 
considered lavish favors, gifts and perks for IOC members and their 
families during their successful campaign for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that we have read shows that Atlanta actually  
pushed those favors and gifts onto the IOC members under the 
pretext of friendship,'' he said. ``The members weren't used to 
this systematic approach to lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly this is the kind of activity the IOC is trying to  
refrain from. This is why the IOC reforms are taking place. We 
don't want it to happen again. We want the public to have full 
confidence in the IOC process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The documents uncovered about Atlanta so far contain no evidence  
of the scholarships, cash payments and other bribery associated 
with Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the rules on gifts (value limit of $200) and travel  
(one trip for two people) were often ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled in connection  
with the Salt Lake scandal. The top two officials of the Salt Lake 
organizing committee also lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, at the height of the Salt Lake scandal, the IOC  
sent letters to national Olympic committees asking for details of 
any ethical misconduct during bids for the games from 1996 to 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said no serious cases were reported to the IOC,  
including any from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The letter we are sending to the USOC will ask why the IOC was  
not informed earlier of the information coming out now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any allegations meriting investigation would be dealt with by  
the new IOC ethics commission, which was set up in the wake of the 
Salt Lake affair. The eight-member panel is headed by IOC vice 
president Keba Mbaye and includes former Sen. Howard Baker. It is 
scheduled to meet again Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Sunday that bid  
documents show Atlanta bidders helped the sons and daughters of IOC 
members get into colleges in Georgia, offered to help them find 
jobs and paid for trips to New York and Disney World in Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN reported it had obtained documents indicating that Atlanta  
organizers believed IOC members could be ``bought.'' One memo in 
the files reportedly describes one IOC member's tastes this way: 
``Gifts are OK. Gift of female OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN also reported that the wife of IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch and a friend were flown to Atlanta and taken on a side 
trip by private jet to Charleston, S.C., in 1990 -- at a total cost 
of more than $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said Samaranch and his wife don't fall within  
the bid-limit rules because he does not vote in the selection of 
host cities and holds a position ``similar to a head of state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's normal to extend hospitality to his wife,''  
Servan-Schreiber said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet OKs Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's Cabinet gave the green light  
Tuesday to a joint venture with Malaysia for a 220 mile gas 
pipeline from a field in the Gulf of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai Industry Minister Suwat Liptapanlop said the state  
Petroleum Authority of Thailand will enter the $1 billion project 
on a 50-50 basis with Malaysia's state Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or 
Petronas. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the largest investment by a Thai government agency  
since the country fell into economic crisis after the flotation of 
the Thai currency in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The pipeline, to be built under an agreement between the two  
state petroleum companies in 1997, will deliver natural gas from an 
offshore field in a shared territory known as the Thai-Malaysia 
joint development area. Construction is to begin in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas will be piped to a separation plant at Songkhla province in  
southern Thailand, close to Malaysia's northern border, and on to 
Thai users and to Malaysia's northern state of Kedah. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists in southern Thailand fear that the project,  
which has yet to undergo an environmental impact assessment, will 
hurt local communities, the ecosystem and tourism. They also argue 
that Thailand has a surplus of power since the economic crisis 
dampened demand.

<HEADLINE> Nichols' Bid for New Trial Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nichols  
had his bid for a new trial rejected by a federal judge, who said 
the defendant had ample opportunity to follow up leads developed by 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Michael Tigar argued in July that the  
government cheated Nichols of a fair trial when the FBI refused to 
turn over about 43,000 documents that he believed could contain 
information to justify a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch, who presided over Nichols'  
trial, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsch said the defense had ample resources to conduct an  
independent investigation and presented a vigorous defense, calling 
92 witnesses and introducing more than 400 exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are reasonable limits to the search for possible leads  
to evidence and the defense requests exceeded those limits,'' 
Matsch said in a ruling handed down Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense ``failed to show prejudice from the failure of the  
government to produce these lead sheets before trial,'' the ruling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman at Tigar's law firm said the defense attorney was  
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors told the judge they turned over 12,000 pertinent FBI  
files and that the other information would not have changed the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 44, was convicted in 1997 of conspiracy and involuntary  
manslaughter in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building that killed 168 people. He is serving a life 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols faces a state trial in Oklahoma City on 160 state murder  
counts. He could get the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy McVeigh, his former Army buddy, was separately convicted  
of murder and weapons counts and sentenced to die.

<HEADLINE> Four UCLA Players Plead No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four defendants in UCLA's handicapped parking  
scandal pleaded no contest Tuesday to a misdemeanor charge of 
illegally possessing handicap parking placards as part of a plea 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	They joined nine other current or former UCLA football players  
who entered the same plea July 28 -- three weeks after they were 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, five others, including 1998 All-America quarterback  
Cade McNown, who were charged Monday and scheduled for arraignment 
Tuesday, were granted continuances until Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at these cases long and hard before we filed them,''  
deputy city attorney Brian Williams said of his office's latest 
action. ``We know we can prove the cases, there's no doubt about 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're alleging there is a false name on the application, or  
the doctor who signed it says she didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown's attorney, Ronald Safer, refused to say how his client  
would plead, but said the Chicago Bears rookie was ``deeply 
troubled'' by the charge, and was legitimately entitled to the 
placard when he used it briefly nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have to come Sept. 30 to see how he pleads,'' Safer  
said outside Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Reynosa and Duval Hicks, who played for the Bruins last  
year, and Durell Price and James Ghezzi, members of this year's 
team, entered their no contest pleas before Municipal Judge Sam 
Ohta. 
</P>
<P>
	As was the case with other defendants who pleaded no contest,  
they were ordered to pay to pay $1,485 in fines and perform 200 
hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes also must spend a day meeting with the disabled and  
their advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	The case of Craig Walendy, another whose UCLA career finished  
last year, was continued until Sept. 30, but Williams said that was 
because his attorney was unavailable, and added he expected Walendy 
to also plead no contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I'm back from suspension, it's officially behind  
us,'' Price said. ``I've apologized a thousand times to everyone 
who would listen, especially my teammates and my family. I'm ready 
to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city attorney's office has brought charges against a total  
of 19 current or former Bruins alleged to be part of the disabled 
parking scam. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine who are members of the current team were suspended for  
the season's first two games. They will return Saturday night 
against Fresno State, with six in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Cases involving junior tailback Keith Brown, who was also  
suspended for the first two games this year, and former UCLA player 
Akil Davis are still being evaluated, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged Monday along with McNown, were running back Skip Hicks  
of the Washington Redskins, safety Larry Atkins of the Kansas City 
Chiefs, former linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo and defensive back 
Eric Whitfield, a member of the current team who also served the 
two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	All were said to have illegally obtained the handicapped parking  
placards in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Safer said he didn't believe there was any evidence McNown ever  
parked in a handicapped spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He completed the application on Jan. 4, he was injured,''  
Safer said. ``He received the placard sometime later. He does not 
recall using a handicapped spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if McNown used a doctor's name on the form, Safer said,  
``He did not complete that part of the form. That portion of the 
form was completed, but not by him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Safer wouldn't elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was 19 years old when he did it,'' Safer said. ``He used  
the placard only a handful of times. When he recovered from his 
injury, he put the placard away forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is somebody who has not been near any kind of trouble in  
his life. He has lived an exemplary life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now 22, McNown was a first-round draft choice of the Bears last  
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's their absolute right to go to trial,'' Williams said of  
the five most recently charged. ``We'll just let a jury decide if 
that happens. Each of their cases has their individual wrinkles. 
(McNown's) wrinkle isn't so great to take him out of the sphere of 
culpability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Altman, an associate of attorney Robert Shapiro who  
represented Price and Ghezzi, said there was never any question his 
clients would take responsibility for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There might have been some misunderstanding about their  
continuance,'' Altman said, adding that the only reason such an 
action was taken was to give him time to gather information. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're two very, very nice guys,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Prompts Shinn Mistrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd prompted a judge to  
declare a mistrial Tuesday in the lawsuit accusing Charlotte 
Hornets owner George Shinn of sexually assaulting a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Costa M. Pleicones initially delayed proceedings for  
several hours, then declared a mistrial and set the retrial for 
Dec. 6. He also urged both sides to try to reach a settlement 
before then. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Shinn and Leslie Price, the woman suing him,  
immediately went into the judge's chambers and were not available 
to discuss whether a settlement was possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Price says Shinn lured her to his suburban Tega Cay home in  
September 1997 and forced her to give him oral sex. Shinn has 
denied the allegations and has sued Price for slander in a North 
Carolina court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both sides had asked Pleicones to delay the  
proceedings to prevent having a long time between opening 
statements and testimony if the hurricane knocked out power or did 
a lot of damage in Columbia. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo knocked out 
power to parts of the city for up to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleicones said he was reluctant to declare the mistrial because  
of the money and time spent to get the case to trial, but he also 
said he would not put people in harm's way while the governor was 
ordering an evacuation of the coast about 100 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd is expected to hit the coast Thursday and, Pleicones said,  
``Clearly, this trial is not going to be concluded by Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the case returns for trial, Pleicones will have to rule on  
several pretrial questions. That includes whether testimony will be 
allowed from a former Hornets cheerleader who has said Shinn 
coerced her into a two-year sexual relationship or from a man who 
says he had a sexual relationship with Price at the same time as 
the alleged assault by Shinn.

<HEADLINE> Boxer `Big Cat' Williams Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Cleveland ``Big Cat'' Williams, a boxer who was  
shot by police but recovered to fight Muhammad Ali for the title in 
1966, died after being struck by a car. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams died Friday at Ben Taub hospital. No charges were filed  
against the driver, who hit the ailing Williams as he crossed the 
street after a dialysis treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' medical troubles began in 1965, when he was shot in  
the stomach by a Texas state trooper after arguing during a traffic 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting left Williams with lifelong kindney trouble, but it  
didn't stop him from challenging Ali in the Houston Astrodome only 
a year and a half later. 
</P>

	``I told him he was the champion before he got in the ring,''  
Irene Williams, his wife, said of the Nov. 14, 1966, bout. ``That 
was a fight we didn't think would ever happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``He fought Ali with one kidney and only half of his intestines.  
He was the people's champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali scored a third-round knockout and Williams was never again a  
serious contender, fighting only a few more years. Then the 
heavyweight who twice fought Sonny Liston called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, Williams underwent dialysis treatments three  
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tragedy we had to lose him,'' his wife said. ``It's  
hard to take. The shooting couldn't take him. Diabetes. None of 
that took him out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a good man,'' said Reuben Williams, the only child of  
the boxer. ``Loved people, loved children and loved to fish. And 
loved the sport of boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was born in Griffin, Ga., and raised in Houston. He was  
inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in Commerce, Calif., in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service is Friday at Eternal Rest Funeral Home in  
Houston, with burial on Saturday at Paradise North Cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Declares Fla, Ga Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- Calling Hurricane Floyd ``one  
of the most serious hurricanes ever to threaten the United 
States,'' President Clinton issued disaster declarations for 
Florida and Georgia in anticipation of the destruction the storm 
may wreak on the southeastern U.S. coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The president issued the declarations Wednesday morning before  
leaving Queenstown for Christchurch for a state visit with New 
Zealand Prime Minister Jane Shipley. He planned to return home 
immediately after that visit to oversee emergency efforts for the 
storm, which he called ``one of the most serious hurricanes ever to 
threaten the United States, if the predictions of its force and 
scope hold true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask all of you here to remember my fellow Americans,''  
Clinton said. ``I am going to fly home, and we'll make the best job 
of it that we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early declaration ``enables state and local governments to  
get equipment and other things ... in place to begin recovery 
efforts at the earliest possible moment,'' White House spokesman 
Barry Toiv said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke twice Wednesday with James Lee Witt, the director  
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to keep abreast of 
Hurricane Floyd's progress. He also consulted with Vice President 
Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Witt and Gore placed a conference call to the governors and  
other state officials of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South 
Carolina to give them the most up-to-date forecast data on Floyd's 
likely path, a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, Floyd's center was near Abaco Island, or about  
195 miles east-southeast of Palm Beach, Fla. It was moving 
west-northwest about 14 mph and was expected to turn gradually 
toward the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2 million coastal residents in Florida and Georgia have  
been urged to leave their homes for safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Gore communicated the declarations directly to the  
governors of Florida and Georgia, according to administration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive storm also prompted Clinton to cut short a day of  
rest planned for Hawaii on the way back from New Zealand, where he 
had attended the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 
</P>
<P>
	By canceling the Hawaii visit, Clinton will be back in  
Washington on Wednesday night, instead of Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wants to return quickly to stay on top of the  
hurricane developments,'' said Clinton spokesman Jake Siewert. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has made a practice of visiting the sites of major  
disasters to review relief operations and comfort victims. But such 
visits often are delayed until the logistics of the president's 
visit won't interfere with relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration allows FEMA to begin supporting state and local  
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize and  
provide ... equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the 
impacts of the disaster,'' according to the announcement from the 
White House.

<HEADLINE> Rangel Resigns From Apollo Theatre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rep. Charles Rangel has resigned as chairman of  
the board of the Apollo Theatre, bringing the troubled Harlem 
landmark a step closer to a deal that would put Time Warner in 
charge of its revival. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Ossie Davis was expected to succeed Rangel.  
</P>
<P>
	Rangel's resignation, announced Monday, was among conditions  
state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer set last month when he 
tentatively agreed to drop a lawsuit alleging financial 
mismanagement by the board of the famed theater, which has launched 
the careers of a legion of black stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Board directors also voted Monday to accept nine Time  
Warner-recommended members -- on top of four added last month -- 
giving the company control of the 22-member board. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a major step forward,'' said Charles Gargano, chairman  
of the Empire State Development Corp., the state agency that owns 
the theater. ``Now that these issues have been largely cleared up 
we can see the money starting to flow, we can see a stronger 
management team there, and with that we can expect great things to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Apollo opened in 1914, featuring live entertainment. For  
many years, every Wednesday night was Amateur Night. Among the 
winners who went on to stardom were Billie Holiday, Ella 
Fitzgerald, Leslie Uggams, Joe Tex, Jackie Wilson, the Coasters, 
Gladys Knight and the Pips, the Ink Spots, and the Shirelles. 
</P>
<P>
	It was turned into a movie theater in the 1970s and reopened for  
live shows in 1983. More recently, it was the venue for a 
television show, ``It's Showtime at the Apollo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Attorney General Dennis Vacco filed a lawsuit last year  
accusing Rangel and five other board members of failing to collect 
some $4 million owed to the theater by the Inner City Theater 
Group, which is run by Rangel's longtime friend and political ally 
Percy Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer, who succeeded Vacco, said in August he would drop the  
suit if at least $1 million was paid to the foundation that 
oversees the Apollo, new members were added to the board and Rangel 
stepped down as chairman. The money has not yet been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Spitzer said he was pleased by Rangel's  
resignation but that more still needed to be done before the 
lawsuit could be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Capel, Rangel's chief of staff, said the congressman had  
planned his resignation for some time, but wanted to wait until 
Spitzer's investigation was over.

<HEADLINE> Teen Who Reported Parents To Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A 16-year-old girl who police say tipped  
them to numerous marijuana plants at her home can return there 
despite a pending drug case against her parents, a judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	In reuniting the family, Montgomery County District Court Judge  
C.J. Vaughey ordered Robert Alvarez and Kathleen Tucker from 
discussing the case with their daughter, Kerry, who has been 
staying with friends since her parents' arrests last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing, I think, is the child and the  
stability of this child,'' Vaughey said, though he said he harbors 
``some reservations'' about the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez, a former U.S. Department of Energy senior policy  
adviser, and Tucker, a prominent nuclear activist, were arrested 
after Kerry showed police photos of the 69 marijuana plants at her 
home, court documents say. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughey issued the ruling Monday after the prosecution and  
defense agreed that the teen-ager had nowhere to stay long-term. 
Defense attorney Steven Kupferberg said he spoke with Kerry Tucker 
twice, and she told him she wanted to return home to her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state doesn't have an interest in keeping a 16-year-old  
child away from her parents,'' Deputy State's Attorney Katherine 
Winfree said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez was fired after his arrest, said Kupferberg, who  
represented both parents in Monday's custody proceeding but is only 
defending Kathleen Tucker on the criminal charges. Alvarez has 
another lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to forbidding the family from discussing the case,  
Vaughey warned the parents not to keep illegal drugs in the house 
and told them to secure all prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Gov't. To Help Insurer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The government's financial watchdog  
today declared Korea Life Insurance Co. a ``weak financial 
institution,'' allowing the injection of public funds into the 
ailing firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came after three attempts to auction off the company  
failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Supervisory Commission earlier said it would order  
capital reduction, scrap all shares and inject 1.5 trillion won 
($1.25 billion) into Korea Life to make it more attractive for 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said it would be able to recover the taxpayers'  
money when Korea Life gets back on its feet and the company is sold 
to private investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Korea Life, the nation's third largest insurance company,  
controlled 16 percent of the nation's $35 billion life insurance 
market before a financial crisis hit South Korea in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As of June, Korea Life had $9.2 billion in assets and $11.6  
billion in debts. Korea Life chairman Choi Soon-young is serving a 
five year jail term for illegally sending millions of dollars out 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Choi and his family own about half of the company and he has  
been struggling from prison to try to maintain control.

	109 Killed in Moscow Explosion  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Dozens of people were missing and believed buried  
under tons of wreckage Monday after a suspected bomb pulverized an 
eight-story apartment building in Moscow, killing at least 109 
people. Authorities blamed terrorists for the pre-dawn blast, and 
appealed for help finding a man who allegedly rented space in that 
building and another that was blown up four days earlier. More than 
200 people have died in explosions in Russia during the past two 
weeks. The government ordered a massive security operation in the 
capital and other cities.

	EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Launching talks on a final  
peace accord Monday with a pledge to meet an ambitious one-year 
deadline, the top Palestinian and Israeli negotiators each set 
demands that could torpedo the talks from the outset -- were it not 
for their declared determination for a breakthrough after years of 
stagnation. A week after working through side issues -- including 
prisoner releases and land handovers -- Israelis and Palestinians 
are confronting the key issues that have long defined each side's 
sense of nationhood. In addition to Jerusalem and the return of 
territory, they will address refugees, settlements and Palestinian 
statehood.

	State of Emergency Declared As Storm Nears  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- As Hurricane Floyd charged toward Florida with  
potentially catastrophic 155 mph winds, Gov. Jeb Bush declared a 
state of emergency Monday night and more than 1 million people were 
told to evacuate the Atlantic coast. Floyd was much larger than 
Hurricane Andrew, which caused $25 billion in damage, killed 26 
people and left 160,000 homeless in 1992. Floyd's winds -- at least 
74 mph -- extended for 125 miles, whereas Andrew's winds extended 
about 25 or 30 miles. Forecasters said Floyd would brush past the 
Bahamas overnight and could hit land in the next couple of days 
between central Florida and South Carolina.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sifting through thousands of pages of  
documents provided four years ago to a congressional panel 
investigating the 1993 Waco tragedy, a House Democrat has turned up 
evidence that the Justice Department did notify Congress about the 
FBI's use of potentially incendiary tear gas. That evidence, Rep. 
Henry Waxman charged Monday, was overlooked by Rep. Dan Burton, the 
House Republican who is leading a new inquiry into the government's 
deadly standoff with the Branch Davidians -- and who has accused 
Attorney General Janet Reno and the Justice Department of possibly 
concealing the truth from Congress and the public.

forces should be included, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas 
said Monday. The statement seemed to open the way for Australia to 
play a leading role in the peacekeeping operation. A top Indonesian 
military official had said earlier that the military won't accept 
Australian involvement in the East Timor force, but Alatas said 
``it's all up to the United Nations to determine the composition.''

<HEADLINE> SingTel, Lycos in Asian Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore Telecom and U.S. Web media company  
Lycos announced a $50 million joint venture on Tuesday to tap into 
Asia's burgeoning Internet market. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos Asia, as the 50-50 venture was named, will launch local  
language content sites this year in 10 countries across Asia, 
including India and China. It plans to add an additional four 
countries later. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture gives both companies a chance to grab a piece of the  
fast-growing Internet business in Asia while building on their 
respective strengths, analysts said. Lycos has an Internet brand 
name, while SingTel offers funds and regional expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos, based in Waltham, Mass., will provide its search,  
navigation and community technologies to the venture, while SingTel 
will manage day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For SingTel, the move is part of a broader effort to diversify  
and find new sources of income as it prepares for the loss of its 
fixed-line domestic telecommunications monopoly in April, when 
international consortium StarHub starts operations in the island 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos Asia will be SingTel's first venture into the Internet  
business outside Singapore. At home, its Internet-related 
businesses include SingNet, an access service; National Computer 
Systems, and SingTel Internet Exchange, which connects 40 service 
providers in 20 countries.

<HEADLINE> Yellow Jackets Get Help for `D' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- While Georgia Tech's offense tries to cope with  
the loss of running back Joe Burns, the beleaguered defense gets 
some help this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore linebacker Matt Uremovich will play his first game in  
nearly a year when the 12th-ranked Yellow Jackets (1-1) play host 
to Central Florida (0-2) Saturday night at Bobby Dodd Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Uremovich was suspended after starting four of the first five  
games in 1998 as a redshirt freshman, recording a career-high 10 
tackles in his last game against North Carolina State on Oct. 18. 
He reportedly was suspended for taking a muscle-building drug 
banned by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Also returning is cornerback Troy Tolbert, who was suspended for  
the first two games for conduct detrimental to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Linebacker-wise, it will help out because we have a lot of  
younger guys at that position,'' safety Chris Young said. 
``Cornerback is the same situation. I think you will see a lot of 
difference on the defensive side with those two guys in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Tech, which has ranked among the worst teams nationally  
in yards allowed for two years running, was incapable of stopping 
top-ranked Florida State in a 41-35 loss last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles piled up 444 yards and managed to win even though  
Tech's offense had 501 yards and Joe Hamilton completed all 15 of 
his passes in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Uremovich is likely to take over at middle linebacker for  
freshman Recardo Winbush, who was working on the outside in 
practice Tuesday. Tolbert, meanwhile, is competing for playing time 
against redshirt freshman Marvious Hester. 
</P>
<P>
	While not guaranteeing a starting role to either player, coach  
George O'Leary was cleared excited about the return of his big-play 
linebacker. He will have Uremovich call defensive signals and 
expects him to bring more cohesiveness to a defense that has 
created only one turnover in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to his suspension, Uremovich had 32 tackles, an  
interception and returned a fumble 54 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Uremovich, there's no question we will have more speed  
defensively,'' O'Leary said. ``And the chemistry on defense from a 
leadership standpoint, Matt will bring that back, no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uremovich, who is off limits to the media while preparing for  
his return to the lineup, has been working with the scout team 
defense during the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very, very hard hitter,'' center Noah King said. ``He  
reminds me a little bit of Keith Brooking,'' the former Tech 
linebacker who now plays for the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times when I've gone head-to-head with Matt, I come  
away with a broken chin strap or my nose swollen up,'' King added. 
``One time, he gave me a black eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burns broke his right leg after making a 14-yard run against the  
Seminoles in the fourth quarter. Tech's leading rusher as a 
freshman, he gained 87 yards in his first two games as a sophomore 
before the season-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wishes he could take that play back,'' said Young, who is  
Burns' roommate. ``It's killing him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Burns means senior Phillip Rogers (129 yards, three  
touchdowns) will have to assume a major share of the backfield 
duties, but he's bothered by a sore left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yellow Jackets also plan to give playing time to sophomore  
Sean Gregory and freshman Mike Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe did a lot of things for us,'' O'Leary said. ``It's a tough  
loss. But those things happen in football. We've got to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burns will undergo surgery on Thursday and sit out the rest of  
the semester before returning to school in January. Georgia Tech 
expects the NCAA to grant him another year of eligibility as a 
medical hardship case.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Won't Give Up on Gas Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Dreaming of a future where you never  
have to go to a gas station again and can just plug your car in at 
night for a full day of driving? It's not going to happen any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from abandoning the gas engine, automakers are showcasing  
new technologies at the Frankfurt auto show to boost fuel economy 
using just plain old gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``A pure electric car? I don't think that will ever become the  
mainstream,'' said Jos De Boes, general manager for vehicle 
engineering in Toyota's European division. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most promising advances gaining popularity is the  
direct injection engine, featured by several carmakers at the 
Frankfurt International Motor Show this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The engines borrow ideas from technology already widely used in  
diesel engines. Direct injection pumps fuel at high pressure 
directly into the engine cylinders, using advances in computers to 
control the mix between fuel and air. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is an engine that can get up to 35 percent better  
fuel consumption than a diesel engine while also reducing carbon 
dioxide emissions and putting out more power. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is lots of room for emission and fuel economy  
improvement in gasoline engines,'' said Akira Kijima, head of power 
train development at Mitsubishi Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi already uses direct injection in 75 percent of its  
motors in Japan and 35 percent in Europe. The models with the 
special engine cost only about $300 more than vehicles that use 
conventional fuel injection. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Frankfurt show, which opens to the public Thursday,  
Volkswagen also introduced its version of a direct injection engine 
to be featured in its Lupo FSI model. Ford also unveiled a 
prototype of a 1.1-liter direct injection engine. 
</P>
<P>
	Another advance allowed by the new engine is that it can start  
instantly when the driver touches the gas pedal. That means that 
the car can turn off the engine when it isn't moving to save even 
more fuel -- a car uses about 5 percent to 8 percent of its fuel 
while idling, Kijima said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stop-and-start system will be available in Japan by the end of  
the year, he added. The engines are so quiet that drivers won't 
even know when they are running or not, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct injection has its drawbacks, however. One of the biggest  
obstacles in making the technology more widely available is fuel 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to reap the most benefits in also reducing all kinds of  
emissions, direct injection engines must have low-sulfur fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some countries in Europe meet the standard of low  
sulfur, fuel quality can vary widely. In the United States, fuel 
sold in California meets the standard, but the benefits of the 
engine currently wouldn't be realized in other states.

<HEADLINE> VW Has Role for Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Computers that monitor road conditions  
and respond more quickly than a human could will soon become a 
standard automotive feature, Volkswagen's chief executive said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the Frankfurt International Motor Show, Ferdinand  
Piech said VW plans to introduce the company's ``Electronic 
Stability Program'' as a standard option on all vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This system will become as widespread as anti-lock brakes did  
some years ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The system helps drivers by activating brakes to help maintain  
the stability of the car. According to Piech, the system has been 
shown to reduce accidents or the severity of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The feature is already standard on the New Beetle, and will now  
be extended to the automaker's mass-market Golf, Bora and Passat 
models. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frankfurt show opens to the public Thursday, but automakers  
were holding media previews today and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	VW also showed off a model made by one of its subsidiaries, the  
new Seat Arosa 3L model. The car's engine takes its name because it 
uses three liters of gas per 100 kilometers -- about three-quarters 
of a gallon per 60 miles. That's compared to between six and 12 
liters for other European-made cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Audi unveiled its new A2 design, which has an  
all-aluminum body that weighs 40 percent less than if it were to be 
made of steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz held the European premiere of its SLR coupe, a  
convertible version of the automaker's super sports car whose body 
is made from high-tech composite materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota jumped the gun on unveilings Monday, showing off their  
new Yaris Verso family car. The car has a system that allows the 
rear seats to fold all the way into the bottom of the floor for 
additional cargo room. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese automaker also announced it plans to sell its Prius  
hybrid-powered car in Europe in mid-2000. The family sedan uses two 
engines: a 1.5-liter gas engine and an electric motor. The 
combination gives it better gas mileage than conventional vehicles 
-- 28 kilometers per liter, or 66 miles to the gallon, in test 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Other unveilings planned this week at the show include the BMW  
Z-8 super roadster and a new convertible version of the diminutive 
Smart car, produced by a DaimlerChrysler subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	An unexpected entry into the luxury market will come from  
Volkswagen. The carmaker will reportedly unveil a new D1 that will 
be powered by a 12-cylinder motor, to hit the market at the end of 
2000. It's expected to cost less than the $77,000 for a comparable 
Mercedes S 500. 
</P>
<P>
	VW is also unveiling a version of the New Beetle that will be  
about $2,700 cheaper than the current base price of $19,200. 
Although the new car has been a hit in the United States, it has 
yet to take off in Europe. The carmaker also plans to introduce a 
turbo version of the car. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler also is taking aim at the lower-end of the  
market in Europe, unveiling a concept compact car called the Java 
that aims to compete with VW's Golf. The Java is set to hit 
showrooms in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Frankfurt show will also offer prospective consumers  
the chance to get behind the wheel of the state-of-the-art designs. 
Visitors, accompanied by an automaker representative, will be able 
to choose from 150 cars to take a 20-minute test drive around town.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Press Aide Leaves Dole Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A second press aide to Elizabeth Dole quit,  
her campaign said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Press secretary Michael Paranzino submitted his resignation for  
personal reasons shortly after the Aug. 14 Iowa straw poll and left 
last week, said communications director Ari Fleischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer announced his own resignation late last week but said  
he did not mention Paranzino's departure at the same time because, 
``I didn't think it rose to the level of news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer said both he and Paranzino remain confident in Dole's  
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Paranzino, one in a press operation of four, was Dole's  
traveling companion and most visible aide out on the stump. ``In 
retrospect, we probably made a mistake asking a married guy to live 
his life on the road,'' said Fleischer, referring to Paranzino.

<HEADLINE> Sin City Undergoing Renaissance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Once upon a time, slots and showgirls were  
enough to keep this neon city glowing. As the gambling craze spread 
to 48 states, though, casino owners had to scramble to offer more 
culture, cuisine and clothes with their craps. 
</P>
<P>
	As the stakes go up, jackpots are getting bigger, the food  
fancier, the buildings bolder, the shopping malls ritzier and the 
shows more lavishly international. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are the days when you could come here with 100 bucks and  
expect to enjoy shows, shops and slots. Now that's the price of a 
single ticket for some of the top shows, and shopping has gone from 
The Gap to Gucci. 
</P>
<P>
	New hotels once relied on cash the casinos could cultivate. Now  
megaresorts blossoming on the Strip house world-class retailers, 
and $4.95 buffets have taken a back seat to gourmet restaurants 
tended by famous chefs such as Wolfgang Puck. 
</P>
<P>
	To coax the big bucks from a record number of tourists (33  
million expected this year) casino executives are sparing no 
expense, figuring they'll win the money back at the tables -- casino 
or showroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts, Inc., the man who  
launched the transformation of the Las Vegas Strip with the opening 
of his flagship property a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent interview, Wynn grinned as he recounted his  
conversation with top executives of Cirque du Soleil, the 
Montreal-based avante garde entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn was pitching ideas for a new show at his $1.6 billion  
Bellagio resort, still under construction at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're crazy,'' said Cirque founding President Guy Laliberte,  
responding to Wynn's idea of an elaborate new water-themed 
spectacle. ``You're going to test the envelope. You realize you're 
talking costs of maybe $50 million?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Will you do it?'' Wynn asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Laliberte answered, hesitantly.  
</P>
<P>
	The final tab to stage and produce ``O,'' Bellagio's stage  
extravaganza, topped out at $102 million, with 90 percent funded by 
Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a leap of faith Wynn had taken before.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Wynn signed illusionists Siegfried and Roy to an  
unprecedented 5-year, $58 million contract at the Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics scoffed, questioning whether any Vegas act could  
justify that kind of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in their 10th year at the Mirage, with 2 1/2 years remaining on  
a second contract, the popular act is grossing $55 million a year, 
playing to 750,000 people annually. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``O'' is making waves at Bellagio, packing sellout crowds at  
$100 per ticket. The show is expected to gross $70 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mystere,'' a Cirque production at Mirage's Treasure Island  
hotel-casino, is grossing $45 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	All three shows are running at 97 percent capacity, with ``O''  
drawing 18,000 people per week, ``Mystere'' and Siegfried and Roy 
15,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the Strip at Mandalay Bay, the Broadway musical ``Chicago''  
has been playing to capacity crowds since it opened in March at the 
resort's plush 1,800-seat state-of-the-art theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The show has been extended into next year, according to Glenn  
Schaeffer, president of Mandalay Resort Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadway star Tommy Tune headlines the $45 million spectacular  
``EFX'' at the MGM Grand. Other leads in the show have been 
``Phantom of the Opera'' star Michael Crawford and former teen idol 
David Cassidy, who moves to the Rio Suite Hotel with his new show 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
	A touring company of ``CATS'' plays the MGM in September.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand have built events centers.  
Luciano Pavarotti christened one, Barbra Streisand the other. And 
she'll be back to usher in 2000. Others featured in millennium 
celebrations include Bette Midler, Elton John, Tina Turner and Rod 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Luxor resort will be the site when the Bolshoi Ballet kicks  
off a 25-city United States tour Sept. 3-5 with the production, 
``Bolshoi, The Classical Collection -- From Russia With Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bolshoi is not the only foreign import headed for the United  
States via Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, an English adaptation of the hit French musical  
``Notre Dame de Paris'' is scheduled to open at the new Paris Las 
Vegas hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a sellout from day one, as it has  
been all over the world,'' Paris Las Vegas president Paul Pusateri 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Music moves people,'' he said recently, walking along a drive  
in the shadow of the resort's 50-story replica of the Eiffel Tower. 
``It evokes powerful emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pusateri believes people coming to sample the city's new  
billion-dollar megaresorts want an entertainment experience to 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a different crowd coming to this town,'' Pusateri  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``Without an entertainment centerpiece, these hotels do not keep  
the promise,'' Wynn said. ``You've gotta forget the slot machines. 
They don't mean anything anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Translation: A decade ago, Nevada and New Jersey had the only  
gambling casinos in the country. Today, 48 of 50 states have some 
form of legalized gambling and casinos are popping up in more and 
more of them. Las Vegas had to raise the bar, offer something 
different, and the movers and shakers saw world-class entertainment 
as just the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gambling has not been the attraction for many years,'' Wynn  
said. ``The Mirage was built for people who wanted to do more than 
just gamble. This city was built by entertainers. The fact is, Las 
Vegas is all about entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schaeffer agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``People come here today for the entertainment, for the  
restaurants, the shopping, not just for the gambling,'' Schaeffer 
said. ``Las Vegas has become a more sophisticated entertainment 
destination. Today, national and international acts will open a 
tour, for example, in Las Vegas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime Las Vegan Robert Deiro sees the current entertainment  
fare as ``eye and ear candy -- easy to watch and easy to listen 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deiro, during intermission at a Celine Dion benefit, reflected  
on the unique nature of Las Vegas entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Pavarotti were playing here nightly, nobody would come to  
watch him after three weeks,'' Deiro said. ``Yet Siegfried and Roy 
sell out nightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the spring of 2001, Mirage plans to launch a new  
Broadway-style musical, ``Miss Spectacular,'' written by Jerry 
Herman just for the resort and staged by some of the top names in 
the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The New York Times drama critic will have to come here to  
review the show,'' Wynn said.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,  
with the key indexes in Tokyo and Hong Kong falling on worries over 
the surging Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 132.07  
points, or 0.74 percent, to 17,777.22. On Monday, the average 
closed up 198.27 points, or 1.12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell as the yen surged against the greenback, rekindling  
concern that Japan's fledging economic recovery could be curbed by 
the rising yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen leads to lower profits for Japan's exporters, since  
it makes their products more expensive and therefore less 
competitive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.56 yen, down  
1.22 yen from Tokyo's late Monday level of 107.78 yen, but above 
its late New York level of 106.44 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar fell as low as 106.00 yen,  
its lowest level since May 15, 1996, when it traded at 105.77 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed generally lower Tuesday, pushed down by  
the weakness in the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, lost 56.82 points, or 0.4 percent, closing at 
13,804.03. On Monday, the index had gained 4.9 points, or 0.03 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the Hong Kong market was hit by selective  
profit-taking in reaction to the fall on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares closed lower on continued uncertainty over an  
international force to stem the violence in East Timor and threats 
by international lenders to freeze loans over a bank scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian Development Bank announced Monday that it would defer  
approval of about $500 million of loans to Indonesia because of 
alleged financial irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal centers on a $80 million transfer from Bank Bali to  
a company controlled by a senior official in the ruling Golkar 
party. Golkar opponents claimed the funds were meant to finance 
President B.J. Habibie's re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 7.593 points,  
or 1.3 percent, to 562.059. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking after five  
straight sessions of advances. The market's key Weighted Stock 
Price Index fell 86.67 points, or 1.1 percent, to 8,092.02. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index edged up 1.90 points to 2,120.97. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed, with a technical rebound  
on some blue chips buoying the main index after three straight days 
of losses. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected 
companies rose 12.51 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,101.21. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed fractionally lower,  
with losses in resources stocks just outweighing gains in the 
industrial sector. The benchmark All Ordinaries Index closed at 
2,975.9, down 0.7 of a point. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: The main index fell 1.3 percent on profit-taking after  
three straight sessions of gains. The Korea Composite Stock Price 
Index fell 12.37 points to 968.54. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed. The benchmark Straits  
Times Index rose 3.27 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,142.50. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower amid a lack of  
corporate news. The Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip 
stocks, closed at 729.05, down 8.39 points, or 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed slightly lower. The Thailand  
SET Index fell 1.12 points, or 0.25 percent, to 443.82.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Spar on Farm Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state lawmakers agreed that growers need  
billions of dollars in emergency aid this year, but there was no 
consensus Tuesday on whether to change government farm policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a farm bill that is not working and needs to be  
fixed,'' Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., said at a hearing of the House 
Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	With commodity prices depressed for the second year in a row,  
Democrats are pushing for an overhaul of the 1996 ``Freedom to 
Farm'' law, which was designed to wean farmers from government 
price supports and production controls. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans are resisting major changes to the law, and farm  
organizations are divided over what, if anything, Congress should 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Democrats on the committee said they had spent the  
August recess listening to producers pleading for changes in the 
1996 law. While Republicans said their farm constituents want 
lawmakers to keep the 1996 law and work more aggressively to open 
markets to U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people in my 14 counties don't want to go back to the old  
days,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. ``What about fair trade and 
free trade, what about markets?'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaHood said concentration of beef processing among a few  
companies is a major concern among livestock producers, who also 
are suffering from European reluctance to buy American beef that 
has been treated with growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	Pomeroy acknowledged that major revisions in the 1996 law would  
be unwieldy: ``The last thing we can afford is to get bogged down 
trying to fix everything forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate negotiators expect to begin work soon on a  
Senate-passed $7.4 billion farm-assistance package that's part of a 
$68 billion spending bill for the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of members of the National Farmers Union and other  
groups traditionally aligned with Democrats are lobbying Congress 
this week to pass the emergency-aid package along with long-term 
changes in farm policy. 
</P>
<P>
	They planned to rally Wednesday at the Capitol with Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and other Democratic senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest farmer organization, the American Farm  
Bureau Federation, defends the 1996 law. Current economic problems 
shouldn't be used to justify government supply controls, new 
storage programs or higher crop subsidies, the group says. 
</P>
<P>
	What appears likely to pass this year is a measure akin to the  
Senate's disaster aid package, along with separate proposals for 
making crop insurance more attractive to farmers.

<HEADLINE> Browns Hope To Learn From Blowout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The morning after the Pittsburgh Steelers  
beat up on the Cleveland Browns 43-0, Lomas Brown felt fine. 
</P>
<P>
	No soreness. No feeling in his muscles like he tried to push a  
truck and trailer around a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's bad.  
</P>
<P>
	If Cleveland's star offensive tackle, a 15-year veteran, didn't  
feel the effects of playing in an NFL game, it means he wasn't on 
the field enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even sore. I played more in the preseason games,''  
Brown said. ``There was no continuity, there was no flow for the 
offense. There was nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown wasn't the only one who failed to see anything positive in  
the loss to Pittsburgh. He and his teammates, who had the day off 
Tuesday, simply resolved themselves to putting the loss behind 
them, then trying to improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't find anything we can take out of that game where we  
can say, hey, we can build on this. The only thing I can say about 
that game is that it's over with and we have to play a lot better 
than this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one tried to sugarcoat the lopsided loss in Cleveland's first  
game back in the NFL after a three-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns set a team record for fewest yards in a game (40),  
had possession of the ball for just 12 minutes, 11 seconds and 
forced the Steelers to punt only once -- late in the game when it 
didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the offensive linemen, linebacker Jamir Miller could  
barely move after being on the field for most of Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was exhausted in the third quarter. When you go 60 or 70  
snaps in three quarters, that's a load,'' Miller said. ``It's a 
very terrible experience, to say the least. But it's a week to week 
game. We can't let what happened affect our season, we still have 
15 more games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the Pittsburgh game, Browns coach Chris Palmer  
was looking for a ``flag carrier'' on offense. He also was 
considering making major changes in the lineup, topped by replacing 
starting quarterback Ty Detmer with top draft pick Tim Couch, who 
practiced with the Browns first-team offense on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Browns had some time to try and forget about  
last weekend, then move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``One game doesn't make your season,'' Miller said. ``We just  
have to learn from the mistakes we made. Watch the film, flush it 
and get ready to play Tennessee next week.''

<HEADLINE> Gators Dump Humble Act for Vols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida dropped its humble act. Not  
that anybody really bought it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	This is, after all, Tennessee week. And national championships  
aside, the No. 4 Gators made it clear they still think they're 
better than the Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Spurrier gave his team the green light to jabber  
this week. It was a marked difference from last year, when 
Tennessee came into the game with a five-game losing streak to 
Florida but in possession of the Southeastern Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols finally beat the Gators last season. All that did was  
inspire Florida to return to its old ways. The swagger, it seemed, 
worked better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just told them to try to temper what they said,'' Spurrier  
said Tuesday. ``Hopefully, we won't say more than we can back up. 
But I read in the paper today that we were favored by two points. 
So, how are we supposed to act?'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, away they went.  
</P>
<P>
	``They won the national title last year, so I guess they have a  
little rap right now,'' safety Marquand Manuel said. ``They can rap 
as much as they want. But they have to fly down on Saturday and 
prove their point. We're going to prove ours, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators say they don't have enough bulletin-board space to  
post all the comments they've seen flying out of Knoxville lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most infuriating material included one statement made  
this week by Vols offensive lineman Cosey Coleman, and another made 
last month by receiver Cedrick Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they'll be as good as they were last year up  
front,'' Coleman said, referring to Florida's young defense. ``Most 
of the guys that are starting now were in the rotation last year, 
but they weren't as good as the guys starting. So, you're looking 
at the second string.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Wilson was asked about playing at the Swamp, where  
Florida carries a nation-best, 29-game winning streak into 
Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing Florida in the Swamp doesn't mean any more to me than  
playing Kentucky in Lexington,'' Wilson said. ``It doesn't mean 
anything to me at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gators defensive lineman Alex Brown took issue with the lack of  
Tennessee's respect for Florida Field, where the Vols haven't won 
since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many teammates, Brown also brought up last year's meeting  
with Tennessee, in which Florida committed five turnovers and 
missed a field goal in overtime in a 20-17 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they come in here, I expect the streak to get to 30,''  
Brown said. ``They don't have room to talk. We slipped up last 
year. They won in overtime and they won the national championship 
with an undefeated year. Great. Do it again. Beat us here and then 
you can get all the respect you want. We don't lose here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dig on Florida's talent was equally galling to several  
Gators, who insisted Tennessee's victory last year didn't prove 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's extra incentive, I'll put it that way,'' Manuel said.  
``They happen to get a muff here, a muff there and win the game and 
they're superstars? We'll just go out there and do our job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the trash talkers at Florida drowned out the  
calmer voices. 
</P>
<P>
	There were, indeed, several players who refused to get baited  
into the conversation. And there were plenty others who preferred 
to talk about not talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're from a tough place and you talk a lot, you learn  
that talking doesn't win you a fight,'' running back Earnest Graham 
said. ``You can talk, but when it's time to fight, you have to be 
tough and know how to win.''

<HEADLINE> Bobbitt Avoids Jail Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLON, Nev. (AP) -- John Wayne Bobbitt dodged a jail sentence  
Tuesday and was put on probation for his part in a scheme to steal 
clothes from a store. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbitt, 32, and five co-defendants had pleaded guilty to  
attempted grand larceny and other charges in a plea bargain. An 
estimated $140,000 was stolen from a store that since has closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Archie Blake put Bobbitt on probation for five years and  
ordered him to pay $5,000 restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbitt said he didn't know the clothing had been stolen.  
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to stay away from trouble,'' Bobbitt said after his  
sentencing in Fallon, about 60 miles east of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbitt made headlines in 1993 when his then-wife, Lorena, cut  
off his penis at their apartment in Manassas, Va. She drove off in 
a fury and tossed the severed organ out the car window. It later 
was reattached. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorena argued she'd been the victim of an abusive husband and  
was found innocent by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbitt said Tuesday he hasn't spoken to her since.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I said to her was 'I want a divorce,''' he  
said. 
</P>

	He now lives in Niagara Falls, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Pageant Chief Rules Vs. Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The head of the Miss America pageant  
on Tuesday backed off plans to allow women who have been divorced 
or pregnant to compete for the title, saying the pageant's board of 
directors would reconsider its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert L. Beck, CEO of the Miss America Organization, said the  
board had agreed to hold off implementing the new rules -- which 
were to take effect starting next year -- pending talks with state 
pageant operators, who are furious about the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported Monday that the pageant had  
decided to break with nearly 50 years of tradition by striking 
provisions in the contestant contracts that require women to swear 
they have never been married and never been pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	State pageant officials say the changes would mar the ``high  
moral standards'' Miss America has stood for. Former Miss America 
winners, current contestants and the former CEO of the pageant have 
also all lined up against the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just sad,'' said Jack Lawson, chairman of the Miss  
Montana Pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	Several state pageant directors who asked not to be named  
Tuesday said there would be mass defections by states from the Miss 
America program if the changes stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the outcome of the dialogue will be,'' Beck  
said Tuesday in his first public statements about the controversy. 
Asked if it was possible that the old rules will stand, he said: 
``That's always a possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules, adopted at a June meeting of the board, would  
require contestants to swear that ``I am unmarried'' and ``I am not 
the natural or adoptive parent of any child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They would open the door to divorcees, women who have had  
abortions and women who have given birth to children who later 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was to bring the contestant contract into compliance  
with New Jersey laws against discrimination, Beck said in an 
affidavit filed in court as part of the legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	The pageant notified state operators about the change last  
month, telling them their contestants would have to sign the new 
contract to compete in Saturday's 79th annual Miss America Pageant 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	The states went to court Aug. 17 to fight the contract.  
</P>
<P>
	In an out-of-court settlement, the pageant agreed not to require  
this year's contestants to sign the new contract, and the National 
Association of Miss America State Pageants agreed to withdraw its 
request for an injunction preventing the Miss America Organization 
from forcing them to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Beck tried to play down the controversy, saying that  
the board's agreement not to apply the rule change immediately 
meant it was ``tabling discussion of the matter until after this 
year's national competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But state pageant officials told the AP that, despite the  
exemption for this year, the rule change by the board remained in 
effect and would have been enforced starting next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the state pageant association said Tuesday it would  
go back to court to seek a judge's ruling on whether in fact the 
old rules violated New Jersey's anti-discrimination laws, as Beck 
had suggested in his affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Libby Taylor, the president of the organization, said the  
changes would destroy the fundamental principles of the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	``They strike at the very heart of the ideal that Miss America  
represents,'' said Ms. Taylor, who runs the Miss Kentucky pageant.

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Mayoral Primary Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A white city councilman won the Democratic  
mayoral primary Tuesday, defeating two black candidates in this 
predominantly black city by promising to clean the streets of 
open-air drug markets and have zero tolerance for crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin O'Malley won the primary with 61,219 votes, or 53  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans 9 to 1, he is  
expected to easily defeat his GOP opponent in the general election 
in November. If he does win, O'Malley, 36, would become the 
youngest mayor in city history. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the first day of this primary campaign to tonight I never  
once doubted the fairness the goodness and the intelligence of the 
people of Baltimore city,'' O'Malley told exuberant supporters 
gathered at the a children's museum. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley defeated former Councilman Carl Stokes, who had 32,069  
votes, or 28 percent, and Council President Lawrence Bell, who 
raised the most money but finished with 19,611 votes, or 17 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley had to shake off criticism that he was seeking to split  
the black vote when he entered the race two weeks before the filing 
deadline. Race is a key factor in mayoral politics in Baltimore, 
where 65 percent of the population is black. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley, however, won the backing of several key black  
lawmakers and church leaders, as well as influential white 
politicians such as former mayor and former Gov. William Donald 
Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, O'Malley will face GOP candidate David Tufaro, a  
developer who easily defeated five little-known candidates. Tufaro 
won with 23,252 votes, or 89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley hammered away at crime as the main issue, promoting a  
zero-tolerance policing strategy in which all crimes, even minor 
so-called quality-of-life offenses, will be aggressively pursued. 
Bell also supported zero-tolerance, but Stokes had criticized the 
strategy as targeting minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1971, an incumbent was not on the  
ballot. Mayor Kurt Schmoke, the city's first elected black mayor, 
decided not to run for a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was almost comic. Among the original list of candidates  
were six with arrest records and three who had filed for 
bankruptcy. Police arrested one candidate on burglary charges after 
recognizing her on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, the best-known candidate, was damaged by revelations of  
his personal financial troubles and by an incident in which his 
supporters disrupted an O'Malley event. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes weathered revelations that he failed to pay taxes for  
several years and that his campaign literature falsely said he 
graduated from college. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the primary, Schmoke said the city's estimated  
59,000 drug addicts -- and the crime they create -- are the next 
mayor's key problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they focus their attention like a laser beam on that issue,  
then we may see a significant turnaround,'' said Schmoke, who did 
not endorse any candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	But he criticized O'Malley's zero-tolerance policing strategy,  
saying it could give police license to be overly aggressive.

<HEADLINE> GIs' Remains To Be Disinterred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his first letter home after arriving in  
South Korea in late August 1950 amid some of the bloodiest fighting 
of the Korean War, 19-year-old Robert E. Mitchell tried to sound 
reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello Mom, Pop and Sis,'' he began. ``I'm making it just fine,  
but pray a lot because it will come in handy. If you don't hear 
from me very often don't worry because I'll make it okay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, postmarked Aug. 23, arrived at the Mitchell home in  
Garner, Ark., on Sept. 5. The next day he was missing. Nearly half 
a century later the family still doesn't know quite what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Like thousands of other American soldiers who never returned  
from Korea, Mitchell is presumed to have died in battle. Like 
precious few of those sad mysteries, however, there is a glimmer of 
hope in the Mitchell case -- not that he survived but that his 
family may one day be able to bury his remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's name has been tentatively linked to a set of remains  
in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, 
although it is not yet clear whether they can be positively 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, two sets of Korean War servicemen's remains will  
be disinterred from the cemetery in Honolulu, and the Army's 
Central Identification Laboratory there will take mitochondrial DNA 
from the bones and attempt to match it with DNA samples offered by 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible, though not certain, that one of those sets of  
remains may be Mitchell's, Pentagon officials said Monday. The 
officials would not disclose the names associated with the two sets 
of remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Larry Greer said members of 10 families  
thought to have a link to sets of remains at the Hawaii cemetery 
have provided the Central Identification Laboratory with DNA 
samples. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those people is Beth Adams, the only sister of Robert  
Mitchell. She was notified by the Pentagon on Saturday that two 
sets of remains would be removed from the Hawaii cemetery this 
week. She is not sure what the chances are, but she hopes that one 
of those sets turns out to be her brother's. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were so many years when we didn't know anything'' about  
his fate, she said in a telephone interview from her Garner, Ark., 
home. ``I'm glad to do anything that would help us know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time the Pentagon has removed remains from a  
Korean War cemetery to attempt DNA identification. It has used DNA 
to identify remains of servicemen killed in the Vietnam War, 
including Air Force Lt. Michael Blassie, whose remains had been in 
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier until last year. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Blassie success, the Pentagon decided this year it  
would attempt to identify remains from the National Memorial 
Cemetery of the Pacific, commonly called the Punchbowl, which 
contains 866 remains of servicemen from the Korean War. The remains 
were turned over to the United States by North Korea after the war 
ended in 1953, but were buried without being positively identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually as many as 70 remains from the Punchbowl may be  
disinterred and tested for DNA matching.

<HEADLINE> Senator: White House Pressured FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI, scheduled to testify at a Senate  
hearing on clemency granted to 16 Puerto Rican militants, backed 
out at the last minute under pressure from the White House, a 
Republican senator asserted today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia accused the White House of  
``trying to build a fortress around their decision'' to grant 
clemency to the Puerto Rico nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's pretty clear that the White House is behind  
this,'' Coverdell said. ``You've got to wonder what would cause the 
White House to bypass a chance to explain themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI did not return a phone call seeking comment. But a  
Justice Department letter to Coverdell signed by acting Assistant 
General Jon P. Jennings explained that because the power to grant 
clemency is the president's exclusively, there are constitutional 
questions about whether it would be appropriate for FBI officials 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those offered clemency were members of the FALN -- the  
Spanish initials for Armed Forces of National Liberation -- 
responsible for some 130 bombings in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
that left six dead and scores wounded. None of the 16 granted 
clemency was convicted of killing or wounding anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell's hearing before the Foreign Relations subcommittee on  
terrorism was designed to explore whether the president's grant of 
clemency may have undermined the government's strict anti-terrorism 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing came hours before the Senate was to take up a  
Republican-sponsored resolution condemning clemency for the Puerto 
Ricans. The House adopted a similar resolution last week, 311-41. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Coverdell's hearing was to focus on terrorism, it  
relied primarily on the emotional testimony of victims of bombings 
by Puerto Rican militants and Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., who has 
been one of the harshest critics of the clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	``My speech comes from my heart as an American citizen who has  
been betrayed by his president,'' former New York City Police 
Detective Richard Pastorella said. He lost his sight, much of his 
hearing and all the fingers on his right hand in a 1982 FALN 
bombing in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ignited a firestorm of criticism when he announced last  
month that he would commute the sentences of 16 militants not 
directly involved in planting bombs if they renounced violence and 
met other conditions of parole. Fourteen of them accepted the offer 
and 11 were freed from federal prison Friday. One prisoner must 
serve five more years before he is released under the clemency deal 
and the remaining two, who were already out of prison, had their 
fines of $100,000 and $50,000 eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and some members of the law enforcement community  
had accused Clinton of offering clemency to help his wife's 
all-but-announced Senate candidacy from New York, home to some 1.3 
million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue has turned into more of a headache for the first  
lady then a help. Mrs. Clinton first came out against the clemency 
offer, angering many of New York's Puerto Rican leaders. Then last 
week she explained that she should have consulted more with Latino 
leaders before reaching a decision.

<HEADLINE> Golf's World Rankings Change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Official World Golf Ranking formula is new and improved,  
even if it remains as complex as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting at Carnoustie during the British Open, the  
governing board agreed to seven changes designed to fine-tune the 
accuracy of the world ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	The most simple modification to explain is that the World Match  
Play Championship in England and the Million Dollar Challenge in 
Sun City will no longer count because they are invitation-only 
tournaments with unofficial prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are a little more complicated, such as the procedure  
to gradual reduction of ranking points. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, for example, earned 100 points for winning the PGA  
Championship (majors are worth 50, twice as much in the current 
year). In the old system, the value would be cut in half to 50 
points next year, and he would lose all those points after two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new formula, instead of points being cut in half after  
52 weeks and eliminated after 104 weeks, points will be reduced by 
one-eighth every three months over a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	This change, which doesn't take effect until next September, is  
the most significant because it offers a more current reflection on 
who is playing well. 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Points will be awarded to more of the field. In some cases,  
only the top 20 used to receive points. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Points will no longer be rounded off to whole numbers. If  
fourth place was worth 5.9 points and fifth place got 5.6 points, 
both positions were awarded six points. This change adheres to the 
philosophy that any player who beats another should be rewarded at 
a higher level. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The strength-of-field formula will be revised to shrink the  
gap in value between a tournament with the No. 1 player compared to 
a tournament with the No. 2 or No. 3 player. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Events on a smaller tour (South Africa, Australasia) will not  
be worth more points just because they are co-sanctioned by a 
stronger tour (European). 
</P>
<P>
	-- The minimum number of events that count against a player's  
ranking will go from 40 tournaments over two years to 20 
tournaments over one year. This will help players like Greg Norman, 
who are recovering from a season-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line?  
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods is still No. 1, and likely will stay there for a  
while. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FEELING CHIPPER:* Chip Beck was all smiles in Canada, which  
isn't all that unusual coming from a man who always sees the glass 
half-full. This time he had reason -- for the first time in three 
years, Beck made the cut in back-to-back tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	During a two-week tour of the Great White North, Beck tied for  
31st in Vancouver and tied for 15th in the Canadian Open, where the 
electronic scoreboard only had to change screens four times before 
the gallery could see the name ``Beck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get back in the game,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But his wicked slump may not keep him in the game much longer.  
Beck used his one-time exemption for being top 50 in career 
earnings to stay on tour this year, but at 187th on the money list, 
he needs about $200,000 to keep his card. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, Beck will return to Q-school for the first time in 20  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm either going to qualify or get it all done in the next  
couple of weeks,'' Beck said. ``I'd rather play good on the Nike 
Tour than bad out here, because at least you're building confidence 
and moving forward. The way I've played the last three years hasn't 
been much fun at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I get my game back, I'll be happy,'' he said. ``I  
know I'll get it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SERGIO and IMG:* Agents for Sergio Garcia aren't giving up the  
Spanish sensation to the IMG, but they have hired the massive 
sports agency to handle certain areas where they lack expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to maintain Sergio's current environment, which up  
to now has been so successful,'' said Jose Marquina of albatros 
Scratch SL (aka, Team Sergio). ``IMG will contribute their 
expertise in certain specific areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship already appears to be paying off.  
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the arrangement, Garcia's agents also released his  
schedule for the rest of the year. It includes the Dunhill Cup, 
World Match Play Championship, the Million Dollar Challenge in Sun 
City and the Williams World Challenge, the 12-man event worth $3.5 
million at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	All of them are managed by IMG.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OH, CANADA:* The toughest decision in golf last week turned out  
be the best one for Glen Hnatiuk. The Manitoba native had an 
exemption to play in the Canadian Open, but opted to stay on the 
Nike Tour with hopes of getting back to the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Hnatiuk, 34, made a 12-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole to win  
the Tri-Cities Open. The victory was worth $40,500 and moved him up 
to fifth on the Nike Tour money list. The top 15 get their PGA Tour 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Looking for possible pairings in the Ryder Cup? During  
the U.S. practice at The Country Club, captain Ben Crenshaw put 
together Hal Sutton with Jeff Maggert, two players who are steady 
off the tee. David Duval and Phil Mickelson are also together in 
that foursome. ... LPGA Tour commissioner Ty Votaw has finally 
settled his family in Daytona Beach, Fla. His wife, Paula, a human 
resources manager for General Electric, is taking a similar job 
with International Speedway Corp. ... Colin Montgomerie is rarely 
short on confidence, even after blowing a three-stroke lead and 
losing the British Masters to Bob May. ``Normal service resumes 
next week, and we'll see who's on the leaderboard with me there,'' 
he said. ... Clemson (men) and Georgia (women) will start the 2000 
college season at No. 1, according to Golfweek's preseason 
rankings. ... Callaway Golf has released new Hawk Eye irons, which 
have an interior weight cavity along the sole to create a lower 
center of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* The last time a European won a major  
championship and a Ryder Cup singles match in the same year was 
1985 (Sandy Lyle and Bernhard Langer). Europeans are 0-4 since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD:* ``Every once in a while, you see Tiger Woods and  
David Duval playing the way they've played and you think it's easy 
to win. But as great as Tiger is, he's winning by one. It's just 
not that easy.'' -- Paul Azinger.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Press Aide Leaves Dole Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A second press aide to Elizabeth Dole quit,  
her campaign said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Press secretary Michael Paranzino submitted his resignation for  
personal reasons shortly after the Aug. 14 Iowa straw poll and left 
last week, said communications director Ari Fleischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer announced his own resignation late last week but said  
he did not mention Paranzino's departure at the same time because, 
``I didn't think it rose to the level of news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer said both he and Paranzino remain confident in Dole's  
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Paranzino, one in a press operation of four, was Dole's  
traveling companion and most visible aide out on the stump. ``In 
retrospect, we probably made a mistake asking a married guy to live 
his life on the road,'' said Fleischer, referring to Paranzino.

<HEADLINE> House Moving To OK Soft Money Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second consecutive year, the House  
appears ready to brush aside the objections of Republican leaders 
and approve a ban on the unlimited ``soft money'' campaign 
donations so prized by the national political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the moment of truth for all who support reform to our  
corrupt campaign finance system,'' Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., 
said Monday at a news conference where backers of the bipartisan 
measure expressed optimism about today's vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a debate that is long overdue.''  
</P>
<P>
	It was also a debate with a familiar ring.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the House approved similar legislation that included  
a ban on soft money for national parties and for state parties 
seeking to influence federal elections. The vote then was 252-179, 
and came after a strenuous campaign of opposition waged by the 
leadership of the House Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill died in a Senate filibuster last year, and opponents  
have promised to try and kill it again when it reaches the floor in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to banning soft-money donations, which are not  
regulated by the federal government, the bill would place curbs on 
certain political advertising. Broadcast commercials within 60 days 
of an election that made use of the name or likeness of a candidate 
would have to be paid for with regulated contributions. So, too, 
would any print or broadcast commercial that contained an 
``unmistakeable or unambiguous'' appeal for the election or defeat 
of a federal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Those provisions are designed to crack down on thinly veiled  
attack ads that are now paid for with soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	A House Republican leader ridiculed the measure on Monday as an  
infringement on the First Amendment's free-speech guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	For the bill to be constitutional, said Rep. J.C. Watts,  
R-Okla., the First Amendment would have had to be written so it 
didn't apply to speech that ``supports or opposes a cause, or is 
made anonymously, or occurs in September or October of an 
even-numbered year... 
</P>
<P>
	``Since they didn't write it this way I hope you'll join me in  
opposing'' the bill, Watts urged his Republican colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Constitutional issues aside, Republicans fear they will be hurt  
politically if soft money is banned and there are no similar curbs 
on the activities of labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson and Rep. Tom Davis, the  
Virginian who chairs the Republican House campaign committee, 
cautioned the rank and file this summer that a ban on soft money 
could wipe out a $40 million soft money advantage the GOP enjoyed 
in the last campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	According to GOP sources, the two men said the bill's proposed  
ban on soft money would leave GOP candidates vulnerable to 
unlimited expenditures by unions and other groups working to 
overturn the narrow Republican majority in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the 1998 election cycle, soft money helped fund over 32  
million phone bank calls, over 27 million GOTV (get out the vote) 
mail pieces, over 18 million absentee ballots and over 4.5 million 
issue and GOTV calls,'' said material prepared for the two men's 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Republican used soft money to transfer $34.3  
million to state parties and to make $5.8 million in direct 
contributions to state and local candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft-money contributions to the Republican National Committee  
and the GOP Senate and House campaign committees totaled more than 
$130 million in the 1997-1998 election cycle, according to material 
presented to the lawmakers in August. By contrast, Democrats took 
in under $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats know that eliminating soft money will give them an  
electoral advantage,'' the material went on to say. ``They will 
always have massive union funds and manpower to make up the 
difference.''

<HEADLINE> Qualcomm Shares Rise 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Shares of communications company Qualcomm Inc.  
rose more than 11 percent Tuesday after the firm announced it was 
seeking a buyer for its mobile phone manufacturing unit and that 
fourth-quarter earnings would meet or beat estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Qualcomm, which for months had been the subject of  
rumors that it would sell the phone manufacturing business, rose 
$17.12 1/2 to $170.50 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego-based company hopes to sell the phone handset  
division by the end of the year because of a worldwide parts 
shortage caused by heavy demand and falling margins in the industry 
sparked by fierce competition, said spokeswoman Christine Trimble. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualcomm will focus on licensing its CDMA technology to other  
phone manufacturers and will continue designing and manufacturing 
CDMA chips, Trimble said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also will continue manufacturing the Omnitracs  
global-positioning systems and maintain participation in Globalstar 
Telecommunications, a worldwide satellite-based phone network 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualcomm is now looking at ways to shift employees from its  
phone manufacturing division to other units of the company to avoid 
layoffs, but can't rule out the possibility that some workers will 
lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to tell what the impact would be,'' Trimble  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualcomm also announced that it would meet or exceed  
fourth-quarter earnings estimates of 87 cents per share. It did not 
say whose estimates it was using, though the figures Qualcomm used 
are slightly less than the estimate projection of 88 cents per 
share by First Call/Thomson Financial, which is based on a survey 
of analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualcomm reported earnings of 54 cents per diluted share a year  
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble said Qualcomm will release its fourth-quarter earnings  
Nov. 2.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were lower today  
in early trading on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices were pressured by the fall harvest, with traders  
saying yields in the eastern corn belt have been better than 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	A sale of U.S. corn to Iran and interest from South Korea was  
limiting the price decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans dipped for a second straight day after a week-long  
rally, amid concern that the recent runup in prices would hurt U.S. 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar concerns about wheat exports pushed prices for that  
commodity lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.72 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.15 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 1/4 
cent to $1.15 1/2 a bushel, and November soybeans fell 5 1/4 cents to 
$5.05 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures plummeted on signs of rising supply at a time 
when retail demand is down. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell .12 cent to 67.25 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .02 cent to 79.60 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs tumbled 1.47 cents to 41.50 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies fell .57 cents to 53.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Emmy Awards Top Nielsen Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The ceremony honoring television's best and  
brightest bombed -- on TV. Fox's telecast of the Emmy Awards drew 
the lowest ratings for television's big night since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Sunday telecast's estimated 17.4 million viewers was  
easily the most-watched program of the week, a lull before the 
upcoming storm of season premieres. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a Fox entertainment program has ranked No.  
1 during the week in all of Nielsen Media Research's measurements. 
But the audience was still 1.9 million people smaller than the one 
watching NBC's Emmy telecast last year. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, led last week by its twin ``60 Minutes'' broadcasts,  
narrowly won the week with a 6.7 rating and 12 share. Fox had a 6.6 
rating and 11 share, and was easily the most popular network among 
the advertiser-prized 18-49 audience. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was third with a 6.3 rating and 11 share, ABC had a 5.7  
rating and 10 share, and the WB and UPN tied with 2.2 ratings and 4 
shares. Pax TV had a 0.9 rating and 2 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox also got a jolt of negative attention from Sen. Joseph  
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, and former U.S. Education 
Secretary William Bennett. The two gave Fox its ``Silver Sewer 
Award'' for its ``tireless, tasteless and ongoing efforts to drag 
down network programming standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two politicians criticized the new Fox series, ``Get Real,''  
for showing a mother finding her teen-aged son in bed with his 
girlfriend. The show premiered last week to lackluster ratings, 
finishing in 50th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox issued a statement saying its programs had been rated  
appropriately under the industry's voluntary standards to warn 
viewers of content. The network said it respected viewers' freedom 
to choose their own entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and the ``NBC Nightly News'' tied  
for first in the evening news ratings race with 7.0 ratings and 16 
shares. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.0 rating and 13 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Sept. 6-12, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``Emmy Awards,'' Fox, 11.7; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 9.1;  
``60 Minutes II,'' CBS, 8.8; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 8.6; ``ER,'' NBC, 
8.5; ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' special, CBS, 8.5; ``Frasier,'' 
NBC, 8.5; ``Friends,'' NBC, 8.3; ``20/20-Friday,'' ABC, 8.0; 
``JAG,'' CBS, 8.0.

<HEADLINE> Former Inmate To Get New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man cleared of a double murder after spending  
more than 15 years on death row now has a shot at erasing from his 
record charges stemming from a $2 armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Porter, 43, freed from death row in February after  
another man confessed, was granted a new trial Monday for the 
robbery committed the night of the 1982 slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter initially was tried before the same jury on the murder  
and armed robbery charges. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney contended that testimony about the murders likely  
biased jurors who also found Porter guilty in the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Thomas Fitzgerald agreed Monday in deciding that  
Porter should be retried on the three remaining charges -- armed 
robbery, unlawful restraint and unlawful use of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if he is convicted a second time in the robbery of Henry  
Williams, Porter likely will not be sent back to prison because he 
already has served enough time for robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors insist the new trial is worth the cost and effort.  
</P>
<P>
	``We think he is a robber and a stickup man and we owe it to the  
community that we serve to see that it's protected,'' Assistant 
State's Attorney Thomas Gainer said after the new trial was 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was released after a Milwaukee laborer, Alstory Simon,  
admitted he was responsible for the 1982 fatal shootings of Marilyn 
Green, 19, and Jerry Hillard, 18, in a park on the South Side. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon made the admission under questioning by a private  
detective working with a Northwestern University journalism class. 
Simon has since pleaded guilty and been sentenced to 37 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter attorney Daniel Sanders said the next step could be a  
fight over the admissibility of a dead man's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who testified against Porter at the 1983 trial, died  
in a fire several years ago. Sanders said it could be hard to 
convict Porter unless a transcript of what Williams told the court 
16 years ago is allowed into evidence.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Wants Mile High Stadium Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Mayor Wellington Webb wants the new Denver Broncos  
stadium to keep the old one's name. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Monday, Webb urged the Metropolitan Football Stadium  
District to keep Mile High Stadium as the ``stand-alone name'' of 
the stadium being built. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an elected official who is typically called upon to be a  
steward of citizen tax dollars, my first inclination was to find a 
way to lessen the tax burden of the new stadium by considering 
corporate naming rights,'' Webb said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I've spoken with fans who remember the Broncos of the  
striped-socks era and I've spoken with fans who endured the 
blistering snowstorms to watch the team play at Mile High. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traveling around the world, there are few things that are  
synonymous with the City of Denver and the Rocky Mountain region'' 
than the Broncos and Mile High Stadium, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the groundbreaking for the stadium last month, Broncos owner  
Pat Bowlen said he also wants the home of the two-time Super Bowl 
champions to retain its name. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision rests with the Stadium District, which  
oversees the taxpayers' three-quarters share of the $364.2 million 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	A sale of naming rights could bring an estimated $50 million in  
help for public costs. Last month, board member Joy Burns said 
although everyone loves the name Mile High Stadium, there is not 
such a significant attachment to it that would preclude a name 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the district begins to take bids, it must by law survey  
residents in the six-county Denver area about retaining the name. 
Board members said last month that the survey will probably be done 
in the next six months.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Urges Holocaust Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top U.S. Treasury official today urged  
German companies to offer a bigger payment to survivors of Nazi 
slave labor camps, saying it is time for them to meet ``their moral 
responsibility'' for wartime abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat told the House  
Banking Committee that survivors also must reduce their demands in 
order to reach agreement by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The German companies have time and again denied any legal  
liability in U.S. courts, but have clearly indicated their moral 
responsibility for the gross abuses inflicted on millions of forced 
and slave laborers,'' Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now time that they make a proposal to settle the suits  
in a fashion consistent with their moral responsibility,'' 
Eizenstat said of the 16 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say what amounts of money are being negotiated  
but said the two sides are far apart and will have to ``give 
considerably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for survivors at one time reportedly demanded $20  
billion. German industry has offered $1.7 billion to compensate for 
using Nazi camp inmates as slave labor during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the same token, I hope that plaintiffs' attorneys are aware  
that the initial monetary demands they have put forward in this 
negotiation are not considered realistic by German industry or the 
German government,'' Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those attorneys will need to show flexibility if these cases  
are to be settled within the lifetimes of the survivors they 
represent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies and the German government are planning to set up  
two foundations or funds to handle survivor claims, a system 
Eizenstat said would be faster and cover more people than pending 
U.S. lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had received assurances from companies that they will  
continue to negotiate a settlement despite court rulings Monday in 
which U.S. federal judges dismissed two separate cases against an 
American and two German companies. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because while the companies want ``legal closure,'' on  
the issue of compensation, it was ``always viewed as primarily a 
moral issue,'' Eizenstat said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Offers Anti-Gay Views </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Questioned by an anti-gay rights  
publication, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Tuesday that he opposes 
gay marriages and that a court erred in striking a ban on gays in 
the Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishers of the newsletter said Bush's comments were ``a good  
start'' but said they had more questions about the Republican 
presidential front-runner's position on gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Horn is a leading anti-gay rights activist who publishes a  
newsletter called ``Straight from the Heart.'' He's been 
questioning presidential campaigns about their views on gay issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pushed to detail the Texas governor's positions, the Bush  
campaign sent Horn a brief statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush believes marriage is between a man and a woman  
and therefore does not believe in gay marriages,'' the statement 
said. He also opposed adoption by gay couples because ``he believes 
children ought to be adopted in families with a man and woman who 
are married.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told the newsletter that he believes the New Jersey Supreme  
Court ``was wrong'' when it struck down the Boy Scouts' ban on gays 
in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``He believes the Boy Scouts is a private organization and they  
should be able to set their own standards,'' Bush's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good start,'' said Horn. ``There are a couple of  
other things we want answers on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horn said he would press Bush to offer views on ``the gay agenda  
in public education'' and on domestic partner laws allowing 
benefits for partners in a gay relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recommendation to him would be to provide those specific  
questions to us and we will provide answers to him,'' said Bush 
spokesman Eric Woolson. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn said the questions had been posed to all the Republican  
presidential candidates, and only former cabinet officer Elizabeth 
Dole and Arizona Sen. John McCain had failed to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The other candidates also opposed the gay rights initiatives,  
Horn noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Bush's rivals argue the front-runner is vague on the  
issues, and ducks tough questions. Bush counters that he will flesh 
out a detailed agenda as the campaign unfolds, but will do it as 
his own pace.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Trade Partnership Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investment banks Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan  
Stanley Dean Witter have joined three other big name Wall Street 
firms in a partnership to operate an electronic trading system that 
will compete with the traditional stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Goldman Sachs Group, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Madoff  
Securities announced the creation of Primex Trading NA, one of a 
number of electronic communication networks, known as ECNs, that 
have emerged recently as alternative trading systems to the New 
York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter to the Primex partnership is significant because of the 
volume of trading business the two firms will bring to the new 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	A widespread criticism of ECNs is that they lack liquidity,  
which means the number of trades taking place on the systems is 
small and stock prices can swing wildly on the basis of a handful 
of transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Madoff, head of Madoff Securities, said that, counting  
the latest additions, the five-member Primex partnership now 
accounts for about 60 percent of all of the stock trades processed 
on any given day. If the partnership shifts just a fraction of that 
business to Primex, the system is assured a decent level of 
liquidity, Madoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Primex hopes to separate itself from the crowd of ECNs by  
offering a computer-based auction system in which the best prices 
will be displayed to an ``electronic crowd'' who will then compete, 
via computer, for the best offer. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, trades conducted via the New York Stock Exchange's  
auction system are limited to the prices being offered by brokers 
gathered on the floor of the exchange.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Tribe Signs Gambling Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A wealthy Indian tribe that owns a  
1,200-slot machine casino belatedly joined dozens of other tribes 
and signed a pact with the governor Tuesday that would increase 
casino-style gambling on California reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agua Caliente, which earlier declined to join the 57 other  
tribes that approved the pacts on Friday, signed the agreement in 
Gov. Gray Davis' office. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 11th hour of the 20th century, we have sought to make  
right with the first Americans,'' Davis said with the tribe's 
chairman, Richard Milanovich, at his side. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palm Springs tribe is a major participant in California's  
gambling politics and had considered bankrolling a ballot 
initiative next year that would have dramatically increased 
casino-style gambling on Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	But after days of negotiations in the Capitol, the tribe decided  
against a ballot fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements ward off a Justice Department threat to enforce a  
federal court order that would have shut down the tribes' slots and 
low-stakes blackjack games in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
	The state agreed to allow slot machines to continue operating  
after the Indians consented to a cap of no more than about 43,000 
of the devices. An estimated 18,000 are in use now. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise came after a high court overturned Proposition 5,  
the 1998 voter-approved measure that allowed gambling machines and 
certain card games at Indian casinos. The justices said the 
California Constitution bans such Las Vegas-style gambling.

<HEADLINE> Fredericks Qualifies for 100 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Frankie Fredericks of Namibia  
qualified Tuesday for the 100-meter finals as the All Africa Games 
rolled into high gear with the start of track and field events. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigerian Deji Aliu supplied the major competition for  
Fredericks, actually clocking a faster 10.11 in the same semifinal 
as the Namibian. Fredericks' 10.27 was only the fourth-fastest 
qualifying time for Wednesday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Assefa Mezgebu of Ethiopia won the 10,000 meters in  
28:12.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 5,000 athletes from 52 countries are participating in the  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some excitement at a basketball game between Angola  
and Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Awoture Eleyae, head of the Supreme Council of Sport in  
Africa, said guns were taken from Angolan spectators who live in 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't comprehend why people would want to watch a basketball  
with guns,'' Eleyae said.

<HEADLINE> CART Race Will Return to Cleveland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- CART and IMG Motorsports agreed Tuesday to  
bring a race back to Cleveland for the next three years, reversing 
CART's decision earlier this summer to pull out of the local grand 
prix. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG and Championship Auto Racing Teams had argued over the  
sanctioning fee for the race. But they agreed on a deal that will 
put the circuit's championship series back at the temporary course 
at Burke Lakefront Airport through 2002, IMG spokesman Denny Young 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the new deal were not disclosed. IMG president Bud  
Stanner said in June that CART's sanctioning fee had jumped from 
$1.6 million to about $2 million, which was more than his company 
wanted to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The less expensive Indy Racing League had planned to take CART's  
place, backed by IMG. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mayor Michael R. White withdrew his support for the IRL race  
on Sept. 3, citing rumors that CART and IRL might merge. The IRL 
race's oval course also would have required construction at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	White then asked IMG and CART to return to the negotiating  
table. 
</P>
<P>
	``CART will be back in Cleveland next summer and for many years  
to follow,'' White said. ``This is great news for the city of 
Cleveland, CART and racing's most loyal fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CART spokesman Ron Richards said the mayor's actions helped  
bring the two sides together.	   ''We always recognized that Cleveland's a great place to race,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman from IRL referred back to a statement earlier this  
month from Leo Mehl, IRL's executive director, who said it was 
unfortunate the IRL won't be able to race in Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Alaskans Vote on Cash Rewards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Alaskans voted Tuesday on a proposal to  
balance the budget by reducing the annual dividend each man, woman 
and child receives from the state's oil-royalty savings account. 
</P>
<P>
	The election was strictly advisory. But if voters approve,  
Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles and the Republican-controlled 
Legislature have promised to enact a law splitting the earnings of 
the $26 billion Alaska Permanent Fund between state spending and 
the wildly popular annual dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	A decline in oil revenues has forced sharp cuts in the state  
budget, but the fund -- and the dividend -- have grown in the booming 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan before voters would cut the dividend to about $1,340 in  
2001. Last year's payout was $1,540 and this year's is expected to 
exceed $1,700. About $800 million a year would be dedicated to 
bridging the gap between the state's spending and its revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the plan contended it was necessary to avoid  
drastic budget cuts or the loss of Alaska's status as the only 
state without an income tax or a sales tax. The supporters drew 
more than $500,000 in donations from businesses, particularly in 
oil and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents, including a loose coalition of conservatives and  
liberal environmentalists, said cutting the dividend would amount 
to a regressive tax that hits the poor while largely exempting rich 
people and corporations, including Alaska's powerful oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Some opponents want deep budget cuts, others want an income tax,  
and still others want to increase taxes on the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to put the plan on the ballot began last winter, when  
oil prices dropped below $9 a barrel and the projected budget gap 
for the current fiscal year grew to more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, oil has climbed to more than $23 a barrel, shrinking  
the budget gap to a projected $632 million.

<HEADLINE> Ellen Tracy Spring Fashion Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For its spring 2000 wardrobe, the Ellen Tracy  
fashion company is offering women a little something - and the 
emphasis is on little. 
</P>
<P>
	With hems on skirts -- and on pants, too -- rising so high, and  
with belly-baring waistlines riding so low, wearers might need to 
tone ankles as well as abs. 
</P>
<P>
	Seldom do designers accomplish so much with so little.  
</P>
<P>
	A fabric shortage? Perhaps. But Ellen Tracy's Fashion Week  
runway show Tuesday made a case for clothes in pint-size 
proportions. Low-slung khaki linen trousers cropped on the calf 
combined with abbreviated T-shirts that showed slivers of stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Tracy is a $250 million company that typically tracks the  
trends while catering to a stylish customer who demands 
comfortable, corporate clothes. Now the company is sizing up spring 
with a little sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The return of the shorter length is going to be newer,'' says  
Linda Allard, the company's head designer. ``It puts a whole new 
emphasis on the shapes and on the figure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other looks, such as satin raincoats in tropical garden colors,  
and gauze tunics, offer body-friendly coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the runways Tuesday, Oscar de la Renta, ever the  
perfectionist, saw to it that the sky was gloriously blue for his 
spring preview - even if it was only a projected, celestial 
backdrop with cottony clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	So much the better to show off his favorite blue: denim.  
</P>
<P>
	Denim? From de la Renta? Granted, it's not exactly the blue-jean  
rodeo-queen variety. The Dominican-born designer has built his 
business dressing well-heeled women who populate the social pages. 
His rendition of the true-blue American fabric promises to show up 
at important soirees. Take, for instance, his white cotton evening 
gowns paired with impeccably tailored denim jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really mostly about the mixture of the unmixable,'' says  
de la Renta. ``That's what fashion is all about today. You can take 
a daytime element and mix with evening elements for a wonderful 
look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other eye-catchers: de la Renta's enormous, silk tulle ballerina  
ball skirts, approximately three feet in diameter. Make room for 
that new closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Miller conjured up ``an eclectic hodgepodge,'' she said,  
which touches on trends including florals, crayon brights, ruffles, 
and sheer and shine. 
</P>
<P>
	Like de la Renta, her mind is on the mix.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like the contrast of more modern items, like a rubber top,  
with more vintage items, like a beaded floral print '70s skirt,'' 
says Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's chaos theory also showed up in the form of animal  
prints, surprisingly cast in turquoise or magenta. Unlike anything 
you'd find in the forest, they're ideal for the urban jungle.

<HEADLINE> Details of Atlanta Games Bid Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC will request details of any improprieties  
during Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Olympics and refer any serious 
cases to its ethics panel for possible action, a spokesman said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee will write the U.S. Olympic  
Committee on Tuesday or Wednesday, asking for information on the 
lobbying tactics contained in Atlanta's bid files, spokesman 
Franklin Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get the information, it will be passed on to the  
ethics commission. Right now, the only document the IOC has is what 
it reads in the press. For us, it's still at a level of 
allegations,'' Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously secret records turned over to U.S. congressional  
investigators have revealed that Atlanta bidders offered or 
considered lavish favors, gifts and perks for IOC members and their 
families during their successful campaign for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents uncovered so far contain no evidence of the  
scholarships, cash payments and other bribery associated with Salt 
Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the rules on gifts (value limit of $200) and travel  
(one trip for two people) were often ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled in connection  
with the Salt Lake scandal. The top two officials of the Salt Lake 
organizing committee also lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that we have seen so far in the press shows that  
the bid from Atlanta did not cross the line that was crossed in 
Salt Lake City,'' Servan-Schreiber told The Associated Press by 
telephone from Sydney, Australia, where he is attending meetings 
related to the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that we have read shows that Atlanta actually  
pushed those favors and gifts onto the IOC members under the 
pretext of friendship,'' he said. ``The members weren't used to 
this systematic approach to lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly this is the kind of activity the IOC is trying to  
refrain from. This is why the IOC reforms are taking place. We 
don't want it to happen again. We want the public to have full 
confidence in the IOC process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, at the height of the Salt Lake scandal, the IOC  
sent letters to national Olympic committees asking for details of 
any ethical misconduct during bids for the games from 1996 to 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said no serious cases were reported to the IOC,  
including from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The letter we are sending to the USOC will ask why the IOC was  
not informed earlier of the information coming out now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any allegations meriting investigation would be dealt with by  
the new IOC ethics commission, which was set up in the wake of the 
Salt Lake affair. The eight-member panel is headed by IOC vice 
president Keba Mbaye and includes former Sen. Howard Baker. It is 
scheduled to meet again Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Sunday that bid  
documents show Atlanta bidders helped the sons and daughters of IOC 
members get into colleges in Georgia, offered to help them find 
jobs and paid for trips to New York and Disney World in Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN reported it had obtained documents indicating that Atlanta  
organizers believed IOC members could be ``bought.'' One memo in 
the files reportedly describes one IOC member's tastes this way: 
``Gifts are OK. Gift of female OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN also reported that the wife of IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch and a friend were flown to Atlanta and taken on a side 
trip by private jet to Charleston, S.C., in 1990 -- at a total cost 
of more than $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found it very surprising,'' Servan-Schreiber said. ``It  
probably fell through the cracks. Normally, the IOC pays for the 
president and his wife when they travel. I have no idea why the 
Atlanta bid committee paid for that. Should we reimburse that? I 
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said Samaranch and his wife don't fall within the  
bid-limit rules because he does not vote in the selection of host 
cities and holds a position ``similar to a head of state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's normal to extend hospitality to his wife,''  
Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the friend accompanying Mrs. Samaranch was her  
cousin, whom he described as her habitual traveling companion. 
</P>
<P>
	Two current IOC members have been cited in the Atlanta records  
as receiving special favors. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the documents examined by the Journal-Constitution,  
Atlanta officials arranged for the son of Rampaul Ruhee of 
Mauritius to enroll at Georgia Tech in fall 1990. They also helped 
him settle into an apartment, with leased furniture and rent paid 
five months in advance, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also cited documents indicating that Atlanta Olympics chief  
Billy Payne helped the son of Russian member Vitaly Smirnov get a 
job at a ski resort in Colorado. Newsweek magazine, meanwhile, 
reported that Smirnov received travel and favors worth a total of 
$8,500 from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov was one of five IOC members who received a ``serious  
warning'' earlier this year for their role in the Salt Lake 
scandal.

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Hits Florida, Heads for N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COCOA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Heavy rain from one of the most  
fearsome storms of the century began to lash the coast ahead of 
Hurricane Floyd Tuesday night, as evacuees from Florida to the 
Carolinas streamed inland in bumper-to-bumper traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 2 million people were told to get out of the way as Floyd  
skirted the north-central Florida coast, menacing an area from Cape 
Canaveral to Jacksonville with 140 mph winds. The monstrous, 
600-mile storm -- bigger than the whole state of Florida -- 
threatened to roll ashore early Thursday, probably in Georgia or 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain began falling from West Palm Beach to Cape Canaveral  
Tuesday evening, with forecasters expecting tropical storm winds to 
come ashore just before dawn and hurricane force winds greater than 
74 mph late Wednesday morning, if the storm continued its current 
path. 
</P>
<P>
	By 8 p.m., Floyd was centered 205 miles east-southeast of Cape  
Canaveral, moving northwest at 12 mph. Its winds had eased from 
Monday's 155 mph, but it was still a Category 4 storm, the second 
most powerful hurricane designation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this thing parallels us, it could act like a weed-eater  
going up the coast,'' said Craig Fugate of the Florida Emergency 
Operations Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected the eye of the storm to come within 50  
miles of Daytona Beach early Wednesday afternoon as it moves north. 
Landfall was projected close to Charleston, S.C., by early 
Thursday, said meteorologist Jeremy Pennington with the National 
Hurricane Center 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney World closed early because of the weather for the  
first time in its 28-year history. Other Orlando-area resorts like 
Universal Studios and SeaWorld also shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cape Canaveral's nearly deserted Kennedy Space Center, 102  
workers volunteered to stay behind to ride out Floyd, which NASA 
feared could destroy launch pads and the hangars where all four 
space shuttles are kept. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody else is gone. It's kind of eerie out here,'' NASA  
spokesman George Diller, one of the volunteers, said by telephone 
from a fortified building at the space center. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued pre-emptive disaster declarations for  
Florida and Georgia to enable recovery efforts to begin as quickly 
as possible. He also planned to return a day early from his trip to 
New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Emergency Management Agency set up a staging area in  
Atlanta, stockpiling food, ice, water, cots, sleeping bags, 
blankets, generators, portable toilets, flashlights and plastic 
sheeting so that they could be delivered to hard-hit areas in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, authorities ordered 500,000 people to evacuate six  
coastal counties. A similar ordered covered 800,000 people in South 
Carolina, a week shy of the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Hugo's 
destructive run. 
</P>
<P>
	To ease traffic out of Charleston, all lanes of Interstate 26  
were switched over to eastbound traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, residents were urged to evacuate outlying  
islands on the Outer Banks, and Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get out of harm's way,'' Hunt said. ``Don't tempt it.''  
</P>
<P>
	In north and central Florida, where hundreds of thousands were  
warned to clear out, traffic was bumper-to-bumper on hurricane 
escape routes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting out of Dodge,'' said Phyllis Cusack of Daytona  
Beach, who was driving westward on Interstate 10 with her daughter. 
``We're just going to drive and find a hotel, and we brought 
pillows in case we don't find one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Mills, a 34-year-old Kennedy Space Center worker, got  
stuck in traffic, managing only 15 miles in 2 1/2 hours. He became so 
frustrated he simply turned around and returned to Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just inching along,'' he said. ``You made a mile every  
five to 10 minutes. There were people going on the sides of the 
road. People were getting angry.''

	Daytona Beach, Palm Beach and other coastal areas were virtual  
ghost towns as most people appeared to heed evacuation orders. Most 
gas stations, restaurants and shops were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some people refused to abandon their homes and  
businesses. Some went to the beach to watch the increasingly 
powerful surf, while others kicked back with friends in bars. 
</P>
<P>
	While Americans were fleeing inland, Hurricane Floyd vented its  
fury on the Bahamas, toppling trees and power lines, stripping 
roofs from homes and sending roiling sea waters into the streets of 
the capital, Nassau. Phone service was cut off throughout much of 
the low-lying Atlantic archipelago, and residents and tourists 
sought safety in government shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect along the U.S. coast from Boca  
Raton to Little River Inlet, S.C. High surf advisories were in 
effect as far north as New York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane warning was lifted in the Miami area after the  
storm made a northward turn, and evacuees there were allowed to 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
	But with hurricane winds extending 125 miles from Floyd's eye  
and tropical storm-force winds reaching out as far as 290 miles, 
Floyd could potentially reach clear across the state to Tampa, on 
Florida's Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights in and out of Florida and Georgia  
were canceled, and Amtrak suspended train service into and out of 
Miami, scrambling the plans of vacationers and business travelers 
around the country. The Navy sent ships to ride out the storm at 
sea, and military aircraft were flown inland to bases from Maine to 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, the Marine boot camp at Parris Island was  
preparing school buses to move 7,000 recruits to inland shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Galbreath, 75, insisted on staying in her beachfront  
home in New Smyrna Beach. She did not want to risk moving her son 
Ricky Galbreath, 51, because he has cerebral palsy and cannot walk

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks tumbled today after reports of  
strong retail sales and a soaring trade deficit reignited fears 
that interest rates will rise. The dollar continued to slip, adding 
to the pressure on stocks. At the close of trading on Wall Street, 
the Dow Jones industrial average was down 120.00 at 10,910.33. 
Broader stock indicators turned mixed. The Nasdaq composite index

	Trade Deficit Sets Quarterly Record  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit soared to another  
record high, but the overall economy remained unfazed as consumers 
went on a buying binge in August. The Commerce Department reported 
today that retail sales jumped 1.2 percent last month, the biggest 
increase in six months, as consumers snapped up new cars, furniture 
and clothing at a rapid clip. In a second report, the government 
said the U.S. current account trade deficit climbed to an all-time 
high of $80.7 billion in the April-June quarter of this year. That 
was up 17.5 percent from a first-quarter deficit of $68.7 billion, 
the previous record.

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Shares of communications company Qualcomm Inc.  
rose more than 11 percent today after the firm announced it was 
seeking a buyer for its mobile phone manufacturing unit and that 
fourth-quarter earnings would meet or beat estimates. Shares of 
Qualcomm, which for months had been the subject of rumors that it 
would sell the phone manufacturing business, rose 17 1/8 to 170 1/2. 
Spokesman Christine Trimble said Qualcomm will focus on licensing 
its CDMA technology to other phone manufacturers and will continue 
designing and manufacturing CDMA chips.

	Two Household Moving Firms To Merge  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) -- North American Van Lines Inc. plans to  
merge with Allied Van Lines in a $450 million deal that will create 
the world's largest moving company. NA Holding Corp., which will be 
based in Fort Wayne, would have more than $2 billion in annual 
revenues, locations in 36 countries and a network of 1,100 agents 
throughout North America. The merger would establish it as the 
clear leader in a business that's been very competitive, said 
analyst Doug Rockel of ING Barings LLC.

	Deadline Nears for Auto Workers  
</P>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Contract talks between the United  
Auto Workers and automakers intensified today as agreements 
covering 407,000 workers were due to expire at midnight. The union 
appeared to be negotiating hardest with DaimlerChrysler AG. 
Officials met at the German-American automaker's U.S. offices in 
Auburn Hills late into last night and resumed talks today. 
Negotiations are also under way with General Motors Corp. and Ford 
Motor Co.

	Credit Protection Schemes Decried  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators say credit card protection  
scams have become big business for fraudulent operations who target 
people unaware of the rights they already have. The Federal Trade 
Commission was announcing cases against several such companies 
today. They are accused of bilking consumers out of $25 million by 
exploiting concerns about card theft, loss or Y2K-related problems. 
Attorneys general in Illinois, Ohio, Arizona, Florida, West 
Virginia and Wisconsin planned similar actions. Credit card holders 
already are entitled to certain protections without having to pay 
for them.

	Securities Fraud Alleged in Japan  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Several Japanese companies face possible losses  
from bonds they purchased from a Tokyo-based securities firm whose 
head is facing charges for allegedly bilking Japanese investors out 
of up to $1 billion. Martin Armstrong, 50, was charged yesterday 
with securities fraud by federal prosecutors and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission for allegedly swindling investors through 
corporations he controlled -- including Tokyo-based Cresvale 
International Ltd. -- in attempt to make up for trading losses. The 
Maple Shade, N.J. man was released on $5 million bail after an 
appearance in federal court in Trenton, N.J.

	Practical Cars at Frankfurt Show  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Automakers unveiled a number of boxy  
family cars at the Frankfurt auto show today, offering a glimpse of 
Europe's automotive future that looks decidedly practical. 
Volkswagen's new Polo, new versions of Ford's Fiesta, the Audi A2 
and concept vehicles by Opel and Chrysler all have a similar shape 
-- drawing cues from the minivan with their conventional car hoods 
and a hatchback-style rear. There were also new advances at the 
high end of the market as Mercedes showed its S600, a V-12 luxury 
car, and a coupe version of its SLR super sports car. BMW showed 
off its Z8 roadster and an X5 ``sports activity vehicle'' that 
combines design elements of a station wagon and sports utility 
vehicle.

	Gov't Offering Y2K Warnings Abroad  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what promises to be the best road map yet  
for identifying global problems caused by the Year 2000 technology 
glitch, the State Department today said it was preparing 
country-by-country warnings for Americans living or traveling in 
194 nations. While there is no reason yet to issue any specific 
warning, Kevin Herbert, director of overseas citizens services at 
the department, said Americans could face ``potential 
difficulties'' in obtaining medical services, proper water and 
other facilities as a result of malfunctioning computers. Herbert 
said technology warnings would be routinely issued along with 
familiar travel advisories.

institutional investors to help fund its planned expansion in Latin 
America. The investors, led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Private 
Equity, will take a 12.5 percent stake in the company. Brazilian 
publishers Folha Group and Abril Group, who started the Sao Paulo, 
Brazil-based company in 1996, will continue to own 87.5 percent of 
UOL.

	Health Care Companies Curb Service  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some home health care companies say new  
Medicare payment caps have prompted them to curb services to 
elderly and disabled patients with expensive medical problems, such 
as diabetes or congestive heart failure. Results of a survey 
covering 28 home care companies in nine states found steps being 
taken include turning away patients likely to need longer-term or 
repeat care, particularly diabetics, or intensive short-term care 
such as those such as those who leave the hospital with intravenous 
drips. Virtually all of the companies said they were also pushing 
to discharge existing Medicare patients with chronic diseases, such 
diabetes or multiple sclerosis, into nursing homes or family care.

	Report: Gov'ts Ignore IMF Warnings  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Critics often blame the International Monetary  
Fund for failing to predict or prevent financial crises, but a new 
report concludes that governments do not heed IMF warnings designed 
to fend off economic turmoil. The independent report, commissioned 
by the agency, also says, however, that IMF monitoring of the 
economies of its 182 member nations has failed to keep pace with 
the globalization of financial markets and the increased importance 
of billions of dollars moving around the world every day.

<HEADLINE> Merger May Form Largest Moving Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) -- North American Van Lines Inc. plans to  
merge with Allied Van Lines in a $450 million deal that will create 
the world's largest moving company. 
</P>
<P>
	NA Holding Corp., which will be based in Fort Wayne, would have  
more than $2 billion in annual revenues, locations in 36 countries 
and a network of 1,100 agents throughout North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would establish it as the clear leader in a business  
that's been very competitive, said analyst Doug Rockel of ING 
Barings LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are two heavyweights within a relatively modest niche  
inside the trucking industry,'' Rockel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year,  
pending regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice Inc., the New York  
investment firm that owns most of North American, to pay Allied's 
London-based parent, NFC PLC, $400 million in cash and $25 million 
in preferred and common stock that represents a 20 percent stake in 
NA Holding Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	NFC will receive warrants to acquire an additional 10 percent  
stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	CD&AMP;R will hold on to 55 percent of NA Holding. The remainder  
will be held by North American management and agents. 
</P>
<P>
	About 18 months after merging, the combined company will realize  
annual savings of $20 million to $30 million through greater 
efficiencies, said R. Barry Uber, North American's president and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	No layoffs are expected since the two companies overlap little  
geographically, Uber said. 
</P>
<P>
	North American specializes in moving high-end merchandise such  
as computers, medical equipment and commercial products, while 
Allied specializes in households. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bring together two outstanding teams with an agent network  
unmatched in the industry,'' Uber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would represent a major consolidation in the  
household moving industry at the time when six years of housing 
growth is threatened by the higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Uber said North American's analysis of recent recessions  
showed the moving industry did not contract nearly as much as the 
economy as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	``If things were bad in a marketplace, people move to get jobs  
in another part of the country. This is a very mobile society,'' 
Uber said. 
</P>
<P>
	All of Allied's moving-services business -- Allied in the United  
States and Canada, Pickfords in the United Kingdom, and Allied 
Pickfords in Europe, Australia and Asia -- would keep those brand 
names in the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	James W. Rogers, a principal in CD&AMP;R, will serve as chairman of  
the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Van Lines, established in 1928, employs 4,000 people  
worldwide and moved 338,000 shipments last year. North American, 
founded in 1933, employs about 3,200 people worldwide and moved 
more than 440,000 shipments last year.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains Mostly Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures fell sharply Tuesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while grain futures were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight day that soybean prices declined  
after a long price rally that had been fueled by bone-dry weather 
in the Midwest and expectations of a shrinking crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are concerned that the surge in the price of soybeans  
will hurt the demand for U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Positive signs from the fall harvest of corn sent prices for  
that commodity lower. Fair weather is expected through the week, 
helping producers, and moisture levels are said to be low, enabling 
harvesting to begin in key states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat was pressured by weak export sales, but potential losses  
were offset by the anticipation that freezes in the northern Plains 
states and the Canadian prairie could cause problems for the spring 
wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was unchanged at $2.88 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.14 3/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
1 cent to $1.14 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 8 1/2 cents to 
$5.01 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork  
futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .50 cent to 67.87 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .75 cent to 80.37 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose .13 cent to 43.10 cents a pound; February frozen 
pork bellies fell .05 cent to 54.07 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Italian, Deutsche Telecoms at Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The shareholders of the Wind telecommunications  
consortium on Tuesday effectively voted to oust Deutsche Telekom's 
two board members. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote technically was in favor of a motion of  
``accountability'' against the Deutsche Telekom representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the move, Deutsche Telekom is not obliged to sell its  
stake in Wind, a fixed-line and cellular telephone operator, 
according to a source close to the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind is 51 percent owned by the Italian state electricity group  
Enel SpA, with the remainder evenly divided between France Telecom 
and Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote over accountability was in response to Deutsche  
Telekom's move to enter alliance negotiations with Telecom Italia 
SpA, which is Italy's main cellular phone operator a a bit 
competitor of Wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Enel and France Telecom claim the alliance talks violated  
shareholder covenants. The alliance talks failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The accountability motion required the approval of holders of at  
least 20 percent of shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Deutsche Telekom said the ``move represents an  
abuse of law'' and that it would take necessary legal steps to 
counter it. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, a Rome court ruled that Deutsche Telekom damaged Wind  
when it entered into alliance talks with Telecom Italia. The court 
imposed the symbolic punishment of requiring Deutsche Telekom to 
publish the ruling in three major Italian newspapers.

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Hits Florida, Heads for N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COCOA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Heavy rain from one of the most  
fearsome storms of the century began to lash the coast ahead of 
Hurricane Floyd Tuesday night, as evacuees from Florida to the 
Carolinas streamed inland in bumper-to-bumper traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 2 million people were told to get out of the way as Floyd  
skirted the north-central Florida coast, menacing an area from Cape 
Canaveral to Jacksonville with 140 mph winds. The monstrous, 
600-mile storm -- bigger than the whole state of Florida -- 
threatened to roll ashore early Thursday, probably in Georgia or 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain began falling from West Palm Beach to Cape Canaveral  
Tuesday evening, with forecasters expecting tropical storm winds to 
come ashore just before dawn and hurricane force winds greater than 
74 mph late Wednesday morning, if the storm continued its current 
path. 
</P>
<P>
	By 8 p.m., Floyd was centered 205 miles east-southeast of Cape  
Canaveral, moving northwest at 12 mph. Its winds had eased from 
Monday's 155 mph, but it was still a Category 4 storm, the second 
most powerful hurricane designation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this thing parallels us, it could act like a weed-eater  
going up the coast,'' said Craig Fugate of the Florida Emergency 
Operations Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected the eye of the storm to come within 50  
miles of Daytona Beach early Wednesday afternoon as it moves north. 
Landfall was projected close to Charleston, S.C., by early 
Thursday, said meteorologist Jeremy Pennington with the National 
Hurricane Center 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney World closed early because of the weather for the  
first time in its 28-year history. Other Orlando-area resorts like 
Universal Studios and SeaWorld also shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cape Canaveral's nearly deserted Kennedy Space Center, 102  
workers volunteered to stay behind to ride out Floyd, which NASA 
feared could destroy launch pads and the hangars where all four 
space shuttles are kept.

<P>
	``Everybody else is gone. It's kind of eerie out here,'' NASA  
spokesman George Diller, one of the volunteers, said by telephone 
from a fortified building at the space center. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued pre-emptive disaster declarations for  
Florida and Georgia to enable recovery efforts to begin as quickly 
as possible. He also planned to return a day early from his trip to 
New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Emergency Management Agency set up a staging area in  
Atlanta, stockpiling food, ice, water, cots, sleeping bags, 
blankets, generators, portable toilets, flashlights and plastic 
sheeting so that they could be delivered to hard-hit areas in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, authorities ordered 500,000 people to evacuate six  
coastal counties. A similar ordered covered 800,000 people in South 
Carolina, a week shy of the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Hugo's 
destructive run. 
</P>
<P>
	To ease traffic out of Charleston, all lanes of Interstate 26  
were switched over to eastbound traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, residents were urged to evacuate outlying  
islands on the Outer Banks, and Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get out of harm's way,'' Hunt said. ``Don't tempt it.''  
</P>
<P>
	In north and central Florida, where hundreds of thousands were  
warned to clear out, traffic was bumper-to-bumper on hurricane 
escape routes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting out of Dodge,'' said Phyllis Cusack of Daytona  
Beach, who was driving westward on Interstate 10 with her daughter. 
``We're just going to drive and find a hotel, and we brought 
pillows in case we don't find one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Mills, a 34-year-old Kennedy Space Center worker, got  
stuck in traffic, managing only 15 miles in 2 1/2 hours. He became so 
frustrated he simply turned around and returned to Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just inching along,'' he said. ``You made a mile every  
five to 10 minutes. There were people going on the sides of the 
road. People were getting angry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daytona Beach, Palm Beach and other coastal areas were virtual  
ghost towns as most people appeared to heed evacuation orders. Most 
gas stations, restaurants and shops were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some people refused to abandon their homes and  
businesses. Some went to the beach to watch the increasingly 
powerful surf, while others kicked back with friends in bars. 
</P>
<P>
	While Americans were fleeing inland, Hurricane Floyd vented its  
fury on the Bahamas, toppling trees and power lines, stripping 
roofs from homes and sending roiling sea waters into the streets of 
the capital, Nassau. Phone service was cut off throughout much of 
the low-lying Atlantic archipelago, and residents and tourists 
sought safety in government shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect along the U.S. coast from Boca  
Raton to Little River Inlet, S.C. High surf advisories were in 
effect as far north as New York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane warning was lifted in the Miami area after the  
storm made a northward turn, and evacuees there were allowed to 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
	But with hurricane winds extending 125 miles from Floyd's eye  
and tropical storm-force winds reaching out as far as 290 miles, 
Floyd could potentially reach clear across the state to Tampa, on 
Florida's Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights in and out of Florida and Georgia  
were canceled, and Amtrak suspended train service into and out of 
Miami, scrambling the plans of vacationers and business travelers 
around the country. The Navy sent ships to ride out the storm at 
sea, and military aircraft were flown inland to bases from Maine to 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, the Marine boot camp at Parris Island was  
preparing school buses to move 7,000 recruits to inland shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Galbreath, 75, insisted on staying in her beachfront  
home in New Smyrna Beach. She did not want to risk moving her son 
Ricky Galbreath, 51, because he has cerebral palsy and cannot walk 
or talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just put it in God's hands and let him take care of it,''  
she said.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Columbia TriStar Television President Jon  
Feltheimer has resigned, days after parent company Sony Pictures 
Entertainment rehired former TV chief Mel Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Feltheimer's contract was to expire in February, and his future  
had been uncertain after Harris was appointed last week as 
co-president and chief operating officer of Sony Pictures 
Entertainment. Harris, who had left Sony in 1995, was brought back 
to oversee television production. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Feltheimer, Columbia TriStar had produced such hits as  
``Mad About You,'' ``The Nanny'' and ``Party of Five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feltheimer joined the company in 1991 as president of TriStar

<HEADLINE> Ellen Tracy Spring Fashion Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For its spring 2000 wardrobe, the Ellen Tracy  
fashion company is offering women a little something - and the 
emphasis is on little. 
</P>
<P>
	With hems on skirts -- and on pants, too -- rising so high, and  
with belly-baring waistlines riding so low, wearers might need to 
tone ankles as well as abs. 
</P>
<P>
	Seldom do designers accomplish so much with so little.  
</P>
<P>
	A fabric shortage? Perhaps. But Ellen Tracy's Fashion Week  
runway show Tuesday made a case for clothes in pint-size 
proportions. Low-slung khaki linen trousers cropped on the calf 
combined with abbreviated T-shirts that showed slivers of stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Tracy is a $250 million company that typically tracks the  
trends while catering to a stylish customer who demands 
comfortable, corporate clothes. Now the company is sizing up spring 
with a little sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The return of the shorter length is going to be newer,'' says  
Linda Allard, the company's head designer. ``It puts a whole new 
emphasis on the shapes and on the figure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other looks, such as satin raincoats in tropical garden colors,  
and gauze tunics, offer body-friendly coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the runways Tuesday, Oscar de la Renta, ever the  
perfectionist, saw to it that the sky was gloriously blue for his 
spring preview - even if it was only a projected, celestial 
backdrop with cottony clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	So much the better to show off his favorite blue: denim.  
</P>
<P>
	Denim? From de la Renta? Granted, it's not exactly the blue-jean  
rodeo-queen variety. The Dominican-born designer has built his 
business dressing well-heeled women who populate the social pages. 
His rendition of the true-blue American fabric promises to show up 
at important soirees. Take, for instance, his white cotton evening 
gowns paired with impeccably tailored denim jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really mostly about the mixture of the unmixable,'' says  
de la Renta. ``That's what fashion is all about today. You can take 
a daytime element and mix with evening elements for a wonderful 
look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other eye-catchers: de la Renta's enormous, silk tulle ballerina  
ball skirts, approximately three feet in diameter. Make room for 
that new closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Miller conjured up ``an eclectic hodgepodge,'' she said,  
which touches on trends including florals, crayon brights, ruffles, 
and sheer and shine. 
</P>
<P>
	Like de la Renta, her mind is on the mix.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like the contrast of more modern items, like a rubber top,  
with more vintage items, like a beaded floral print '70s skirt,'' 
says Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's chaos theory also showed up in the form of animal  
prints, surprisingly cast in turquoise or magenta. Unlike anything 
you'd find in the forest, they're ideal for the urban jungle.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hits Three-Year Low vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell to a three-year low against the  
Japanese yen Tuesday amid news that America's trade deficit soared 
to another record high in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 105.79 yen in late New York trading,  
down from 106.44 yen on Monday and the lowest level since May 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the dollar rose against other major currencies. The  
euro was quoted at $1.0354, down from $1.0411 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third straight losing session against the yen for the  
dollar, which has been hurt by optimism that a budding Japanese 
recovery may be a better investment than the U.S. economy -- 
especially with the Federal Reserve trying to slow it with higher 
interest rates as a precaution against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Those pressures were compounded Tuesday by a report revealing  
that the U.S. current account trade deficit climbed to $80.7 
billion in the April-June quarter. That was up 17.5 percent from a 
first-quarter deficit of $68.7 billion, the previous record. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account is the broadest measure of trade because it  
tracks not only goods and services but also investment flows and 
U.S. foreign aid payments. The second-quarter's deterioration came 
in all areas as a slight rise in exports was swamped by a big jump 
in imports, led by sharply higher foreign oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	A jump in imports weighs on the dollar because foreign companies  
selling products in the United States take their U.S. revenues and 
convert them to other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5486 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.5420 on Monday, and 1.4745 Canadian dollars, up 
from 1.4697 a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound fell to $1.6072 from late Monday's quote of  
$1.6080. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8890  
German marks, up from 1.8785 on Monday; 6.3353 French francs, up 
from 6.3003; and 1,870 Italian lire, up from 1,860.

<HEADLINE> Securities Fraud Alleged in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Several Japanese companies face possible losses  
from bonds they purchased from a Tokyo-based securities firm whose 
head is facing charges for allegedly bilking Japanese investors out 
of up to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Armstrong, 50, was charged Monday with securities fraud  
by federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission 
for allegedly swindling investors through corporations he 
controlled -- including Tokyo-based Cresvale International Ltd. -- in 
attempt to make up for trading losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Shade, N.J. man was released on $5 million bail after  
an appearance in federal court in Trenton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, resin maker Gun Ei Chemical Industry Co. said Tuesday  
it will post a special loss of 11.79 billion yen ($111.3 million) 
in the quarter ending Sept. 30 in connection with the write-off of 
its Cresvale bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the company said, it will omit its dividend and  
cancel plans to buy back shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Truck assembler Showa Aircraft Industry Co. said its Cresvale  
bond holdings have a book value of about 2.39 billion yen ($22.5 
million). 
</P>
<P>
	Showa faces a ``significant impact'' on its earnings for the  
fiscal year ending March 2000 if it must write off the holdings, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Daiseki Co., which provides industrial garbage  
collection services, said its Cresvale bond holdings total 400 
million yen ($3.7 million), while restaurant chain operator 
Saizeriya Co. and Towa Pharmaceutical Co. each said they has 500 
million yen ($4.7 million). Advertising agency Asatsu-DK Inc. said 
it held 3 billion yen ($28.6 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of several midsize Japanese companies, including metal  
worker Amada Co. and stereo maker Alps Electric Co., fell Tuesday 
after they announced that they, too, may have to record losses 
because of Cresvale investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Alps said it may have to write off 21.8 billion yen ($200.5  
million) of investments made by two subsidiaries, while Amada said 
it holds 6 billion ($57 million) of bonds that it may have to take 
losses on. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency ordered Cresvale  
International to halt sales of the bonds temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong controls Princeton Global Management Ltd. and its  
parent company, Princeton Economics International Ltd. He also 
controls several securities agencies, including Cresvale.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed: Dow Falls 120.00 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks tumbled Tuesday after reports  
of strong retail sales and a soaring trade deficit reignited fears 
that interest rates will rise. The dollar continued to slip, adding 
to the pressure on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 120.00 points, a loss of  
1.1 percent, to close at 10,910.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 7.84 to 1,336.29, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 23.52 to 
2,868.29, helped along by sharp gains in shares of semiconductor 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most stocks were undercut Tuesday by a Commerce Department  
report that showed retail sales surged 1.2 percent in August, the 
biggest increase in six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was nearly twice what economists had anticipated,  
and it fed worries that the Federal Reserve will raise interest 
rates for the third time this year as it tries to prevent inflation 
from escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has already boosted short-term interest rates twice this  
summer, and many economists believed those two increases would have 
been enough to slow consumer spending. But the buoyant U.S. 
economy, with high employment levels and rising wages, has left 
consumers highly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is fearful of the continued strength of the  
economy,'' said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First 
Advisers. ``Consumers are spending up a storm, blithely ignoring 
the rise in interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade  
deficit soared to a record $80.7 billion in the second quarter. 
That news prompted the dollar's latest slide against the Japanese 
yen, to as low as 105.25 yen compared with 106.44 yen late Monday 
in New York. As recently as May, the dollar bought more than 124 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar is now at its lowest level against the yen since May  
1996. A weaker dollar can hurt stocks by encouraging foreign 
investors to put their money in investments in their own countries. 
It also makes imported goods more expensive, adding to inflationary 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The stream of bad economic news hit bonds hard, sending the  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbing to 6.11 percent from 
6.05 percent late Monday. Escalating bond yields can also hurt 
stocks by presenting a guaranteed, stable rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are trying to fill in pieces of the mosaic, trying  
to determine what the Fed will do,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief 
market strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore. ``The market is not 
convinced that the economy lacks inflationary pressures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cripps said stocks will probably stay in a narrow range until  
Oct. 5, when the Fed's policy-making committee holds its next 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still believe the Fed will not raise rates in October, but  
it may still be in the cards for some time this year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and brokerage stocks were among the worst performers  
Tuesday, due largely to concern over interest rates. Dow component 
J.P. Morgan fell 2 13/16 to 122, and Merrill Lynch fell 2 7/8 to 72 
15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance stocks faltered as Hurricane Floyd roared toward the  
Florida coast. The hurricane is expected to be the costliest storm 
since Hurricane Andrew, which caused about $16 billion in property 
losses in 1992. Allstate fell 1 7/16 to 32 1/8, and Cigna fell 2 1/16 
to 87 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualcomm, up 17 1/8 to 170 1/2, boosted the Nasdaq after officials of  
the wireless communications company said they expect to meet or 
exceed analysts' estimates of earnings of 87 cents a share in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductor companies also posted strong gains following a  
bullish forecast from an industry executive. James C. Morgan, 
chairman and chief executive of Applied Materials, said 
semiconductor production worldwide is expected to more than double 
in the next few years as the Internet feeds heavy demand for 
computers. Applied Materials rose 5 9/16 to 81 9/16 and Texas 
Instruments gained 2 7/8 to 91 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 881.27 million 
shares, compared with 800.49 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.41 to 438.24.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average  
fell 0.7 percent. Germany's DAX index lost 0.8 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 lost 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Offers Y2K Warnings Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Problems such as power failures, telephone  
outages or water shortages are likely in China, Russia and some 
other large nations because of the Year 2000 technology problem, 
the State Department predicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings, intended for Americans considering traveling  
overseas during the New Year's holiday, provided the most detailed 
picture to date from the U.S. government about where it anticipates 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``This information will help Americans make their own  
decisions,'' Undersecretary Thomas Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
	No country's Y2K situation was severe enough to issue a formal  
``travel warning'' to discourage Americans from visiting, the State 
Department said, although it urged citizens traveling to Belarus to 
defer their trips or ``be prepared to withstand power, water and 
heat outages during cold winter weather that can last several days 
or more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we're not issuing travel warnings at this time  
... may be taken by some as being reassuring,'' said Kevin Herbert, 
the department's director of overseas citizens services. ``... We 
would do a travel warning if we thought it was dangerous to go 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 196 country-by-country advisories were published on the  
agency's Internet site -- http://travel.state.gov -- in updated 
``consular information sheets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government's most severe warnings included Russia, where it  
predicted likely failures with electrical and heat outages and 
problems with phone and financial systems and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby Ukraine ``appears to be unprepared'' and warned of ``a  
risk of potential disruption in all key sectors, especially the 
energy and electric services,'' the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also described possible failures in China's banking and phone  
systems, and said inland Chinese cities may experience power 
failures and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations in Western Europe fared better in the government  
assessment. Spain, France and Germany were declared ``low risk,'' 
although the government said Italy should work harder on health 
care, telecommunications and transportation issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada and Mexico, the U.S. border countries, also were graded  
low risk. The government said Mexico could experience local 
problems with its phone system, but added that adequate manual 
overrides were in place for electrical or water failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate's Year 2000  
Committee, complained that the State Department ``barely scratches 
the surface of serious Y2K problems facing many countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In making its assessments, the State Department looked  
specifically for potential problems with health care, 
communications, financial services or transportation -- all crucial 
for travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not our intention to impede travel or hinder tourism in  
any way,'' said John O'Keefe of the agency's office of 
undersecretary for management. ``Nor have these analyses been 
geared to reflect any political considerations or the nature of the 
relationship between the United States and any country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government cited a moderate risk of telephone and power  
failures in Israel, adding that the nation's thousands of cellular 
phone customers might be affected. Japan also was declared low 
risk, although the State Department urged travelers with special 
medical needs to take precautions because of inadequate computer 
repairs in the country's health care system. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the world's worst Year 2000 failures will occur  
overseas. A report Tuesday from the Office of Management and Budget 
said 97 percent of the U.S. government's most important computers 
at its largest agencies have been fixed. OMB estimated the total 
cost of government repairs at $8.34 billion, a slight increase from 
the $8.05 billion cited earlier in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The task of naming which countries were likely to suffer serious  
failures was so sensitive that State Department officials refused 
to discuss problems in specific countries or regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department also acknowledged that it warned foreign  
governments twice about how they would be graded before releasing 
the information to the American public. 
</P>
<P>
	The earliest drafts were finished more than three months ago,  
but not published until Tuesday -- with fewer than 17 weeks before 
year's end -- to give governments time to provide more information 
about computer repairs and to argue for more positive portrayals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to make sure the information was fairly reliable,''  
said O'Keefe, who acknowledged a ``very active dialogue'' with 
foreign governments about their grades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly don't know if they're unhappy or not,'' Herbert  
said. ``Even if they were, that's not what dictates what goes into 
the consular information sheets.''

<HEADLINE> Sheriff Probes How Handgun Obtained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Md. (AP) -- A sheriff blamed a lack of training and a  
misunderstanding with allowing a man with a protective order 
against him to buy a handgun he is suspected of using to fatally 
shoot his children last week. 
</P>
<P>
	State police were still looking for the 9 mm Smith and Wesson  
pistol Richard Spicknall II is thought to have used to kill Destiny 
Array Spicknall, 3, and Richard Spicknall III, 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, both still strapped in their safety seats, were  
found Thursday by roofers arriving for work at an unfinished home. 
The little boy was already dead, and Destiny died Friday in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say he shot the children at close range with the pistol  
he bought Sept. 2, then made up a story about how he was carjacked 
by an armed hitchhiker who sped away with the children. He was 
arrested after undergoing hours of questioning by officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Scuba divers were combing the bottom of the Choptank River, near  
Cambridge, Md., where Spicknall is thought to have thrown the 
pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities now say Spicknall should not have been able to buy  
the handgun because his estranged wife had obtained a restraining 
order against him last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard County Sheriff Charles Cave said his staff did not file a  
record of the protective order with a database where gun sellers 
check the backgrounds of would-be buyers because it was marked as a 
``consent'' order. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the understanding of this office that when marked with  
'consent,' the order would only be held on file,'' Cave said in a 
statement. ``We now know this is not the case. Whether or not a 
protective order is marked 'consent' or not, it should be on 
record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cave said the data processors who handle protective orders are  
not offered any formal training beyond being given a ``protective 
order manual'' by the state of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was their understanding that since it had the word consent  
on it, he was no longer prohibited from purchasing a gun,'' Chief 
Deputy Sheriff R. Scott Mergenthaler said. ``This case was strictly 
a human error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spicknall, 27, of Laurel was held without bail in the Talbot  
County jail.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Balks at Wearing Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN, Pa. (AP) -- A high school teacher who says his neck is  
painfully scarred because of surgery for Hodgkin's disease is suing 
to challenge a school dress code that requires him to wear a tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation 10 years ago left Anthony Slatcoff with  
``extensive rope-like scars, a source of extreme pain when wearing 
clothing that exerts pressure on the neck,'' according to his 
federal lawsuit against the Berlin-Brothersvalley school district. 
</P>
<P>
	The biology teacher wants a judge to order an exemption in the  
dress code for him. He went without a tie from Aug. 30 to Sept. 2 
at Berlin-Brothersvalley High and got verbal and written warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Slatcoff also has filed a discrimination charge with the Equal  
Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides are negotiating a settlement, said Wayne  
Henderson, the school district superintendent.

<HEADLINE> Miss America Pageant Changes Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) --The head of the Miss America  
Organization said today the pageant may back off plans to begin 
accepting competitors who had divorced or had abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first public statements about the change, pageant CEO  
Robert Beck said the board had agreed to defer implementing the new 
rules pending talks with state pageant operators who had objected 
to the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was possible that the old rules banning such women  
would remain intact, he said: ``That's always a possibility. I 
don't know what the endgame will be from the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck said the national organization planned to issue a statement  
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck's comments came a day after The Associated Press reported  
that the Miss America Pageant board voted in June to lift its ban 
on women who have been married or had abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionalists were furious.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked when I heard it,'' said Miss America 1993 Leanza  
Cornett. ``I was like `What?' Out of all of the things I could have 
expected, that is one I wouldn't think of in a million years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing contestants with divorces and abortions in their pasts  
will strip a time-honored gleam of virtue from their rhinestone 
tiaras, Miss Cornett said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still little girls out there who have who held Miss  
America and others like her up on a pedestal,'' she said. ``When 
you're sitting around the dinner table with your daughter or your 
little niece, it'll bring up so many questions. I'm shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For almost 50 years, contestants had signed a pledge vowing  
they've never been married or pregnant -- a rule enacted after Miss 
America 1949, Jacque Mercer, was married and divorced during her 
reign. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules would require simply that they sign a document  
saying ``I am unmarried'' and ``I am not pregnant and I am not the 
natural or adoptive parent of any child.'' The pageant is open to 
contestants age 17 through 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes were approved last month by the Miss America  
Organization in order to bring the pageant in line with New 
Jersey's discrimination laws, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The old rules have never been challenged in court or otherwise,  
according to Leonard Horn, a lawyer who served as general counsel 
from 1967 to 1987 and pageant CEO from 1987 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy was deemed to be ``reasonably necessary'' by the  
Miss America Organization board, according to Beck. ``These changes 
reflected MAO's conclusion that applicable laws prohibited the 
continuation of these requirements at the national level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an affidavit, Beck said state pageants would remain free to  
keep their eligibility rules the same, despite the change in the 
governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a state organization that refused to go along might  
risk losing its franchise because the national organization 
determines who gets to run the official state pageants. 
</P>
<P>
	The new state pageant contracts -- which Beck distributed to  
state directors in August notifying them of the change -- were met 
with some alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miss America has a long history of high moral standards and  
traditions, and I'm opposed to anything that changes that,'' said 
Libby Taylor, executive director of the Miss Kentucky Pageant and 
president of the National Association of Miss America State 
Pageants. 
</P>
<P>
	The state pageants went to court to fight the change, and the  
Miss America Organization agreed to back off for this year's 
pageant, scheduled for Saturday at Convention Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	But the board has approved the change to take effect next year.  
</P>
<P>
	As the wrangling continued, some current contestants said they  
were displeased with a seemingly common touch being added to a 
contest that celebrates the feminine ideal -- even in an age where 
one in two marriages fail, and abortion is controversial yet 
commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing Miss America does is she's a role  
model,'' said Lucy Ours, the reigning Miss West Virginia. ``If 
she's been married and divorced by age 24, people might not look at 
her as a very good role model.''

<HEADLINE> Trump Urged To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump says he may run for president as  
a Reform Party candidate out of respect for Minnesota Gov. Jesse 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Ventura, a former professional wrestler and a  
leader in the Reform Party, are said to be urging Trump to run as 
an alternative to the potential candidacy of Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants me to run for president, and I have a lot of  
respect for Jesse and the job he has done,'' Trump said Monday in a 
telephone interview from his New York office. ``When he asks to 
look at something, I'm going to consider it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say whether Ventura has actually urged him to  
run, though Trump has talked to the governor recently. But 
Ventura's backers are making it clear that Trump would be more 
suitable than Buchanan. And an official who has talked to both 
Trump and Ventura said the governor would prefer to see Trump run. 
</P>
<P>
	The official spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said Monday that he has had three conversations with  
Trump, and that ``he is starting to pique my interest a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he may end up being a good candidate for us, ''  
Ventura said, adding that he has read Trump's upcoming book and he 
believes Trump ``seems to parallel me a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a three-time Republican presidential candidate who is  
sagging in the 2000 presidential polls, is on the brink of bolting 
the GOP for the Reform Party. Trump's remarks set the stage for a 
potential clash between him and Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his views are prehistoric,'' Trump said of Buchanan.  
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, appearing on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' said he was  
``heading in that direction of running for the Reform Party 
nomination ... and we'll have a final decision by Oct. 15.'' He 
said he planned to call Reform Party founder Ross Perot this week 
or next week to discuss a possible party switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan also said he knew Trump but did not know whether Trump  
planned to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura too has said Buchanan's conservative views on social  
issues would not fit the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he was flattered by the attention, but he did not  
sound convinced that a presidential race was in his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would I want to run? That's not a bad question. When I  
look at people who have become president, they seem to go out not 
looking as good as they did going in,'' he said. ``So I really 
don't know at all, but it's something, out of respect for Jesse, 
I'll look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump provided few details about his position on national  
issues. Like Buchanan, he is opposed to the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. Asked about abortion, Trump said, ``It's too early 
to give those views.''

<HEADLINE> Environmental Group Backs Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite his carefully groomed image as a  
strong environmentalist, Al Gore lost the endorsement of an 
environmental group on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends of the Earth's political action committee instead  
endorsed Bill Bradley, citing his record as ``far superior'' to 
Gore's. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a wide range of water, toxics and public lands issues,  
Bradley has been a forceful champion,'' said Brent Blackwelder, 
president of Friends of the Earth PAC. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said Gore passed up the opportunity to take the lead  
on environmental issues and actually paved the way for ``Draconian 
erosions of existing environmental protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of rhetoric of what Gore was going to do, and  
he didn't follow through with that,'' said Friends of the Earth 
spokesman Mark Whiteis-Helm. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiteis-Helm listed protecting the ozone layer as one of Gore's  
failed opportunities. During Gore's tenure as vice president, the 
administration weakened the phase-out date for the chemical methyl 
bromide and opposed the stronger protection measures suggested by 
European nations, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends of the Earth gave the Clinton administration an average  
grade of ``D'' for its environmental record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disappointing to tell the American people who is the  
better candidate for the environment,'' since Gore has put 
environmental issues on the political agenda, said Whiteis-Helm. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing the two candidates while they served in the Senate --  
Bradley represented New Jersey and Gore was a Tennessee senator -- 
the vice president again falls short, the group said. It cited 
League of Conservation Voters rankings that gave Bradley a score of 
85.5 out of 100 on the environment compared to 66.5 for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement ``reflects the breadth of the work Bradley did  
on the environment in the sense of how much he accomplished in 
issues ranging from land conservation to clean waters,'' said 
Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore campaign declined comment on Friends of the Earth's  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore is committed to a balanced approach to making sure  
that American working families have a clean and healthy 
environment,'' Gore campaign Press secretary Kiki Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other environmental groups have not decided whom to endorse.  
</P>
<P>
	Organizations like the Sierra Club have complained that Gore  
hasn't done enough on issues like fuel efficiency in cars and the 
development of cleaner electricity sources. But they have made not 
indicated they will follow Friends of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Democratic candidates have better environmental policies  
than anyone that has ever been nominated by any party,'' said Carl 
Pope, executive director of The Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope said the two candidates were very similar in policy and  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``No administration has really provided the leadership that the  
challenges of the next century call for,'' said Pope. ``The 
question is which candidate will step up to those challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Friends of the Earth PAC probably won't give any money to  
Bradley, Whiteis-Helm said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably try to concentrate (the contributions) to  
closer and smaller races,'' Whiteis-Helm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends of the Earth is an environmental network operating in 63  
countries with 20,000 members in the U.S., compared to the Sierra 
Club's 600,000 members.

<HEADLINE> Justice Said Disclosed Tear Gas Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sifting through thousands of pages of  
documents provided four years ago to a congressional panel 
investigating the 1993 Waco tragedy, a House Democrat has turned up 
evidence that the Justice Department did notify Congress about the 
FBI's use of potentially incendiary tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	That evidence, Rep. Henry Waxman charged Monday, was overlooked  
by Rep. Dan Burton, the House Republican who is leading a new 
inquiry into the government's deadly standoff with the Branch 
Davidians -- and who has accused Attorney General Janet Reno and the 
Justice Department of possibly concealing the truth from Congress 
and the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no indication that Chairman Burton or his staff  
thought to review these documents before accusing the attorney 
general of a cover-up,'' Waxman, D-Calif., wrote in a letter to the 
special counsel investigating the recently revived Waco 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to the allegations of cover-up, substantial evidence  
of the use of military tear gas rounds was, in fact, provided to 
Congress in 1995,'' said Waxman, who is top Democrat on the House 
Government Reform Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, who chairs the committee, said the Justice Department  
buried the panel in an avalanche of documents shortly before the 
1995 hearings began, and congressional investigators depended on a 
Justice summary to guide them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Justice Department dumped 100,000 documents on the  
committee three days before the hearings, knowing that they 
couldn't possibly go through them,'' the Indiana Republican said in 
an interview. Although Burton was on the Government Reform 
Committee in 1995, he was not on the subcommittee that led the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton also noted that the Justice Department was forced to  
acknowledge last week that it failed in 1995 to give Congress the 
key page from a 1993 FBI lab report mentioning the use of military 
tear gas. The final page of that 49-page report, with the key tear 
gas mention, was missing, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's a coincidence,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Almost six out of 10 Americans believe the FBI has been  
intentionally trying to cover up its actions at Waco, an ABC News 
poll released Monday indicated. Only one out of five polled said 
they thought Reno should resign, based on what they now know. The 
poll of 1,008 adults was taken Sept. 8-12 and has an error margin 
of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The records Waxman cited, discovered among more than 40 boxes of  
material compiled during the earlier House hearings, include an FBI 
pilot's 1993 statement recalling a radio transmission in which 
agents had a conversation ``relative to the utilization of some 
sort of military round ... on a concrete bunker.'' And post-raid 
interview summaries include an unnamed FBI agent's explanation that 
smoke captured on film ``came from (an) attempt to penetrate bunker 
with one military and two (non-incendiary) rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Houston lawyer who is representing surviving Davidians in  
their upcoming wrongful-death lawsuit against the government, said 
the records offer little proof of candor by Justice and FBI 
officials in their earlier appearances on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is not whether anybody ever discussed the use of  
military rounds. The point is that representations were made that 
no pyrotechnic devices were used ... and unless you were a 
munitions expert, you would not know that military CS gas was 
necessarily a pyrotechnic device,'' said lawyer Michael Caddell. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the FBI's recent admission that a ``very limited number''  
of pyrotechnic rounds were fired, Justice and FBI officials had 
publicly denied the use of potentially incendiary tear gas. That 
about-face sparked congressional outrage and led Reno to appoint an 
outside investigator, former Sen. John Danforth. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, a Missouri Republican with solid credentials on  
Capitol Hill, said determining whether the government's actions 
triggered the inferno that ended the 51-day siege will be among the 
``dark questions'' his investigation will cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Cult leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during the  
blaze, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and Reno maintain that Davidians deliberately set the  
fire. They have said the pyrotechnic canisters bounced off the roof 
of a concrete bunker and rolled harmlessly into a field hours 
before the blaze began.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Extend Hill's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Outfielder Glenallen Hill agreed to a one-year  
contract extension Tuesday with the Chicago Cubs, hoping he can be 
part of a turnaround in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill has been one of the Cubs' most important backups, starting  
52 games in left field, right field and as a designated hitter. 
Hill has hit .332 with 14 homers and 42 RBIs as a starter, and 
contributed three pinch homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like where I'm at,'' said Hill, who also got a contract  
option for 2001. ``I love Chicago as a city. I love the stadium. I 
love the direction the team's trying to establish. I'm convinced 
they're moving in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After making the playoffs last season, the Cubs have fallen to  
last in the NL Central at 56-87. Hill is interested in seeing how 
many players the Cubs retain during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some good players on this team,'' he said. ``I think  
it's going to be a really a tough decision on what players they 
bring back. It's going to be very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill thinks the Cubs started to struggle in large part because  
Lance Johnson went on the disabled list June 20 with a strained 
abdomen. The Cubs were in second place at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	They went into a tailspin after losing Johnson, their leadoff  
hitter and center fielder. When he was activated on Aug. 21, the 
Cubs had fallen into last place. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really hurt this team was when we lost Lance Johnson,''  
Hill said. ``When we lost Lance, it took the sail out of our 
ship.''

<HEADLINE> Pele Explains '74 World Cup Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Soccer great Pele has revealed for  
the first time that he refused to play in the 1974 World Cup in 
Germany to protest torture by Brazil's military regime. 
</P>
<P>
	In a TV interview, Pele, 58, said he resisted pressure and  
threats from Brazil's ruling generals to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had left the national team in '71, and in '74 I was in good  
shape. But that story about torture made me desist,'' Pele said 
Sunday on the Bandeirantes TV network. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military tried to force me,'' he added. ``I was pressured  
with tax questions, but I decided to stick to my position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The armed forces seized power in a 1964 coup and held it until  
1985. Many real and suspected political adversaries were arrested, 
tortured and killed, especially between 1968 and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The period coincided with the golden age of Brazilian soccer,  
whose symbol was Pele. He was on the national teams that won the 
World Cup in 1958, 1962 and 1970, and the government used the team 
to improve its own popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he agreed to play in the World Cups of 1966 and 1970,  
when the military was in power, Pele replied: ``I didn't know what 
was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pele made his official farewell from the national team in 1971  
but continued to play for Santos until 1974, when he transferred to 
the New York Cosmos. In 1973, the military summoned him back to the 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the league's high scorer and they called me up. They  
came with insinuations,'' Pele said. ``I told them, if it were a 
war I would go, even as cannon fodder, because I'm Brazilian and 
this is my country. But it's a sport, it's soccer, it's the World 
Cup and I'm not going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Pele's absence from the Cup has been the subject of  
endless speculation. Brazil was eliminated in the semifinals by the 
legendary ``Clockwork Orange'' Dutch team of Johan Cruyff, which in 
turn lost to host West Germany in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Brazilians thought Pele's presence could have made the  
difference and earned the team its fourth Cup title, which didn't 
come until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The version that emerged was that Pele had a falling-out with  
Joao Havelange, the president of the Brazilian Soccer Federation 
and later head of FIFA, soccer's governing body. Havelange had sold 
marketing rights to Pele's image without the player's consent, and 
bad blood existed between them for years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mario Zagallo, who played on the 1958 and 1962 teams and was  
coach in 1970, 1974 and 1998, confirmed Pele's story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, those were the reasons,'' Zagallo said. ``Pele said it  
all.''

<HEADLINE> Campaigns Thrive in Current System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Congress considering legislation to  
regulate managed-care health plans, the health and insurance 
industries gave $3.3 million in unregulated soft money to the 
Republican and Democratic parties -- contributions that would be 
eliminated under legislation moving to the House floor this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP received $2.6 million and the Democrats $1.7 million  
from health and insurance interests, according to the advocacy 
group Common Cause. The banking and securities industries, pushing 
for legislation overhauling Depression-era banking regulations, 
gave $3 million to the GOP and $2.5 million to the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	That continues the Republican Party's traditional edge in soft  
money contributions, the unregulated amounts from labor unions, 
individuals and businesses that do not fall under contribution 
limits but cannot be used as direct aid to federal candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Party committees raised $30.7 million in soft money  
during the first half of 1999 compared with $24.5 million raised by 
Democratic committees, Common Cause said. During the 1998 
elections, the Republicans raised $131.6 million in soft money, 
compared with the Democrats' $92.8 million, Federal Election 
Commission records show. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have urged Republican lawmakers to defeat the  
campaign finance bill that would ban soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an alternative proposal, sponsored by Rep. John  
Doolittle, R-Calif., would not ban soft money but would eliminate 
federal funding of presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner for the  
2000 presidential nomination, reported last week that he had raised 
a record $49 million. Bush is not accepting public financing for 
his campaign, allowing him to avoid spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for publisher Steve Forbes, who is paying most of his  
campaign expenses himself, the other Republican candidates and both 
Democratic hopefuls are seeking federal funds to help finance their 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders, who oppose overhauling campaign  
finance laws, have flourished under the current system. Speaker 
Dennis Hastert of Illinois, and Majority Leader Dick Armey and 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, both of Texas, raised more than $3 million 
during the first six months of 1999 for their campaign committees 
and for the separate political action committees they control.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Inflation Worries / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices fell Tuesday on renewed  
inflation fears after a government report of unexpectedly strong 
retail sales in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong consumer demand for retail products can push prices  
higher stirring up inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 31/32  
point, or $9.68 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.12 percent from Monday's 6.05 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasurys got off to a bad start early in the trading session  
following the lead of the dollar, which continued its slide against 
the Japanese yen, despite another effort by the Bank of Japan to 
slow the yen's rise by buying dollars Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds also fell as the Commerce Department announced that retail  
sales rose 1.2 percent in August, well above economists' 
expectations of a 0.7 percent increase. The news renewed concerns 
among traders that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates for 
a third time this year in an effort to slow down the United States 
economy and stave off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders will have to contend with additional inflation-related  
news Wednesday, when the Consumer Price Index for August is 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 3/32 to 1/8 point,  
and intermediate maturities declined 1/4 to 7/16 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.81 percent as the  
discount rose 0.02 percentage point from Monday's weekly auction to 
4.68 percent. Six-month yields were 5.11 percent, as the discount 
fell 0.01 percentage point from the auction to 4.91 percent. 
One-year yields were 5.26 percent as the discount rose by 0.02 
percentage point from late Monday to 4.99 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged at 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/2 point to 113 1/8. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.86 percent from 5.82 percent.

<HEADLINE> Navratilova Nominated for Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- Martina Navratilova heads the nominees to  
be voted on for election to the International Tennis Hall of Fame 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall's Enshrinee Nominating Committee selected Navratilova,  
Malcolm Anderson, Nancye Wynn Bolton and Mervyn Rose to be included 
on the ballot in the player category. Robert Kelleher and the late 
Derek Hardwick were nominated for their contributions to tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1956, Navratilova became a  
U.S. citizen on July 21, 1981. She turned pro in 1973 and retired 
in 1994 after being ranked No. 1 in the world in singles for a 
total of 331 weeks and No. 1 in doubles from Dec. 21, 1986, through 
Jan. 22, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander holds the record for most match victories in  
both singles and doubles, with 1,438 singles victories and 1,111 in 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, Anderson became the first unseeded player to win the  
United States singles championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolton, like Anderson a native of Australia, won 20 Australian  
titles including the singles, doubles and mixed doubles in both 
1947 and '48. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was a member of Australia's winning Davis Cup in 1951 and  
'52, and was ranked in the top 10 in the world in singles in 
1953-55 and '57-58. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardwick, former president of both the Lawn Tennis Association  
and the International Tennis Federation, served as chairman of the 
Men's International Professional Tennis Council, the governing body 
of men's tennis prior to the advent of the ATP Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher, president of the United States Tennis Association, was  
a primary force behind the establishment of open tennis in America. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of international tennis media will vote on Navratilova,  
the only recent player nominee, while the International Masters 
Panel will vote on the others. Those selected will be officially 
inducted into the Hall of Fame in Newport on July 15.

<HEADLINE> MGM Reclaims Some Broadcast Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- MGM, making plans to launch a cable or  
satellite TV network, is regaining some broadcast rights to about 
800 movies it licensed to Turner Broadcasting System. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio said Tuesday it will reclaim full television rights  
to 200 titles and is getting non-exclusive rights on the other 600. 
MGM will be able to air the movies as early as next September on 
any network the studio owns or operates. 
</P>
<P>
	Films that MGM and Turner will share include ``West Side  
Story,'' ``Annie Hall'' and ``The Magnificent Seven.'' Films it 
will regain exclusively include ``Lenny'' and some of the ``Pink 
Panther'' movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner swapped the film rights in exchange for an extension of  
up to two years on its broadcast rights to the 600 titles it will 
share. Under the 1990 licensing deal, Turner's rights to those 
movies were to expire at various times between 2000 and 2007.

<HEADLINE> Jury Views Dragging Death Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- Dentures, clothing and other personal items  
belonging to a black man dragged to death were shown Tuesday to 
jurors who must decide if a second white supremacist should be 
convicted of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoes, a wallet, a watch and shirts belonging to James Byrd Jr.  
and found along the road where he was killed were entered into 
evidence in the second day of testimony in the capital murder trial 
of Lawrence Russell Brewer, 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County Sheriff's Detective Tommy Robinson, who was  
summoned to Huff Creek Road northeast of Jasper in east Texas on 
June 7, 1998, described what he found. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see where a vehicle had left and appeared to be  
dragging something behind it,'' Robinson said. ``It looked like a 
large animal dragged down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, accompanied by another detective, reached the remains  
of a human body that was blocking the end of the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a badly disfigured adult black male body, laying in the  
main portion of the road, feet pointing west, missing a right arm, 
neck and head,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Backtracking along the nearly 3-mile dragging route, they found  
a human head and dentures, then followed the logging road where 
they found beer bottles, a nut driver tool, clothing and other 
items, including a wallet containing the 49-year-old Byrd's 
identification cards and cigarette butts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence was the same used in the February trial of John  
William King, 24, the first of three men accused of Byrd's slaying 
to be convicted and sent to death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer also could get the death penalty if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	A lighter also discovered and entered into evidence Tuesday was  
engraved with the name ``Possum'' and an interlocking insignia of 
three K's, a symbol of the Ku Klux Klan. King's nickname in prison 
was Possum. 
</P>
<P>
	In the King trial, DNA evidence linked the bottles and cigarette  
butts to all three white men. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's lawyer Layne Walker asked Robinson why he did not  
change his plastic gloves after picking up each piece of evidence. 
Walker argued that could have led to evidence contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The third man charged in the slaying and awaiting trial is Shawn  
Allen Berry, also 24. The name ``Berry'' was scratched on the tool 
found at the logging road. 
</P>
<P>
	King and Brewer had served time together in prison. Prosecutors  
say it was there that King was schooled by Brewer in white racist 
beliefs and hatred of blacks that led to Byrd's slaying.

<HEADLINE>  Sutton Gets New Lease on Life, Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Hal Sutton sat alone in the lobby of a Toronto hotel before the  
sun rose on the day after his 11th career PGA Tour victory, a 
newspaper in his lap as he waited for a shuttle bus to take him to 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi won the U.S. Open.  
</P>
<P>
	The New Orleans Saints won their NFL opener.  
</P>
<P>
	Oh, and a 41-year-old Louisiana man with a new lease on life and  
unwavering confidence won the Canadian Open. Sutton got to the golf 
section and kept flipping the pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything good there in there about you?'' a hotel guest asked  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton smiled but ignored the question. There was a time when  
reading too many stories about himself, about whether he really was 
the next Jack Nicklaus, led to a slump so severe it nearly caused 
him to find a new career during what should have been his prime. 
</P>
<P>
	He went eight years without winning, 12 years before he actually  
felt anywhere near the same man who won The Players Championship 
and the PGA Championship at 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through a stretch where everybody thought I was ... not  
living up to everybody else's expectations,'' he once said. ``I was 
letting people influence my thinking. So I started trying to make 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have kept doing what Hal Sutton knew how to do,'' he  
added. ``I should have been myself instead of trying to become 
someone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twin daughters born in January and another daughter who turns 3  
in November make Sutton feel younger than he is. Nothing turns back 
the clock like winning, especially the way he dissected a difficult 
Glen Abbey course in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of tournament that reminds people how good  
Sutton was, and still is, and why he may be one of the most 
reliable players for captain Ben Crenshaw when that little 
exhibition with Europe rolls around next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton has gone a dozen years between Ryder Cups, another price  
he had to pay for his midlife crisis. Losing made him tougher, more 
disciplined. He was so desperate to win he stopped caring about the 
credentials he once carried. 
</P>
<P>
	That might not be a bad example for teammates to follow if they  
don't want to see Europe load the Ryder Cup onto the Concorde after 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience is always a factor if you're going to succeed,''  
Sutton said. ``But there is a lot more that factors into succeeding 
at the Ryder Cup. We're all going to have to reach down inside and 
do a little gut-check, and decide how bad we want this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American team is stacked once again, loaded with the kind of  
can't-miss talent Sutton possessed in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	All of their players are top 30 in the world rankings, seven of  
them have won major championships. The only rookie is David Duval, 
who happens to be the second-best player in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, only four Americans have ever played on a winning Ryder  
Cup team, a list that does not include Sutton. The pressure will 
never be greater than at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure?  
</P>
<P>
	For Sutton, that was taking his one-time exemption from the  
career money list to keep his playing privileges in 1993, a time 
when he was hitting the ball so poorly he was embarrassed to be 
seen on driving range next to the best players in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But he reached inside, pulled himself out of the pit and now has  
one more score to settle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton played in the 1985 and 1987 matches, which each carry a  
dubious footnote -- one was the worst U.S loss in Ryder Cup history, 
the other was the first U.S. loss on home soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been on two talented teams,'' he said. ``I have been on  
two experienced teams. And we came out of there losers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has watched the past five matches on television and saw a  
familiar theme -- the United States was better on paper, Europe was 
better on grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can write it from as many different angles as you want as  
to why we haven't gotten it done or whatever else,'' he said. ``I 
think it's going to have to come from inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton has been relatively quiet about the Ryder Cup. But a  
victory in his final tuneup before the matches had him champing at 
the bit, even when the delicate issue of Ryder Cup revenue was 
broached. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I've got to say about that is I hope we've all  
pulled together, and we're there for one common denominator, which 
is to win that Ryder Cup back -- whether we get paid to do it, or 
whether we have to pay them to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next Nicklaus?  
</P>
<P>
	No, just a man who has experienced his share of misery and wants  
to make sure it doesn't happen again.

<HEADLINE> NASA Evacuates Kennedy Space Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Just over 100 workers volunteered to  
stay behind at the evacuated Kennedy Space Center on Tuesday to 
ride out Hurricane Floyd, which NASA feared could destroy the 
launch pads and shuttle hangars. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had warned the storm could pass 40 miles offshore,  
bringing wind of 114 mph. By late Tuesday, however, the National 
Hurricane Center said the eye would likely remain 100 miles off the 
coast, with less severe winds inland. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA evacuated its approximately 12,500 workers Monday and  
closed down the space center. It also reduced its skeleton staff to 
102, instead of the usual 120. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody else is gone. It's kind of eerie out here,'' NASA  
spokesman George Diller, one of the volunteers, said by telephone 
from a fortified building at the space center. ``I kind of can feel 
the concern growing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA feared not only the wind, but the storm surge. The space  
center is only 9 feet above sea level. And its space shuttle 
hangars and launch pads are designed to withstand wind of no more 
than 125 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	All four shuttles, worth $2 billion apiece, are parked indoors.  
At the nearby Cape Canaveral Air Station, four rockets stood 
exposed on launch pads. 
</P>
<P>
	The next shuttle mission is scheduled for the end of October but  
will probably be delayed because of the interruption in work.

<HEADLINE> Judge Told To Rethink Marijuana Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The dark judicial clouds hovering over  
California's medical marijuana clubs may have lightened -- but only 
just a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told a federal  
judge to rethink his absolute ban on drug distribution at some 
northern California marijuana clubs, and consider an exemption for 
patients who show a serious medical need and no legal alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not as broad, the court's language was consistent with a  
1996 California initiative allowing patients with a doctor's 
recommendation to possess and use marijuana for serious illnesses 
without prosecution under state law. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also consistent with medical marijuana laws in four other  
states -- Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Alaska -- in the nine-state 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	For those states -- and Nevada, which is considering a similar  
law -- the ruling appears to recognize a defense of ``medical 
necessity:'' the need to violate the federal drug law in order to 
prevent a more serious harm. 
</P>
<P>
	That conflicts with a U.S. Justice Department argument that no  
claim of necessity could justify use of a drug federally classified 
as dangerous and having no approved medical purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, we have a clear ruling that the federal  
Controlled Substances Act is not an absolute bar to the 
distribution of medical cannabis,'' said Gerald Uelmen, a Santa 
Clara University law professor and lawyer for the Oakland Cannabis 
Buyers' Cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department did not return a telephone call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical marijuana clubs sprang up around California after the  
November 1996 approval of Proposition 215, which allowed patients 
with serious illnesses to obtain and use marijuana if their doctors 
approved. The drug is used to relieve pain and other effects of 
AIDS, cancer and certain other diseases and their treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department responded by suing six northern  
California clubs, saying the absolute federal ban on marijuana 
distribution overrode the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer agreed, issuing a contempt  
order last year that forced four of the clubs to stop distributing 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the clubs, in Fairfax and Ukiah, remain open because the  
government failed to present evidence that they were distributing 
marijuana at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Other informal organizations scattered around the state also  
continue to supply medicinal marijuana. The Oakland club also has 
resumed limited operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 3-0 ruling, the court said the government ``has yet to  
identify any interest it may have in blocking the distribution of 
marijuana to those with medical needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said the government ``has offered no evidence to rebut  
(a marijuana club's) evidence that cannabis is the only effective 
treatment for a large group of seriously ill individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court said patients would have to show they faced imminent  
harm, from a serious medical condition, and have found that legal 
alternatives to marijuana don't work or cause intolerable side 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Breyer would be justified in granting the  
exception, but did not order it issued.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Testimony Contradictory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Federal investigators have grown pessimistic that  
witness testimony can provide concrete answers into what caused the 
deadly collision between an Amtrak train and a truck in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board is searching for clues  
into the crash that left 11 passengers dead and 122 injured after a 
truck was struck by the City of New Orleans train in Bourbonnais, 
about 50 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day hearing into the March 15 crash continues today  
with testimony from Amtrak executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was a day of conflicting testimony.  
</P>
<P>
	Luis A. Nieves, who testified he was driving the second of two  
cars stopped behind John R. Stokes' tractor-trailer, said through 
an interpreter that he saw warning lights and heard bells as Stokes 
drove through the railroad crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieves said he also saw a crossing gate strike Stokes' truck as  
he attempted to drive it around the barrier, shortly before it was 
struck in the rear by the train. 
</P>
<P>
	But truck driver Aubrey Fosburgh, who was picking up cargo about  
75 to 100 yards from the crash site, said the crossing gate was up 
when Stokes crossed the railroad, adding that he ``never (saw) the 
gate down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also described the ball of flame that shot into the air  
shortly after the crash. ``It was a mess,'' Fosburgh said, who 
rushed to the scene to help passengers escape a mangled train car. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflicting accounts did little to clear up two key  
questions: Was Stokes trying to drive his fully loaded truck around 
the railroad's crossing gates and beat the oncoming locomotive? Or 
did the crossing's warning signals activate too late -- or not at 
all -- leaving him unaware that the train was rumbling toward him at 
79 mph? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that there's anything that is clear one way or  
another as a result of today,'' said George Black, the NTSB member 
who is chairing the hearing into the fiery collision. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the NTSB probably won't make any final determinations  
until March. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, who was not hurt in the crash, refused to testify  
Monday. He told authorities after the crash that he didn't see the 
train approaching, and claimed the crossing's warning bells, lights 
and gates activated after he was on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony Monday, train engineer Angel Flores said he  
sounded the whistle and activated the emergency braking system as 
the train neared the truck, but said he didn't remember whether 
lights at the crossing were flashing.

<HEADLINE> FCC Denying Bells' Rivals Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bell companies will not be required to give  
rivals access to equipment used for high-speed Internet services 
but will still have to lease them key elements of their phone 
networks, under action expected Wednesday by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is taking another shot at  
rules that open up the local phone market by requiring the Bells 
and other major local carriers to give competitors access to parts 
of their networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance companies and other upstart competitors had also  
sought access to the local phone companies' equipment that delivers 
advanced telecommunications services. They argued that such 
equipment is need so they can roll out high-speed Internet services 
more quickly to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	If adopted, the rules will still enable competitors to lease  
certain components from major local phone carriers so they can 
provide local service without having to build their own facilities. 
A 1996 telecommunications law envisioned this as one way to spur 
more entrants into the local market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are telling companies that the elements you came to rely  
on, you are still going to have those to rely on,'' FCC Chairman 
Bill Kennard said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One piece consists of the wires that run from local phone  
company offices to homes and businesses. These are the most crucial 
network elements because they would be very expensive to duplicate. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an effort to get high-speed Internet services out to  
consumers more quickly, Kennard said the commission doesn't intend 
to force the Bells and others to grant their rivals access to 
equipment used for such advanced services. 
</P>
<P>
	This will give incumbent phone companies an incentive to invest  
in high-speed Internet services in the face of competition from 
others like cable companies who are offering such access over their 
lines, Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Kennard said, new competitors will have an  
incentive to invest in their own equipment for providing these 
Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are creating the conditions for lots of companies to get  
out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC originally developed a list of items -- which did not  
include advanced services -- that local companies had to make 
available in 1996. The Supreme Court eventually sent the rules back 
to the commission, saying that the FCC did not adequately consider 
whether competitors could obtain the pieces from another source. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said the commission has gone back to provide  
justification for its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those rules have worked. They are going to stay in place,''  
Kennard said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Examines Grocery Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ever wonder why some foods get prime placement  
on supermarket shelves while other products are stacked practically 
out of reach? 
</P>
<P>
	The short answer? Money. So much of it, in fact, that a Senate  
panel is exploring the issue of grocery industry ``slotting fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Small Business Committee said its investigation of  
the practice found evidence suggesting that small businesses suffer 
because of food makers that spend millions of dollars to muscle 
competing products off store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a small business that can't scrape together the  
huge amounts needed to compete with other manufacturers might not 
get its product to market, which troubles Sen. Christopher Bond, 
R-Mo., the committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond said the fees are a barrier that keeps some small  
businesses from ever getting their products sold in some markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retail shelf space is some of the most expensive real estate  
that money can buy,'' he asserted at a hearing today on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, the panel's senior Democrat,  
said there is a ``legitimate question'' as to whether slotting fees 
fit the country's standard of free and open competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``At best such a practice would seem ... suspicious,'' he said.  
``Why does a business have to pay a fee to reserve space on a 
shelf?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A supermarket trade group defended the fees, saying small  
businesses would actually be in a worse position without the 
practice, which has existed for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	A common fee quoted is $5,000 per item, per store, but it can be  
as low as $10,000 per item for an entire chain, according to a 
committee background paper prepared for today's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Slotting fees total at least $9 billion annually, said Gregory  
Gundlach, a University of Notre Dame business professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said they limit consumer choice by reducing the variety  
of available products and may lead to higher retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Orfield, a committee spokesman, said the panel was getting  
involved because of possible antitrust concerns and numerous 
complaints about the practice from small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
	John Motley, the Food Marketing Institute's senior vice  
president for government and public affairs, said slotting fees are 
a necessary marketing practice, given the high cost to retailers of 
putting a new product on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers and retailers typically negotiate the fee.  
</P>
<P>
	Four out of five new products fail, said Motley, whose  
association represents 21,000 retail food stores. The typical 
supermarket stocks 30,000 products out of the more than 100,000 
available to choose from, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have empty shelf space, so when somebody introduces a  
new product, in order to sell it or display it, we have to displace 
products that are selling,'' Motley said. ``We have to take a 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slotting fees are meant to offset that risk.  
</P>
<P>
	Without them, smaller retailers and suppliers would likely lose  
the battle against established food industry giants that have ample 
budgets to advertise and promote their products through coupons and 
other means, Motley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some retailers won't accept the fees, and some manufacturers  
refuse to pay them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a practice that manufacturers use to say to the  
retailer, 'We believe that this new product is going to do well and 
we stand behind it and we're willing to help you offset the cost of 
putting it on your shelf,''' Motley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill James, senior vice president for industry affairs at the  
Grocery Manufacturers of America, said the association generally 
dislikes the fees but doesn't tell members how to market their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little different than just a payment for shelf space,''  
said James, whose group represents about 90 percent of all 
supermarket goods.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Sets Quarterly Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit soared to another  
record high, but the overall economy remained unfazed as consumers 
went on a buying binge in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that retail sales  
jumped 1.2 percent last month, the biggest increase in six months, 
as consumers snapped up new cars, furniture and clothing at a rapid 
clip. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second report, the government said the U.S. current account  
trade deficit climbed to an all-time high of $80.7 billion in the 
April-June quarter of this year. That was up 17.5 percent from a 
first-quarter deficit of $68.7 billion, the previous record. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets took a nosedive on the stronger-than-expected  
retail sales figures. Investors fear the surge in consumer spending 
-- fully two-thirds of the total U.S. economy -- increases the 
likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a 
third time in October. It would act on the principle that rapid 
economic growth normally triggers inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 120 points to close at  
10,910. Bond prices, which are sensitive to inflation fears, also 
fell, pushing the yield on Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond up to 
6.11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar skidded to its lowest level against the Japanese yen  
since May 1996 as investors worried anew about America's huge trade 
deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.2 percent rise in retail sales was almost double what  
private economists expected and followed a 1 percent July advance. 
It called into question forecasts that the economy would slow 
significantly in the second half of this year as two rate increases 
from the Fed and rising mortgage rates were expected to take a toll 
on interest-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are continuing to buy anything and everything,''  
said Mark Zandi, economist at Regional Financial Associates in West 
Chester, Pa. ``Aggressive consumer spending has been the principal 
source of the economy's growth, and it is continuing to drive the 
economy forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zandi said the big retail sales figure for August probably will  
tip the Fed into raising rates at their Oct. 5 meeting, especially 
if Wednesday's report on consumer inflation points to worrisome 
signs of increased price pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales were powered last month by a second big monthly  
increase in auto sales, which climbed 2.5 percent. So far this 
year, U.S. auto sales are on track to beat the 1986 record of 16.1 
million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Even excluding autos, retail sales showed surprising strength,  
rising by 0.7 percent, also almost double economists' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales jumped 0.7 percent at furniture stores; clothing stores  
posted a 1.3 percent gain; hardware stores enjoyed a 1.3 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union bank economist Mark Vitner noted that retail sales  
are up 10.6 percent from the level a year ago, a sizable gain 
normally ``associated with the beginnings of an economic expansion, 
not one closing in on its ninth anniversary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The huge sales gains were attributed to strong consumer  
confidence, bolstered by the high-flying stock market and an 
unemployment rate hovering near a three-decade low of 4.2 percent 
for most of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``With these positive economic indicators still in place, we can  
expect the fall and holiday seasons to be very successful,'' said 
Rosalind Wells, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The robust consumer sector has offset the drag from trade, where  
manufacturers and farmers have suffered from loss of export markets 
caused by steep recessions overseas after the Asian currency 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first half of this year, the current account trade  
deficit has been running at an annual rate of $299 billion, far 
above last year's record of $220.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account is the broadest measure of trade because it  
tracks not only goods and services but also investment flows and 
U.S. foreign aid payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The second quarter showed deterioration in all areas with the  
goods deficit widening as a slight rise in exports was swamped by a 
big jump in imports, led by sharply higher foreign oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Artist Plans Jerusalem Ice Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- An artist who creates fantastically colored works  
of glass and plastic is sending 64 tons of ice blocks from an 
Alaskan well to Jerusalem, where they will be stacked into a 
60-foot-long wall just outside the Old City. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Chihuly's vision is that tensions in the Middle East  
someday will melt like his ice wall in the desert sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The wall, of course, will come down much faster than barriers  
between Jews and Arabs in Israel -- Chihuly's creation should take 
about a week to melt after it is installed on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chihuly believes the message will be clear.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think it will make people feel good. Jerusalem is  
still pretty divided, east and west,'' Chihuly said recently in his 
studio in Seattle. ``This happens to be right on the border. It 
could bring together Jews, Muslims and Christians from different 
parts of the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chihuly still hasn't decided on the form the 20-foot-tall wall  
will take. Some portions probably will be collapsed, and the big 
blocks will be fused together using dry ice. The wall will be lit 
by 4,500-watt airport landing lights at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything changes -- color, form,'' as the ice melts, he said.  
The wall initially will be transparent, but over time ``the sun 
will make it more textured, more milky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chihuly, 57, whose own glass-blowing days ended in 1976 when he  
lost an eye in a car accident, oversees a Renaissance-style studio 
operation in Seattle, where dozens of glass artists execute his 
visions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unmistakable with his electric ragdoll hair and black eye patch,  
he spins his dreams of light and color in a rambling Lake Union 
boathouse crammed with workers, friends, and family. 
</P>
<P>
	Chihuly, whose works also have dangled over the canals of  
Venice, lived in an Israeli kibbutz in 1962 and ``always liked the 
idea of ice in the desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So for his latest work, he decided on Jerusalem, where a  
yearlong exhibit of his work at the Tower of David Museum -- 
featuring thousands of pieces of colored and shaped glass -- has 
drawn 200,000 visitors since July. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit includes the Blue Tower, a fanciful 46-foot pillar  
made of hundreds of undulating kelp-like pieces, delicate 
chandeliers, iridescent and brightly colored spheres and oblongs, 
and forests of glass spears. 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail to Chihuly's studio, Israeli singer Noa Asher said  
that since ``the Glass Magician ... set foot in the holy land, 
people have been obsessed with color and beauty rather than hatred 
and war. Now that's an achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the wall, Chihuly took ice from a well in an Alaskan quarry  
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The blocks were loaded into refrigerated trucks and then hauled  
by rail to Anchorage, Alaska, barged to Tacoma, Wash., taken by 
train to New Jersey and then put aboard a ship that arrives Friday 
at the Israeli port of Ashdod. From there it will be trucked to 
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Punitive Damages Eyed Vs. Swissair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Lawyers for Swissair are asking a federal  
judge to decide whether families of people killed in last year's 
crash off Nova Scotia are entitled to punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The families have asked U.S. District Judge James T. Giles to  
reject a settlement package worth about $300 million because it 
would limit an estimated $1 billion in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs argue that such an agreement would keep the  
families from learning the full extent of any potential misconduct 
involved in the September 1998 crash that killed 229 people. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Swissair attorneys asked U.S. Giles to determine  
whether damages could be limited under the Death on the High Seas 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The law only allows for the recovery of compensatory damages, or  
real losses associated with income and medical costs, and not 
punitive damages. Both sides agreed that the act, which Congress 
passed in 1920, does not define the term ``high seas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs argued that the act does not apply because the  
crash occurred within the territorial waters of Canada, while 
Swissair lawyers said it applies in any waters at least one marine 
league (about three miles) from the U.S. coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair Flight 111 was bound from New York to Geneva when it  
plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on Sept. 2, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Baylor Reeling After Wacky Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- The sound was unforgettable at Floyd Casey  
Stadium when Baylor was jolted by an improbable last-play loss for 
the second straight week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of weird to hear 30,000 jaws drop at the same  
time,'' said Joe Jackson, a sophomore center. ``That was really 
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone associated with Baylor's program is having a tough time  
dealing with the Bears' 0-2 start, especially considering the 
circumstances of Saturday's bizarre 27-24 loss to UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
	With less than 20 seconds to play, Baylor had a three-point lead  
and the ball inside the Rebels 10. But instead of having his 
quarterback take a knee and run out the clock, first-year coach 
Kevin Steele elected to go for one more score by calling a running 
play. The Bears paid the price when Darrel Bush fumbled into the 
end zone and UNLV's Kevin Thomas returned it for a game-winning 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor kicker Kyle Atteberry, who missed an extra point on the  
last play of overtime in the Bears' opening-week loss to Boston 
College, said it has taken several days for the reality of the 
sudden UNLV loss to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was just shocked,'' Atteberry said. ``You've got to  
go through some personal time of mourning, but you've only got a 
short while to think about it because we play again this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Bears are trying to pick up the pieces in time to  
salvage what they insist can still be a successful season. Players 
and coaches all said that process starts with forgetting about the 
past two weeks, even though questions about the losses are sure to 
follow them the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele, who took full responsibility for Saturday's defeat and  
called it ``a stupid mistake on my part,'' said Tuesday he will no 
longer talk with the media about the final play of the UNLV game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have rectified it as a team,'' Steele said. ``We've  
challenged each other, it's been a great bonding experience, and 
it's over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Steele has received criticism from the public about his  
decision to run the ball on the last play, he has received nothing 
but support from the Baylor players and assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Even defensive coordinator Brick Haley, whose unit wasn't on the  
field when the game-winning touchdown occurred, said he agreed with 
Steele's call. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you question what happened on that last play, that's like  
taking the sword out of these guys' hands,'' Haley said. ``We say 
we want to build an attitude, and you can't do that by taking a 
knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush hasn't spoken to the media since his costly fumble, but his  
running backs coach, former Nebraska quarterback Tommie Frazier, 
said he and the rest of the players are eager to put the loss 
behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things like this are toughest on the players, and they're  
taking it in stride,'' Frazier said. ``So if the players aren't 
hanging their heads, then the coaches won't either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the crushing finishes of their first two games, the  
Bears already have shown dramatic improvement from their 2-9 season 
in 1998. Last year, Baylor ranked 98th or lower nationally in five 
major categories, including total offense and total defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele, who spent the past six seasons as a linebackers coach  
for the Carolina Panthers, said he thinks the Bears' steadily 
increasing confidence on both sides of the ball eventually will 
outweigh any lingering effects from the early losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``For football players, it's second nature to put bad things  
behind you, or you don't stand a chance,'' Steele said. ``These 
guys know that. We've just had too much practice at it.''

	The storm reportedly lashed San Salvador and Cat Island in the  
eastern section of the 600-mile chain of more than 700 islands. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, strong winds rocked moving cars and kicked up sand  
and surf that delighted some die-hards still frolicking in the 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been this scared about a storm,'' said shopkeeper  
Angel Chea as she hastily boarded up her windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which  
features top sustained winds of 156 mph with higher gusts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's capable of almost catastrophic destruction,'' said Todd  
Kimberlain, a forecaster at the U.S. National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, Hurricane Andrew was a Category 4 storm when it  
struck South Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an 
estimated $25 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's eye was likely to pass over Eleuthera Island at 4 a.m.,  
meteorologists said -- but residents there were feeling the effect 
by early evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's fruit flying all over the place, and it's already  
uprooted small trees in my garden,'' said Geoff Pearce of 
Eleuthera, before phone lines there went silent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Nassau residents were already in hurricane shelters.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be caught in the rush,'' said Margaret Bastian  
of Nassau, as she settled into a shelter with a blanket, a pillow 
and a small bag full of food. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm interrupted airline flights, cruises and shipping  
traffic between the United States and the Caribbean. American 
Airlines on Monday canceled its nine daily flights between southern 
Florida and its hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, while both Carnival 
Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines sent Bahamas-bound 
ships to Mexico instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamian officials warned that storm surges of up to 20 feet  
could sweep as far as six miles inland. That's a terrifying 
prospect on this island of New Providence, which is only seven 
miles from north to south. 
</P>
<P>
	``God is the only one who can help us now,'' said Nassau  
resident Mildred Minnis. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under  
hurricane warnings Monday night, as was all of the mainland Florida 
east coast from Florida City to just south of Brunswick, Georgia. 
Tropical storm warnings were posted for the southeastern Bahamas, 
the nearby British Turks and Caicos islands and parts of the 
Florida Keys. A hurricane watch was in effect for the Georgia coast 
from Brunswick to Savannah and is expected to be extended to South 
Carolina in the night. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, the Bahamian capital, long lines formed at gasoline  
stations and grocery stores and two major supermarkets ran out of 
bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamian schools were converted into hurricane shelters, and  
officials planned to close Nassau's airport later Monday. 
Organizers canceled a parade to welcome home Bahamian track runners 
from the Outdoor World Championship in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't ask those girls to come from a safe place to an  
unsafe place,'' said Sports Minster Zhivargo Laing. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Salvador, a quiet resort island where Christopher  
Columbus is believed to have first landed in the New World, Riding 
Rock Inn manager Carter Williams said he moved all of his guests to 
a shelter at the nearby Church of God. ``I worked until about 2 
o'clock (a.m.) preparing for the hurricane,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The island's Club Med resort said some customers would wait out  
the storm at the resort. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. EDT, Floyd's center was 53 miles east of Eleuthera  
Island in the northwest Bahamas, which is 320 miles southeast of 
Miami. The National Weather Service in Miami reported the center at 
latitude 24.9 degrees north, longitude 75.3 degrees west. 
</P>
<P>
	It was moving west at 14 mph, but was expected to turn slightly  
northward later, cutting across the Bahamas and then arcing along 
the Florida peninsula beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the hurricane would likely rake across the Abacos  
Islands and Eleuthera, which were blasted last month by Hurricane 
Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was joined Monday by Hurricane Gert, which grew from a  
tropical storm to a hurricane with winds near 85 mph about 1,210 
miles east of the Leeward Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were also watching a strengthening cluster of storms  
about 800 miles southeast of Bermuda and said it could become a 
tropical depression or storm.

<HEADLINE> General Mills Cereals Go Bilingual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) -- Frutis and Cinnamon Corn Stars, the  
bilingual cousins of Cheerios and Lucky Charms, are part of a new 
effort effort by General Mills to cater to Hispanic consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Para Su Familia -- or For Your Family -- line began last month  
in Texas and New Mexico and could soon appear on supermarket 
shelves around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The line consists of four cereals: Frutis, Frosted Corn Flakes,  
Cinnamon Corn Stars and Raisin Bran. Bilingual packaging and 
lightly sweetened tastes set them apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hispanic consumer is definitely a growing market,'' said  
Lydia Midness, director of General Mills' Big G cereal division. 
``We wanted to offer something specifically developed for 
Hispanics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boxes feature a purple logo with the words ``Productos de  
General Mills'' and ``Para Su Familia.'' Nutritional information is 
in English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	The new cereals also are lightly sweetened, reflecting the  
tastes of Hispanics who took part in focus groups. Frutis, for 
example, tastes like fruity Cheerios or a less sweet version of 
Kellogg's Fruit Loops. 
</P>
<P>
	By creating a new line of cereals, Golden Valley, Minn.-based  
General Mills can appeal to Hispanics adopting mainstream U.S. 
tastes, as well as non-assimilated Hispanics who might prefer the 
new cereals, said Michael Minor, a marketing professor at the 
University of Texas-Pan American.

<HEADLINE> Internet Taxes Fail to Catch Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If public opinion polls and Republican political  
leaders are any guide, efforts that would expand taxes to Internet 
commerce will meet with intense resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This idea is not a popular one in Congress or among the  
American people,'' three dozen House GOP lawmakers wrote in a 
letter to the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, which 
today continues its second of four planned meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, a poll released Tuesday by the Gallup Organization  
indicated that 36 percent of registered voters who actively use the 
Internet say they would be less likely to vote for a political 
candidate who supports taxes on Internet purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said they opposed an  
Internet sales tax, with only 14 percent in favor. The telephone 
survey polled 1,000 randomly chosen frequent Internet users between 
Aug. 26 and Aug. 31 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-member commission of business and government officials  
was created by Congress last year to recommend future tax policy on 
Internet business and is supposed to finalize recommendations by 
April. That same law imposed a three-year moratorium on new 
Internet taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP letter, signed by House Majority Leader Dick Armey and  
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, both of Texas, said many Republicans were 
troubled by indications that the panel was examining ``how to tax 
the Internet, rather than whether to tax the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers urged the panel to focus on the international  
implications of U.S. tax decisions and on how U.S. competitiveness 
might be affected by ``complex and excessive state and local taxes 
on e-commerce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You should also know that there are many members that will  
oppose any new taxes on the Internet,'' the GOP letter said. ``An 
academic exercise on new ways to tax the Internet is not productive 
and does not reflect the intent of Congress in establishing the 
commission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a position puts the House Republicans at odds with many  
state and local government officials, who fear growth in Internet 
commerce will siphon away sales tax and other revenue needed for 
schools, roads, fire protection and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If state and local governments lose billions, be assured  
county governments will have to increase property taxes or income 
taxes to make up the difference -- or cut essential community 
services,'' said Larry Naake, executive director of the National 
Association of Counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the panel's chairman, Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore of  
Virginia, said he did not detect a ``steamroll'' moving the 
commission one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that there is yet a building consensus,'' Gilmore  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A major question for the commission, and ultimately for  
Congress, is whether to devise a way for states and local 
governments to require collection of sales taxes on Internet 
purchases across state borders. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that only Congress can force  
companies to collect and remit sales taxes unless the firm has 
``nexus'' in that state -- a store, a warehouse, or some other 
physical presence. This applies to catalog operations as well as 
Internet commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Some proponents of sales tax reform say there are ways to  
develop software that would allow companies to collect sales taxes 
based on the destination of the goods purchased. Meanwhile, Sen. 
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., has introduced a bill in Congress to 
impose a 5 percent national sales tax on all remote sales, 
including Internet and catalog.

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Floyd Menaces Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Panicked Bahamas residents abandoned  
beachfront homes and scrambled for emergency supplies Monday as 
mammoth Hurricane Floyd's 155 mph winds bore down on the 
vulnerable, low-lying archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy winds and rain pelted the Bahamian capital of Nassau. It  
was moving on a path that could deliver Florida its hardest storm 
strike in years by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm reportedly lashed San Salvador and Cat Island in the  
eastern section of the 600-mile chain of more than 700 islands.

	``God is the only one who can help us now,'' said Nassau  
resident Mildred Minnis. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under  
hurricane warnings Monday night, as was all of the mainland Florida 
east coast from Florida City to just south of Brunswick, Georgia. 
Tropical storm warnings were posted for the southeastern Bahamas, 
the nearby British Turks and Caicos islands and parts of the 
Florida Keys. A hurricane watch was in effect for the Georgia coast 
from Brunswick to Savannah and is expected to be extended to South 
Carolina in the night. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, the Bahamian capital, long lines formed at gasoline  
stations and grocery stores and two major supermarkets ran out of 
bottled water.

<HEADLINE> Savannah Protecting Historic Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- Thousands were evacuated Tuesday from this  
coastal city to escape Hurricane Floyd, leaving behind Georgia's 
most picturesque and historic downtown, with its antebellum 
mansions, lush public squares and century-old oaks dripping with 
Spanish moss. 
</P>
<P>
	Savannah's haunting beauty makes it Georgia's second most  
popular tourist destination, behind Stone Mountain. Tourists come 
to visit places they have read about in ``Midnight in the Garden of 
Good and Evil'' or seen in movies such as ``Forrest Gump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So while city officials said their first concern was moving  
residents safely inland, they also acknowledged that saving 
historic Savannah was priority No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``A whole lot of people are really worried right now that the  
character of the city will not be the same,'' said City Manager 
Michael Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Emergency Management Agency predicted Floyd would  
rake Savannah and other coastal cities with 125 mph winds late 
Wednesday, with the eye of the storm passing over Tybee Island 20 
miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the stately antebellum homes in the historic district  
were unprotected by plywood or duct tape. Residents said the 
downtown layout, with homes huddled close together around the 
squares, would shield them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figure if it's been here over 100 years and it's withstood  
it without any problems, it'll probably withstand this one -- 
hopefully,'' said Dr. David Thomas, an obstetrician-gynecologist 
drinking orange juice on the steps of his three-story, 1889 home on 
Montery Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses, hotels and homes built in the 1800s were shuttered  
and boarded. Museums packed away their china and other fragile 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	At Bonaventure Cemetery, featured on the cover of ``Midnight in  
the Garden of Good and Evil,'' a few people removed statues from 
the graves of relatives. Bonaventure, where songwriter Johnny 
Mercer and other leading citizens of Savannah are buried, sits on 
the Savannah River and could flood. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument for Revolutionary War hero Casimir Pulaski, which  
had been on display at the Coastal Heritage Museum, was put in 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Lafayette Square, workers rushed to remove 112 feet of  
scaffolding from the twin spires of St. John the Baptist Cathedral, 
Savannah's oldest cathedral at 200-plus years. The scaffolding was 
erected to repair the church's stucco surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's like losing a child. We put a lot of hard work  
into getting that stuff up there and it's kind of tough to have to 
watch them have to take it down,'' said foreman Don Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Other historic sites include the house where Girl Scouts of  
America founder Juliette Gordon Low was born in 1860, and the 
former Cotton Exchange building, where traders set world cotton 
prices from the 1880s until the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatham County ordered all 250,000 residents to evacuate before  
Tuesday afternoon. A few people remained in the historic district. 
Some were boarding up their businesses before leaving town. Others 
were bellying up to the bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get all the drunks out of here so I can leave  
myself,'' said Patsy Williams, bartender at McDonough's Bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Savannah's historic district sits on a bluff above the Savannah  
River, 20 miles inland and high enough to keep most of downtown 
from flooding, city officials said. Their main worry was that wind 
and debris could breach old homes and buildings, letting water seep 
in from heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Savannah residents worried most about damage to the  
towering oaks that give the city some of its distinctive natural 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a majority of the trees will be gone. And that's what  
we're known for,'' said Natalie Allmon, who was boarding up windows 
at the Planters Inn, where she is general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials expect many of the oaks will stand up to the  
storm. Many were planted in the 1890s, and the city went through 
five years ago and removed trees that were dead or dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Savannah wasn't the only place in Georgia worried about  
protecting its historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers on Jekyll Island shuttered the ``millionaire cottages''  
built by the Rockefellers and Pulitzers and shut off power and 
water to the mansions. 
</P>
<P>
	At Fort McAllister, where Gen. William T. Sherman ended his  
March to the Sea after burning Atlanta, state workers removed 
military artifacts, including small arms and artillery shells. 
</P>
<P>
	On St. Simons Island, resident James Armstrong, 61, said he  
wasn't worried about the historic lighthouse, which survived a 
powerful hurricane in the 1800s. Gleaming white, it stands 
overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and the Port of Brunswick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ain't nothing going to happen to that lighthouse,'' he said.  
``In fact, that's a good place to hide.''

<HEADLINE> Four UCLA Players Plead No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The city attorney's office maintains that  
what Cade McNown's lawyer calls his ``exemplary life'' includes an 
illegal quarterback sneak. 
</P>
<P>
	While four more defendants in UCLA's handicapped parking scandal  
pleaded no contest Tuesday to a misdemeanor charge as part of a 
plea agreement, the case of McNown was put off until the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, the first-team All-America quarterback as a senior last  
year, and four other former or current UCLA players were charged 
Monday with illegally possessing a handicap parking placard. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were scheduled for arraignment Tuesday, and all had  
their cases continued until Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The city attorney's office has brought charges against a total  
of 19 current or former Bruins alleged to be part of the disabled 
parking scam. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at these cases long and hard before we filed them,''  
deputy city attorney Brian Williams said of his office's latest 
action. ``We know we can prove the cases, there's no doubt about 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're alleging there is a false name on the application, or  
the doctor who signed it says she didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown's attorney, Ronald Safer, refused to say how his client  
would plead, but said the Chicago Bears rookie was ``deeply 
troubled'' by the charge and was legitimately entitled to the 
placard when he used it briefly nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have to come Sept. 30 to see how he pleads,'' Safer  
said outside Los Angeles Municipal Court. ``This is somebody who 
has not been near any kind of trouble in his life. He has lived an 
exemplary life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Reynosa and Duval Hicks, who played for the Bruins last  
year, and Durell Price and James Ghezzi, members of this year's 
team, entered their no-contest pleas before Municipal Judge Sam 
Ohta. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the other current or former UCLA players who were  
charged July 8 entered no-contest pleas three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	As was the case with other defendants who pleaded no contest,  
Reynosa, Hicks, Price and Ghezzi were ordered to pay to pay $1,485 
in fines and perform 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes also must spend a day meeting with the disabled and  
their advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	The case of Craig Walendy, another whose UCLA career finished  
last year, was continued until Sept. 30, but Williams said that was 
because his attorney was unavailable, and added he expected Walendy 
to also plead no contest. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine who are members of the current team were suspended for  
the season's first two games. They will return Saturday night 
against Fresno State, with six in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Williams said, cases involving junior tailback  
Keith Brown, who was also suspended for the first two games this 
year, and former UCLA player Akil Davis are still being evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged Monday along with McNown were running back Skip Hicks of  
the Washington Redskins, safety Larry Atkins of the Kansas City 
Chiefs, former linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo and defensive back 
Eric Whitfield, a member of the current team who also served the 
two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	All were said to have illegally obtained the handicapped parking  
placards in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Safer said he didn't believe there was any evidence McNown ever  
parked in a handicapped spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He completed the application on Jan. 4, he was injured,''  
Safer said. ``He received the placard sometime later. He does not 
recall using a handicapped spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if McNown used a doctor's name on the form, Safer said,  
``He did not complete that part of the form. That portion of the 
form was completed, but not by him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Safer wouldn't elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was 19 years old when he did it,'' Safer said. ``He used  
the placard only a handful of times. When he recovered from his 
injury, he put the placard away forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now 22, McNown was a first-round draft choice of the Bears last  
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's their absolute right to go to trial,'' Williams said of  
the five most recently charged. ``We'll just let a jury decide if 
that happens. Each of their cases has their individual wrinkles. 
(McNown's) wrinkle isn't so great to take him out of the sphere of 
culpability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Altman, an associate of attorney Robert Shapiro who  
represented Price and Ghezzi, said there was never any question his 
clients would take responsibility for their actions.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Moving Fast on E. Timor Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council is moving fast to  
draft a resolution authorizing deployment of an international force 
to East Timor and troops could be on the ground by the weekend, 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan met the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Portugal and  
Australia, and Britain offered a draft resolution authorizing a 
multinational force for East Timor at a hurriedly called Security 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we should just keep going until it's done,'' U.S.  
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told reporters before the Security 
Council meeting started today. 
</P>
<P>
	At Indonesia's request, the draft says the force will operate  
under a unified command. But Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas 
told reporters the U.N.-authorized international force would be in 
command on the ground, with Indonesian troops playing an advisory 
and liaison role. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor independence advocate and Nobel Peace Prize winner  
Jose Ramos Horta demanded today that Indonesia withdraw all troops 
from the territory, saying their presence is likely to ignite a 
bloodbath. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we have an international force on the ground and  
Indonesian troops are still there, it's going to be impossible to 
control the emotions of our people. The security must be entirely, 
exclusively in the hands of the multinational force,'' he told 
reporters before the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alatas said Indonesian soldiers would not be withdrawn  
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Militiamen in East Timor began their rampage after results were  
announced Sept. 4 from a U.N.-supervised ballot on the future of 
the former Portuguese colony, which Indonesia invaded in 1975. 
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the draft resolution, the multinational force will  
have a four-month mandate. It will be charged with securing order, 
facilitating humanitarian assistance when possible and with 
protecting the U.N. mission in Dili, East Timor's provincial 
capital. The U.N. evacuated all but a skeleton staff to the 
northern Australian city of Darwin early today. 
</P>
<P>
	With a growing humanitarian crisis and looting, burning and  
violence continuing in East Timor, pressure intensified for quick 
agreement on the composition and mandate of the force and its 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to have elements on the ground by the weekend,'' Annan  
told reporters this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well we hope so too,'' said Alatas as he arrived at the United  
Nations for another meeting with Annan. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan and Alatas agreed Monday to move ahead as quickly as  
possible following Indonesia's decision Sunday to ask multinational 
troops for help, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general hopes to work out details of the  
deployment by late today, Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the quickest decision possible (by the Security  
Council), today, probably tomorrow,'' said Portugal's Foreign 
Minister Jaime Gama. ``We need very quick action ...to restore 
security and avoid the atrocities and killings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas said he wanted to discuss the composition and command of  
the multinational force with Annan, reiterating that Indonesia 
preferred participation by fellow countries in the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations, but stressing ``we have no 
conditionalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annan has asked Australia to lead the force, but Indonesia's  
armed forces and a parliamentary committee have voiced strong 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas met with Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer at  
the United Nations today and said afterwards that Australia is 
``the party that is the best prepared to send their contribution of 
troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australia has assembled 4,500 soldiers and equipment on 24-hour  
alert in Darwin, an hour's flight from East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council resolution drafted by Britain would deploy  
the multinational force under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which 
would authorize the use of force to restore law and order in East 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	It calls for an immediate end to the violence by armed militia  
and Indonesian security forces and for a halt to the forced 
displacement of East Timorese. It demands that those responsible be 
brought to justice, stressing that ``persons committing such 
violations bear individual responsibility.''

<HEADLINE> Health Care Companies Curb Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some home health care companies say new  
Medicare payment caps have prompted them to curb services to 
elderly and disabled patients with expensive medical problems, such 
as diabetes or congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises the important question as to whether or not we have  
created a situation where the sicker patients in our society are 
not wanted by anybody because of the higher cost of their care,'' 
said Barbara Markham Smith, a George Washington University 
researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The university on Tuesday released the results of a survey of 28  
home care companies in nine states: California, Florida, Indiana, 
Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, paid for by the National Association for Home Care  
and the Home Health Services and Staffing Association, was not 
designed to be statistically representative of all home care 
companies. But among those surveyed, two-thirds said they had taken 
steps to lower the proportion of very sick Medicare patients they 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those steps:  
</P>
<P>
	--Turning away patients likely to need longer-term or repeat  
care, particularly diabetics, or intensive short-term care such as 
those who leave the hospital with intravenous drips. 
</P>
<P>
	--Firing specialists, such as cardiac nurses, to avoid attracting  
patients with complex problems such as congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	--Marketing to attract patients likely to recover quickly, such  
as otherwise healthy people who have had hip replacements or 
coronary bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all of the companies said they were also pushing to  
discharge existing Medicare patients with chronic diseases, such 
diabetes or multiple sclerosis, into nursing homes or family care. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers agreed in 1997 to new annual caps on Medicare payments  
to home care companies to limit what some said was out-of-control 
and potentially fraudulent use of the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the industry and some advocates for the elderly and  
disabled contend the payment caps are too tight. Congress provided 
$1.7 billion last fall to raise payments slightly, but lobbying 
continues for more. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed that $7.5 billion be set aside  
over the next decade to correct unintended consequences of 1997 
Medicare payment changes that also have affected hospitals and 
nursing homes. But administration officials have insisted that 
before that money is spent, there must be proof that patients, not 
just company profits, are in jeopardy.

<HEADLINE> Credit Card Protection Schemes Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chris Weddle, a college student with just one  
credit card, had received numerous calls from telemarketers 
offering plans that would supposedly protect him from being held 
liable for charges he did not make. 
</P>
<P>
	He resisted time and again, saying he did not need additional  
safeguards beyond those guaranteed by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them would just keep pushing,'' said Weddle of Santa  
Maria, Calif. ``There were a couple of times where I just had to 
hang up on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one company didn't take ``no'' for an answer -- and  
ironically, charged Weddle an unauthorized $240 on his credit card 
bill for a plan to protect against unauthorized charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators say credit card protection scams have become  
big business for fraudulent operations who target people unaware of 
the rights they already have. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission was announcing cases against  
several such companies today, who are accused of bilking consumers 
out of $25 million by exploiting concerns about card theft, loss or 
Y2K-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``These companies took advantage of students, seniors and others  
scared into thinking they were vulnerable,'' said Jodie Bernstein, 
director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general in Illinois, Ohio, Arizona, Florida, West  
Virginia and Wisconsin planned similar actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card holders already are entitled to certain protections  
without having to pay for them. Federal law caps the maximum amount 
credit card companies can be held liable for charges they did not 
authorize at $50. Lenders often opt to waive this fee as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Visa, for example, has a ``zero liability'' policy for customers  
who report fraudulent charges within two business days of 
discovering them. Customers might realize their credit card is 
missing right away or might not discover the fraudulent charges 
until they notice them on their monthly bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In some instances, the telemarketers posed as representatives of  
major credit card companies and would scare cardholders into 
thinking that they should pay for additional protection because 
criminals were stealing card numbers over the Internet, the FTC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telemarketers also told consumers they could be held fully  
liable for charges they did not consent to on their bills. In 
another twist on the scam, telemarketers called credit cardholders 
to warn them that the millennium bug could expose their card to 
fraud that the offered protection plan would avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	According to regulators, telemarketers sometimes trick consumers  
by reciting parts of their credit card number and asking for the 
rest of the digits, claiming they need to verify the security of 
the card. With the full number in hand, the companies could bill 
directly to the credit card, with charges ranging from $200 to 
$400. Some consumers, like Weddle, had not consented to any 
services but were billed for them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and credit card issuers say the red flags should go up for  
cardholders if they are asked to provide their number. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers should never need to provide their account  
information over the phone unless they initiated the call,'' said 
Charlotte Birch of the American Bankers Association. If customers 
have doubts about plans being touted as from their bank, she said, 
they should call the bank directly and ask if the service is 
sponsored by them. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates also warn credit cardholders against getting  
trapped into paying an unneeded expense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Credit card protection is a racket,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski,  
consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research 
Group. The programs ``are overpriced and aggressively and 
deceptively marketed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardholders could be using the money to pay down their  
principle, he said.

<HEADLINE> Past USOC Chief Simon Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Calling it ``one of the great honors of my  
life,'' former U.S. Olympic Committee president William Simon 
received the USOC's second Gen. Douglas MacArthur Award on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, 71, headed the USOC from 1980-84, taking over after the  
boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games and running the organization 
during the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1984 Summer Games will go down in history as the most  
successful of all,'' Simon said during a luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	He was lauded by Nancy Kissinger, the wife of former Secretary  
of State Henry Kissinger, and by former Olympic swimmer Donna de 
Varona, a former USOC board member. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, a former USOC vice  
president, was scheduled to speak but canceled because of Hurricane 
Floyd, which is approaching Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only person that's ever tamed George Steinbrenner is Bill  
Simon,'' de Varona said. 
</P>
<P>
	The MacArthur Award was first given last year, when it was  
presented to two members of the 1936 U.S. Olympic track team, Marty 
Glickman and the late Sam Stoller. The pair, the only Jewish 
athletes on the U.S. team at the Berlin Games, were replaced on the 
400-meter relay squad at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, former USOC marketing head John Krimsky, who attended the  
luncheon, said he will be be part of a task force to raise the $125 
million still needed for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky quit in April to become president of Relationship  
Management Programs Inc., which runs United Airlines' senior 
frequent-flier program. He said Peter Larson, the chairman and CEO 
of Brunswick bowling, and Xerox CEO Paul Allaire will be on the 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky's old job was split in two after he left.  
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Dunn was hired last month as deputy executive director  
for development and will be responsible for individual donations. 
She had been with the the University of Washington for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Ogrean, the USOC's deputy executive director for marketing,  
is in responsible for corporate sponsorships.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Magazine To Go Weekly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to go head-to-head with competitors like  
Entertainment Weekly, US magazine is changing from a monthly to 
weekly format beginning next March. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was announced Monday by Jann Wenner, chairman of  
Wenner Media Inc., which also publishes Rolling Stone and Men's 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry McDonell, currently editor of Men's Journal, will take the  
helm of the new version of the magazine, which will be called 
USWeekly. 
</P>
<P>
	Priya Narang, media director for DeWitt Media, praised the  
decision to go weekly as a ``smart move'' for the magazine. ``They 
need to be very current in order to survive,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended in June, US had a circulation of 1  
million, down from 1.1 million in the same period a year ago, 
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The magazine's ad 
revenues for the eight months ending in August slipped 6 percent 
over the same period last year to $16.4 million, according to the 
Publishers Information Bureau.

<HEADLINE>  New Look for Nebraska Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- DeAngelo Evans, thought to be Nebraska's  
next great running back before he was slowed by numerous injuries, 
shocked teammates and coaches by quitting the fourth-ranked 
Cornhuskers just two games into his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries which kept Evans out of all but three games last year,  
and a slow start this season, frustrated him to the point where he 
no longer wanted to play, coach Frank Solich said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly difficult for this football team,'' Solich said  
during his weekly news conference. ``You never want to have a 
player, for whatever reason, not be able to finish out the season 
or finish out his career at your school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Evans situation overshadowed another big change in the  
Cornhuskers backfield announced Tuesday. Eric Crouch will start at 
quarterback in place of Bobby Newcombe, who is moving to wingback. 
Crouch, who lost out to Newcombe in a preseason battle for the 
starting job, leads Nebraska with five rushing touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans and Solich met over the weekend, and the player's mind  
``seemed to be pretty well made up when we talked,'' Solich said. 
``In general it really came down to the role he was playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska defeated California 45-0 on Saturday, but Evans  
finished with five yards on six carries as the Bears virtually shut 
down the pitch on the Cornhuskers' option plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's battled back, he's in position to get some things done  
and really didn't have the opportunity to do it,'' Solich said. 
``On a normal day, when we run as many options as we did in that 
game, the I-back will end up with the football on numerous 
occasions and will have an opportunity for some big plays and a lot 
of yards. That did not happen in that ball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was finished with football, but planned to remain in  
Lincoln and finish school, Solich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was unavailable for comment. He didn't attend Tuesday's  
news conference and no one answered the telephone at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Alexander, who leads Nebraska with 121 yards on 21 carries,  
will take over as the starting tailback on Saturday against 
Southern Mississippi, with Correll Buckhalter, thought to be 
leaving the team a week ago over a lack of playing time, at No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I heard the rumor I didn't believe it,''  
Alexander said of Evans. ``It's surprising, but at the same time 
there's nothing we can do about it as a team. That's DeAngelo's 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans' decision also was the latest in a series of departures  
and rumors of departures for the Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup quarterback Jay Runty transferred to NCAA Division II  
Nebraska-Omaha after Solich announced the preseason depth chart. 
Before the Iowa game, Crouch was rumored to be leaving, though he 
and Solich said that, while the quarterback was disappointed not be 
the starter, he hadn't considered quitting the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week Buckhalter, who had just three carries in a 42-7  
blowout at Iowa in the season opener, was a no-show at practice for 
three days. Buckhalter said Tuesday he was frustrated by the lack 
of playing time, but also hadn't planned to leave school. 
Buckhalter was suspended for the Cal game, but will be back on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10, 215-pound Evans was considered a top prospect out  
of high school in Wichita, Kan., where he surpassed many of fellow 
Wichita native Barry Sanders' rushing records. 
</P>
<P>
	After running for 776 yards and 14 touchdowns as a freshman in  
1996, Evans sparked hope among Huskers fans that he would put up 
numbers comparable to such former greats as Mike Rozier and Roger 
Craig. A pelvic injury sidelined Evans in 1997, and last year he 
had knee surgery before the season and played in just three games, 
finishing with 227 yards on 38 carries.

<HEADLINE> Audubon Society Fights for Condors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of environmentalists contend that in  
the choice between generating cleaner power from windmills and 
protecting the endangered California condor, the bird must be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Audubon Society is fighting an Enron Corp. proposal  
to erect wind-powered turbines in the Tehachapi Mountains about 60 
miles north of Los Angeles. The fear is that some of the 49 wild 
condors could be chewed up in the propellers spinning 200 feet 
above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to imagine a worse idea than putting a condor  
Cuisinart next door to critical condor habitat,'' said David Beard, 
the group's senior vice president for public policy. ``The survival 
of the condor must come first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enron officials contend they do not plan to build at the  
disputed site it leased in 1982, even though the company filed 
state documents related to the project in March. The company is 
concentrating its turbines in several projects around Palm Springs, 
southeast of Los Angeles, and included the disputed Tehachapi site 
as a matter of routine, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no plans, even on the drawing board,'' said Gary  
Foster, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron. 
</P>
<P>
	The Audubon Society is trying to pull the plug by targeting a  
federal tax break. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wind Energy Tax Credit, which provides 1.5 cents per  
kilowatt-hour generated, expired June 30. Without it, wind power 
becomes much less profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders are expected to introduce legislation soon to  
extend this and other tax breaks, but Audubon officials are pushing 
for legislation to prevent turbines within 10 miles of condor 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential Enron project is about one mile south of where the  
last two condors were captured on Tunis Ridge and two to three 
miles from where one of the last nesting pairs was found near 
Pyramid Lake, Audubon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The California condor population dwindled to 21 in 1981 because  
of hunting and poisoned carrion. But 162 birds are breeding in zoos 
or living in the wild today. 
</P>
<P>
	The government spends about $1.7 million a year in a program to  
capture the birds, raise the young, then set them free. Twenty live 
in the wild in southern California, nine around Big Sur, 150 miles 
south of San Francisco, and 20 in Nevada. Another 20 are scheduled 
to be released into the wild this fall.

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Pounds Bahamas With Rain, Wind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd pounded the Bahamas with  
howling winds and blinding rain today, snapping palm trees in half, 
downing power lines and churning up dangerous surf throughout the 
vulnerable islands east of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Frightened residents in the low-lying archipelago huddled inside  
their homes and dozens of public shelters as Floyd, with top 
sustained wind of 150 mph, raked the Bahamas and threatened Florida 
and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting rocked,'' said JAMZ radio news director Kirk  
Smith, who reported 100 mph wind gusts in Nassau, the Bahamian 
capital. ``We tried to go outside but a huge tree just fell outside 
our studio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT, Floyd's center was near Eleuthera Island and  
about 255 miles east of Miami. It was moving west-northwest near 14 
mph, and a gradual turn toward the northwest was expected later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd uprooted 30-foot trees, ripped awnings off buildings and  
sent whirling sheets of rain through Nassau's deserted streets. Its 
roaring winds shook the 11-story Marriott Hotel and pelted the 
streets with debris, setting off car alarms. Love 97 radio reported 
flooding in the western tip of New Providence Island, which has 
165,000 people, half the country's population. 
</P>
<P>
	With one exception -- a man who watched the hurricane from a seat  
on his 8th-floor balcony -- stranded tourists huddled inside the 
underground ballroom at the Marriott. They slept on couches and the 
floor, sipped coffee and listened in awe to the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids slept through it and so did my husband, but I was  
woken by what sounded like tin crashing down and got worried when I 
could feel the whole bed shaking,'' said Jeannine Bixby of Rumney, 
N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 guests and 500 staff members at the sprawling  
Atlantis Resort in Paradise Island were waiting out the storm 
inside a resort convention center. ``Everyone's really cooperative. 
They know how serious this is,'' said resort spokesman Ed Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	San Salvador, Eleuthera and Cat islands reported 110 mph winds  
today. The U.S. National Hurricane Center cited reports of severe 
damage in Eleuthera, but Bahamas police Chief Superintendent Alan 
Gibson said there were no immediate reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 600 miles wide, Floyd dwarfed the small islands, its  
hurricane-force winds extending 125 miles from the storm's center. 
Tropical storm-force winds extended 165 miles beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was expected to cut across the Bahamas and then arc along  
the Florida peninsula Wednesday. The huge storm could deliver 
Florida its hardest storm strike in years. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect from Florida City, Fla., to  
just south of Brunswick, Ga. A hurricane watch was in effect 
northward to Little River Inlet, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	With evacuations planned or under way in parts of Florida and  
Georgia, the U.S. hurricane center issued a heavy surf advisory for 
the East Coast northward to Montauk Point, N.Y. Up to 10 inches of 
rain and dangerous storm surges were likely in the Bahamas, and 
tropical storm force winds were expected in Miami and Fort 
Lauderdale today. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which  
features top sustained wind of 156 mph with higher gusts. By 
comparison, Hurricane Andrew had Category 4 status when it struck 
South Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an estimated 
$25 billion in damage. Andrew killed four people in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Rolle, a forecaster at the Bahamas Department of  
Meteorology, said the storm's center passed over Arthur's Town on 
north Cat Island earlier today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expected storm surges up to 20 feet and warned they  
could flood areas of New Providence six miles inland -- a daunting 
prospect for an island seven miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotels moved guests out of seaside rooms, and schools were  
converted into hurricane shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Cappell and her husband, of New York City, arrived in  
Nassau on Monday and planned to ride out the storm at their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only heard about (the storm) on the way to the airport. We  
had cancellation insurance, but we decided to take a chance,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Salvador, a quiet resort island where Christopher  
Columbus is believed to have first landed in the New World, Riding 
Rock Inn manager Carter Williams moved all of his guests to a 
shelter at the nearby Church of God. The island's Club Med resort 
said some customers were waiting out the hurricane at the resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd disrupted airline flights, cruises and shipping traffic  
between the United States and the Caribbean. American Airlines 
canceled its nine daily flights between southern Florida and its 
hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, while both Carnival Cruise Lines and 
Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines sent Bahamas-bound ships to Mexico 
instead. Bahamas Air flew its jets to Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Hurricane Gert strengthened to winds near 105 mph and  
was 1,155 miles east of the Leeward Islands. Gert was moving 
west-northwest near 15 mph.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Risks Around the World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the State Department's warnings to U.S. citizens  
about possible Year 2000 computer failures around the world: 

</P>
<P>
	Bahrain: ``Role as the financial hub of the region has made many  
of its systems heavily computer reliant. ... Moderate risk of 
potential disruption of electric power and water sources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belarus: ``Does not appear to be prepared to deal with the Y2K  
problem. ... Americans who are planning to remain in Belarus should 
be prepared to withstand power, water and heat outages during cold 
winter weather that can last several days or more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil: ``Risk for potentially moderate but largely isolated  
disruptions in telecommunications, electricity, the health sector, 
and possibly financial services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China: ``May be a risk of potential disruption in the key  
sectors of banking and finance, telecommunications, medical 
services, and in electrical power and infrastructure systems 
outside of the coastal cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba: ``Moderate risk of potential disruption in such key  
sectors as banking and finance, telecommunications, and electric 
power. Public services are not reliable, and the Cuban population 
is accustomed to doing without key services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India: ``Largest question is the readiness of the electric power  
sector and the ocean ports, parts of which have been slow to 
address the Y2K issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israel: ``Moderate risk of potential disruption in key sectors,  
including telecommunications and electric power. ... Ground 
stations for mobile communications may be vulnerable to Y2K-related 
disruptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy: ``Will lower the risks of potential Y2K disruptions with  
greater progress in remediation and contingency planning, 
particularly in the fields of health care, telecommunications and, 
to a lesser extent, transportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia: ``Disruptions are likely to occur in the key sectors of  
electrical power, heat, telecommunications, transportation, and 
financial and emergency services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia: ``Moderate risk of potential disruption in the  
telecommunications, banking and finance and electric power 
sectors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan: ``All ATM machines in Taiwan may be shut down for  
thirty-six hours, beginning early on December 31st.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Offering Y2K Warnings Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what promises to be the best road map yet  
for identifying global problems caused by the Year 2000 technology 
glitch, the State Department today said it was preparing 
country-by-country warnings for Americans living or traveling in 
194 nations. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is no reason yet to issue any specific warning,  
Kevin Herbert, director of overseas citizens services at the 
department, said Americans could face ``potential difficulties'' in 
obtaining medical services, proper water and other facilities as a 
result of malfunctioning computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Department of State has no greater responsibility'' than  
safeguarding Americans abroad, Herbert said, in announcing that 
technology warnings would be routinely issued along with familiar 
travel advisories. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Herbert said this would help Americans  
make overseas travel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The government warned, for example, that in China there ``may be  
a risk of potential disruption in the key sectors of banking and 
finance, telecommunications, medical services and in electrical 
power and infrastructure systems outside of the coastal cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It cautioned that failures in Russia were ``likely to occur in  
the key sectors of electrical power, heat, telecommunications, 
transportation and financial and emergency services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unprecedented warnings will include details from countries  
where visiting Americans could be affected by power outages, water 
shortages and other potentially serious problems if computers are 
unable to recognize the four-digit date 2000 on Jan 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain said it also planned to publish today a  
country-by-country advisory to warn British citizens about nations 
most at risk from the Year 2000 technology problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. reports were compiled by its embassies worldwide.  
Experts have long complained about the difficulties collecting 
adequate information from foreign governments about possible 
computer failures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the information we're getting is self-reported,'' said  
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate's Year 2000 
Committee. ``If it turns out these self-reported statements are 
accurate, the folks won't feel much in the way of Y2K.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings also were expected to suggest how and where  
failures overseas may affect U.S. interests in the interconnected 
global economy, where problems with the export of Venezuelan crude, 
for example, might affect the price of gasoline for motorists here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disruptions in this infrastructure and the relationships among  
suppliers and customers will negatively affect individuals, firms, 
industries, governments and national and regional economies around 
the world,'' the agency's inspector general, Jacquelyn 
Williams-Bridgers, told a Senate committee earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department previously has criticized Y2K efforts in  
Russia and former Eastern bloc countries, citing a ``relatively 
high probability of ... failures.'' It also has predicted problems 
with power grids in India and Poland, railroads in China and 
telephones and water supplies in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The task of publicly identifying countries where systems might  
fail was clearly a sensitive one for the agency, which called the 
warnings ``carefully compiled ... in an objective, non-comparative 
and non-alarmist way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Consular Affairs said comments about Y2K efforts  
will be added to each nation's updated consular information sheet -- 
available on the State Department's Internet site -- and said 
details will be updated periodically as countries improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first priority is to provide information to U.S. citizens  
to try to meet their needs,'' State Department spokesman Phil 
Reeker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem may occur because some computer programs,  
especially older ones, might fail when the date changes to 2000. 
Because the programs were written to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year, such programs could read the digits ``00'' as 
1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the world's worst Year 2000 failures will occur  
overseas. They are predicting with increasing confidence there will 
be no national failures in the United States among key industries. 
</P>
<P>
	A new report today from the Office of Management and Budget said  
97 percent of the U.S. government's most important computers at its 
largest agencies have been fixed. OMB estimated the total cost of 
government repairs at $8.34 billion, a slight increase from the 
$8.05 billion cited earlier in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is a worry, Japan is a worry, Russia is a worry, Italy  
is a worry. ... But many of these countries now are moving more 
aggressively and catching up,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, 
D-Conn., vice chairman of the Senate Year 2000 Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gartner Group Inc., an analyst firm in Stamford, Conn., last  
month identified Russia as the highest risk for Y2K failures, 
followed by India and a cluster of countries that included 
Venezuela, Norway, Japan, Taiwan and Finland.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Residents Flee Hurricane Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- They came bearing TVs, VCRs, dogs,  
photos and a caged cockatiel, buckled into the passenger seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Families pulling trailers, boats and wooden wagons sat for hours  
Tuesday on Interstate 10 in a gridlocked effort to flee Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is insane,'' said Vicki Drake, whose family was traveling  
in a four-car caravan that included the seat-belted bird. As for 
where they were going, Mrs. Drake said with a laugh: ``We're not 
sure. Just west somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West seemed to be the direction favored by much of Florida as  
Floyd rumbled up the coast, spreading panic. 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 10 is the only major westbound highway out of  
Jacksonville, the last big city before the Georgia state line. The 
airport began shutting down Tuesday evening, closing the last major 
air escape route on Florida's Atlantic Coast. The airports in 
Miami, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale closed hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	And so Jacksonville, which hasn't seen a destructive hurricane  
since Dora blew through 35 years ago, became a traffic bottleneck, 
clogged not only by its own residents but by people running from as 
far away as Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At a rest stop on I-10, just west of Jacksonville, hundreds of  
cars jammed the parking lot and men, women and children waited in 
long lines to use the bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rhodes family left Jacksonville Beach at 9 a.m. It took them  
nearly seven hours to travel 35 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Rhodes didn't want to leave, but her grown son, Ben,  
threatened to tie her to the car, she said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived there 50 years, through Dora, and the worst that  
happened was my fence blew down,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son shook his head and jerked his thumb toward his mother.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told her we weren't messing around with this one,'' he said.  
``This one is bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So they packed photos, clothes, food, the VCR, the CD player and  
all of Ben's compact discs. ``Three boxes of them,'' laughed his 
wife, Colleen. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother-in-law snorted. ``We brought so much stuff, I said,  
`Why don't we just hook the house up to the bumper,''' said Marie 
Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallahassee is about 160 miles down the road, but many of those  
who called ahead were told there weren't any hotel rooms left. 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio stations warned there wasn't a room to be found  
within a 120-mile radius of Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone headed north first,'' Ben Rhodes said. ``Now everyone  
is going west. We don't even know where we are going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going that way,'' he said, pointing to the  
miles-long row of taillights headed toward Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Ruiz, 40, of Orlando, brought with her a Bible, her stereo  
and a 12-pack of Pepsi and got on Interstate 4 heading west toward 
Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just been listening to the radio and praying a lot,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> Bobbitt Avoids Jail Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLON, Nev. (AP) -- John Wayne Bobbitt dodged a jail sentence  
Tuesday and was put on probation for his part in a scheme to steal 
clothes from a store. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbitt, 32, and five co-defendants had pleaded guilty to  
attempted grand larceny and other charges in a plea bargain. An 
estimated $140,000 in clothing was stolen from a store that has 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Archie Blake put Bobbitt on probation for five years and  
ordered him to pay $5,000 restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbitt said he didn't know the clothing had been stolen.  
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to stay away from trouble,'' Bobbitt said after his  
sentencing in Fallon, about 60 miles east of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbitt made headlines in 1993 when his then-wife, Lorena, cut  
off his penis at their apartment in Manassas, Va. She drove off in 
a fury and tossed the severed organ out the car window. It later 
was reattached. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife argued she'd been the victim of an abusive husband and  
was found innocent by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> For Penn State, It's Deja Vu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- A season-opening victory against an  
overrated Top 25 team, a blowout and then a close call against 
Pittsburgh. What is this, 1998 all over again for No. 3 Penn State? 
</P>
<P>
	The Nittany Lions had better hope not.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, they started 3-0 by beating No. 21 Southern  
Mississippi, routing Bowling Green and sneaking past Pittsburgh. 
Then they got clobbered at No. 1 Ohio State, dropped two more big 
road games and ended up in the Outback Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, most of the same cast travels to No. 8 Miami --  
Hurricane Floyd permitting -- and tries to end the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very important that we go down there this week  
and come away with a `W,' especially coming out of last year, 
coming out of those losses at Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio State,'' 
fullback Mike Cerimele said. ``Three big games and we didn't come 
out with a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The losing trend goes back farther than last year: Penn State  
has not beaten a Top 10 team on the road since downing No. 5 
Michigan 31-24 on Oct. 15, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State thought it had put last season's problems behind it  
with a 41-7 dismantling of then-No. 4 Arizona in this year's opener 
and with a 70-point showing against Akron. 
</P>
<P>
	But the next week, Arizona had to come from behind in the  
fourth-quarter to nip Texas Christian -- a team that went on to lose 
to Northwestern. And on Saturday, Penn State nearly lost to Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, beating the 'Canes seems more uncertain -- and more  
important. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the course of this 38-year-old rivalry, it has always  
seemed to be that way: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Joe Paterno went 5-5 in his first season as coach and lost to  
Navy in the 1967 season opener. Then, he brought Penn State down to 
Miami and beat the Hurricanes 17-8 with a bunch of untested 
sophomores. It was the start of his most successful run, 31-1-1 
from 1967 through 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In 1981, Miami beat No. 1 Penn State 17-14, staving off a  
fourth-quarter rally. The next day, the Miami Herald called it the 
Hurricanes' ``Biggest Victory Ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Six years later, Paterno won his second national title with a  
14-10 victory over No. 1 Miami in the 1987 Fiesta Bowl. Pete 
Giftopoulos' interception at the Lions' 1-yard line with 9 seconds 
left remains one of Penn State's most dramatic moments. 
</P>
<P>
	With Miami under coach Butch Davis looking more like the touted  
teams of the 1980s, Paterno has his team sensing that this could be 
another special one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miami is a great team,'' tailback Eric McCoo said. ``Everybody  
can see that they're coming back to be one of the great teams 
again. This is one of those games, you make little mistakes, you 
lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State made plenty of little mistakes against Pittsburgh,  
and were especially inconsistent on offense. The Panthers confused 
Penn State into just 65 yards rushing, and but for a few big 
passing plays, held their offense in check. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive linemen said they were confused by Pitt's stunts.  
Miami, which held Ohio State to 116 yards on the ground, should be 
even tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's not troubling enough, Paterno expects to be without  
tailback Cordell Mitchell, a fast, reliable senior who can't seem 
to stay healthy. Last week, he was out with a deep thigh bruise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching him yesterday, he couldn't even jog, so I would be  
doubtful if he's going to be ready,'' Paterno said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoo, who started the end of 1998 when Mitchell was out with a  
shoulder injury, will probably start again. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, Paterno said he has not seen tape of the play  
that got LaVar Arrington two personal fouls Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno said he does not plan to look at it, and he did not  
discipline his star linebacker over the dust-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is just going to have to be very, very careful. He can't  
retaliate. I wouldn't expect him to get involved in a skirmish like 
that,'' he said. ``He's got to understand that he is in the 
limelight. He's got to be able to maybe have a little tighter 
control over himself than somebody else.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Cable News Stresses Content </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new generation of local cable newscasts is  
helping to change the image of local television news as shallow and 
crime-sodden. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the cable news operations that have sprung up quickly in  
the past few years are trying to compete with bigger broadcasters 
by emphasizing substance over sizzle, a study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the best news channels, like Las Vegas One and New York  
One, pack more information into their newscasts than broadcast 
network affiliates, said a report by Rocky Mountain Media Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The media watchdog group has criticized local broadcast  
newscasts throughout the 1990s for heavily emphasizing crime news 
and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sense that a lot of people in the industry feel that the  
traditional local newscast is vulnerable to change,'' Paul Klite, 
the group's executive director, said Tuesday. ``The old format has 
gotten tiresome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klite's group studied the newscasts of 21 cable stations on a  
fairly typical news day -- June 23, 1999. Overall, the programs had 
more news stories and fewer commercials than local newscasts did 
when measured in a separate, similar study. The cable newscasts had 
25 percent less news about violent crime, Klite said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable news operations generally have fewer soft features, less  
banter between anchors, and are also more willing to try different 
approaches, such as doing four short weather forecasts in an hour. 
Many cable newscasts feature one anchor instead of two, possibly 
because it's cheaper, Klite said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited Cable Pulse 24, a Toronto news station, as  
``without a doubt the most information-packed newscast in North 
America.'' Its screen is divided into seven separate information 
windows that deliver stock figures, sports scores, news headlines, 
the time, local weather, local traffic and a traditional newscast. 
</P>
<P>
	The newscast takes up 35 percent of the screen. Many stories ran  
for two minutes, unusually long in local news, and covered the 
environment, financial news, politics and health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sort of grew out of looking at an Internet screen,'' said  
Stephen Hurlbut, the station's vice president and general manager. 
``We seem to be evolving into a culture that can process multiple 
sources of information at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some viewers initially responded negatively when the  
format was introduced a year and a half ago, it is now popular and 
imitated, mostly in Canada, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all cable stations followed the trend, the report said.  
Miami station WAMI's twice-nightly newscast, while trying to 
present an alternative to crime-heavy local broadcasts, 
concentrated on ``fluff'' like celebrity gossip and relationship 
advice, Klite said. 
</P>
<P>
	WAMI complained the media watchdog group studied a newscast that  
was not typical, Klite said. WAMI's news director did not 
immediately return a telephone call on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> LPGA To Play in Hawaii Twice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii will play host to a second women's golf  
tournament, the LPGA Takefuji Classic, in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Takefuji Corp., a Japanese consumer finance company, announced  
Tuesday a 3-year sponsorship agreement for the 54-hole event which 
will be held March 2-4 at the Kona Country Club on the island of 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The full-field event will include 130 tour players, plus two  
sponsor exemptions. Two Japanese regulars on the LPGA Tour, Hiromi 
Kobayashi and Akiko Fukushima, are expected to compete for the 
$800,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	However, another big name Japanese star, Mayumi Hirose, is not  
expected to compete because of the start of the Japan LPGA Tour 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	On the LPGA Tour calendar, the Takefuji Classic will follow the  
Hawaiian Ladies Open at Kapolei and the tour's one-time stop in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Takefuji president and chief executive officer Yasuo Takei said  
the tournament ``opens the door to not only American players, but 
also other top players from Europe, South America, Asia and 
Oceania.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament will be telecast to Japan via TV-Tokyo.  
Negotiations are continuing with The Golf Channel for showing in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the two LPGA tournaments, Hawaii plays host to  
the PGA's Mercedes Championships, Sony Classic and PGA Grand Slam 
of Golf and the Senior PGA Tour's Kaanapali Classic, MasterCard 
Championship and Senior Skins.

<HEADLINE> Emmy Voters Gunshy on 'Sopranos' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photo NY129    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Sopranos'' may have been the critical  
darling of the Emmys, but the mafia drama faced enough hurdles to 
fill the trunk of a mobster's car by the time the ceremony rolled 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	The HBO series about a New Jersey crime family led the field  
with 16 nominations yet came away with just four Emmys, two at the 
Sunday awards show and two technical awards given earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first cable program nominated for best dramatic  
series, but lost to last year's winner, ABC's legal drama ``The 
Practice.'' David E. Kelley, creator of ``The Practice,'' also went 
home with the award for best comedy series, ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' went into the awards with great reviews and  
hardcore fans among HBO subscribers. But its dark tone and cast of 
unsavory characters may not have played well with television 
academy voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``What drives the shows that win Emmys is sentiment,'' said  
Thomas O'Neil, author of ``The Emmys.'' ``The thing that makes 'The 
Sopranos' work so well is cynicism, not sentiment, while David E. 
Kelley is a master of sentiment and impacting voters and grabbing 
hold of voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmy voters generally look for characters and situations they  
can relate to, and a mob drama laced with graphic violence and 
profanity doesn't quite fit the bill, O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Chase, creator and producer of ``The Sopranos,'' said  
Monday the show ``does flaunt some pretty basic rules about 
television, like the likeability factor. I don't know that our 
characters are very huggable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series had five acting nominations, yet won just one -- for  
the most upright ``Sopranos'' character. Edie Falco, who plays a 
soul-searching mob wife, took home the award for best actress in a 
drama series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emmy voters in general want to like who they're voting for,''  
O'Neil said. ``Look who did win. Edie Falco, the woman who is the 
moral center of that series, the moral center of that immoral 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other major award ``The Sopranos'' won Sunday was for  
dramatic writing, a category the series dominated with four of the 
five nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters who pick Emmy winners also tend to gravitate more toward  
the familiar and traditional. The three other drama nominees, 
``NYPD Blue,'' ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order,'' all have been perpetual 
nominees, and each has won the dramatic series award in past years. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran series also dominated the acting awards, with such  
perennial winners as Dennis Franz of ``NYPD Blue'' and Helen Hunt 
of ``Mad About You'' going home with more awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The television academy membership does tend to be reasonably  
conservative in terms of embracing new media,'' said Gerald 
Isenberg, a former producer who is a film and television professor 
at the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Albrecht, HBO president of original programming, said  
there may have been some backlash against ``The Sopranos'' because 
of the wide press coverage the show had gained. The explicit 
violence, language and sex also may have worked against the series, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than likely there are people who are offended by some of  
that content when they're in the voting room,'' Albrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even ``The Practice'' creator Kelley conceded afterward that  
he had gone into the Emmys with a hunch ``The Sopranos'' would win 
best drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's such a terrific show,'' Kelley said. ``I don't think  
it's one that approximates anything that I've seen before on 
television or anything that I've done before.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Gingrich's Have Divorce Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has reached an  
agreement with his wife on how to divide their assets as part of 
their divorce proceedings, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The confidential agreement on who owns what between Gingrich and  
his wife, Marianne, was reached Monday and ``gives them both 
support to live off of,'' said Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, told the newspaper that  
an agreement was reached, but would give no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached prior to a Thursday hearing that was  
expected to attract national media, especially after the disclosure 
of Gingrich's relationship with a 33-year-old congressional aide, 
Callista Bisek of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches not only end their 18-year  
marriage, but also avoid answering specific charges they've made 
against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich filed court papers in August accusing Gingrich of  
trying to transfer assets before the divorce filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, 56, said in a separate filing that Mrs. Gingrich held  
all the couple's personal liquid assets when they separated. He 
further accused her of depleting ``a substantial portion'' of those 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls to Gingrich's office and Mrs. Gingrich's house went  
unanswered late Monday.

<HEADLINE> Irish Dismiss Third-String QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame third-string quarterback Eric  
Chappel has been dismissed from the team, Fighting Irish coach Bob 
Davie said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chappel has played sparingly in his four years at Notre Dame.  
</P>
<P>
	``No question that it hurts us, no question that it hurts him.  
But it was a decision that I had to make,'' Davie said without 
giving any details of the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Chappel started in place of the injured Jarious  
Jackson in the game against Southern California, but was replaced 
by Arnaz Battle after two of his three passes were intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Chappel's absence leaves the Irish thin at quarterback. Davie  
didn't sign any true quarterbacks in this year's recruiting class 
and converted freshman Gary Godsey from tight end to quarterback to 
have a fourth quarterback on the roster.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Penalize Aiding Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In legislation aimed mainly at Russia, the  
House passed a measure Tuesday that would impose sanctions on 
countries helping Iran develop nuclear, chemical or biological 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this will send a strong message to the Russian  
government,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., ranking Democrat on 
the House International Relations Committee, before the 419-0 vote. 
``This is an area where they can allow no seepage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in a statement, said the president's senior  
advisers would recommend he veto the bill because it would ``have 
the effect of undermining multilateral support that is vital to 
effectively fight proliferation.'' Clinton vetoed a similar bill 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, sponsored by International Relations Committee  
Chairman Ben Gilman, R-N.Y., would require the president to report 
to Congress every six months on any transfer of material helping 
Iran's weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
	The president would have to cut off arms export licenses or U.S.  
economic assistance to any country involved in Iranian weapons 
proliferation unless he cited national security reasons for waiving 
the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has not yet considered the bill.  
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would withhold $590 million the United States  
is to pay Russia for its participation in the international space 
station program until the president determines that Russia is 
actively opposing proliferation to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress must not look the other way in the face of  
proliferation, or one day it will come back to haunt us,'' said 
Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House Science 
Committee which has jurisdiction over space station funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA says Iran probably will develop intercontinental  
ballistic missiles within 15 years. Both Russia and China have 
provided conventional weapons to Iran, and there has long been 
concern about possible smuggling of nuclear technology from Russia 
to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, congressional Republican leaders decided not to try  
to override Clinton's veto after the administration imposed 
sanctions on nine Russian companies suspected of providing weapons 
technology to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in its veto threat, said the Russians  
recently enacted tough export control legislation and adopted a 
U.S. plan aimed at severing contacts between Russian entities and 
Iran's missile programs. It said holding up space station money 
could lead to significant cost increases and delays. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1883.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Removed From Waco Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal prosecutor who raised questions  
about a possible Justice Department cover-up in the Waco standoff 
was abruptly removed from the case along with his boss, according 
to a court filing made public today. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder recused U.S. Attorney James  
W. Blagg in San Antonio and assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston 
in Waco, Texas, from any further dealings in criminal or civil 
proceedings related to the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder appointed the U.S. attorney in a neighboring district as  
a ``special attorney to the U.S. attorney general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court filing in Waco provides no explanation for the  
decision to recuse the U.S. attorneys' office for the Western 
District of Texas, to which Blagg and Johnston are assigned, but 
said the action took effect last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott  
told reporters today that the Senate investigation should go beyond 
Waco to the Justice Department's forthrightness on other matters, 
such as allegations of campaign finance violations by the 1996 
Clinton campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to have to be broader than just Waco  
itself,'' said Lott, R-Miss. ``I think we have a bigger focus here. 
... There are a number of investigations that they are basically 
either not doing or they have stiffed us on. So we need to find out 
what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recusal of the U.S. attorney's office isn't the first in the  
Waco case. Attorney General Janet Reno last week recused herself, 
saying she will be a witness in the independent inquiry she ordered 
into the fiery end of the 1993 siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, in a letter made public Monday, wrote Reno recently  
warning that aides within her own department were misleading her 
about federal agents' roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have formed the belief that facts may have been kept from  
you -- and quite possibly are being kept from you even now -- by 
components of the department,'' Johnston wrote in an Aug. 30 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston also has been at odds with Blagg, his superior, and  
other Justice officials over the investigation of the government's 
actions during the standoff with the Davidians at their compound 
outside Waco. It was Johnston who pressed Justice Department 
officials to allow independent filmmakers to review evidence sifted 
from the charred ruins of the Davidians' compound -- evidence that 
led to the FBI's recent admission that potentially incendiary tear 
gas canisters were fired on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	That disclosure, after six years of denials, sparked a furor on  
Capitol Hill and has led to congressional inquiries and Reno's 
appointment of an independent investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	Blagg, Johnston and the Justice Department provided no immediate  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came a day after a key House Democrat released  
evidence provided four years ago to Congress showing that the 
Justice Department did notify lawmakers about the FBI's use of 
potentially incendiary tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	That evidence, Rep. Henry Waxman said Monday, was overlooked by  
Rep. Dan Burton, the House Republican who is leading a new inquiry 
into the government's deadly standoff with the Branch Davidians -- 
and who has accused Reno and the Justice Department of possibly 
concealing the truth from Congress and the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no indication that Chairman Burton or his staff  
thought to review these documents before accusing the attorney 
general of a cover-up,'' Waxman, D-Calif., wrote in a letter to the 
special counsel investigating the recently revived Waco 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to the allegations of cover-up, substantial evidence  
of the use of military tear gas rounds was, in fact, provided to 
Congress in 1995,'' said Waxman, who is top Democrat on the House 
Government Reform Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, who chairs the committee, said the Justice Department  
buried the panel in an avalanche of documents shortly before the 
1995 hearings began, and congressional investigators depended on a 
Justice summary to guide them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Justice Department dumped 100,000 documents on the  
committee three days before the hearings, knowing that they 
couldn't possibly go through them,'' the Indiana Republican said in 
an interview. Although Burton was on the Government Reform 
Committee in 1995, he was not on the subcommittee that led the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton also noted that the Justice Department was forced to  
acknowledge last week that it failed in 1995 to give Congress the 
key page from a 1993 FBI lab report mentioning the use of military 
tear gas. The final page of that 49-page report, with the key tear 
gas mention, was missing, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's a coincidence,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Almost six out of 10 Americans believe the FBI has been  
intentionally trying to cover up its actions at Waco, an ABC News 
poll released Monday indicated. Only one out of five polled said 
they thought Reno should resign, based on what they now know. The 
poll of 1,008 adults was taken Sept. 8-12 and has an error margin 
of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

	The records Waxman cited, discovered among more than 40 boxes of  
material compiled during the earlier House hearings, include an FBI 
pilot's 1993 statement recalling a radio transmission in which 
agents had a conversation ``relative to the utilization of some 
sort of military round ... on a concrete bunker.'' And post-raid 
interview summaries include an unnamed FBI agent's explanation that 
smoke captured on film ``came from (an) attempt to penetrate bunker 
with one military and two (non-incendiary) rounds.''

<HEADLINE> Holan's Comeback Ends With Thrashers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Milos Holan, attempting to return to the NHL four  
years after being diagnosed with leukemia, was released Tuesday by 
the Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	Holan, 28-year-old defenseman, was among nine players cut by the  
Thrashers before their exhibition game at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Forwards Kirby Law, Sean Ritchlin, Bryan Adams, Reggie Berg and  
Jeff Martin; defensemen Lawrence Nycholat; and goalie Scott 
Fankhouser were assigned to the Thrashers' minor-league affiliate, 
the Orlando Solar Bears of the International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Mike Muzechka was returned to his junior team, the  
Tri-City Americans of the Western Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	Holan was formally assigned to Vitkovice, the team in his native  
Czech Republic where he played last season. But he already had said 
he would retire as a player if he didn't make it with the 
Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just doing my best and then I will see what happens,''  
Holan said last week. ``If that's good enough, I'll stay. If not, 
I'll go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had not played in the NHL since undergoing a high-risk  
bone-marrow transplant during the 1995-96 season, a few months 
after he was diagnosed with leukemia during a routine physical 
while playing for the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	Holan was hospitalized for eight months and lost 60 pounds while  
enduring numerous complications involving his heart, kidney and 
gall bladder. He missed two full seasons before attempting a 
comeback with the Mighty Ducks last year, but was cut without ever 
playing an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Holan was part of the Thrashers' traveling roster for two  
exhibition games last weekend, but he didn't make enough of an 
impression to earn a longer look. Defense is already is one of the 
team's strongest positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Holan plans to go into coaching in the Czech Republic, where he  
will rejoin his wife, Irena, and their two children: 7-year-old 
Veronica and 3-year-old Milos Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers have 44 players remaining in camp. They will cut  
that number in half prior to their first regular-season game, Oct. 
2 against New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Top Jockey Gall To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLINSVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Dave Gall, fourth on the jockeys'  
career victory list with 7,389, said Tuesday he will retire at the 
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old Gall has been racing at Fairmount Park near St.  
Louis since 1959. Gall, who led the country in victories in 1979, 
trails only Willie Shoemaker, Laffit Pincay Jr. and Pat Day on the 
career list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time, isn't it?'' said Gall, whose last day of  
racing will be Saturday night. ``It's been a long, long time. I 
decided early this spring that I was going to finish the meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gall said he would train horses next year and ``do other  
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I can do well,'' he said. ``I haven't done  
anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gall has been slowed by injuries in recent years, including a  
broken jaw, ankle and collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll enjoy not having to be here at exactly the right times  
and all that,'' Gall said. ``I've only been taking vacations when I 
get hurt, and that's not much fun.''

<HEADLINE>  Kurt Warner Impresses Rams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- When the quarterback went down at Central  
Florida, his center knew the team was in big trouble. When the same 
thing happened with the St. Louis Rams, center Mike Gruttadauria 
had exactly the opposite feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruttadauria just knew untested Kurt Warner would be fine, and  
he was right about Sunday's opener. Warner threw for 309 yards and 
three touchdowns in his first career start as the Rams beat 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second-teamer came in and he was a freshmman and he just  
was tripping over his words,'' Gruttadauria said of his college 
experience. ``Kurt, he comes in like he's been running this offense 
and we don't have anything to worry about. Business as usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner led NFL Europe, which has a 10-game season, with 2,101  
yards passing and 15 touchdowns for the Amsterdam Admirals in 1998. 
Before that, he amassed 10,164 yards and 183 touchdowns in three 
seasons for the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League. 
Before that, he was the Gateway Conference player of the year at 
Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	But before this season he had thrown only 11 NFL passes in a  
mop-up role in last year's finale, and had only one preseason start 
to get ready after Trent Green went out with a season-ending knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	After the opener, he's not such an unknown anymore. Warner got a  
game ball and tears of joy from coach Dick Vermeil, whose gamble 
not to sign a veteran backup before training camp seems to have 
paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``His overall composure and awareness in all phases of what he  
was doing was far better than anybody could expect,'' Vermeil said. 
``There are a lot of quarterbacks that were first-round picks that 
have been given all the opportunities, all the coaching, all the 
money, all the everything, and they're on their third team -- and 
they're still going to fail -- because they don't have that 
composure, that poise under pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that humility. The first thing Warner said to his teammates  
after the game was an apology of sorts. He told them he'd get 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to read too much into this one, because I know I  
made some mistakes out there,'' said Warner, who was intercepted 
twice -- one was not his fault -- and lost a fumble. ``But it does 
give you a lot of confidence to go out and get a victory, and to 
make some plays. I always believed I could be here and that I could 
do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, 28, admitted to a few anxious moments after Green was  
injured Aug. 28 and the job fell into his lap. He said recently 
he's been waking up in the middle of the night and thinking about 
what exactly he'd do on third-and-5 with the blitz coming. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the anxiety vanished the night before, and take it from  
Gruttadauria, the hands that reached down for the ball were not 
shaking at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has that innate confidence that guys just respect,''  
Gruttadauria said. ``When he's in the huddle, he does all the 
little things that make you feel good and make you want to 
follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner has often said he needs to be a facilitator as much as a  
playmaker. The Rams are loaded with speedy receivers like Isaac 
Bruce (eight catches for 92 yards and a TD), Torry Holt (three for 
34 and a TD) and Az Hakim (five for 63), plus he has the 
multidimensional Marshall Faulk (72 yards receiving, 54 yards 
rushing). 
</P>
<P>
	Warner's passing yardage was adjusted from 316 yards after the  
Elias Sports Bureau reviewed the game. It's the third-highest 
yardage total by a rookie in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to help Kurt,'' Bruce said. ``He hasn't been in that  
situation before and it's up to guys like myself to help Kurt out, 
so he doesn't have the feeling he's the only general on the 
field.''

<HEADLINE> Grand Slam Changes Dates for Tiger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The PGA of America changed the dates of the Grand Slam of Golf  
on Tuesday to make sure Tiger Woods could play in the tournament 
for this year's major championship winners. 
</P>
<P>
	While the PGA accommodated the world's No. 1 player by moving  
the Grand Slam back one week to Nov. 23-24, it did no favors for 
Paul Lawrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Forced to choose between the Grand Slam, originally scheduled  
for Nov. 16-17, and representing his country for the first time in 
the World Cup, which begins Nov. 18 in Malaysia, Lawrie decided to 
go to Hawaii and compete for a $1 million purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland is to be represented in the 45th World Cup by Colin  
Montgomerie, the leading money-winner in Europe, and Dean 
Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA decided to change the dates of the Grand Slam after  
Woods won the PGA Championship at Medinah last month, but committed 
to play in his first World Cup, joining good friend Mark O'Meara. 
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the situation, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said Woods will receive about $1 million in appearance 
fees to play at the Mines Resort in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA spokesman Julius Mason said the Grand Slam dates were  
changed in an effort to get all four major winners to Poipu Bay 
Resort, regardless of who they were. Since moving the unofficial 
event to November in 1991, the Grand Slam has always had all the 
major champions of that year. 
</P>
<P>
	There is still hope for Lawrie to play both. It is not  
unprecedented for Scotland's World Cup team to change, although the 
two-man team of Montgomerie and Robertson was still the official 
entry from the European tour as of Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Woods will be the No. 1 seed because of his  
world ranking and will play Lawrie in the the first 18-hole match 
on Nov. 23, while U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart will play 
Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal in the other match. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners will play Nov. 24, with $400,000 going to the  
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The format changed to match play last year, and Woods beat Vijay  
Singh in the final round. Woods played last year as the first 
alternate because O'Meara won two majors.

<HEADLINE>  U.N. Pulls Out Staff in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Rampaging militiamen were believed to  
have set fire to the abandoned U.N. compound in East Timor today, 
hours after 110 U.N. staff and 1,300 refugees left for safety in 
Australia, a U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining U.N. staff members, holed up in the Australian  
consulate, reported that a black plume of smoke was rising from the 
direction of the compound in the provincial capital of Dili, said 
Fernando del Mundo, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff feared their headquarters had been set ablaze by  
militiamen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaos still gripped Dili, and it was impossible to verify the  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, nearly 1,000 students  
tried to march on parliament, demanding the resignation of 
President B.J. Habibie and the end of military involvement in 
politics -- and blaming both for the bloodshed in East Timor. 
Protesters clashed with police firing plastic bullets and tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military kill people in East Timor. We students must  
challenge them,'' said one protest organizer, who identified 
himself by the single name of Lachman. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was in New York today  
negotiating with U.N. officials on the makeup of a peacekeeping 
force intended to halt the violence that has forced hundreds of 
thousands of East Timorese to flee their homes. U.N. officials have 
said peacekeepers could be on the ground within five days. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapid agreement on deploying a force is vital to saving the  
estimated 300,000 refugees, said Samuel Tamrat, senior political 
officer for the U.N. mission in East Timor, or UNAMET, in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	With many refugees in the hills running out of food and water,  
an Australian government aid agency, AusAID, hoped to start 
dropping food and humanitarian supplies on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ximenes, a spokesman for East Timor's independence  
movement, told Portugal's TSF radio that killings in Dili are 
continuing. Referring to the arrival of peacekeepers, he said: 
``Three or four more days will be too late. We can't defend 
ourselves. We're unarmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based Carter Center, which monitors international  
political crises, said militiamen, backed by the Indonesian 
military, continue to terrorize and murder refugees in camps set up 
in West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, East Timor's spiritual leader said today that he'd  
asked Pope John Paul II to pressure President Clinton for quick 
action to mobilize an international force. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Carlos Belo, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize,  
said he hoped the United States didn't have ``two standards: one 
for Kosovo and one for East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has endorsed the idea of international peacekeepers for  
East Timor, but the United States will not take a lead role. By 
contrast, the United States marshaled NATO forces and international 
peacekeepers for a huge campaign in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he feels Clinton is so vital to getting the  
peacekeeping effort off the ground, Belo said with a smile: 
``Because he's the boss of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, to the echo of sporadic gunfire in the distance,  
the United Nations closed its besieged compound in Dili, flying out 
the staffers and civilians who had become hostage to marauding 
militia and Indonesian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The dozen U.N. personnel who stayed behind are to prepare the  
way for the international peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. compound had become a symbol of U.N. resolve to  
shepherd East Timor to independence and protect its people after 
78.5 percent of voters opted in an Aug. 30 referendum to break away 
from Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a week, guns were fired outside the compound walls  
and cars were smashed and looted. Militiamen threatened to lob in 
grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. staff and East Timorese were evacuated under the guard  
of Indonesian troops through burned-out and looted streets to the 
airport. The Indonesian news agency Antara said one East Timorese 
died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees -- exhausted, bedraggled and in many cases sick --  
arrived later in Australia. They will live in tents in a compound 
outside the northern Australian city of Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the children have chicken pox, and several cases of  
tuberculosis were diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas has said Indonesia prefers Asian countries in the  
peacekeeping force. But he says the government is not setting any 
conditions on the force's makeup -- despite demands by nationalists 
that Australia be barred from participating. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia -- which has been touted as most likely to lead the  
force -- has been the most vocal advocate of a peacekeeping 
contingent in East Timor. Some Indonesians accuse Australia of 
meddling in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Defense Minister John Moore said his country could  
lead a force into East Timor by Saturday if U.N. approval goes 
through. Australia has assembled 4,500 soldiers and equipment on 
24-hour alert in Darwin, an hour's flight from East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there has been no official word on the size of the  
peacekeeping force, estimates say 7,000 troops could be needed.

militia and Indonesian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The dozen U.N. personnel who stayed behind are to prepare the  
way for the international peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. compound had become a symbol of U.N. resolve to  
shepherd East Timor to independence and protect its people after 
78.5 percent of voters opted in an Aug. 30 referendum to break away 
from Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a week, guns were fired outside the compound walls  
and cars were smashed and looted. Militiamen threatened to lob in 
grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. staff and East Timorese were evacuated under the guard  
of Indonesian troops through burned-out and looted streets to the 
airport. The Indonesian news agency Antara said one East Timorese 
died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees -- exhausted, bedraggled and in many cases sick --  
arrived later in Australia. They will live in tents in a compound 
outside the northern Australian city of Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the children have chicken pox, and several cases of  
tuberculosis were diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas has said Indonesia prefers Asian countries in the  
peacekeeping force. But he says the government is not setting any 
conditions on the force's makeup -- despite demands by nationalists 
that Australia be barred from participating. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia -- which has been touted as most likely to lead the  
force -- has been the most vocal advocate of a peacekeeping 
contingent in East Timor. Some Indonesians accuse Australia of 
meddling in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Defense Minister John Moore said his country could  
lead a force into East Timor by Saturday if U.N. approval goes 
through. Australia has assembled 4,500 soldiers and equipment on 
24-hour alert in Darwin, an hour's flight from East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there has been no official word on the size of the  
peacekeeping force, estimates say 7,000 troops could be needed.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Said Spending $47B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG reportedly plans to invest  
$47 billion over the next three years to develop and produce new 
cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-American automaker was expected to unveil the plan  
Tuesday at the Frankfurt International Motor Show, the Financial 
Times of London reported in Tuesday's editions, citing an internal 
company document. Excerpts from the report were released by the 
newspaper's New York office on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for DaimlerChrysler to roll out 64 new passenger  
cars and commercial vehicle models by 2004, the newspaper said. 
That would average about one new model a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The new models could include versions of its `Smart' two-seater  
and a mid-size Chrysler car for Europe, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimistic outlook is based on better-than-expected cost  
savings realized following last year's merger of Diamler-Benz and 
Chrysler, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Coryatt Retires Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The injury-plagued career of Quentin  
Coryatt ended Tuesday with the linebacker telling the Dallas 
Cowboys he won't be joining them this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coryatt, whom Indianapolis took with the No. 2 pick in the 1992  
draft, sat out last season after being released by the Colts late 
in training camp to try and get over the aches and pains that had 
dogged him for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas wanted to sign him last fall, but waited until April. He  
was immediately penciled in as the starting strongside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	But the former Texas A&AMP;M star never even made it into an  
exhibition game. He reaggravated an old Achilles' tendon problem 
and also was having trouble with his surgically reconstructed left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously disappointed,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones  
said. ``I respect his decision. He's been an outstanding football 
player throughout college and the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plans were for him to really make an impact for us  
defensively, so we'll be challenged to pick up the slack without 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the team is not in the market for a linebacker,  
meaning they will stick with second-year player Darren Hambrick, 
who has been playing the strong side. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chan Gailey said Hambrick played fine Sunday in Dallas'  
season-opening victory over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a few things happen,'' Gailey said. ``For the most  
part he played fairly well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys lost Coryatt the same day they learned Pro Bowl  
defensive tackle Leon Lett will miss seven more games as punishment 
for his fifth violation of the league's substance abuse policy. 
Dallas also is waiting for cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Kevin 
Smith to return from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, Coryatt hasn't retired -- yet. His agent, Stephen  
Zucker, was working out the financial arrangements with the Cowboys 
before the team made a roster move. 
</P>
<P>
	Zucker said the 29-year-old Coryatt was disappointed things  
didn't work out because he enjoyed being in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me earlier that he wished he'd found the Cowboys when  
he was coming out of college,'' Zucker said. ``He loved it. He 
tried as hard as he could.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Suspends Cowboys' Lett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- After three months of waiting, the Dallas  
Cowboys learned Tuesday they can hold their nearly annual ``Welcome 
Back Leon Lett'' celebration on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	That date will mark the end of Lett's third substance-abuse  
suspension since 1995. The Cowboys' best run-stopper can return to 
the lineup for the Nov. 14 home game against Green Bay after 
missing the first eight games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue had been mulling over the  
penalty since he suspended Lett indefinitely on June 4. The 
half-season punishment was longer than team owner Jerry Jones 
expected, but he's simply happy to know exactly when Lett will be 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an outstanding football player,'' Jones said. ``We need  
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With five violations of the NFL's substance abuse policy, Lett  
is among the biggest reasons why Dallas' image has been tarnished 
in recent years. Yet Jones said he still believes in Lett. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does not have dependency or addiction,'' Jones said.  
``That's not to say there are not issues, but those are not two of 
them. That is a meaningful part of why I want him on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The substance-abuse program doesn't force players to miss games  
for their first two violations. A third violation draws a four-game 
suspension and a fourth violation gets a ban of at least one year. 
After that, it's up to the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys were hoping Tagliabue would only suspend Lett for  
four games, as he did the last five-time violator, Clayton Holmes. 
The commissioner instead set a new standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he believes Tagliabue took his time making the  
announcement because the penalty will be looked to again for other 
five-time offenders. Tagliabue added that Lett would be suspended 
for a year if he has another violation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commissioner was looking for a long-term way to handle  
these types of circumstances,'' Jones said. ``He was looking to 
potentially establish a standard that would publicly point out the 
seriousness and importance the league is placing in this area of 
substance abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lett was not available for comment, but Jones said he spoke with  
him about the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly regrets every aspect of this thing,'' Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Lett missed four games in 1995 after testing  
positive for marijuana, then the last three games of 1996 and the 
first 13 of 1997 after testing positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the Pro Bowl last season with 51 tackles, four sacks, 20  
quarterback pressures and a team-high seven tackles for losses. His 
other Pro Bowl trip was in 1994, his previous full season. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting a victory over Washington last Sunday, Dallas has gone  
12-9 during Lett's suspensions. That .571 winning percentage is 
actually better than their .556 percentage (20-16) with him since 
he began missing games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cowboys know they need his 6-foot-6, 300-pound body  
plugging the middle of their defensive line, especially after 
allowing 504 yards to the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett's third game back would be against Miami on Thanksgiving in  
Texas Stadium, bringing back memories of one of the worst blunders 
in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	On a snowy Thanksgiving in 1993, Lett mistakenly tried picking  
up a missed field goal that would've been a dead ball. Instead, he 
knocked it to a Dolphin, setting up Miami's successful 
second-chance kick for the victory as time expired.

<HEADLINE> Stanford President Stepping Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- The president of Stanford University  
said Tuesday that he'll resign by next summer after eight years as 
the head of one of the country's most prestigious universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerhard Casper, a 61-year-old constitutional law scholar, said  
he will take a sabbatical and then return to teach at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for me to make this my last year as  
president of Stanford,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Casper has recently faced criticism over the financially  
troubled merger of Stanford's teaching hospital with the University 
of California at San Francisco's hospitals. Together, they lost $60 
million in the second year after the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	While president of Stanford, a job that paid him $375,622 last  
year, Casper has focused on improving undergraduate curriculum, 
launching a new program for freshmen and sophomores that encourage 
mentoring relationships between students and faculty.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Offers Direct Car Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- In another step toward selling cars over the  
Internet, a new Web site allows car buyers to pick out specific 
cars from a dealer's inventory and agree to a price online. 
</P>
<P>
	Unveiled Monday, Uautobid.com is one of several sites vying for  
online car buyers, competing against companies such as Autoweb.com, 
Microsoft Corp.'s CarPoint, Autobytel.com Inc. and major 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sites allow consumers to get online bids from  
participating dealers on new cars and trucks. After a request for a 
price is submitted, the dealer contacts the consumer and handles 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	A few sites, including CarsDirect.com and megadealer  
AutoNation's new Web site, AutoNationDirect.com, also try to sell 
cars directly to online buyers. Customers choose a make and model, 
then agree to a price online. The sites then find vehicles that 
match those terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Uautobid, based in New York, links buyers with a specific  
vehicle on a dealer's lot. Dealers who post cars on the site have 
agreed to sell the vehicle for a certain price. When a customer 
submits a bid that meets the price, the purchase is confirmed with 
a $250 deposit. The customer then has 48 hours to finish the deal 
at the dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers bid based on a suggested retail price or in an  
auction. They will not see the selling price agreed to by the 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is a venture of Interstate National Dealer Services  
Inc., which sells service contracts and extended warranties to 
vehicle dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	James McQuivey, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc.,  
said his firm estimates that by 2003, about 500,000 vehicles will 
be bought directly over the Internet out of 16 million sold 
nationwide.

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Benjamin S. Bloom, an education professor whose  
research led to an upsurge in interest in early childhood 
education, including the creation of the Head Start program, died 
Monday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom, the Charles W. Swift Distinguished Service Professor  
Emeritus in Education at the University of Chicago, and known for 
expanding notions of who was capable of learning and performing 
well in school. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, Bloom demonstrated that 50 percent of the  
variations in intelligence at age 17 can be estimated at age 4. 
That, and research showing that early experiences at home impact 
learning later in life, led in part to the establishment of Head 
Start. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom went on to advance a theory that said all students are  
capable of learning if material is presented in a logical, 
systematic way. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, Bloom wrote 17 books and served as president  
of the American Educational Research Association.

		   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Harry Crane, co-creator of Jackie  
Gleason's classic 1950s sitcom ``The Honeymooners'' and comedy 
writer for Red Skelton, the Marx Brothers, Bing Crosby and others, 
died Tuesday of cancer. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	The writer, who worked on movies as well as TV, had another link  
to Hollywood: He was the grandfather of actresses Melissa Gilbert 
(``Little House on the Prairie'') and Sara Gilbert (``Roseanne''). 
</P>
<P>
	The native of New York City was 19 when he started performing  
stand-up comedy. He was recruited by MGM as a screenwriter, earning 
his first credit on ``Air Raid Wardens'' (1943), starring Stan 
Laurel and Oliver Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Joe Bigelow were staff writers for ``Cavalcade of Stars''  
when Gleason, the variety show's new host, asked for help in 
developing a sketch. 
</P>
<P>
	Gleason told the writers he wanted to play an ``everyday working  
stiff'' who lived with his long-suffering wife in a little Brooklyn 
flat, according to the book ``Classic Sitcoms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two created a scene involving squabbling Ralph and Alice  
Kramden, and the couple became a variety show mainstay for Gleason 
and then in 1955 the basis for the 39-episode sitcom ``The 
Honeymooners.''

LaGrange Daily News for 34 years, died Monday of leukemia. He was 
74. 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over as publisher on Sept. 1, 1961, Long dedicated  
the newspaper to attracting new and diversified jobs. He 
spearheaded a drive to organize a chamber of commerce, twice

<HEADLINE> British Inflation at 36-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's annual inflation rate fell in August to  
1.1 percent, its lowest level in 36 years, the Office for National 
Statistics said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Good harvests for seasonal vegetables and lower clothing costs  
were among the main reasons for the decline, which was partially 
offset by higher gasoline prices. The year-to-year inflation rate 
was 1.3 percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The decrease in consumer prices is likely to reassure the Bank  
of England, which only last week raised a key lending rate in an 
effort to cool Britain's surging housing market and other 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest inflation figure is the lowest since July 1963, when  
the rate stood at 0.8 percent, the statistics office said. The peak 
inflation rate since that time, 26.9 percent, came in August 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	An adjusted measure of inflation -- the so-called underlying  
rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments -- was 2.1 percent 
in August, its lowest level since October 1994, the office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The underlying rate is the measure chosen by the government as  
the focus for its efforts to control inflation. The government's 
targeted rate is 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlying inflation was 2.2 percent in July.

<HEADLINE> Emmy Awards Top Nielsen Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe the interpretive dance medley by hosts  
Jenna Elfman and David Hyde Pierce was to blame: Fox's Sunday 
telecast of the Emmy Awards drew the lowest ratings for 
television's big night since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the telecast's estimated 17.4 million viewers was easily  
the most-watched program of the week, a lull before the upcoming 
storm of season premieres. It was the first time a Fox 
entertainment program has ranked No. 1 during the week in all of 
Nielsen Media Research's measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	But the audience was still 1.9 million people smaller than the  
one watching NBC's Emmy telecast last year. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, led last week by its twin ``60 Minutes'' broadcasts,  
narrowly won the week with a 6.7 rating and 12 share. Fox had a 6.6 
rating and 11 share, and was easily the most popular network among 
the advertiser-prized 18-49 audience. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was third with a 6.3 rating and 11 share, ABC had a 5.7  
rating and 10 share, and the WB and UPN tied with 2.2 ratings and 4 
shares. Pax TV had a 0.9 rating and 2 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox also got a jolt of negative attention from Sen. Joseph  
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, and former U.S. Education 
Secretary William Bennett. The two gave Fox its ``Silver Sewer 
Award'' for its ``tireless, tasteless and ongoing efforts to drag 
down network programming standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two politicians criticized the new Fox series, ``Get Real,''  
for showing a mother finding her teen-aged son in bed with his 
girlfriend. The show premiered last week to lackluster ratings, 
finishing in 50th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox issued a statement saying its programs had been rated  
appropriately under the industry's voluntary standards to warn 
viewers of content. The network said it respected viewers' freedom 
to choose their own entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and the ``NBC Nightly News'' tied  
for first in the evening news ratings race with 7.0 ratings and 16 
shares. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.0 rating and 13 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Sept. 6-12, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were:

<HEADLINE> Corinth Museum Pieces Found in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- More than 200 ancient objects stolen from  
a Corinth museum nine years ago were found in a Florida storage 
area by the FBI and Greek authorities, Greece's culture minister 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the biggest, if not the biggest, antiquities  
thefts,'' Culture Minister Elisavet Papazoi said. ``We are happy 
that they were found in good condition, and they will soon be back 
in Greece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acting on a tip last week, authorities discovered all but three  
of the 271 stolen objects. They were wrapped in plastic and masking 
tape and hidden in fish crates in a storage area in Miami, Athens 
Police Chief Pavlos Roubis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roubis would not give any details of the exact location or  
provide further details of the bust. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Archaeologists on Monday identified the antiquities as those  
stolen in April 1990 from the Archaeology Museum in Corinth, 50 
miles southwest of Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, police said at least four people broke into the  
building, tied up the guard, cleaned out most of the museum's 
displays, loaded the objects onto trucks and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like moving a whole museum,'' Papazoi said. The museum  
has since been fitted with an alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Greek culture ministry received information that  
the stolen artifacts had been transported to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The stolen antiquities include such rare pieces as a 5th century  
B.C. marble head of a young man known as a Kouros; a small marble 
statue of Pan, the pastoral god of fertility; 13 marble sculpted 
heads dating back to the Hellenistic and Roman periods; and 164 
varied pouring vessels, urns and wine jugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three items still missing are a marble bust of Julius  
Caesar, thought to have been carved after his death in 44 B.C., and 
carved marble heads of Eros and the Ptolemaic god Serapis. 
</P>
<P>
	The antiquities were taken to FBI offices in New York and should  
be returned to Greece within two months, Papazoi said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Drafts Pesticide Regulations / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- With a big judicial nudge, California  
pesticide regulators are drafting the first statewide regulations 
governing the use of methyl bromide, a fumigant treasured by 
farmers but poisonous to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a court order, the state Department of Pesticide  
Regulation must shape a set of formal guidelines by June 2000, 
incorporating public opinion and the views of other stakeholders 
throughout the rule-making process. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of environmental groups, which in a lawsuit accused  
the agency of failing to obey a 10-year-old state law requiring 
clear, uniform and enforceable regulations, wanted a quicker 
timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the groups say they are encouraged that DPR Director Paul  
E. Helliker has actively solicited watchdog groups for input as his 
department formulates a plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Helliker ``is making steps in the right direction for reducing  
the impact of toxins in California,'' said Susan Kegley, a staff 
scientist for the Pesticide Action Network in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Methyl bromide, an odorless, colorless gas, is used worldwide,  
mostly by strawberry and tomato growers, to purge soil of insects, 
mites, rodents and weeds before plantings. A potent pest killer 
also used by exterminators, the fumigant is highly poisonous to 
humans and has been blamed for damaging the Earth's protective 
ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the most recent state data, 361 people were  
definitely or probably poisoned by methyl bromide from 1982 to 
1996; of these, 248 involved farm uses. Environmentalists believe 
the toll is much greater because many people suffering from 
pesticide poisoning assume they have the flu or another common 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemical also has caused 19 deaths since 1982, all of them  
occurring off farms, when people entered fumigated buildings before 
the gas had dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an amendment to the Clean Air Act, the pesticide must be  
reduced 25 percent this year in the United States, 50 percent in 
2001, 70 percent in 2003, and fully banned by 2005. Millions of 
public and private dollars are being spent in a race to find an 
alternative before the phase-out. 
</P>
<P>
	California already has the strictest system for regulating  
highly toxic pesticides. It's the only state requiring users of 
such materials to obtain both special training and site-specific 
permits from county agricultural commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	But a main contention in the lawsuit against DPR was that permit  
guidelines could be changed without notice and that enforcement was 
subject to local discretion, leaving too many inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
	To remedy the problem, the DPR announced Monday that it may  
force methyl bromide users to provide buffer zones around schools 
and neighborhoods. The agency also is reevaluating whether 
statewide rules are needed for other high-risk pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	DPR must submit proposed regulations to the Office of  
Administrative Law by the end of the year. A formal comment period 
is required for public input. And the state must submit regular 
reports to the judge until he determines the agency has complied. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we'd like to do is get a lot of input from a lot of  
people before we propose anything,'' said DPR spokeswoman Veda 
Federighi. ``That way we can put them in place more quickly.''

<HEADLINE> Pacific Century To Cut 1,015 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The parent company of Hawaii's largest bank  
plans to cut 1,015 positions, or one-fifth of its work force, as 
part of a corporate restructuring aimed at boosting its sagging 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pacific Century Financial Corp. officials said Monday that  
fewer than 266 workers actually will lose their jobs since most of 
the reductions will come from a hiring freeze begun last year, 
early retirement and attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Honolulu-based corporation expects to generate $21 million a  
year in new revenue and save $43 million annually in operating 
expenses when the redesign is fully implemented by the fourth 
quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation's board also authorized the repurchase of up to  
300,000 shares of common stock per quarter beginning in the fourth 
quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Century, a $14.6 billion financial services company  
whose main subsidiary is Bank of Hawaii, employs 5,200 people in 
Hawaii, California, Arizona, Asia, Guam, the Northern Mariana 
Islands and the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of the 1,015 targeted positions are in Hawaii.  
The remaining 20 percent are in the Western Pacific and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's world, it's all about creating value and being able  
to compete globally, and for many years here in Hawaii I don't 
believe that companies had to worry too much about value and 
competing globally,'' said Lawrence Johnson, chairman and chief 
executive of Pacific Century and Bank of Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Lett Suspended Seven Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Leon Lett  
will miss the next seven games as punishment for his fifth 
violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett, 30, had been suspended indefinitely since June 4 and  
missed the team's opening win at Washington on Sunday. The NFL's 
ruling, announced today, will allow the former Pro Bowler to rejoin 
the Cowboys for the Nov. 14 home game against Green Bay -- if he has 
no further violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed, but I'm glad we have a definitive time we  
can expect him back,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ``We're 
disappointed we don't have him now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue also told Lett he will be suspended  
for at least one year should he violate the substance abuse policy 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently banned from the team's workouts and premises, Lett is  
allowed to return Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett's absence Sunday contributed to a defensive breakdown that  
allowed the Redskins to score 32 straight points. The Cowboys won 
in overtime 41-35. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Tagliabue took his time weighing several factors in a  
decision that could set a precedent for other players who reach 
this stage in the league's after-care program. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner could have given Lett up to a lifetime ban but  
instead opted to double the penalty he gave the previous five-time 
violator, Clayton Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	The precedent ``was not set'' with Holmes, Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lett was not immediately available for comment. His agent, Jim  
Steiner of St. Louis, said he was surprised that Jones made the 
announcement and declined further comment until he had spoken with 
Lett or Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the fourth season in the last five that Lett has missed  
games because of suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed four games in 1995 after testing positive for  
marijuana, then the last three games of 1996 and the first 13 of 
1997 after testing positive for cocaine. Dallas has gone 11-9 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
	When he plays, the 6-foot-6, 300-pound Lett remains a dominant  
force. He's made the Pro Bowl in his last two full seasons, 1994 
and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he had 51 tackles, four sacks, 20 quarterback  
pressures and a team-high seven tackles for losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Confidentiality rules prohibit the NFL from commenting on  
specific cases. However, according to the league's substance abuse 
policy, a player would have to violate the rules five times to be 
treated the way Lett has been. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the first two violations do not result in suspensions,  
they are not publicized. The third violation is a four-game 
suspension and the fourth violation draws a ban of at least one 
year. Punishment for the fifth violation is at the commissioner's 
discretion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue considered several factors, including how many tests  
Lett has passed since he was reinstated in November 1997 and how 
cooperative he's been with the process. Lett has been tested up to 
10 times a month for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys made Lett a seventh-round draft pick out of Emporia  
State in 1991. He quickly blossomed into a key player in their 
defensive line rotation and was part of the Super Bowl champion 
teams in 1992, '93 and '95. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett also is remembered for two on-field gaffes.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 1993 Super Bowl, Lett set a record for returning a fumble  
64 yards -- but he needed 65 for a touchdown. Thinking he'd score 
easily, Lett was raising the ball in celebration when Buffalo's Don 
Beebe swatted it away from behind at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	The following November, in a snowy Thanksgiving Day game against  
the Miami Dolphins, Lett mistakenly tried picking up a missed field 
goal instead of letting it become a dead ball. He ended up knocking 
it to a Dolphin, setting up Miami's successful second chance kick 
for the victory.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Retire Elway's No. 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway gave Denver one last Mile High memory  
before the Miami Dolphins spoiled the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	On the field where he won 105 games, Elway was inducted into the  
Broncos' Ring of Fame on Monday night and watched as the familiar 
No. 7 jersey he wore for 16 seasons was retired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos could have used their longtime quarterback as they  
trailed 17-7 at halftime and lost 38-21. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by his wife, Janet, and their four children, Elway  
turned his 15-minute tribute at halftime into an emotional 
dedication to the fans who watched him grow from an immature 
quarterback to a certain Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy that the Baltimore Colts traded me here, you  
can't believe it,'' Elway said, his voice wavering. ``I'm going to 
miss you, but I'm not going to be far away because I'm going to be 
a Denver Bronco forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his retirement speech in April, Elway remained fairly  
composed as he addressed the crowd of 76,000 at Mile High Stadium. 
He walked onto the field to Billy Idol's ``Rebel Yell'' and flashed 
a thumbs up to about 100 men dressed in white No. 7 jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes there is a player that becomes so important to us  
and so much our hero that his number and name become synonymous,'' 
Denver owner Pat Bowlen said. ``There will never be another No. 7 
on the Broncos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tears formed in Elway's eyes as his name was unveiled on the  
facade of the stadium's northwest corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd really like to say what an honor it is to see my name up  
there,'' Elway said. ``To have my name associated with the Ring of 
Fame is truly a great honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who retired after winning his second straight Super Bowl  
title, is the 16th member of Denver's Ring of Fame and the first 
inductee since Louis Wright was inducted in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos waived the mandatory five-year waiting period for  
Elway's induction. He is sure to be inducted into the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame when he becomes eligible in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Dan Marino, who was in the Miami locker room during the  
halftime ceremony, has more passing yards than Elway, who finished 
with 51,475. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also had 300 career touchdown passes and an NFL-leading  
148 victories as a starter. Marino is second with 142. 
</P>
<P>
	The statistic Elway will be remembered best for is his 47  
game-tying or game-winning drives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to clue the world in on this Mile High magic,''  
Elway told the fans. ``They can talk about the altitude. They can 
talk about the field. They can talk about everything, but the key 
thing to Mile High magic is you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Elway watched from a luxury box as Broncos  
alumni were introduced. He looked calm, sipping occasionally from a 
Coors bottle and talking to his 8-year-old daughter Juliana.

<HEADLINE> Senator Wants Youth Violence Fought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Youth violence is a public health threat, and  
the surgeon general should lead the fight against it, a Republican 
senator told the Clinton administration Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all we've seen, it makes sense to get into the realm of  
prevention,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who heads the 
Appropriations Committee panel that oversees funding for such 
programs. ``We think the surgeon general is a good person to head 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since April's deadly shooting rampage at Columbine High School  
in Littleton, Colo., federal policymakers have accused the 
entertainment industry, the media, the Internet, gun availability, 
lax school security and uninvolved parents, among others, of having 
a role in fomenting or simply allowing such violence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, three Cabinet secretaries and the deputy attorney  
general testified before Specter's subcommittee on how their 
agencies -- the Education, Health and Human Services, Labor and 
Justice Departments -- were helping states and communities create 
better school, home and work environments. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses also sought more funding for such efforts.  
</P>
<P>
	Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala  
acknowledged the public health angle of youth violence but said the 
surgeon general's office -- which she oversees -- lacks the resources 
to take the lead in administering the myriad of programs. The 
surgeon general is chiefly a national spokesman on administration 
health policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Violence is one of many youth risk behaviors that are  
preventable, but there are no easy answers, short cuts or 
panaceas,'' she said. ``We are working to establish a White House 
Council on Youth Violence, which will be an interagency 
coordinating body for federal youth violence services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said President Clinton gave Surgeon General David  
Satcher a key role at this year's White House conference on youth 
violence when he directed Satcher to conduct a landmark study on 
its causes. A 1972 surgeon general study documented how some 
children imitate violent television scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a central person,'' Specter said. ``If you have a  
better candidate, I'm open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for funding, Specter's panel and its House counterpart will  
largely determine how $300 billion will be allocated for fiscal 
2000, beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had $1 billion worth of applications for a program that  
we only have $200 million for,'' said Education Secretary Richard 
W. Riley, referring to the department's after-school efforts 
designed to give idle youth constructive alternatives. ``As you 
know, current funding remains billions below the president's 
request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis Herman promoted a $2.7 billion youth  
employment program saying, ``The best crime-prevention strategy is 
a jobs-promotion strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is sponsoring several programs to combat  
delinquency, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Specter suggested the pie is not that big, saying,  
``We've only scratched the surface as best we can.''

<HEADLINE> Automakers Walk Off Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG workers in  
Missouri and Indiana walked off their jobs Tuesday night as 
contract talks between the United Auto Workers and automakers 
intensified before a midnight deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers on the second shift at two DaimlerChrysler plants in  
Fenton, Mo., outside of St. Louis, walked off the job at 9:45 p.m. 
The plants, which make the highly profitable Dodge Ram trucks and 
DaimlerChrysler's minivans employ about 7,100. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 minutes later, workers at two transmission plants and a  
casting plant in Kokomo, Ind., walked off the job, DaimlerChrysler 
said. Those plants employ a total of 8,400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokesman David Barnas said the union has not  
told DaimlerChrysler the reason for the walkouts. Barnas said he 
was unsure how many workers were on the job when the walkout took 
place. Officials at locals in Missouri and Indiana could not be 
immediately reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which has said little about the progress of the talks  
to replace contracts covering 407,000 workers, including 75,000 
workers at DaimlerChrysler. Officials met at the German-American 
automaker's U.S. offices in Auburn Hills late into Monday night and 
resumed talks early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While UAW President Stephen P. Yokich has praised  
DaimlerChrysler's offers, there were other signs the union was 
prepared to fight. Officers at local unions in Detroit and Warren 
also said they were preparing to walk out at midnight if a contract 
extension was not granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton  
said talks were proceeding, but that wages and job security issues 
were still on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations are proceeding very, very well ... but it  
isn't over 'til it's over and we'll all just have to wait and 
see,'' DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton told the cable 
financial network CNBC in an interview Tuesday morning from 
Frankfurt, Germany, where he was attending an industry trade show. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations were also under way with General Motors Corp. and  
Ford Motor Co. UAW negotiators met at GM over the weekend, but did 
not meet at Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the union has extended contracts past the deadline.  
Ford spokesman Ed Miller said the UAW had indefinitely extended 
Ford's contract on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An extension has yet to be arranged for DaimlerChrysler or GM,  
but experts said a strike that would threaten a boom year for the 
auto industry seems unlikely. The UAW has not called a national 
strike during contract negotiations since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW usually chooses one automaker to make a deal with first,  
then uses that deal as a template for other contracts. This year, 
Yokich has kept talks going with both GM and DaimlerChrysler, and 
refused to publicly name a target. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have released little information about the talks.  
Wages, job security, health-care costs, overtime demands and the 
assignment of work to outside suppliers were expected to be among 
the top issues in this year's talks, as they were during the last 
round in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of  
record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more 
than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few indications of what proposals the UAW and  
DaimlerChrysler might be negotiating. The union has discussed 
efforts to organize DaimlerChrysler's nonunion plants in the United 
States: a Mercedes-Benz sport utility factory in Alabama with 1,600 
workers and at Freightliner commercial truck plants in the 
Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW leaders have complained about company moves against  
organizers. DaimlerChrysler has vowed to remain neutral in the 
UAW's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	It is against federal labor rules for the issue to be part of  
the UAW's contract. But problems in the organizing campaign will 
affect DaimlerChrysler's relationship with its largest U.S. union. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages are an issue at GM, which has sought to mend fences with  
the UAW after last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint, Mich., 
parts factories that virtually shut down the automaker's North 
American production. 
</P>
<P>
	According to union newsletters, the UAW has asked GM for higher  
wages, and sought better overtime compensation with more money and 
extra time off. In recent years, automakers have held down 
employment by increasing overtime; the average GM hourly worker 
adds about 9 hours of overtime a week. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has offered to guarantee lifetime employment for workers with  
at least 10 years of experience; DaimlerChrysler reportedly has 
offered a similar proposal. In return, the companies would likely 
seek more flexibility in hiring or job rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The thorniest issue appears to be at Ford, which would like to  
spin off its Visteon parts unit that employs 23,500 UAW workers. 
The UAW is opposed to the move, fearing job cuts and lower wages at 
a separate company.

	The union, which has said little about the progress of the  
talks, appeared to be negotiating hardest with DaimlerChrysler AG. 
Officials met at the German-American automaker's U.S. offices in 
Auburn Hills late into Monday night and resumed talks early 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While UAW President Stephen P. Yokich has praised  
DaimlerChrysler's offers, there were signs the union was prepared 
to fight. Officers at local unions in Detroit, Warren and Fenton, 
Mo., said they were preparing to walk out at midnight if a contract 
extension was not granted. 
</P>
<P>
	A DaimlerChrysler spokesperson said the company was aware of  
such preparations, but was hopeful a new contract could be agreed 
to without a work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton  
said talks were proceeding, but that wages and job security issues 
were still on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations are proceeding very, very well ... but it  
isn't over 'til it's over and we'll all just have to wait and 
see,'' DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton told the cable 
financial network CNBC in an interview Tuesday morning from 
Frankfurt, Germany, where he was attending an industry trade show. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations were also under way with General Motors Corp. and  
Ford Motor Co. UAW negotiators met at GM over the weekend, but did 
not meet at Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the union has extended contracts past the deadline.  
Ford spokesman Ed Miller said the UAW had indefinitely extended 
Ford's contract on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An extension has yet to be arranged for DaimlerChrysler or GM,  
but experts said a strike that would threaten a boom year for the 
auto industry seems unlikely. The UAW has not called a national 
strike during contract negotiations since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW usually chooses one automaker to make a deal with first,  
then uses that deal as a template for other contracts. This year, 
Yokich has kept talks going with both GM and DaimlerChrysler, and 
refused to publicly name a target. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have released little information about the talks.  
Wages, job security, health-care costs, overtime demands and the 
assignment of work to outside suppliers were expected to be among 
the top issues in this year's talks, as they were during the last 
round in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of  
record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more 
than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few indications of what proposals the UAW and  
DaimlerChrysler might be negotiating. The union has discussed 
efforts to organize DaimlerChrysler's nonunion plants in the United 
States: a Mercedes-Benz sport utility factory in Alabama with 1,600 
workers and at Freightliner commercial truck plants in the 
Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW leaders have complained about company moves against  
organizers. DaimlerChrysler has vowed to remain neutral in the 
UAW's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	It is against federal labor rules for the issue to be part of  
the UAW's contract. But problems in the organizing campaign will 
affect DaimlerChrysler's relationship with its largest U.S. union. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages are an issue at GM, which has sought to mend fences with  
the UAW after last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint, Mich., 
parts factories that virtually shut down the automaker's North 
American production. 
</P>
<P>
	According to union newsletters, the UAW has asked GM for higher  
wages, and sought better overtime compensation with more money and 
extra time off. In recent years, automakers have held down 
employment by increasing overtime; the average GM hourly worker 
adds about 9 hours of overtime a week. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has offered to guarantee lifetime employment for workers with  
at least 10 years of experience; DaimlerChrysler reportedly has 
offered a similar proposal. In return, the companies would likely 
seek more flexibility in hiring or job rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The thorniest issue appears to be at Ford, which would like to  
spin off its Visteon parts unit that employs 23,500 UAW workers. 
The UAW is opposed to the move, fearing job cuts and lower wages at 
a separate company.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gov'ts Ignore IMF Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Critics often blame the International Monetary  
Fund for failing to predict or prevent financial crises, but a new 
report concludes that governments do not heed IMF warnings designed 
to fend off economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	But the independent report, commissioned by the agency, says IMF  
monitoring of the economies of its 182 member nations has failed to 
keep pace with the globalization of financial markets and the 
increased importance of billions of dollars moving around the world 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF assembled a group of experts headed by John Crow, former  
governor of the Bank of Canada, to look at IMF economic monitoring, 
or ``surveillance,'' in 12 countries and recommend how to improve 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 countries included Thailand, where the global financial  
crisis began in July 1997, Korea and Brazil. All received 
multibillion dollar IMF rescue packages as their economies neared 
collapse over the next 20 months. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem the report found is that the IMF lacks the political  
clout to enforce its recommendations. As an international financial 
institution, it recommends remedial actions to keep countries out 
of economic trouble but can't force them to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a disjunction between what the rest of the world  
thinks the IMF can do'' in a crisis ``and what insiders think,'' 
Crow said, presenting the report at a news conference a week before 
the Washington-based IMF holds its annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IMF is never a primary influence, but it can play a role  
in a debate'' on what to do, he said. ``Political considerations 
almost always dominate over fund warnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These considerations can include an impending presidential  
election or a government protecting companies or individuals with 
whom it has close ties, a practice known as crony capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Crow also said the IMF was slow to apply in the Asian crisis in  
late 1997 lessons learned when the it stepped in to bail out Mexico 
in 1995 during the peso crisis, particularly involving 
vulnerabilities in domestic financial systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The report stressed ``the need to focus surveillance more  
directly on the international aspects of a country's situation, the 
linkages across countries and the lessons countries can learn from 
other experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It recommended that IMF surveillance should focus only its core  
specialty areas of exchange-rate policy and directly associated 
macroeconomic policies and leave social and labor issues to 
organizations such as the World Bank and the International Labor 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Both IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and members of the  
IMF's executive board said the recommendation runs counter to 
demands of IMF members and the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional critics of the IMF, among others, have demanded  
that the agency increase emphasis on the interaction between 
economic policy and issues such as labor reform and protection of 
the environment.

<HEADLINE> Drugs Cause Multiple-Birth Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Triplets ... quadruplets ... quintuplets ...  
and more -- there's a boom in babies arriving in bunches. 
</P>
<P>
	Frazzled moms and dads welcomed more than 6,700 of these bundles  
of joy in 1997, a fourfold jump in less than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	And more than 104,000 babies were born with one sibling in 1997,  
a 52 percent increase in twins, according to a report released 
Tuesday documenting the huge increase in numbers of U.S. multiple 
births. 
</P>
<P>
	The soaring popularity of fertility drugs combined with women  
waiting longer to have children explain the ``unprecedented'' 
trend, the National Center for Health Statistics said in 
documenting trends from 1980 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase is particularly striking among older women: More  
twins were born to women in their late 40s in 1997 than in all of 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine being 48 years old and having quadruplets,'' said John  
Kiely, a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Medical 
Center of Cincinnati. ``Up until recently, women that old couldn't 
even get pregnant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The steep climb is attributed largely to older women, who are  
more likely to have a naturally occurring multiple birth to begin 
with. They're also likely to encounter trouble getting pregnant and 
therefore more likely to try fertility drugs, where doctors 
fertilize several eggs in hopes that at least one survives. Often, 
more than one does. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty years ago, women didn't wait so long to start families.  
``Now they're in the work force and they want to develop a career'' 
before giving birth, said Dr. Louis Keith, president of the Center 
for the Study of Multiple Births at Northwestern University Medical 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	And the science has kept up with the social trends.  
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1970s, doctors began using hormonal drugs, which  
prompt women to produce several eggs at a time. Their use 
skyrocketed in the late 1980s as techniques caught on that help 
fertilize eggs both inside and outside the womb. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers estimate that about one-third of the increase is due  
to older women having babies, with two-thirds attributable to 
fertility treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite warm and fuzzy publicity surrounding large births --  
remember the seven babies from Iowa -- the trend is not all good 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies born in groups, particularly of three or more, are more  
likely to die as infants or to be dangerously small, which can lead 
to vision and hearing impairments, mental retardation and 
developmental delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Twins are almost five times as likely to die in their first year  
as single births, and babies from triplets, quadruplets and larger 
groups are more than 10 times as likely to die as infants. 
</P>
<P>
	Twins are about nine times as likely to be under 3.3 pounds, or  
``very low birth weight,'' than infants born alone. The risk is 
about the same for being ``low birth weight,'' or under 5.5 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	For babies in larger groups, chances are even greater. More than  
one in three of these babies is under 3.3 pounds, compared to just 
1 percent of single births. And 93 percent of them weigh less than 
5.5 pounds, compared to 6 percent of single births. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very high-risk births,'' said Joyce Martin, the  
report's lead author. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase is likely to continue unless fertility specialists  
change aggressive treatments, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these women have been trying for years to get pregnant  
and can't, and it's a great joy to them,'' said Kiely. But, he 
suggested, there should be a ``national debate about whether 
fertility drugs and fertility treatments are being overused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just the babies at risk. Mothers also face  
significantly greater risk of developing anemia, high blood 
pressure or convulsions during pregnancy, according to research 
Keith is presenting at a conference this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, based on data from birth certificates, also found  
that women in certain states, generally in the Northeast, were more 
likely to have multiple births. 
</P>
<P>
	The triplet-and-up birth rates in New Jersey and Nebraska were  
twice the national rate. And the twin birth rates in Massachusetts 
and Connecticut were 25 percent higher than average. Women in the 
Southwest generally had lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the variation comes because women in some  
states tend to be older. They also noted that fertility clinics, 
while found across the country, are concentrated in the Northeast.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Names New Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A leading figure in the financial world on  
Monday was named head of the 16 museums of the Smithsonian 
Institution and the National Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence M. Small, 58, will become the 11th secretary of the  
Smithsonian in January. He is leaving his job as president of 
Fannie Mae, one of the principle U.S. home mortgage financing 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian, founded in 1846, runs the national museums of  
American History, American Art, Natural History, Air and Space and 
others in the capital. It employs 6,400 people and annually hosts 
more than 30 million visitors at its 17 facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Small will succeed I. Michael Heyman, 69, a former law professor  
and university chancellor, who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``With distance learning so important today, with means of  
communication that never existed in the past, with the ability to 
take parts of the Smithsonian's 142 million ... items of art and 
artifacts and move them around more,'' he told reporters, ``I can 
see an institution that is far more involved with local communities 
and the representatives of those communities in Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small, who studied Spanish literature at Brown University and  
the flamenco guitar in Spain, is a longtime collector of art from 
the rain forests of South America and Africa. He has served on the 
boards of the Joffrey Ballet, the National Building Museum and on 
the council of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial, and he was treasurer of 
Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber Conable, a former Republican Congressman from New York  
who served on the search committee, said Small was selected from 
more than 250 candidates and was chosen ``unanimously, which has 
not always been so in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress appropriated $412 million this year for the  
Smithsonian. Last year it earned another $147 million from its 
magazines and other activities. Last month Gary Beer, organizer of 
the Sundance Film Festival for independent producers, took over as 
head of the newly established Smithsonian Business Ventures.

	PULP FICTION: Move over paper media, electronic information is

found newsprint will be the biggest losers by the year 2003. But it 
won't be completely over for the pulp and paper industry. Office 
and home printers will be working overtime, and the study predicts 
that the amount of paper used at home will double 1996 consumption 
levels by 2003.

	ELDER CARE SCARE: Baby boomers could be headed for big trouble.  
A survey by the American Health Care Association found the

financially prepared for long-term care. Another 50 percent 
admitted not having given any thought as to how to pay 
post-retirement costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The study suggests those in their 30s and 40s who don't start  
saving from their paychecks now may one day wake up in a nursing

has spent nearly all his or her life savings.

questions whether entrepreneurs must first fail to later succeed. 
The study contends that more teaching of entrepreneurial skills is 
needed, especially at the primary school level.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Floyd Pummels Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd vented its fury on the  
Bahamas on Tuesday -- toppling trees and power lines, stripping 
roofs off homes and shoving a roiling sea into streets. 
</P>
<P>
	As Floyd bore down on the U.S. coast, 2 million people were  
urged to leave their homes in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. 
President Clinton issued pre-emptive disaster declarations for 
Florida and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bahamas, Floyd flung trees and debris into buildings in  
the Bahamas and chased frightened tourists from exposed hotel rooms 
to more enclosed space. 
</P>
<P>
	As the brunt of the storm passed late Tuesday, people in Nassau  
began venturing outside. Trees were blocking the main highway 
linking the island's east and center and two barges were washed 
ashore near main street. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is amazing,'' said Andreas Appleby, 23, of Raleigh, N.C,  
surveying the havoc wreaked by Floyd in the Bahamian capital. ``I 
can't believe all of this damage was caused by one storm!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several people including one who fell off a roof were being  
treated for minor injuries, ZNF government radio reported. No other 
information on injuries was immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	It was difficult to estimate the extent of the damage elsewhere,  
because the hurricane knocked out phone lines to most of the 
populated islands and they remained down even as Floyd was poised 
to leave the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ham radio operators cited initial reports of flooded homes and  
damaged docks and boats as Floyd's eye passed over the northern 
islands and keys. Those reports couldn't be immediately confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, the capital, authorities lost telephone links  
throughout the vulnerable, low-lying archipelago -- including 
Eleuthera, San Salvador and Cat Island -- where winds reached 110 
mph and damage was feared to be extensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't get through to San Salvador or Cat Island, but we  
expect it to be bad,'' said Melanie Roach, an official at a 
government command center. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd ripped roofs off homes and flooded some streets in  
Eleuthera Island, which has a population of 10,000, Roach said. 
Most residents were safely inside shelters; the island's popular 
Club Med resort had closed for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 380 Club Med guests of vacation chain's 11-story glass  
building in San Salvador were sitting out the storm, and there were 
no injuries reported, the main office in Miami said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Bahamas most populated island, New Providence, rescuers  
fought through driving rain to reach residents of battered homes. 
But the debris-strewn streets and 3-foot-high flooding in places 
made the job difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane uprooted 30-foot trees and sent blinding,  
horizontal sheets of rain through deserted streets. It shoved cars 
around and snapped palm trees in half. High winds set car alarms 
screeching throughout the capital, Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's winds eased somewhat to 140 mph, down from 155 mph, but  
it was still a dangerous Category 4 storm capable of causing 
extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamian defense officials met to plan cleanup and relief  
efforts, and all defense personnel were ordered to report to duty 
Wednesday morning, JAMZ radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Nassau, residents reported flooding a quarter-mile  
inland. Officials warned that storm surges up to 20 feet could 
inundate parts of New Providence six miles inland, a daunting 
prospect for an island just seven miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m. EDT, Floyd was centered just north of Little Abaco  
island in the northern Bahamas, about 205 miles east-southeast of 
Cape Canaveral, Fla., the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It 
was moving north-northwest near 12 mph with maximum sustained winds 
of 140 mph. Hurricane-strength winds of at least 75 mph extended 
125 miles from the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacationers throughout the Bahamas sought shelter inside secure  
hotel lobbies and enclosed rooms. As the power flickered on and 
off, they dozed on couches and floors, sipped coffee, played cards 
and waited for the storm to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	On Grand Bahama, worried residents took rooms at Freeport's  
Victory Inn, 2 miles from the nearest shore, which had been vacated 
by tourists fleeing the storm. Most brought their own canned food. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be really bad,'' said the inn's manager,  
Wenzel Armbister. To get through it, he said, ``we're having a 
hurricane party. We've got the bar open and everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Paradise Island, 2,000 guests at the sprawling Atlantis  
Resort sought refuge inside a convention center, along with 500 
resort workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's really cooperative. They know how serious this  
is,'' said Atlantis spokesman Ed Fields. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Russians Claim Ousting Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Leaving police in charge, Russian  
troops began pulling out of a region in Dagestan today after 
claiming they had ousted Islamic militants who had occupied it for 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramilitary police units continued searching houses today for  
rebels, mines and abandoned weapons around Karamakhi and 
Chabanmakhi, villages in central Dagestan. Interior Ministry 
spokesman Mikhail Arkhipov insisted the units were in full control 
of the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The villages were strongholds for a group of Wahhabis, a  
fundamentalist Islamic sect that had driven out Russian authorities 
and imposed its rigid version of Islamic law for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian army and Interior Ministry forces fought for two weeks  
to oust the rebels. After daily battles, soldiers raised the 
Russian flag Sunday in Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi. 
</P>
<P>
	Army troops started leaving the villages today, Arkhipov said.  
He did not say how many Russian troops had been there. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russian forces bombed rebels on a second front in  
Dagestan, the Novolakskoye region, close to the border with 
breakaway Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes were aimed at gun positions and rebel trucks around  
the villages of Novolakskoye, Akhar, and Shusheya and along the 
Chechnya-Dagestan border, Arkhipov said. 
</P>
<P>
	No casualties were immediately reported.  
</P>
<P>
	Chechen officials claimed Russian bombs hit a village inside  
Chechnya, Sholkovskaya, the Interfax news agency reported. Russian 
forces have acknowledged hitting Chechnya before, but insist they 
are targeting rebels, not settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Karamakhi area apparently under Russian control,  
federal forces were concentrating on the Novolakskoye region, and 
were planning to send 2,500 new troops and 150 armored personnel 
carriers in the coming days, Interfax said. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslim militants seeking to create an Islamic state in southern  
Russia have been battling Russian security forces in Dagestan for 
more than a month. They invaded the Novolakskoye region in early 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Russian officials believe the fighting in Dagestan is  
linked to explosions at Moscow apartment buildings Thursday and 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's lower house of parliament opened its fall session today  
with a closed meeting on security and the Dagestan fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin today discussed the fighting with  
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Interior Minister Vladimir 
Rushailo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians say hundreds of rebels have been killed since  
fighting in Dagestan began in August, though the militants say the 
claim is exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have lost more than 150 Interior Ministry troops,  
with at least 645 wounded, since the start of the fighting in early 
August. The figures do not include Defense Ministry forces, which 
have also taken part in the battles.

<HEADLINE> Thomas Looking To Add IBA to CBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- A group headed by Isiah Thomas is  
negotiating to buy the nine-team International Basketball 
Association, league officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, a former Detroit Pistons star in the NBA, purchased the  
nine-team CBA last month and now is eyeing the IBA, which has teams 
in Canada and six states. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a league, we are committed to trying to make our league the  
best it can be and high profile, and we're entertaining any kind of 
discussion that might be potentially beneficial to us,'' said Shawn 
Coates, communications director for the IBA in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have approached us and we're open to any offer that helps  
our league to gain prominence or exposure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages to Isiah International in Birmingham, Mich., weren't  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	IBA president Bill Sorensen, of Bismarck, N.D., said the deal  
could create a developmental league for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties won't reveal financial terms or other details until  
negotiations are completed, said Sorensen, the Bismarck mayor who 
is owner or part owner of two IBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas wants the IBA teams to maintain their ties to the  
community, Sorensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants the existing owners to have some minority ownership,  
so he has some local ties. We may not be out entirely, but we'll 
have to wait and see what unfolds,'' Sorensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBA teams are located at Rapid City, S.D.; Billings, Mont.; Des  
Moines, Iowa; Minot, N.D.; Bismarck, N.D.; Fargo, N.D.-Moorhead, 
Minn.; Rochester, Minn.; Youngstown, Ohio, and Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBA begins its fifth season in late November.

<HEADLINE> US May Sanction China Over Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has new evidence that China  
may have transferred medium-range missiles to Pakistan. The 
discovery raises the possibility of tough sanctions against China 
and adds a potential complication to a relationship that seemed 
headed for recovery after a difficult period. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Foley called the possible  
transfer of M-11 missiles, with a range of about 250 miles, a 
matter of ``grave national security importance'' to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	A national intelligence estimate concluded that the transfer  
took place, but Foley said Tuesday that policy and legal 
determinations have yet to be made. 
</P>
<P>
	An intelligence judgment is not a sufficient basis for applying  
technology-transfer sanctions, Foley said. ``It depends to a large 
extent on the nature of the evidence underlying that judgment, and 
before the law can be triggered, all the various elements of the 
missile sanctions law must be satisfied,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``If we believe that the case can be made within the  
law on such a violation, we will impose sanctions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said he was aware of  
the report and considered it an old allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This issue has lasted for a long time, and I think it already  
has been put to an end,'' Sun said. ``I think the relevant report 
is playing the same old tune, and it can only further undermine 
Chinese-U.S. bilateral relations, which already have been 
damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report was quietly declassified last Thursday, two days  
before President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin met in 
New Zealand amid predictions by both sides that the two governments 
would overcome prickly disputes that soured relations in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	One U.S. official said sanctions against China could add up to  
``big bucks.'' Pakistan also would be subject to sanctions, but it 
would not be materially affected because the country already is 
under penalty because of violations covered by separate 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions are part of the U.S. effort to deter the transfer  
of missiles and missile technology. The law under which the 
sanctions would be applied uses standards outlined in the Missile 
Technology Control Regime, an international anti-missile 
proliferation effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalties would deny high-technology equipment to the  
Chinese organization involved in the transfer. They also would 
extend to activities of the Chinese government relating to 
development of MTCR missiles or MTCR components or affecting 
production of electronic and space systems or equipment and 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years ago, after receiving evidence that China had  
transferred M-11 technology to Pakistan, the Clinton administration 
imposed sanctions against the Chinese entity responsible for the 
transfer. The sanctions were lifted after two years, as prescribed 
in the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese-American relations have been buffeted in recent months  
by the accidental NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade 
in May as well as allegations that China stole secrets from U.S. 
nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights also has been a sore point in relations -- as was  
apparent in an angry response Tuesday of Chinese Ambassador Li 
Zhaoxing to critical remarks by a senior State Department official 
at a forum on U.S.-Chinese relations sponsored by the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Assistant Secretary Susan Shirk said a Chinese crackdown  
on unregistered religious activity had harmed the country's 
internal and international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	She also included many positive comments about ties between  
Washington and Beijing. When she ended her remarks, Li declined to 
join others in the large gathering who applauded Shirk's 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Li, the next speaker, asked Shirk: ``What do you mean by  
crackdown? Have you even read the Chinese constitution? ... Who has 
given you the right to criticize China? This has gone almost to the 
height of absurdity. ... What has made you think you have the right 
to interfere in China's internal affairs?''

<HEADLINE> State Teams Lining Up for Buckeyes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- From 1934 until 1992, Ohio State did not  
lower itself to play football against another school from within 
the state's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, all of a sudden, the Buckeyes are the host of an unofficial  
Ohio college tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next two weeks, the nation's 13th-ranked team gains  
little, but risks a lot when it welcomes Ohio University and the 
University of Cincinnati into Ohio Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	It'll be the first time the Buckeyes have played consecutive  
games against in-state schools since 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State coach John Cooper is behind the good neighbor policy,  
but not because Ohio University is 0-2 and lost to Division I-AA 
Northern Iowa last week, while Cincinnati (1-1), 2-9 a year ago, 
lost to Troy State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in favor of it,'' Cooper said Monday. ``The philosophy to  
do it is good. It's keeping the money in the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``Of course, I like to play them at home, there's no  
question about that. I like to have another home game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes have won their last 22 games against in-state  
schools, dating back to a 7-6 loss to Oberlin in 1921. That string 
includes two victories over Bowling Green and another over Toledo 
this decade -- by a combined score of 110-19 -- after athletics 
director Andy Geiger ended almost six decades of separation between 
Ohio State and other schools inside the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio University gets $350,000 and Cincinnati gets $200,000 in a  
deal where it makes three trips to Columbus, and Ohio State must 
come to Cincinnati once. Next year, Miami of Ohio visits Ohio 
Stadium, with Akron making the trip in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like they're not getting a benefit out of it,''  
Cooper said. ``Certainly, they're the underdog. But it's a good 
recruiting tool, it's good for their budget and it's also a great 
opportunity for those kids to get a chance to compete against a 
bigger team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio University coach Jim Grobe jumped at the chance to play the  
Buckeyes when it was proposed by athletics director Tom Boeh. In 
recent years, the Bobcats have had to travel to North Carolina, 
Kansas State and Wisconsin to get a big payoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Tom came to me, and Ohio State had offered to play us in  
football, I thought that was a no-brainer. I don't care how much 
money was involved,'' Grobe said. ``We have over 70 kids from the 
state of Ohio in our program. They would love to play that game. 
What a great experience for our program and our kids. I just 
thought it was an easy decision, and I appreciate Ohio State giving 
us an opportunity to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (1-1), which ripped 14th-ranked UCLA 42-20 Saturday  
night, is a 40-point favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're favored by 40 points, then let's get up on them by 40  
points then,'' offensive guard Ben Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State fullback Matt Keller, who may not play because of a  
sprained ankle, is a Cincinnati native who said he had an idea what 
the Bobcats will encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a lot of guys from Ohio,'' he said. ``They grew up  
watching Ohio State and it's going to be a great opportunity for 
them to play in from of a big crowd, and they'll have a lot of 
family there. That's a big motivating factor for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no other in-state university of similar size or stature  
to Ohio State, such as Cincinnati would be in men's basketball. 
Cooper was asked if he would still be in favor of scheduling one if 
there was. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't touch that,'' he said with a grin.

<HEADLINE> EEOC To Examine New Pension Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Equal Employment Opportunity  
Commission promised a broad review of a new pension plans that 
critics contend violate age-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to hear from all stakeholders in order to reach fair  
conclusions'' about ``cash-balance'' pension plans, EEOC Chairwoman 
Ida Castro said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to meet with and receive feedback from the employer,  
labor and civil rights communities,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro met Tuesday with Rep. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has led  
congressional criticism of cash-balance plans that can reduce costs 
by cutting future benefits to middle-aged workers while allowing 
younger workers to take a larger payout if they depart before 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans, adopted by more than 300 companies, shift some  
payments from pension plans to cash compensation and stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders says this may violate the 1967 Age Discrimination in  
Employment Act. ``We are not going to sit by and watch as our 
country's older workers are stripped of the benefits they have 
worked so long and hard for,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders recently made public a 1998 IRS memo that says the  
cash-balance plan at an unidentified company ``does not satisfy the 
clear and straightforward requirement'' of age bias law because the 
benefit accrual rate ``decreases as a participant attains each 
additional year of age.''

<HEADLINE> Millions Use Web for Floyd Updates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Millions of people are going onto the Internet  
for instant updates on Hurricane Floyd along with weather maps, 
travel advisories and survival tips. 
</P>
<P>
	Debora Wilson, president and chief executive of weather.com,  
said her site got 14.9 million visitors Monday, five times the 
normal traffic. She expected to break the record again Tuesday. The 
previous high was 12.6 million, when meteorologists tracked four 
hurricanes on Sept. 25, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet makes this information much more widely available  
in places where people would not be naturally able to receive 
television or cable services,'' she said. The site is affiliated 
with cable TV's Weather Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	At www.redcross.org, visitors can learn what causes hurricanes  
and how to prepare for one. The American Red Cross site offers 
guidelines for assembling a disaster supplies kit and protecting 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	Another site, promising up-to-the-minute photos from southern  
Florida beaches, ran into technical difficulties Tuesday. Yet 
another site updated flight cancellations throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a site, www.4hurricanes.com, helping link visitors  
to other sites with weather and emergency information. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather.com site offers news dispatches, maps and forecasts.  
It also sets up chat rooms for visitors to message one another 
directly. Absent owners of beach houses can ask detailed questions 
about local conditions.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Risks Around the World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the State Department's warnings to U.S. citizens  
about possible Year 2000 computer failures around the world: 

</P>
<P>
	Bahrain: ``Role as the financial hub of the region has made many  
of its systems heavily computer reliant. ... Moderate risk of 
potential disruption of electric power and water sources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belarus: ``Does not appear to be prepared to deal with the Y2K  
problem. ... Americans who are planning to remain in Belarus should 
be prepared to withstand power, water and heat outages during cold 
winter weather that can last several days or more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil: ``Risk for potentially moderate but largely isolated  
disruptions in telecommunications, electricity, the health sector, 
and possibly financial services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China: ``May be a risk of potential disruption in the key  
sectors of banking and finance, telecommunications, medical 
services, and in electrical power and infrastructure systems 
outside of the coastal cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba: ``Moderate risk of potential disruption in such key  
sectors as banking and finance, telecommunications, and electric 
power. Public services are not reliable, and the Cuban population 
is accustomed to doing without key services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India: ``Largest question is the readiness of the electric power  
sector and the ocean ports, parts of which have been slow to 
address the Y2K issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israel: ``Moderate risk of potential disruption in key sectors,  
including telecommunications and electric power. ... Ground 
stations for mobile communications may be vulnerable to Y2K-related 
disruptions.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Cable News Stresses Content </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hold the blood and guts. A new generation of  
local news programs on cable TV is trying to compete with bigger 
broadcasters by emphasizing substance over sizzle, a study 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the best news channels, like Las Vegas One and New York  
One, pack more information into their newscasts than broadcast 
network affiliates, said a report by Rocky Mountain Media Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The media watchdog group has criticized local broadcast  
newscasts throughout the 1990s for heavily emphasizing crime news 
and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sense that a lot of people in the industry feel that the  
traditional local newscast is vulnerable to change,'' Paul Klite, 
the group's executive director, said Tuesday. ``The old format has 
gotten tiresome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, there has been rapid growth in cable news  
operations, often running 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Klite's group studied the newscasts of 21 cable stations on a  
fairly typical news day -- June 23, 1999. Overall, the programs had 
more news stories and fewer commercials than local newscasts did 
when measured in a separate, similar study. The cable newscasts had 
25 percent less news about violent crime, Klite said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable news operations generally have fewer soft features, less  
banter between anchors, and are also more willing to try different 
approaches, such as doing four short weather forecasts in an hour. 
Many cable newscasts feature one anchor instead of two, possibly 
because it's cheaper, Klite said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited Cable Pulse 24, a Toronto news station, as  
``without a doubt the most information-packed newscast in North 
America.'' Its screen is divided into seven separate information 
windows that deliver stock figures, sports scores, news headlines, 
the time, local weather, local traffic and a traditional newscast. 
</P>
<P>
	The news report takes up 35 percent of the screen. Many stories  
ran for two minutes, unusually long in local news, and covered the 
environment, financial news, politics and health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sort of grew out of looking at an Internet screen,'' said  
Stephen Hurlbut, the station's vice president and general manager. 
``We seem to be evolving into a culture that can process multiple 
sources of information at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some viewers initially responded negatively when the  
format was introduced a year and a half ago, it is now popular and 
imitated, mostly in Canada, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all cable stations followed the trend, the report said.  
Miami station WAMI's twice-nightly newscast, while trying to 
present an alternative to crime-heavy local broadcasts, 
concentrated on ``fluff'' like celebrity gossip and relationship 
advice, Klite said. 
</P>
<P>
	WAMI complained the media watchdog group studied a newscast that  
was not typical, Klite said. WAMI's news director did not 
immediately return a telephone call on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks closed lower Tuesday on concern the  
rising yen is threatening Japan's nascent economic recovery. The 
dollar fell to a 40-month low against the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down 132.07  
points, or 0.74 percent, to 17,777.22 at the end of the day's 
trading. On Monday, the average closed up 198.27 points, or 1.12 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.56 yen at midafternoon, down 1.22 yen from  
Tokyo's late Monday level of 107.78 yen, but above its late New 
York level of 106.44 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar moved as low as 106.00 yen,  
its lowest level since May 15, 1996, when it traded at 105.77 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices fell as the yen surged against the  
greenback, rekindling concern that Japan's fledging economic 
recovery could be curbed by the rising yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen leads to lower profits for Japan's exporters, since  
it makes their products more expensive and therefore less 
competitive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exporters were supposed to break even at 112 yen to the  
dollar,'' said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative strategy 
group at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 566 million shares, down from 597 million shares 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners outnumbered advancers 786 to 421, while 137 issues  
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 10.44 points, or 0.68 percent, to 
1,524.79. The TOPIX closed up 20.37 points, or 1.34 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average rose  
1.90 points to close Monday at 11,030.33. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, a low-key intervention in the foreign  
exchange market by the Bank of Japan gave the dollar a slight 
afternoon boost, but the greenback remains under downward pressure, 
dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign exchange traders say that the BOJ intervened via a few  
foreign banks and Japanese city banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank pushed the dollar up about 1 yen to around  
107.30 yen, said a dealer at a European bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of Finance's top bureaucrat, Nobuaki Usui,  
confirmed that Japanese monetary authorities intervened in support 
of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the yen has been in strong demand, especially  
by foreign investors who want to buy into Japanese financial 
markets amid hopes for an economic turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded between 106.00 yen and 107.30 yen in Tokyo  
trading on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 110.24 yen in late  
afternoon trading, down from 111.60 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7100 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7600 percent, driving 
the price up 0.43 point to 101.62.

<HEADLINE> Experts Contradict Amtrak Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A railroad signal expert testified on Tuesday  
that warning lights probably were flashing before a steel-loaded 
truck tried to cross the tracks and was struck by an Amtrak train 
in an accident that killed 11 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Sharkey, a communications and signals general manager  
for Canadian National-Illinois Central Railroad, said he doubted a 
warning gate hit the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharkey's account came on the second of three days of public  
hearings that the National Transportation Safety Board has been 
holding to look for clues into what caused the March 15 crash of 
the City of New Orleans train near Bourbonnais, about 50 miles 
south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 11 deaths, 122 people were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Luis A. Nieves, who said he was driving the second of  
two cars stopped behind John R. Stokes' tractor-trailer, told board 
members he saw warning lights and heard bells as Stokes drove 
through the railroad crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieves said he also saw a crossing gate strike Stokes' truck as  
he tried to drive it around the barrier, shortly before it was 
struck in the rear by the train. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sharkey, who analyzed event recorder data collected at the  
crossing gate, said he did not think the warning lights and gate 
activated simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharkey said he ``completely agrees'' with testimony given  
Monday by a steel company crane operator, Troy Schultz, who said he 
saw warning lights before the collision. But he said tests he 
performed on the crossing gate showed no evidence that it hit the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The event recorder took down the approach of the train and the  
activation of the warning system but was not designed to detect any 
impact with the gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes received a 60-day suspension and has since regained his  
driver's license. He has refused to testify in this week's hearing.

<HEADLINE> Deadline Nears for Auto Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Contract talks between the United  
Auto Workers and automakers intensified Tuesday as agreements 
covering 407,000 workers were due to expire at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which has said little about the progress of the  
talks, appeared to be negotiating hardest with DaimlerChrysler AG. 
Officials met at the German-American automaker's U.S. offices in 
Auburn Hills late into last night and resumed talks early today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations are proceeding very, very well ... but it  
isn't over 'til it's over and we'll all just have to wait and 
see,'' DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton told the cable 
financial network CNBC in an interview this morning from Frankfurt, 
Germany, where he was attending an industry trade show. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations were also under way with General Motors Corp. and  
Ford Motor Co. UAW negotiators met at GM over the weekend, but did 
not meet at Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the union has extended contracts past the deadline.  
No extension has been made yet, but experts said a strike that 
would threaten a boom year for the auto industry seems unlikely. 
The UAW has not called a national strike during contract 
negotiations since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW usually chooses one automaker to make a deal with first,  
then uses that deal as a template for other contracts. This year, 
union President Stephen P. Yokich has kept talks going with both GM 
and DaimlerChrysler, and refused to publicly name a target. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have released little information about the talks.  
Wages, job security, health-care costs, overtime demands and the 
assignment of work to outside suppliers were expected to be among 
the top issues in this year's talks, as they were during the last 
round in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of  
record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more 
than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few indications of what proposals the UAW and  
DaimlerChrysler might be negotiating. The union has discussed 
efforts to organize DaimlerChrysler's nonunion plants in the United 
States: a Mercedes-Benz sport utility factory in Alabama with 1,600 
workers and at Freightliner commercial truck plants in the 
Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW leaders have complained about company moves against  
organizers. DaimlerChrysler has vowed to remain neutral in the 
UAW's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	It is against federal labor rules for the issue to be part of  
the UAW's contract. But problems in the organizing campaign will 
affect DaimlerChrysler's relationship with its largest U.S. union. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages are an issue at GM, which has sought to mend fences with  
the UAW after last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint, Mich., 
parts factories that virtually shut down the automaker's North 
American production. 
</P>
<P>
	According to union newsletters, the UAW has asked GM for higher  
wages, and sought better overtime compensation with more money and 
extra time off. In recent years, automakers have held down 
employment by increasing overtime; the average GM hourly worker 
adds about 9 hours of overtime a week. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has offered to guarantee lifetime employment for workers with  
at least 10 years of experience; DaimlerChrysler reportedly has 
offered a similar proposal. In return, the companies would likely 
seek more flexibility in hiring or job rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The thorniest issue appears to be at Ford, which would like to  
spin off its Visteon parts unit that employs 23,500 UAW workers. 
The UAW is opposed to the move, fearing job cuts and lower wages at 
a separate company.

<HEADLINE> Irvine To Drive for Jaguar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Jaguar is going into Formula One  
racing next year with Eddie Irvine and Johnny Herbert as drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford recently purchased Jackie Stewart's team for $160 million,  
and the former three-time Formula One champion will head Jaguar 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine is replacing Rubens Barrichello, who is going to Ferrari  
from Stewart-Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The move allows Irvine to finally become the No. 1 driver for a  
team after being second to Michael Schumacher at Ferrari for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	When Schumacher broke his leg this summer in a crash at the  
British Grand Prix, Irvine took over the No. 1 role, but with the 
understanding it would be only until Schumacher was able to reclaim 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine has a chance to become the first Ferrari driver in 20  
years to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	With three races left on the Grand Prix circuit, Irvine is tied  
with defending champion Mika Hakkinen of McLaren-Mercedes at 60 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert already has driving for Stewart-Ford.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said he had always hoped that Jaguar would become  
involved in Formula One once Ford had bought out his team.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Derails Tourists' Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd messed up the  
vacation plans of thousands of Florida tourists, forcing the 
cancellation of hundreds of flights Tuesday and prompting Walt 
Disney World to close early because of the weather for the first 
time in its 28-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotels along the coast also shut down, forcing tourists to head  
for airports or shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Orlando's Walt Disney World before it shut it gates,  
Jacobia Reynolds of Ridgefield, Conn., said she and her husband had 
been saving for years to go to Florida's No. 1 tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a good time until they kick us out,'' Mrs.  
Reynolds said. ``We're going to stay in our room. What choice do we 
have?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her 8-year-old daughter, Gina, said: ``I've never seen a  
hurricane except on TV and I'm a little scared. But I want to go to 
Disney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere around the Orlando area, MGM Studios, Animal Kingdom,  
Universal Studios and SeaWorld also closed. Many of the 
Orlando-area attractions were built in the past two decades and had 
never faced a major hurricane before. 
</P>
<P>
	At Miami International Airport, many disheveled tourists were  
facing a second night of sleeping on the floor. Many were angry and 
uncertain about their next move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely appalling. There was no information,'' said  
Dolores Pearson of Ireland, who missed a connection to London and 
spent Monday night in the airport. ``Nobody cared we were stuck. It 
was complete chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and her husband were among about 500 passengers stranded at  
the airport, where most flights were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Marguerite Previlon was returning from Haiti with her mother  
when they got stuck in Miami. It was her mother's first visit to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't sleep here two nights,'' Ms. Previlon said, her  
65-year-old mother resting on the floor next to her. ``I don't know 
anything about Miami; I'm from Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Orlando International Airport, closed for the first time  
ever, a couple were laughing and videotaping each other at an 
airport bar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to go back to Minneapolis anyway,'' said JoAnn  
Fields, 18. ``I've never seen a hurricane before. Maybe we'll just 
stick it out here at the airport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some hotels were already full with tourists, even before the  
evacuees arrived. Wilson Perry, general manager at the Holiday Inn 
Sunspree Resort, about five miles from Disney World, said he was 
fully booked. The inn is a pet-friendly hotel, and many people were 
arriving with their animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry said he wouldn't turn anyone away once the storm hits.  
``We will put people in the lobby if we have to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Daytona Beach, bridges were closed, and most of the major  
hotels in the area shut down. The city is the home of the Daytona 
International Speedway and the self-proclaimed ``World's Most 
Famous Beach,'' where visitors can drive on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Augustine, the nation's oldest city, founded in 1565, was a  
ghost town, its shops and attractions closed. Its tourist 
attractions include a 17th-century Spanish fortress.

<HEADLINE> Favre's Hand Won't Keep Him Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- When the Green Bay Packers' emotional  
leader got emotional, it was only out of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Favre said he cried tears of joy on the podium Sunday at a  
news conference after engineering the game-winning drive in Green 
Bay's 28-24 victory over the Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm emotional anyway,'' Favre said. ``It wasn't that my arm  
was broken or my thumb. I don't know what it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre and coach Ray Rhodes also said the hand injuries the  
quarterback suffered in the game likely won't keep him out of next 
Sunday's meeting with the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	With a thick bandage on his throwing hand and a smile on his  
face, Favre said Monday that an emotional catharsis was what 
brought tears to his eyes. The final drive, the 14th game-winner of 
Favre's career, was accomplished in exactly 100 seconds and covered 
82 yards -- with no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes said Favre has a sprained thumb and a bruised muscle in  
his hand. Favre said the injury, which some thought might be a 
broken bone, likely won't prevent him from playing next Sunday 
against the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just how strongly I felt about the game,'' Favre said  
of his emotional reaction. ``People can read whatever they want 
into that, but that's all it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes said he also expects Favre to play against Detroit,  
though the three-time MVP will likely skip ``a couple of days'' of 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be awful sore ... but knowing Brett, he's going to be  
back and ready to go Sunday,'' Rhodes said. ``This man is a very 
tough, prideful football player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many wondered if Favre would be the same player this season  
after Mike Holmgren, his only coach in seven years in Green Bay, 
left for the Seattle Seahawks. Holmgren called most of the plays in 
the West Coast offense as Favre ascended to the game's upper 
echelon of quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Favre didn't admit it, Sunday's game undoubtedly assumed  
additional importance when the Packers looked to him to replace 
Holmgren as their emotional leader. 
</P>
<P>
	When Favre threw three interceptions and the Packers were behind  
24-14 with four minutes to play, Green Bay put its fate in his 
hands, and he responded remarkably. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is similar to the one he first had three weeks ago in  
an exhibition game against Denver. Though he said he could barely 
grip a football on the final drive against the Raiders, he 
completed six of the seven passes that weren't spikes to stop the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre has started 110 straight games for the Packers and is six  
starts away from matching Ron Jaworski's record for a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's played banged up before,'' tight end Mark Chmura said.  
``I think we've all come to expect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura's sparing appearances in the second half of the game also  
raised eyebrows in Green Bay. Chmura sat out all of the Packers' 
preseason schedule resting a bulging disk in his neck, but Rhodes 
said his Pro Bowl tight end just wasn't in the game shape necessary 
to play the full afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave us a lot of downs, probably a lot more than he should  
have given us,'' Rhodes said. ``Hey, the man was winded and 
tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura, one of Favre's closest friends, caught four passes in  
the first half, but none in the second. Favre adjusted, throwing to 
backups Tyrone Davis and Jeff Thomason, who caught the game-winner 
with 11 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brett will play through anything,'' said wide receiver Bill  
Schroeder, who on Sunday hinted to reporters that Favre's injury 
could be more serious than first thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just knew he could barely grip a football. It was just  
amazing he could do what he did.''

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Smith Blames Self for Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- As he lay in bed the night after his first NFL  
game, Akili Smith was filled with remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback wished he hadn't missed so much of training camp  
because of a contract holdout. He thought he'd let the Cincinnati 
Bengals down by not knowing the offense when they were on the verge 
of an exhilarating win. 
</P>
<P>
	He felt awful.  
</P>
<P>
	``This week I promise you it won't happen again,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	How is he going to keep his promise? By studying more.  
</P>
<P>
	The first-round draft choice missed virtually all of training  
camp. He signed less than two weeks before the season-opener in 
Tennessee and had a lot to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he still didn't know the playbook, the Bengals  
installed him as Jeff Blake's backup. The only other alternative 
was seventh-round draft pick Scott Covington. 
</P>
<P>
	When Blake went down with leg cramps in the fourth quarter  
Sunday in Tennessee, Smith made his debut and wasn't prepared. 
After two series without a first down, coach Bruce Coslet went to 
Covington for the final series because the other rookie knew the 
offense better. 
</P>
<P>
	Covington did no better, failing to get a first down, and the  
Titans rallied for a 36-35 win. 
</P>
<P>
	That's all Smith could think about that night.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was laying in bed thinking that I put a lot of pressure on  
myself,'' Smith said. ``I felt I lost a game for my team. This week 
I've got to step it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't all his fault. The Bengals' decision not to keep an  
experienced backup quarterback put a lot of pressure on Smith, and 
the long holdout put him way behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the development of a young quarterback,'' Coslet said.  
``He has no idea what it takes to prepare for a football game. 
He'll learn it. Every quarterback has to go through this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith plans to spend a lot more time with the playbook.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I spend an hour and a half every night,'' Smith said.  
``I've got to step it up and go two or three hours. I've got to be 
ready to do a lot more studying.''

<HEADLINE> Mistrial Declared in Abortion Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A federal judge declared a mistrial in a  
lawsuit that accused Operation Rescue and six protesters of 
illegally blocking entrances to abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Walter Rice declared the mistrial  
Monday after private meetings with attorneys for both sides. Rice 
made no announcement in court. A defense attorney said the mistrial 
was declared because of a problem with a prosecution witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe it's a victory,'' said David Mehaffie, one of the  
defendants in the trial. ``God has given a victory over a federal 
government that has wholeheartedly endorsed, protected and even 
propagated infanticide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Vickie Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion  
Federation, said the mistrial merely amounted to a postponement and 
that she is confident a new trial will be set soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an excellent case, excellent witnesses and are  
confident we will prevail,'' Saporta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys also said they expect a new trial, possibly as  
early as this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department brought the case in March 1998 under  
the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said the judge's decision involved a procedural  
issue involving an upcoming prosecution witness. It asked for the 
mistrial because the defendants weren't notified about the breadth 
of what the witness was going to testify about, defense attorney 
Tom Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave no details, and Shelley Jackson, who is prosecuting the  
case for the Justice Department, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	During the jury trial, which began Sept. 2, the government  
accused the defendants of blocking access to clinics in Cincinnati, 
Dayton and Kettering, a Dayton suburb, during protests in July 
1997.

<HEADLINE> E. coli Outbreak Sickens 281 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- What did you eat? Where did you sit?  
Did you wash your hands? Did you wade in the pond? Who was with 
you? 
</P>
<P>
	Health investigators have been interviewing hundreds of people  
who attended a Sept. 4 concert and cookout, hoping some pattern 
will emerge to explain an E. coli outbreak that has now sickened at 
least 281 people. 
</P>
<P>
	While they work the phones, other health workers were performing  
lab tests or gathering samples. 
</P>
<P>
	All they know for sure is that the people who fell ill were  
among the 1,800 people at the event in a cow pasture near 
Petersburg. Twenty were sick enough that they had to be 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the E. coli bacteria lurked in the beef served at the  
event. Maybe bacteria was in the water, or on the hands of a food 
server, or hiding someplace else entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're no different from detectives on a crime scene. We kind  
of tear apart everything we can to come up with the clues that may 
give us an answer,'' Thomas Schafer, spokesman for the Illinois 
Department of Public Health, said Monday. ``We still are going to 
have to be a little lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli is a bacteria usually found in the intestines or manure  
of cattle. People who ingest it can suffer severe cramps, bloody 
diarrhea and, in extreme cases, kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest job for investigators is interviewing people who  
attended the concert, dubbed Cornstock '99. 
</P>
<P>
	Schafer said investigators have the names of about 900  
partygoers and have spoken to 551 -- asking what they ate and drank, 
where they sat, whether they washed their hands, what they did. 
</P>
<P>
	All the answers -- from sick people and healthy alike -- are fed  
into a computer that will search for patterns. If most of the sick 
people ate the same things or did the same things, it narrows the 
field, Schafer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other investigators were working in the field -- literally. They  
visited the farm near Petersburg, about 25 miles northwest of 
Springfield, where Cornstock was held to gather water and manure 
samples. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd at the free concert ate and drank in a field that had  
been used as a cow pasture. Owner Tom Baird had raked and cleaned 
the field of manure, although some traces probably remained. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schafer said those traces were unlikely to be the source of  
contamination, since E. coli will not survive long outside a host 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, investigators have taken manure samples from Baird's  
herd. If they were carrying E. coli, it suggests the contamination 
probably came from the cow Baird donated to be cooked at the event, 
Schafer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the first tests won't be available until later this  
week, Schafer said. It could be weeks, or even months, before the 
health department finishes its investigation, he said.

<HEADLINE> House Voting on Campaign Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to curb the influence of money in  
political campaigns moved toward likely House passage Tuesday night 
despite vociferous complaints from conservative Republicans that 
the bill violates freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reach and influence of special interests have grown out of  
control,'' argued Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, one of numerous 
Republicans to join with Democrats in support of the measure. ``As 
a consequence, people believe their elected officials are bought 
and paid for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., said the measure, with its  
ban on unregulated ``soft money'' contributions and restrictions on 
certain campaign ads, would ``abridge our precious God-given right 
to speak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Republican leadership backed efforts to derail the  
measure or rework it after concluding it could disadvantage GOP 
candidates and leave them vulnerable to attacks by organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the hours leading to a vote on final passage, supporters  
of the bill easily defeated what they described as ``poison pill'' 
amendments that threatened to unravel their bipartisan coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were proposals to triple the 25-year-old limits on  
contributions, allowing donors to give up to $3,000 to individual 
candidates and $75,000 overall for any campaign cycle. Both were 
rejected by margins of more than 2-1, indicating that supporters of 
the legislation had the votes to prevail on the final roll call, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	One amendment that cleared would require non-office holders who  
campaign for office to reimburse the government for the costs of 
transportation. Democrats complained the provision was aimed solely 
at First lady Hillary Clinton, who is making the rounds in her 
unannounced New York Senate campaign with a complement of Secret 
Service agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage would mark the second time in as many years that  
campaign finance legislation, co-sponsored by Republican Rep. 
Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Democratic Rep. Martin Meehan 
of Massachusetts and backed by the White House, had cleared the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, as in 1998, GOP opponents of the measure in the  
Senate are ready with a filibuster, and prospects for final passage 
are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	As drafted in the House, the bill would ban the use of soft  
money in federal campaigns. Unlike hard money donations, which are 
restricted in size, soft money donations are unlimited and 
unregulated by the federal government. Increasingly, they are 
prized by political parties and certain politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the bill would impose limits on certain types of  
political advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast commercials within 60 days of an election that made  
use of the name or likeness of a candidate would have to be paid 
for with hard money contributions, which are limited in size. So, 
too, would any print or broadcast commercial that contained an 
``unmistakable or unambiguous'' appeal for the election or defeat 
of a federal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Those provisions are designed to crack down on thinly veiled  
attacks ads that are now paid for with soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation produced a spirited debate on the House floor  
that ranged from bedrock constitutional issues to matters of overt 
partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay argued that the measure  
represented ``the mother of all government regulation'' and would 
erode the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Roger Wicker of Mississippi agreed, and added that for  
``liberal advocates this bill is really about party politics. The 
big labor bosses use the forced dues of their union members to 
further their political goals,'' he added, and the legislation 
would do nothing to change that. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan dismissed the complaints about the First Amendment as  
ungrounded. ``When they say free speech, they mean big money,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays said the measure was designed to enforce a ban on  
corporate campaign donations that has been on the books since 1907, 
and a similar ban on the use of union dues dating to 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., said, ``It should concern every one of  
us that there are corporations, there are labor unions, there are 
organizations out there'' whose members make six-figure 
contributions. ``If anyone thinks they're doing it because they 
believe in good government, then they need to look at the 
underlying legislation they're supporting,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays and Meehan had wanted to have the debate last spring, to  
give their Senate allies more time to battle the threatened 
filibuster there. 
</P>
<P>
	But House GOP leaders successfully delayed the measure, and  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., stared down rebels in his own 
rank-and-file who had pressured him to step up the timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scenes, the GOP hierarchy also emphasized the  
political threat to Republican candidates. The party chairman, Jim 
Nicholson, and Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, who heads the Republican 
campaign committee, met privately with GOP lawmakers last month and 
told them the party enjoyed a $40 million soft money advantage over 
Democrats in the 1997-1998 election cycle.

<HEADLINE> Appendicitis Diagnostic Works Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A high-tech method of diagnosing appendicitis was  
94 percent accurate in children whose conditions were unclear from 
the standard physical exam and blood tests, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique already is used on adults throughout the country  
with a 98 percent success rate. However, the method is expensive 
and physically intrusive, and an expert not involved in the study 
said those factors could limit its use on children. 
</P>
<P>
	Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of emergency  
abdominal surgery in childhood, with 60,000 to 80,000 U.S. cases 
annually, the researchers noted in Wednesday's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 60 children die annually and at least 12,000 suffer  
burst appendixes, often because uncertain symptoms -- including loss 
of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain -- may mimic other 
ailments and delay diagnosis, researchers said, citing past 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
	When an appendix bursts, it spreads infection throughout the  
abdomen, which can cause infertility in girls and requires 
intravenous antibiotics and weeks of hospitalization. If doctors 
can make the diagnosis and remove the inflamed appendix before it 
bursts, a child usually needs to stay in the hospital just one 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The new, high-tech approach, which combines ultrasound and  
computer-enhanced X-rays, also called CAT scans, gave doctors a 94 
percent rate of accuracy in diagnosing 139 children with suspected 
appendicitis, said researchers at Harvard-affiliated Children's 
Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the children had uncertain diagnoses after standard  
physical examinations and lab tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Barbara M. Garcia Pena, lead author of the new study, said  
ultrasound is the only technique commonly used to aid in children's 
diagnoses when symptoms are uncertain, but it often fails to 
produce a readable image. 
</P>
<P>
	CAT scans, which cost about $500, also involve radiation and  
require inserting a tube into the rectum and filling the intestine 
with dye so X-rays can image the appendix. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the cost and discomfort involved, Dr. Robert M.  
Arensman, chief surgeon at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, 
commended the work but predicted the procedure would never be ``the 
first line of making a diagnosis'' in children. 
</P>
<P>
	An ultrasound test, which costs about $300, involves only  
putting warm oil on the child's abdomen and massaging it with a 
round probe, which sends inaudible sound waves to the internal 
organs. Their echoes produce an image of the appendix.

<HEADLINE> Investing in Positive Cos. Trendy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First there was socially responsible investing.  
Now there's so-called positive investing. 
</P>
<P>
	Socially responsible mutual funds use ``negative'' screens to  
ferret out the stocks of companies investors feel do society more 
harm than good. Alcohol, tobacco and firearms stocks are frequently 
barred from socially responsible funds through negative screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Some want to take the concept of socially aware mutual funds one  
step further. They want to use ``positive'' screens to identify and 
reward companies that are setting good examples in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The different approaches have opened a rift between the huge  
pension fund company TIAA-CREF and a small group of investors whose 
retirement funds are invested in TIAA-CREF's $3.8 billion Social 
Choice Account, which uses negative screens to eliminate unwanted 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Wollman and his wife, Abigail Fuller, both professors at  
Manchester College in Indiana, have spearheaded a three-year effort 
to change TIAA-CREF's investment strategy so that the Social Choice 
fund wouldn't merely exclude companies deemed unfit, but would 
instead seek out companies that are helping their communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like the socially responsible options'' offered by  
TIAA-CREF, Wollman said. ``We just want to make them better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wollman said seed money via loans or stock investments provided  
to fledgling companies that are furthering community development 
efforts could strengthen those companies and help them become role 
models for other corporations. The professor would like to see 5 
percent to 10 percent of the Social Choice fund's assets earmarked 
for local banks, credit unions and similar ventures involved in 
urban revitalization programs. ``We would still make money and have 
a positive impact at the same time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	TIAA-CREF, according to Wollman, has turned a deaf ear to his  
repeated requests for a shift in the fund's investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, says TIAA-CREF, which manages the retirement funds of  
thousands of college professors and millions of other educators. 
``We have heard (Wollman's) requests and we don't agree with his 
position,'' said spokesman Tom Pinto. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinto said TIAA-CREF has a responsibility to do everything  
possible to generate profits for all of its investors. The 
strategies used to generate those profits need to be based strictly 
on financial information and on the criteria listed in each fund's 
prospectus. Use of any other criteria would violate TIAA-CREF's 
responsibilities to its investors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The negative screens already in place make it difficult for the  
Social Choice fund to fulfill its financial goal of mirroring the 
performance of the Standard &AMP; Poor 500 index, Pinto said. To 
further limit the stock choices available to the fund by using 
positive screens would make it even more difficult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinto also argued that positive screens tend to be more  
subjective than negative screens. Everyone seems to agree that 
alcohol, tobacco and firearms companies should be excluded from 
socially responsible funds, ``but it's a little more of a gray area 
when you're trying to find a consensus as to what constitutes a 
social good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More objective analysts tend to favor TIAA-CREF's position.  
</P>
<P>
	Olivia Barbee, a senior analyst at Morningstar Inc., a Chicago  
firm that studies mutual funds, said the Social Choice fund may be 
too big for a positive investment strategy similar to the one 
advocated by Wollman. A handful of tiny stocks of small, unknown 
companies would have little if any impact on the performance of a 
$3.8 billion fund, she said, and fund managers are in the business 
of turning a profit for their clients. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, analysts said, fund managers would be entering  
dangerous territory if they started trying to please one 
shareholder faction over another. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely any large group of shareholders would unanimously  
endorse all of the stocks contained in any fund as large as Social 
Choice for the simple reason that one shareholder's socially 
responsible company could be another shareholder's pariah. And 
who's to decide which shareholder is right? 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, very few companies can make the claim that they offend  
no one. ``There are no vestal virgin stocks, there are no vestal 
virgin companies,'' Barbee said.

<HEADLINE> Co. Sold Missile How-To to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The U.S. Defense Department will examine  
whether a Pennsylvania company damaged national security by selling 
technology to China that could help the accuracy of its missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Michael Stiles said Defense officials will  
scrutinize the actions of Orbit/FR, which has agreed to plead 
guilty in U.S. District Court to violating the Arms Export Control 
Act. Papers declaring the company's intent were filed in court on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Orbit/FR, headquartered in Horsham, about 15 miles north of  
Philadelphia, will be fined $600,000 and could be banned from 
exporting products for up to 10 years, Stiles said. Charges against 
at least one company official are likely to follow, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had agreed to a $1 million deal with Chinese North  
Industries Corp., a major military systems manufacturer for the 
Chinese army. 
</P>
<P>
	The software and equipment sold to China were designed to  
measure the effectiveness of antennas in the nose cones of 
missiles. The system was capable of measuring accuracy within 10 
feet over a distance of 10 miles, said Joe Alkus, a Customs Service 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	No money changed hands. Although the Chinese got the technology,  
it is not fully operational. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials would not discuss whether American security  
was compromised. But ``the results of this investigation have been 
turned over to the Defense Department to make that determination,'' 
Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	William A. Torzolini, the company's chief financial officer,  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Orbit/FR is owned primarily by Orbit-Alchut Technologies Ltd.,  
an Israeli company. The technology in question was originally 
developed for the Israeli armed forces, Stiles said.

<HEADLINE> Groin Sidelines Slugger McGwire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire missed a chance to gain on Sammy  
Sosa in the home-run race Tuesday, sitting out with an injured left 
groin. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman left Monday night's game  
after 4 1-2 innings. He injured the groin compensating for a stiff 
back and may miss Wednesday's game as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still got a little pinch in there,'' manager Tony La  
Russa said. ``If I had to bet a dollar, I'd say Friday'' as the day 
he'll be back. The Cardinals are off Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	With 55 homers, McGwire was four behind Sosa. He finished four  
ahead of Sosa in his record 70-homer season last year. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has played 138 games and had been tied for the team lead  
with utility player Joe McEwing, who started in left field Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo Perez hit for McGwire in the fifth Monday and was  
2-for-3, his first hits with the Cardinals. Perez started at first 
base Tuesday and batted fifth, with Fernando Tatis taking McGwire's 
No. 3 slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, son of former Cincinnati Reds great Tony Perez, was  
called up Sept. 1 from Triple-A Memphis, where he hit .320 with 18 
homers and 82 RBIs. He had only two at-bats with the Cardinals 
before Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Internet Taxes Deemed Not Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A commission made up of government and business  
representatives that is studying how to tax purchases over the 
Internet could hit some heavy public opposition, judging from a 
survey released on the first day of the group's meeting in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a third of registered voters who are active Internet  
users, or 36 percent, would be less likely to vote for a political 
candidate who supports taxes on Internet purchases, according to 
the poll, released Tuesday by the Gallup Organization and (at)plan, 
an online market research firm. All told, 73 percent of active 
Internet users oppose an Internet sales tax, compared to 14 percent 
in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that 58 percent believe taxing goods and  
services bought online would hurt the growth of Internet commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings suggest why the 19-member Advisory Commission on  
Electronic Commerce, created last year by Congress, remains divided 
on key issues seven months before it is scheduled to make tax 
policy recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Registered voters are saying it may become an issue with  
political traction,'' said Mark Wright, chief executive of 
(at)plan, based in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress formed the commission last October as it imposed a  
three-year moratorium on any new state or local taxes on Internet 
access or sales. The commission is composed of representatives from 
eight businesses, eight state and local governments and three 
appointed by the Clinton administration. The group has until next 
April to make recommendations, which could result in legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many members of the group have voiced support for some form of  
taxation as long as the system makes it easy for companies to 
collect. Paramount among the considerations is gaining agreements 
from governments to adopt a single tax rate for each state, or to 
adopt new technologies that would allow businesses to figure out 
any tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
	But such a single-tax system could mean sweeping changes in how  
states and localities handle taxation. Currently, thousands of 
jurisdictions levy a wide range of taxes based on where the item is 
purchased. Taxing an out-of-state purchaser adds a new and vexing 
level of complexity. 
</P>
<P>
	Some group members, including the commission's chairman, Gov.  
James Gilmore of Virginia, are not convinced that an Internet tax 
is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say the commission is not in agreement on that,''  
Gilmore said in a telephone interview before the start of the 
two-day gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	He termed the poll results ``constructive,'' and pointed to them  
as evidence of the need for further study. He said the commission 
may not end up reaching the two-thirds consensus needed to make a 
unified policy recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the groundswell for Internet taxation is powerful. State  
and local governments are worried about losing billions of dollars 
in sales taxes as the Internet takes off. And retailers that sell 
most of their products in stores, so-called ``brick-and-mortar'' 
businesses, contend that Internet taxes level the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the government's job to make sure all levels of retailing  
are taxed equally,'' said Malachy Kavanagh, a spokesman for the 
International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group of 38,000 
shopping center owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallup and (at)plan conducted the telephone survey of 1,000  
randomly chosen frequent Internet users in the United States 
between Aug. 26 and Aug. 31. The poll has a margin of error of plus 
or minus 3 percentage points.

	During its 2-day meeting that started Tuesday, the commission  
plans to hear presentations from businesses and others, but won't 
make any decisions.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Division Head Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The head of DaimlerChrysler's Smart  
operation has resigned over differences in how to market the 
micro-compact auto. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Tuesday came on the same day that Smart  
unveiled new convertible and diesel models at the Frankfurt 
International Motor Show. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler board member Juergen Hubbert said that Lars  
Brorsen's resignation will take effect Oct. 1. A successor to lead 
Micro Compact Car, a DaimlerChrysler subsidiary, will be made later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials declined to elaborate on the differences that  
led to Brorsen's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	However, sales of the two-seater Smart, marketed for Europe's  
crowded cities, have fallen well behind initial forecasts of 
140,000 for the first year -- reaching 70,000 at the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbert acknowledged sales of the Smart were ``much less than  
originally planned,'' but said that sales have been increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders have risen from just about 2,000 a month to 2,500 a week,  
said Christoph Walther, DaimlerChrysler's senior vice president of 
communications. The company also predicts sales will rise 25 
percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker has lowered the price of the Smart and beefed up  
its marketing campaign, including offering free test drives to 
passersby in an attempt to turn sales around. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbert said the company plans to expand the Smart brand in the  
near future, also cooperating with other divisions of 
DaimlerChrysler in production. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the company unveiled a new convertible version of  
its coupe, called the City-Cabrio, that will be available in March 
2000. The car comes with a soft top that is electrically operated 
and can be opened in three ways -- from partially folded back to 
completely concealed in the trunk on the car. 
</P>
<P>
	No price for the model has been set.  
</P>
<P>
	The Smart coupe will also be offered in a diesel version that  
gets 90 miles per gallon from a 0.8 liter direct injection diesel 
engine. It will sell for $10,250. 
</P>
<P>
	A vision of the future for Smart was showcased in a concept  
roadster shown for the first time at the Frankfurt show. The 
convertible breaks out from the boxy Smart body with a longer, 
10 1/2-foot profile. But it still stands just shy of 4 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	The car incorporates the engine and other elements of the Smart  
coupe, meaning that it could placed into production more quickly, 
said Helmut Wawra, Smart's director of technical development. 
Company officials declined to speculate on when that might happen.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Declares Fla, Ga Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton said  
Wednesday the United States has done ``everything we know to do'' 
to prepare for the potential of devastation from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cut short a trip to New Zealand to head home to deal  
with the monster storm, which threatened billions of dollars worth 
of space equipment at Cape Canaveral as well as life and property 
along the southeastern coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, speaking on the last day of his weeklong trip, said the  
silos housing the U.S. space shuttles are not built to withstand 
the ferocity of Floyd's winds. Even so, Clinton said he thinks NASA 
has prepared well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've done everything we know to do,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Local and state governments have also done what they could to  
get ready, with some help from what Clinton called unprecedented 
preemptive disaster declarations for Florida and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to return home immediately after a state visit  
with New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. He called the storm 
``one of the most serious hurricanes ever to threaten the United 
States, if the predictions of its force and scope hold true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask all of you here to remember my fellow Americans,''  
Clinton said. ``I am going to fly home, and we'll make the best job 
of it that we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early declaration ``enables state and local governments to  
get equipment and other things ... in place to begin recovery 
efforts at the earliest possible moment,'' White House spokesman 
Barry Toiv said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke twice Wednesday with James Lee Witt, the director  
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to keep abreast of 
Hurricane Floyd's progress. He also consulted with Vice President 
Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Witt and Gore placed a conference call to the governors and  
other state officials of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South 
Carolina to give them the most up-to-date forecast data on Floyd's 
likely path, a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2 million coastal residents in Florida and Georgia have  
been urged to leave their homes for safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Gore communicated the declarations directly to the  
governors of Florida and Georgia, according to administration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive storm also prompted Clinton to cut short a day of  
rest planned for Hawaii on the way back from New Zealand, where he 
had attended the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 
</P>
<P>
	By canceling the Hawaii visit, Clinton will be back in  
Washington on Wednesday night, instead of Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wants to return quickly to stay on top of the  
hurricane developments,'' said Clinton spokesman Jake Siewert. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has made a practice of visiting the sites of major  
disasters to review relief operations and comfort victims. But such 
visits often are delayed until the logistics of the president's 
visit won't interfere with relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration allows FEMA to begin supporting state and local  
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize and  
provide ... equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the 
impacts of the disaster,'' according to the announcement from the 
White House.

<HEADLINE> Dole Opposes Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth  
Dole urged Congress on Tuesday to reject President Clinton's pleas 
for a global ban on nuclear test explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	She called the long-stalled Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  
``ill-conceived'' and a threat to national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Russia in turmoil, with North Korea and other threats,  
with other rogue nations moving forward, I think the U.S. will need 
-- for the foreseeable future -- a credible deterrent,'' the former 
American Red Cross president said in a telephone interview. ``A 
credible deterrent means you have to have confidence in that 
deterrent -- and that means testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, who lags well behind Republican front-runner George W.  
Bush in presidential polls, also released a statement opposing the 
pact. Clinton wants the treaty approved by a Sept. 23 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle also urged the Senate to reject  
the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``If rejection . . . sends the message that the United States  
will never be willing to give up the weapons we deem to be vital to 
preserving our national security, then that is exactly the right 
signal to send,'' Quayle said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 treaty has been signed by 152 nations but so far  
ratified by only 18 of the 44 nations with nuclear capabilities. 
The nuclear powers must approve the pact for it to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China are among the nations that have not ratified  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the treaty say it would lock in U.S. superiority  
gained in over 1,000 nuclear tests during the Cold War, while 
failing to ratify the pact could open the door to nuclear tests by 
other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argue it could threaten America's ability to deliver  
an effective nuclear strike, if one is ever needed. The treaty is 
bottled up in the Republican-led Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has not conducted a full-fledged nuclear test  
since 1992. Mrs. Dole said a long period of non-testing could 
create ``potential defects'' in the U.S. arsenal. ``Why the rush'' 
to sign a treaty? Mrs. Dole asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Coalition to Reduce  
Nuclear Dangers, cited public polls that show huge majorities of 
Americans favor the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very perilous political position to take,'' he said.  
``It puts her more on the side of (Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee chairman) Jesse Helms and less on the side of moderates 
like (former Sen.) Bob Dole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, who is married to the former senator, said the polls  
underscore a lack of knowledge about the treaty. ``We need to 
educate people about it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Web Site Defaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) --Hackers defaced the Web site of  
South Africa's national statistics agency by inserting obscenities 
and a lewd graphic onto its homepage, the government agency said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the agency linked the electronic vandalism to a  
labor dispute at the state telecommunications company, Telkom. The 
obscenities were directed at Telkom, whose subsidiary manages the 
agency's server, said Statistics South Africa's director of 
publishing, Glenn Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	Telkom has been locked in a bitter struggle with its unions,  
which went on strike Aug. 16. But Telkom rejected the notion that 
the hacking was connected to the strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got absolutely nothing to do with the labor action,''  
said company spokeswoman Amanda Singleton. She suggested the 
tampering was more probably the work of young teen-age hackers, who 
in the past have sent similarly worded abuse to Telkom. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics SA said the electronic vandalism probably took place  
Saturday night, and was not discovered by the agency until Monday 
morning. Technicians were still trying to restore a cleaned-up home 
page on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Computer Snags Threaten Hershey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Hershey Food Corp. says computer problems  
are making it miss filling some candy orders, threatening Halloween 
deliveries, one of the company's busiest times of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth L. Wolfe, chairman and chief executive, said Monday that  
deliveries would be not be back on schedule until mid-October, the 
height of the Halloween candy sales season. 
</P>
<P>
	``While order patterns have remained strong, we have been unable  
to fill them completely, in a timely fashion,'' Wolfe said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	John M. McMillin, who follows the food industry for Prudential  
Securities Inc., said having such problems fall during a busy 
season is especially damaging. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a candy company to miss part of Halloween is not as bad as  
a toy company missing part of Christmas, but it's close,'' McMillin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its earnings would be below the expected level  
for the third quarter that ends Oct. 4 and the entire fiscal year 
because of the delivery system problems that were caused by a 
computer system failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The chocolate maker said earnings for the fiscal year that ends  
Jan. 4, 2000, could be 8 percent to 10 percent below previous 
projections of $2.40 per share. The firm declined to project 
earnings for the third quarter.

<HEADLINE> Grocery 'Slotting Fees' Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At one time, Scott Garfield's family sold its  
Lee's Ice Cream in stores as far away as Saudi Arabia and South 
Korea. But you still can't scoop it up from grocery outlets near 
his Baltimore hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Garfield, testifying Tuesday before the Senate Small Business  
Committee, blamed the situation on ``slotting fees'' -- payments 
from some manufacturers to some retailers to encourage them to take 
a chance on a new product or to ensure good shelf space. 
</P>
<P>
	A supermarket trade group, however, defended the practice,  
saying small businesses would be worse off if that money were not 
changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
	But Garfield and two other entrepreneurs criticized slotting  
fees as an unfair business practice that was contributing to their 
demise. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, I could not enter the market because of  
slotting fees,'' said Garfield, vice president of the company his 
late father started in 1979. ``The small manufacturer cannot 
compete with that hurdle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How is it possible that there was a demand in Saudi Arabia and  
in South Korea for my product, but not in my own backyard?'' he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	A businesswoman identified only as Witness B said ``nothing  
positive'' has come from her experience with the practice. The 
woman, whose face was covered by a hood as she was led into the 
hearing room, testified from behind a screen. Her voice was 
electronically scrambled. 
</P>
<P>
	Her ``family's American dream is collapsing,'' she said, because  
the company started by her parents more than 40 years ago cannot 
afford the ``exorbitant slotting fees'' needed to secure space on 
supermarket shelves. To preserve her anonymity, no details about 
the business were released. 
</P>
<P>
	Slotting fees cost grocery manufacturers at least $9 billion  
yearly, and are usually negotiated in private without public 
disclosure of their terms, said Gregory Gundlach, a marketing 
professor at the University of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Gundlach said the practice was spreading to other industries,  
including computer software, compact discs, books, apparel and 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	John Motley, a senior vice president at the Food Marketing  
Institute, which represents retail food stores, said there would be 
no issue if shelf space were unlimited. ``But ... we have too many 
choices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical supermarket stocks 30,000 items out of the more than  
100,000 available. Another 15,000 to 20,000 products are introduced 
each year, and 80 percent of new items fail, Motley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slotting fees help offset the costs of handling new products,  
such as warehousing, stocking and altering electronic scanning 
files, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Motley also disagreed that the fees hurt smaller businesses.  
Without them, he said, smaller retailers and suppliers would likely 
lose to bigger, better-financed companies that can afford to 
advertise and promote their products. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offering of such allowances tells the retailer that the  
supplier stands behind the product and is willing to share in the 
risk of failure,'' Motley said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., the committee chairman, said  
the fees prevent some small businesses from ever getting their 
products into some markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retail shelf space is some of the most expensive real estate  
that money can buy,'' he said. ``With no markets, you've got no 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond also urged businesses to complain to the Federal Trade  
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Motley said the FTC has reviewed the practice on several  
occasions and has not concluded that slotting fees are 
anti-competitive or should be ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bond, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, the panel's senior  
Democrat, seemed skeptical. A former small business owner himself, 
he said there is a ``legitimate question'' about whether slotting 
fees fit the country's standard of free and open competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``At best such a practice would seem ... suspicious,'' Kerry  
said. ``Why does a business have to pay a fee to reserve space on a 
shelf?''

<HEADLINE>  118 Killed in Moscow Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Security forces checked railway stations and  
markets across Russia today for suspects and explosives after at 
least 118 people died in a suspected bomb blast that demolished an 
apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers continued to search the wreckage for victims of  
Monday's explosion in Moscow, the fourth major blast in Russia in 
two weeks. Search crews today reached the building's basement, 
which was full of water from burst pipes. Children's toys floated 
in the muck. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion that leveled  
the eight-story building. Police suspect a bomb caused the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found a cache of nearly 2 tons of explosives and a  
70-yard length of fuse in another apartment block in southwestern 
Moscow, Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said today. The 
explosives were discovered Monday and the building was evacuated, 
and bomb experts exploded them safely at a military training 
ground, Interior Ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities blamed terrorists, and the government ordered a  
security operation in Moscow and other cities. Police fanned out 
through railway and subway stations and other crowded areas of the 
capital, checking identity papers. They also searched for stores of 
explosives in buildings across Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people suspected of being linked with the blast have been  
detained, police said. They gave no details, though the Interfax 
news agency said two owned companies with offices on the ground 
floor of the destroyed building. 
</P>
<P>
	Police released sketches and photographs of three other men  
suspected of involvement in the explosion, including a man who 
allegedly rented space in the building destroyed Monday and another 
Moscow apartment building that was blown up Thursday. At least 93 
people died in that blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Islamic militants were blamed for an apartment blast in the  
Dagestani city of Buinaksk about a week ago that killed 64. One 
person died and about 30 were injured in the bombing of a crowded 
shopping mall near the Kremlin on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the cases has been solved.  
</P>
<P>
	The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, opened today  
after its summer break with a closed session on security in the 
wake of the explosions and fighting between Russian forces and 
Islamic militants in the southern Russian region of Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obvious to us that both in Dagestan and in Moscow we are  
dealing not with independent fighters, but rather with well-trained 
international saboteurs,'' Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told the 
session, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't self-taught, but rather demolition specialists in  
the widest sense,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many officials linked the two apartment building blasts to the  
fighting in Dagestan, which neighbors breakaway Chechnya. Putin 
called for a ``quarantine'' around Chechnya, to cut off a route for 
weapons and Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin ordered tight security at airports,  
nuclear power stations, oil pipelines and other possible targets 
across the country. He ordered Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to have 
all the 30,000 residential buildings in Moscow searched for 
explosives. Police said this afternoon that more than 26,000 had 
been checked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrorists are trying to scare the Russian people. They are  
trying to demoralize the state,'' Yeltsin declared. 
</P>
<P>
	He met today with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Interior  
Minister Rushailo, who is in charge of police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military will join the security operations in  
Moscow, Sergeyev said afterward. He did not give details. 
</P>
<P>
	Luzkhov hinted that the capital's ``guests'' or visitors --  
especially those not registered with the police -- could be evicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Business was slack at Moscow markets today. At one market, about  
150 riot troops demanded documents from every vendor and many 
shoppers, detaining more than 50 people not properly registered. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's blast increased concern that the government might use  
the rash of explosions to declare a state of emergency. Opponents 
of Yeltsin have claimed for months that the president is looking 
for a chance to assume emergency powers so he can suppress his foes 
and bolster his hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said today he had seen a  
plan drafted by Yeltsin's staff for a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Kremlin aides immediately denied any such plans. The deputy  
chief of Yeltsin's staff, Igor Shabdurasulov, called Zyuganov's 
comments ``delirium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-story building crashed to the ground in Monday's  
blast, its beige bricks crushed to rubble and dust. 
</P>
<P>
	By today, rescuers had removed 118 bodies, including 13  
children, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. Nine wounded 
people were hospitalized, including several residents of a nearby 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	The building was located in a quiet, nondescript residential  
area, close to a school and two kindergartens.

markets across Russia today for suspects and explosives after at 
least 118 people died in a suspected bomb blast that demolished an 
apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers continued to search the wreckage for victims of  
Monday's explosion in Moscow, the fourth major blast in Russia in 
two weeks. Search crews today reached the building's basement, 
which was full of water from burst pipes. Children's toys floated 
in the muck. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion that leveled  
the eight-story building. Police suspect a bomb caused the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found a cache of nearly 2 tons of explosives and a  
70-yard length of fuse in another apartment block in southwestern 
Moscow, Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said today. The 
explosives were discovered Monday and the building was evacuated, 
and bomb experts exploded them safely at a military training 
ground, Interior Ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities blamed terrorists, and the government ordered a  
security operation in Moscow and other cities. Police fanned out 
through railway and subway stations and other crowded areas of the 
capital, checking identity papers. They also searched for stores of 
explosives in buildings across Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people suspected of being linked with the blast have been  
detained, police said. They gave no details, though the Interfax 
news agency said two owned companies with offices on the ground 
floor of the destroyed building. 
</P>
<P>
	Police released sketches and photographs of three other men  
suspected of involvement in the explosion, including a man who 
allegedly rented space in the building destroyed Monday and another 
Moscow apartment building that was blown up Thursday. At least 93 
people died in that blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Islamic militants were blamed for an apartment blast in the  
Dagestani city of Buinaksk about a week ago that killed 64. One 
person died and about 30 were injured in the bombing of a crowded 
shopping mall near the Kremlin on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the cases has been solved.  
</P>
<P>
	The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, opened today  
after its summer break with a closed session on security in the 
wake of the explosions and fighting between Russian forces and 
Islamic militants in the southern Russian region of Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obvious to us that both in Dagestan and in Moscow we are  
dealing not with independent fighters, but rather with well-trained 
international saboteurs,'' Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told the 
session, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't self-taught, but rather demolition specialists in  
the widest sense,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many officials linked the two apartment building blasts to the  
fighting in Dagestan, which neighbors breakaway Chechnya. Putin 
called for a ``quarantine'' around Chechnya, to cut off a route for 
weapons and Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin ordered tight security at airports,  
nuclear power stations, oil pipelines and other possible targets 
across the country. He ordered Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to have 
all the 30,000 residential buildings in Moscow searched for 
explosives. Police said this afternoon that more than 26,000 had 
been checked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrorists are trying to scare the Russian people. They are  
trying to demoralize the state,'' Yeltsin declared. 
</P>
<P>
	He met today with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Interior  
Minister Rushailo, who is in charge of police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military will join the security operations in  
Moscow, Sergeyev said afterward. He did not give details. 
</P>
<P>
	Luzkhov hinted that the capital's ``guests'' or visitors --  
especially those not registered with the police -- could be evicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Business was slack at Moscow markets today. At one market, about  
150 riot troops demanded documents from every vendor and many 
shoppers, detaining more than 50 people not properly registered. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's blast increased concern that the government might use  
the rash of explosions to declare a state of emergency. Opponents 
of Yeltsin have claimed for months that the president is looking 
for a chance to assume emergency powers so he can suppress his foes 
and bolster his hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said today he had seen a  
plan drafted by Yeltsin's staff for a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Kremlin aides immediately denied any such plans. The deputy  
chief of Yeltsin's staff, Igor Shabdurasulov, called Zyuganov's 
comments ``delirium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-story building crashed to the ground in Monday's  
blast, its beige bricks crushed to rubble and dust. 
</P>
<P>
	By today, rescuers had removed 118 bodies, including 13  
children, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. Nine wounded 
people were hospitalized, including several residents of a nearby 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	The building was located in a quiet, nondescript residential  
area, close to a school and two kindergartens.

<HEADLINE>  N. Ireland Terrorist Walks Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- One of Northern Ireland's most  
notorious anti-Catholic terrorists walked free from prison today in 
the latest controversial step to keep the province's precarious 
peace accord from unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a black muscle shirt and backward baseball cap, Johnny  
``Mad Dog'' Adair thrust a clenched fist in the air as he left the 
Maze prison southwest of Belfast surrounded by flag-waving 
supporters, some of whom covered their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Adair served five years of a 16-year sentence after being  
convicted of the unprecedented charge of ``directing terrorism.'' 
That reflected his pivotal role as commander of the outlawed Ulster 
Defense Association in the Protestant Shankill district of Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his 1994 arrest, Adair boasted of his responsibility for  
slaying scores of Catholic civilians as part of the Ulster Defense 
Association's self-styled war against nearby Catholic districts, 
from which the outlawed Irish Republican Army draws support. 
</P>
<P>
	Adair -- a stocky man with a close-shaven head and double hoop  
earrings -- is admired and feared equally by his terrorist 
underlings as a particularly volatile and dangerous figure. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior detective who gathered the case against Adair thinks  
the Ulster Defense Association would never have called its 1994 
cease-fire if Adair hadn't already been jailed. Confronted by 
images of peace doves that year, Adair responded, ``stuff your 
doves.'' His words are still spray-painted on Shankill walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's governor for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, initially  
opposed his parole under the peace accord, citing his potential for 
marshaling support to break the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Ulster Defense Association threatened riots unless Adair  
was treated the same as 292 other prisoners, including leading 
convicted IRA terrorists, already paroled in terms of the Good 
Friday accord of 1998. It specified that all imprisoned members of 
truce-observing groups should be freed by July 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ulster Defense Association's affiliated political party, the  
Ulster Democrats, said today that Adair had converted to the cause 
of peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulster Democrats spokesman John White -- himself a former  
life-sentence prisoner who knifed a Catholic politician and his 
Protestant girlfriend to death in 1973 -- stood beside Adair at the 
prison gates. 
</P>
<P>
	As Adair folded his tattooed arms and smirked in silence, White  
said he wanted ``to thank Mr. Adair personally for his role in the 
whole peace process from its inception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to efforts to salvage key sections of the Good Friday  
accord, White added that Adair ``believes firmly the best way to 
resolve them is through dialogue and nonviolence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adair left behind a prison cell decorated with a poster  
depicting a satanic figure on a field of skulls and the motto: 
``Kill 'em all -- let God sort 'em out.''

<HEADLINE> Pioneer Flour Changes With Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) -- Carl Hilmar Guenther aimed to serve  
his own little community when he founded Pioneer Flour Mills next 
to the San Antonio River in the 1850s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today his descendants are doing that and much more.  
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer Flour Mills, which recently resurrected its corporate  
name, C.H. Guenther &AMP; Son Inc., touts itself as the oldest 
continually owned family flour-milling operation in the country, 
and it still makes the basic grain products it has turned out for 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the privately held company has also become a major producer  
of biscuit and gravy mixes, and fills niches in other modern-day 
food markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to stay in business 150 years, you must be  
competitive,'' said Rich DeGregorio, president and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The producer of Pioneer brand wheat and corn flour, the company  
also makes White Lily, a soft, white flour popular in food stores 
in the South and sold nationally through the catalog of the upscale 
Williams-Sonoma kitchen stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Guenther &AMP; Son acquired White Lily, based in Knoxville, Tenn.,  
about five years ago. The company also operates Pioneer Frozen 
Foods in Duncanville, acquired in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Its San Antonio plant is just south of downtown and can be  
recognized by its old, tall white grain elevator, a landmark in the 
historic King William district. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the company employs about 800 workers.  
</P>
<P>
	Although professional managers like DeGregorio have been hired  
from other food companies, Guenther &AMP; Son considers itself a family 
business. Dozens of Guenther's descendants remain shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	It has gained a national reputation in the food-service industry  
as a supplier to restaurant chains and is one of the nation's 
largest white gravy producers, DeGregorio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sold dry in ready-to-make packets, Pioneer gravies include  
biscuit, country, old-fashioned turkey, chicken, brown and assorted 
no-fat varieties. Cajun brown, roasted garlic and jalapeno gravies 
were introduced this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer produces biscuit, cornbread, pancake, waffle and  
tortilla mixes, frozen dough, and chili and taco seasoning. It also 
sells flour tortilla dough balls. 
</P>
<P>
	In the company's massive warehouse, pallets are stacked high  
with packaged foods ready for shipment to well-known restaurants 
and groceries. For proprietary reasons, DeGregorio wouldn't allow 
the clients to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	In a typical year, Guenther &AMP; Son processes nearly 3 million  
bushels of wheat and corn, DeGregorio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a lot of grain. That's a lot of rail cars,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And that's a long way from the simple mill Guenther established  
in 1851, first in Fredericksburg next to Live Oak Creek, then at 
the San Antonio River site in 1859. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Hilmar Guenther was part of an established family in  
Germany but apparently sought the thrill of making it on his own in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy was an adventurer, just to leave a family situation  
when they were already successful,'' DeGregorio said. ``In many 
ways, quite the American story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guenther oversaw the mill himself until 1902 before passing it  
down to a son. 
</P>
<P>
	These days the company takes pride in its ability to adapt in  
the constantly changing food marketplace, DeGregorio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not the gorilla,'' he said. ``But we know how to fit  
into the niches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company knows how to highlight its history, too.  
</P>
<P>
	A picturesque, limestone house that Guenther built next to the  
San Antonio plant in 1860 was restored in the late 1980s and opened 
to the public as a restaurant, store and museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Guenther family photos and memorabilia are on display along with  
a collection of Dresden china anniversary plates that the mill 
commissioned each year and gave to grocer customers until 
production of the German dishes ended during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	An average of 150 to 200 people per day visit the Guenther House  
during the peak spring and fall seasons, said director Donna 
Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
	Not coincidentally, the indoor-outdoor restaurant features the  
types of food produced by the Pioneer plant, offering such 
breakfast items as biscuits and gravy and southern sweet cream 
waffles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no other waffle like our waffle. It's wonderful and  
addicting,'' Ms. Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep customers loyal to Pioneer products, the company prides  
itself on its quality assurance program, which relies in part on 
strict laboratory and kitchen testing as well as taste testing, 
DeGregorio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We trade on that and live on that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As C.H. Guenther &AMP; Son approaches its sesquicentennial,  
DeGregorio believes the company is well-positioned for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a very competitive situation today,'' he said. ``We  
can perpetuate our business for quite a few years to come.''

<HEADLINE> Sentencing for Talk Show Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A man who fatally shot a gay acquaintance  
who revealed a crush on him during a taping of ``The Jenny Jones 
Show'' was sentenced Tuesday to 25 to 50 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Schmitz trembled as Oakland County Circuit Court Judge  
Wendy Potts sentenced him for the 1995 shotgun slaying of Scott 
Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sentence of this court will rob you of your youth, but it  
will not rob you of your life,'' Potts told Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, 28, apologized to the Amedure family and said, ``I'd  
like to ask God for forgiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz received the same sentence in 1996, but it was based on  
a conviction that later was overturned on appeal. Schmitz remained 
in prison while he was tried and convicted of murder again. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's weeping mother asked the judge to give Schmitz a long  
prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	``When will we be able to get on with our lives? When will  
justice be served and be final?'' Patricia Graves said, her voice 
cracking. Amedure's father, Frank Amedure Sr., also wept as he 
spoke, telling the judge, ``I'll never see my son's smile again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Jerome Sabbota asked for no more than 15 years  
in prison. He said he would also appeal this conviction, arguing 
that jurors should have been allowed to hear evidence about 
Schmitz's suicidal behavior and alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was convicted Aug. 26 of second-degree murder in the  
shotgun death of Amedure, who had appeared with him on a March 1995 
taping of the talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	During the episode, titled ``Same-Sex Secret Crushes,'' Amedure  
revealed his crush on Schmitz, along with a sexual fantasy. During 
the taping, Schmitz said he was heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz killed Amedure three days later in the victim's home.  
</P>
<P>
	In April, jurors in a wrongful death case against Warner Bros.,  
the corporate parent of ``The Jenny Jones Show,'' awarded Amedure's 
family $25 million. That verdict is being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones and the producers of the show were not called to  
testify at Schmitz's second trial, as they had been in the first 
criminal trial and the civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first criminal trial, Schmitz's lawyers argued that  
mental illness and the ambush tactics of the Jones show pushed him 
into a rage that led to the killing. For the second one, a 
different set of lawyers, barred from using a mental defense, 
attempted to shift the blame to Amedure, saying he stalked Schmitz.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Sets Most-Wanted Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAXONBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A man charged with the 1980 killing of a  
small-town police chief has set the record for the most time on the 
FBI's most-wanted list. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Eugene Webb, who would be 68 if he is alive, on Tuesday  
reached 6,705 days on the list, one day more than Charles Lee 
Herron, who was a fugitive from 1968 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb made the list in 1981, five months after allegedly shooting  
Saxonburg Police Chief Gregory Adams, who had pulled him over for 
driving through a stop sign. At the time, Webb was wanted for 
burglary in Colonie, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb's white Mercury Cougar later turned up at a motel in  
Warwick, R.I. There was blood on the floor near the steering wheel, 
and authorities believe Adams may have wounded Webb before dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb has been on ``America's Most Wanted'' three times and  
``Unsolved Mysteries'' once, but the shows have not yielded 
fruitful tips. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI started its wanted list 49 years ago, and its subjects  
stay on it for an average of 316 days.

<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mellon Bank Corp. plans to change its name to  
Mellon Financial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The new name reflects the company's attempts to be the  
best-performing financial services company, Mellon Chairman and 
Chief Executive Martin McGuinn said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The name change was expected to take effect early in the fourth  
quarter. The company was founded in Pittsburgh in 1869 as T. Mellon

</P>
<P>
	Separately, Mellon also said it completed repurchasing 20  
million shares of Mellon common stock and will ask its board next 
week to authorize a new repurchase program for another 25 million 
shares of Mellon stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon has about $2.5 trillion in assets under management,

<HEADLINE> Packers Count Blessings With Favre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Antuan Edwards had never seen Brett  
Favre's magic up close before. 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie cornerback didn't watch many Green Bay Packers games  
during his college years at Clemson. Like any football fan, he knew 
something of Favre's skills, but after watching him lead Green Bay 
on two fourth-quarter touchdown drives in a 28-24 win over the 
Oakland Raiders on Sunday, he had a whole new appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's something amazing,'' Edwards said. ``He was just in  
control out there. I've hardly ever seen something like that on a 
football field. It was great to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre saved Green Bay late, but the Packers say they need to  
save themselves next week. They must rebound from 50 minutes of 
uneven football against the Raiders, who looked like the better 
team until Favre took over. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers face the Detroit Lions, one of four NFC Central  
teams to win its opening game, in the Pontiac Silverdome on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiefly, the Packers must cut down on mistakes and turnovers  
that allowed the Raiders to take a 24-14 lead in the fourth quarter 
despite managing only two offensive drives of any length. Oakland 
went just 32 and 21 yards after Green Bay turnovers to score 10 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had four turnovers, and very seldom do you win a game with  
that many turnovers,'' coach Ray Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the team threw just five interceptions and didn't fumble  
in its four exhibition games, Favre had three passes picked off 
against Oakland. But only one was his fault, as the other two 
ricocheted off receivers Mark Chmura and Corey Bradford. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorsey Levens rushed for 78 yards behind an inconsistent  
offensive line, but he also dropped two passes and fumbled. Green 
Bay's lack of a solid running game last season, which many blamed 
on Levens' absence from nine games because of injury, had more to 
do with the line's play against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we've got some work to do, but we're learning every  
day,'' said guard Mike Wahle, who made his first career start. 
``That's a tough front line they have, but we hung in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On defense, the Packers said Oakland's 153 rushing yards were  
misleading. Defensive tackle Santana Dotson noted 48 came on one 
run by Napoleon Kaufman, and Green Bay's defense limited Tyrone 
Wheatley to 52 yards on 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't allow big plays, the stat sheet looks different,''  
Dotson said. ``If you notice, in the last two minutes, if they 
could have run the ball they could have run the clock out, but they 
couldn't run it against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay will need more run defense against the Lions, who ran  
the ball well in a surprising 28-20 win at Seattle on Sunday. Even 
without Barry Sanders, the Lions have an offense adept at helping a 
ground game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a guy like Barry Sanders is absent from that football  
team, that makes guys want to prove that they can still get this 
thing done without Barry Sanders,'' Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders had consistent offensive success with eight passes  
to running backs, often over or through the charging Packers 
defense, and Rhodes promised to firm up against the tactic. 
Linebacker Brian Williams, who had 16 tackles in one of his best 
games as a Packer, was quick to stop long gains on most of those 
plays.

<HEADLINE> Baylor Reeling After Wacky Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- Joe Jackson is trying to avoid contact with  
football fans this week, and not because he's afraid of being 
taunted about Baylor's two last-second losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Jackson said he and the Bears fear something much worse  
than ridicule -- pity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get tired of being consoled,'' the sophomore center said.  
``You hear `get 'em next time' a lot, but that's not something that 
you want to hear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People are finding it easier than ever to feel sorry for Baylor  
after Saturday's bizarre 27-24 loss to UNLV. With less than 20 
seconds to play, Baylor had a three-point lead and the ball inside 
the Rebels 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of having his quarterback take a knee and run out the  
clock, first-year coach Kevin Steele elected to go for one more 
score by calling a running play. The Bears paid the price when 
Darrel Bush fumbled into the end zone and UNLV's Kevin Thomas 
returned it for a game-winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of weird to hear 30,000 jaws drop at the same  
time,'' Jackson said. ``That was really tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor kicker Kyle Atteberry, who missed an extra point on the  
last play of overtime in the opening-week loss to Boston College, 
said it has taken several days for the reality of the sudden UNLV 
loss to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was just shocked,'' Atteberry said. ``You've got to  
go through some personal time of mourning, but you've only got a 
short while to think about it because we play again this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears are trying to pick up the pieces in time to salvage  
what they insist can still be a successful season. Players and 
coaches all said that process starts with forgetting about the past 
two weeks, even though questions about the losses are sure to 
follow them the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele, who took full responsibility for the defeat Saturday and  
called it ``a stupid mistake on my part,'' said Tuesday he no 
longer will talk with the media about the final play of the UNLV 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have rectified it as a team,'' Steele said. ``We've  
challenged each other, it's been a great bonding experience and 
it's over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Steele has received criticism from the public about his  
decision to run the ball on the last play, he has received nothing 
but support from the Baylor players and assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	Even defensive coordinator Brick Haley, whose unit wasn't on the  
field when the game-winning touchdown occurred, said he agreed with 
Steele's call. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you question what happened on that last play, that's like  
taking the sword out of these guys' hands,'' Haley said. ``We say 
we want to build an attitude, and you can't do that by taking a 
knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atteberry said the players all wanted the team to go for the  
extra touchdown, and said he knew Steele would give them that 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't surprise me,'' Atteberry said. ``We talked all week  
about finishing the job. The crowd would have been cheering if we 
had scored. It was just a one-in-a-million thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the crushing finishes of their first two games, the  
Bears have already shown dramatic improvement from their 2-9 season 
in 1998. Last year, Baylor ranked 98th or lower nationally in five 
major categories, including total offense and total defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele, who spent the past six seasons as a linebackers coach  
for the Carolina Panthers, said he thinks the Bears' steadily 
increasing confidence on both sides of the ball eventually will 
outweigh lingering effects from the early losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``For football players, it's second nature to put bad things  
behind you or you don't stand a chance,'' Steele said. ``These guys 
know that. We've just had too much practice at it.''

<HEADLINE> Georgia Couple To Keep Lost Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RINGGOLD, Ga. (AP) -- More than a year and a half after Kathy  
Fulton found two plastic bags stuffed with $279,000 in her 
driveway, a judge has ruled she and her husband can keep 40 percent 
of it. That means the Fultons get $111,616. 
</P>
<P>
	No, wait! Their attorneys get a one-third contingency fee, so  
that leaves $74,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Oops! Don't forget Uncle Sam. After federal taxes are taken out,  
the couple will have about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their shrunken share, the Fultons' lead attorney, James  
McKoon, said the couple couldn't be happier. He said Monday they 
plan to use it to help pay off their home mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fulton found the cash in December 1997. She ran over the  
bags on her driveway while taking her children to school. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests revealed the bags were tainted with cocaine and traces of  
chemicals used to make methamphetamine. Authorities believe the 
cash was part of a money-laundering operation in Tennessee and 
Georgia, and prosecutors argued all the money should go to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple settled for 40 percent. A federal judge approved the  
deal in July.

<HEADLINE> LSU Captain Arrested for Stealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Larry Foster, a captain on LSU's  
football team, was arrested Tuesday on a purse-snatching charge 
after being chased down and identified by several students. 
</P>
<P>
	The starting wide receiver was booked into the East Baton Rouge  
Parish Jail, LSU Police Capt. Ricky Adams said. Bail was set at 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gerry DiNardo said he did not immediately want to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	A student said her purse was stolen Monday as she sat on a  
campus bench. Several other students said they saw the theft and 
chased Foster into a bathroom in the music building about a 
half-mile from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster was confronted as he left the bathroom and he identified  
himself before walking away, Adams said. The purse, missing about 
$20, was found in the bathroom, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses identified Foster from photos.  
</P>
<P>
	The senior was expected to be one of the Tigers' leading  
receivers this year. As a junior, he caught 56 passes for 722 yards 
and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, one of four team captains, missed last weekend's game  
against North Texas with a pulled hamstring. He returned to 
practice Monday and had been expected to play against Auburn on 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Crews Hunt For Greek Quake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Crews wearing surgical masks hunted  
Tuesday for the last victims of a powerful earthquake that killed 
129 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Six others were hospitalized in serious condition after the  
Sept. 7 quake, which flattened parts of working class and immigrant 
districts north of central Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	With 11 people missing and presumed dead, the death toll is  
expected to climb to 140. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been little hope left of finding survivors, and crews  
were mainly working to collect bodies before bulldozers and other 
heavy equipment move in to clear the wreckage from the deadliest 
quake to hit Greece in more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 6,500 damaged homes slated for demolition, as  
many as 100,000 people could need shelter. The government set a 
two-month deadline to move the homeless from tent cities to more 
durable housing. But that may not be soon enough to beat the rainy 
and raw weather common during the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece's defense minister, Akis Tsochadzopoulos, said troops  
will help erect 5,000 prefabricated homes. He also announced plans 
to scale back on the number of military maneuvers this year, and 
use the saved funds to buy some of the homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision apparently came after a warming of relations  
between Greece and traditional rival Turkey, which was rocked by a 
7.3 magnitude quake on Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries, recently engaged in a massive multibillion  
dollar arms buildup, rushed to help each other in the quakes' 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek prosecutors moved ahead with a flurry of subpoenas in its  
investigation of whether builders used shortcuts to bypass 
anti-quake regulations. The preliminary investigation has focused 
on a five-story kitchen-products factory that collapsed in the 
magnitude 5.9 quake and left more than 20 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou estimated the quake damage  
to reach at least $655 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Onassis foundation, a charitable trust founded by the late  
Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, pledged $955,000 to the 
quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was the deadliest in Greece since 1953, when 476  
people died on the Ionian Sea island of Cephalonia.

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Rejects Textile Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- An appeals court on Tuesday rejected a textile  
industry trade organization's claim that The Limited Inc. and other 
retailers committed customs fraud against the government to try and 
avoid paying customs fees and fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld lower court rulings  
against the American Textile Manufacturers Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Black, a Washington lawyer for the textile institute,  
said its lawyers will consider either asking the full 15-judge 
appeals court to rehear the case or for the U.S. Supreme Court to 
review it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited's management said in a statement Tuesday that it is  
pleased with the court's ruling and that it complies with all U.S. 
laws governing imports and asks that its suppliers do so as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The textile institute claimed that The Limited and the other  
retailers were lying to the government about the country from which 
the apparel was being imported. The apparel in question was from 
China, the lawsuit claims, but the retailers told the U.S. customs 
authorities it was from Hong Kong or Macau because of textile 
import quota limits that could have kept the Chinese-made goods 
from being brought into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Falsely labeling the imports enabled the retailers to avoid  
paying potential customs fees or fines, the textile organization's 
lawyers argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for The Limited, a Columbus-based clothing store chain,  
argued that the textile institute's lawsuit was filed under a 
federal law, the False Claims Act, that does not apply to such 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1863 law was enacted to allow citizens to sue to recover  
money in cases in which they believe the government has been 
defrauded, in exchange for being able to keep part of the money 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute represents U.S. textile and apparel manufacturers.  
At issue are undetermined amounts of import fees that the industry 
group argues were due the government on millions of dollars worth 
of garment shipments into the United States from 1986 to 1996, when 
the lawsuit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John Holschuh in 1997 upheld the defendants'  
argument that the False Claims Act does not apply to this case. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, the government has the option to take over the  
burden of prosecuting a citizen's lawsuit. The government is 
investigating the textile industry's allegations in this case but 
declined to take over the lawsuit, said Douglas Letter, a Justice 
Department attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants are The Limited, affiliated retailers including  
Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Lane Bryant, Structure, 
Express and Lerner New York, and apparel importers Tarrant Apparel 
Group, of Los Angeles, and Mast Industries Inc., of Andover, Mass.

<HEADLINE> Florida Braces for Hurricane Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- More than 1 million people were told to evacuate  
the Atlantic coast Monday and NASA all but abandoned Cape Canaveral 
as Hurricane Floyd -- one of the most powerful storms ever to 
threaten the United States -- charged toward Florida with 
potentially catastrophic 155 mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was much larger than Hurricane Andrew, which smashed into  
South Florida in 1992, causing $25 billion in damage, killing 26 
people and leaving 160,000 homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said Floyd would brush past the Bahamas overnight  
and could hit land in the next couple of days between central 
Florida and South Carolina. They predicted it was capable of 
causing enormous damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary. It's very scary,'' said Gov. Jeb Bush, who  
declared a state of emergency Monday night. ``Andrew hit Miami in 
the middle of the night and it was haunting. This is as strong and 
... three times bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm could be dangerous even if it does not come ashore.  
Floyd's hurricane-force winds -- at least 74 mph -- extended for 125 
miles. Andrew's hurricane-force winds extended about 25 or 30 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	With a hurricane warning in effect Monday from Florida City,  
south of Miami, to Brunswick, Ga., residents along 400 miles of 
coastline packed stores to stock up on canned food, bottled water, 
plywood and aluminum shutters. Navy ships left port to ride out the 
storm at sea, and aircraft were sent inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said 1 million people were urged to evacuate in  
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines canceled all its Tuesday flights at airports  
in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Orlando. In all, 
about 400 flights were canceled, most at American's Miami hub. 
United Airlines and US Airways also canceled all flights into and 
out of South Florida on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia was under a hurricane watch from Brunswick to Savannah,  
a 70-mile span, and forecasters said that likely would be extended 
into South Carolina overnight. Coastal residents in the Brunswick 
and Savannah areas were urged to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the most serious threat we've had to the  
Georgia coast this century,'' said Gary McConnell, director of the 
Georgia Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 600 National Guard troops  
and 500 state police to the coast to help in case an evacuation is 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kennedy Space Center, which is just 9 feet above sea level,  
almost all of the 12,500 workers were leaving. A skeleton crew 
remained behind, but they, too, will evacuate if the wind is as 
fierce as predicted. That would be the first complete evacuation of 
the space center ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of NASA's space shuttles were in a hangar that was  
designed to withstand wind of only up to 105 mph. A fourth was in a 
building designed to stand winds of up to 125 mph. Four 
multimillion-dollar rockets were exposed on launch pads and could 
not be moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal Studios and other tourist attractions in central  
Florida that were built in the last 30 years and have never been 
through a major hurricane prepared by lowering water levels in 
manmade lagoons and removing trash cans and anything else that 
could become projectiles. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. EDT, Floyd was 265 miles east-southeast of Miami. The  
hurricane was moving slightly north of due west near 14 mph with 
top winds of 155 mph -- just below Category 5 strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters predicted that Floyd would turn northwest on  
Tuesday, possibly sparing Miami and other parts of South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States since  
records have been kept: the 1935 Labor Day storm that slammed the 
Florida Keys, killing 423 people, and Hurricane Camille, which 
roared ashore in Mississippi in 1969, killing 256. Andrew was a 
Category 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters in North Carolina said the storm could move through  
there Wednesday night. Coastal residents, still recovering from 
Hurricane Dennis last week, were reminded of Hurricane Hugo, which 
hit South Carolina 10 years ago this month and was one of the 
state's worst disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hurricane Floyd is huge, he's powerful, he's fast, and he's  
mean,'' said Richard Moore, North Carolina's public safety 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	James McDougal of Cocoa, Fla., spent the last day of his  
vacation Monday at a Home Depot in Merritt Island, waiting to pick 
up plywood to cover his home's windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a mess,'' he said of the store. ``Once you get  
inside, every single cash register is crammed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	June Mastandrea, whose home was destroyed by Andrew, said she  
was already prepared for Floyd and was doing some last-minute food 
shopping for friends. She had already told employees in her cabinet 
business to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am ready,'' she said. ``I'm too busy to think about it. If I  
do I'll start to cry.''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A drop in shares of financial services and banks,  
prompted by concern that the European Central Bank might tighten 
interest rates to strengthen the euro, caused European stocks to 
close lower overall Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell to $1.0298, its weakest since July 20, and hit a  
record low of 109.75 against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies  
fell 2.14 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 314.68. The Dow Jones 
Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in countries that 
joined the single currency, closed down 2.15 points, at 331.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 29.08 points to 3,858.01,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 45.71 points at 3,741.96. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, Germany's Xetra DAX index closed with a  
loss of 0.7 percent to 5,446.91 but dealers said the decrease -- 
sparked by the euro's marked slump against the dollar -- was 
contained by an options expiry coming up Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	SAP shares closed with a gain of 3.91 euros to 446.01 euros  
after the company announced it would launch an Internet-based 
product that should account for a significant chunk of its business 
in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the FTSE 100 index closed down 0.4 percent, to  
6,169.0. News that Vodafone and Bell Atlantic are in talks, 
however, caused shares of Vodafone AirTouch to climb 60 pence to 
1,253 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris CAC-40 index fell 0.6 percent to 4,716.78, Amsterdam's  
AEX index fell 0.7 percent to 587.59, and Milan's MIBtel index 
closed with a loss of 0.4 percent to 34,546.

<HEADLINE> 'Honeymooners' Co-Creator Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Harry Crane, co-creator of Jackie  
Gleason's classic 1950s sitcom ``The Honeymooners'' and comedy 
writer for Red Skelton, the Marx Brothers, Bing Crosby and others, 
died Tuesday of cancer. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Crane died at his Beverly Hills home, according to publicist  
Warren Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
	The writer, who worked on movies as well as television, had  
another link to Hollywood: He was the grandfather of actresses 
Melissa Gilbert (``Little House on the Prairie'') and Sara Gilbert 
(``Roseanne''). 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City native was 19 when he started performing  
stand-up comedy. He was recruited by MGM as a screenwriter, earning 
his first credit on ``Air Raid Wardens'' (1943), starring Stan 
Laurel and Oliver Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Harvey Girls'' (1946) and ``Song of the Thin Man'' (1947)  
were among other films Crane worked on before moving to the new 
medium of television. He and Joe Bigelow were staff writers for 
``Cavalcade of Stars'' when Gleason, the variety show's new host, 
asked for help in developing a sketch. 
</P>
<P>
	Gleason told the writers he wanted to play an ``everyday working  
stiff'' who lived with his long-suffering wife in a little Brooklyn 
flat, according to the book ``Classic Sitcoms,'' by Vince Waldron, 
Silman-James Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The two created a scene involving squabbling Ralph and Alice  
Kramden, and the couple became a variety show mainstay for Gleason 
and then in 1955 the basis for the 39-episode sitcom ``The 
Honeymooners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his half-century career, Crane also put laughs into TV  
series, specials and nightclub acts for such singers as Crosby and 
Frank Sinatra and worked with other writers and performers, 
including Mel Brooks, Alan King and Neil Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote material for the Academy Award and Emmy ceremonies  
and humor for Robert F. Kennedy and other politicians.

<HEADLINE> Packers Sign Veteran Punter Aguiar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers shored up their  
kicking game Tuesday by signing veteran free agent punter Louie 
Aguiar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers have been without a dependable punter since veteran  
Sean Landeta signed with the Philadelphia Eagles early in the 
offseason. Green Bay drafted Josh Bidwell in the fourth round, but 
lost the rookie for the season when doctors discovered he had 
testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for the 33-year-old Aguiar, rookie punter Chris  
Hanson was waived. Hanson, who was acquired the same day Bidwell's 
cancer was diagnosed, punted poorly in the Packers' 28-24 victory 
over Oakland on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar was waived by Kansas City on Sept. 5 after five seasons  
with the Chiefs. He kicked inconsistently last year and lost his 
job in training camp to rookie Daniel Pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar also was diagnosed with testicular cancer in March 1998.  
He underwent surgery and 15 radiation treatments later that year 
before returning to average 43 yards per punt last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar kicked for Packers special teams coach Steve Ortmayer at  
Lambeau Field on Tuesday and was signed in the afternoon. After 
playing at Utah State, he spent the first three seasons of his 
career with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	He also may be used as the holder for kicker Ryan Longwell.  
Quarterback Doug Pederson, last year's holder, also signed with 
Philadelphia, and Bidwell had been the team's primary holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar has had only one punt blocked in 631 career attempts. His  
streak of 587 consecutive punts without a block was snapped last 
season, but it still stands as the second longest in NFL history 
behind Dave Jennings (623). 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar will practice with the Packers on Wednesday. Green Bay  
plays at Detroit on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> States Rewarded As Unwed Births Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In most of the country, the proportion of  
babies born to unwed parents continues to rise, but 12 states have 
cut these rates. And the federal government has rewarded the top 
four and the District of Columbia with $20 million each in extra 
welfare money. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1996, when Congress offered $100 million to the states  
that did the best job reducing births to unwed parents, states have 
been devising programs to so, mostly aimed at teens. 
</P>
<P>
	The first set of winners are California, Michigan, Alabama,  
Massachusetts and the district, which recorded the largest drops in 
out-of-wedlock births without increasing the number of abortions, 
the Department of Health and Human Services said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, about one in three babies is born to unwed parents,  
a rate that didn't change between 1994-95 and 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition, little noticed as Congress was enacting its  
far-reaching welfare law, includes all births outside marriage -- 
intended and unintended, to teens and adults, to families on and 
off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	California led the nation, with its rate falling 5.7 percent. It  
was followed by the District of Columbia, which dropped 3.7 
percent; Michigan, 3.4 percent; Alabama, 2 percent; and 
Massachusetts, 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners are a diverse group, geographically, culturally and  
otherwise, and no one is sure how to explain their success. 
Moreover, while all their rates declined, the district has the 
nation's highest out-of-wedlock birth rate; Massachusetts has one 
of the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first year, the contest was based on data from 1996-97 --  
too early for programs passed in the wake of welfare reform to have 
had an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``More evidence is needed to fully understand the range of  
factors contributing to the decrease ... in these particular 
states,'' the department said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time windfall, which will be awarded to the top five  
states each year, must be spent on aid to the poor; it cannot be 
used for schools, roads or tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama officials have been talking about the bonus as they  
consider how to use $30 million in unspent regular welfare money, 
said Joel Sanders, who runs the state's welfare reform program. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting the extra money, he said, makes it easier for officials  
to consider raising spending, knowing that they have a deeper 
cushion. They are considering, for instance, raising their monthly 
welfare benefit; Alabama now pays just $164 for a family of three, 
the lowest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sanders said the state is also considering expanding  
Alabama's teen pregnancy prevention program, which now gets less 
than $1 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got the bonus because of that rate coming down, and we  
would like to see it keep coming down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Massachusetts and Michigan officials said they had no idea  
how they would use the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, out-of-wedlock birth rates range from 16 percent in  
Utah to 45 percent in Mississippi. Cities generally have higher 
rates, and in Washington, D.C., it is 65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Teens account for only one in three unwed births, though most  
state programs focus on them since teen moms are at high risk of 
joining the welfare rolls and dropping out of school. Advocates 
hope the winners use their bonus money to boost these programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will quickly be sending them all a big packet saying,  
`Please use this money to reinvest in teen pregnancy prevention,''' 
said Tamara Kreinin of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen 
Pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners have a variety of explanations for their success,  
including strong welfare reform programs, increased access to birth 
control and declining acceptance of out-of-wedlock pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the programs instituted after the 1996 law did not  
have enough time to affect the first year's bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The district may have benefited from demographics. The rate of  
unwed births among black women has been dropping across the 
country, and the district's population is overwhelmingly black. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the unwed birth rate peaked in 1994 at 32.6 percent  
and has been relatively stable since then, after climbing 
dramatically through the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1985, it 
was just 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	To reduce the out-of-wedlock rate, the number of illegitimate  
births must fall more quickly than births to married women. That is 
tricky, given that all births -- including marital births -- are 
dropping across the country.

<HEADLINE> Gore Embraces Hispanic Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore bounded on stage  
Tuesday to the hot-salsa sounds of Ricky Martin while aides passed 
around a 15-page list of 521 Latino activists endorsing Gore's 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lo acepto,'' Gore grinned. I accept.  
</P>
<P>
	The pep rally was staged as a formal launch to Gore's effort to  
build a groundswell of support in the exploding Hispanic community. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president made the most of his Spanish as he embraced  
supporters beneath the banner, ``Ganamos con Gore'' -- We win with 
Gore -- at the same Capitol Hill hotel where the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus Institute was holding its annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential candidate talked of a ``kinship''  
with Latinos. ``We have had successes together, we have had the 
same enemies,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the community's disproportionately high school dropout  
rates and problems getting health care, Gore repeated the refrain, 
``I'm not satisfied. Nuestras familias merecen lo mejor. (Our 
families deserve better.)'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign aides boasted ``over 700'' Latino elected officials and  
other prominent community leaders on Gore's endorsement list but a 
precise counting tallied 521. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night, Gore joined former ``NYPD Blue'' actor Jimmy Smits  
and the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts to deplore the 
lack of diversity in mainstream movie and TV roles. On Wednesday, 
he addresses the caucus' gala dinner and on Thursday, he speaks to 
the Latino Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic officials confirmed that, with Gore's input, Hispanic  
activist Lydia Camarillo, executive director of the Southwest Voter 
Registration Education Project, was a top contender to oversee next 
summer's Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles and could be 
announced as such this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has also  
fiercely courted Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
	New census data released Tuesday showed the Hispanic population  
grew by more than 35 percent to about 30.3 million between 1990 and 
1998, increasing their share of the total population from 9 percent 
to 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With a riff on pop star Martin's hit single, Gore supporters on  
Tuesday ridiculed any inroads Bush has made with the Hispanic 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's all this talk about George W. Bush and the Latino  
community? I mean they talk about this guy like he's Ricky Martin 
or something,'' said California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody thinks that George W. Bush is good for Latinos,  
they ARE living 'La Vida Loca' (The Crazy Life).'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Bustamante's endorsement of Gore sounded a bit  
backhanded: ``Many months ago I decided -- maybe it wasn't the smart 
political thing to do but I think it was the right thing to do -- to 
support Al Gore for president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president slammed Bush's education proposals, which he  
said could shift public funds from public schools to private 
schools with selective admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strangest education platform I've ever seen because they're  
claiming they can add by subtracting and dividing,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his campaign for the GOP nomination, Bush has proposed  
stripping federal funds from the worst-performing schools and 
making the money available to parents for private schools or other 
education alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's lone rival for the  
Democratic presidential nomination, is also competing for minority 
voters in next year's primaries. And on Monday, the Bradley camp 
announced endorsements from a host of Brooklyn political leaders, 
including several influential members of the New York borough's 
black community. 
</P>
<P>
	At Gore's rally, New Jersey Rep. Robert Menendez introduced Gore  
by taking a poke at Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I judge people in the political context. I come from New  
Jersey. There's another candidate from that state you might be 
aware of,'' Menendez said to hisses from some in the small hotel 
ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez hastened to add that Bradley is ``a great guy, but the  
vice president is willing to put his prestige and his political 
capital on the line.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Sanders Mulling NFL Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- If Barry Sanders decides to return to the NFL, it  
won't be with the Detroit Lions, according to his agent. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ware said Tuesday night that Sanders hasn't indicated  
whether he would return, but said there is ``no way'' he would play 
for the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be hopeful, obviously, that in the right situation that he  
would consider it,'' Ware said. ``I've just tried to put together 
something he might consider. He doesn't like to deal in 
hypotheticals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, the No. 2 rusher on the NFL's career list who retired  
in July, has offered to repay $5.4 million of his signing bonus if 
the Lions release or trade him this season, Ware said. He said he 
made the offer to Detroit on Monday but that the team rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were little nonplused ... because they know that he won't  
play for them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Sanders ``definitely would return,'' if the  
Lions would accommodate him, a source close to the running back 
told ESPN for a story appearing Tuesday on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	But his father, William Sanders, said his son hasn't indicated  
whether he'll come back to football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping he'd never quit,'' he said. ``I don't know what  
he's going to do. ... I keep my fingers crossed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions would not confirm whether Ware had contacted them on  
this matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position remains the same -- that we honored his retirement  
wishes and we expected the repayment of the prorated portion,'' 
Lions spokesman Bill Keenist said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit filed a grievance last week to recover $5.4 million of  
the $11 million signing bonus Sanders got when he signed a 
five-year contract in 1997. Sanders, who needs only 1,458 yards to 
break Walter Payton's career rushing record, disagrees with 
Detroit's claim that he is required to repay a portion of the bonus 
if he doesn't play. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders did not collect a $1.7 million deferred payment due this  
fall on the original bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware said the issue could go either way with an arbitrator. He  
said he has spoken to Lions officials frequently since Sanders 
announced his retirement, asking he be released or traded if he 
repays the portion of the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've told us that if he plays again, he'll play for them or  
he won't play,'' Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said he doesn't blame the Lions for taking the  
stand they have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't release him either if I had a Barry Sanders on a  
contract,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Orange Juice Futures Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With all eyes on Hurricane Floyd stalking the southeastern U.S.  
coastline, orange juice futures were buffeted around in a volatile 
day of trading Tuesday before slipping lower on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, crude oil futures fell after six straight  
gains and cocoa rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors appeared as edgy as Florida residents, sending orange  
juice futures rocketing to almost $1 a pound early in the trading 
session on fears the storm will severely damage groves in the 
Sunshine State. 
</P>
<P>
	Packing a top sustained wind of 140 mph, Floyd potentially poses  
the greatest threat to Florida and its orange groves since much 
smaller Hurricane Andrew slammed into South Florida in 1992, 
causing $25 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	With the latest forecasts calling for the hurricane to strike  
land in Georgia or the Carolinas, sparing the bulk of Florida's 
citrus crop, the market pulled back later Tuesday. Orange juice 
futures finished down 45 cents for the day at 96.55 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	But concerns lingered that high winds would have an impact on  
orange juice groves, likely knocking fruit off trees in eastern 
portions of the key producing region Tuesday night and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know with hurricanes,'' said Elizabeth Steger,  
president of Citrus Consulting International in Orlando. ``We've 
had hurricanes without damage and hurricanes with damage. We'll 
just have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted, however, that with the start of the harvest still  
some three months away, the small size of the oranges now on trees 
makes it less vulnerable to damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, crude oil futures dropped in cautious trading  
ahead of a report on U.S. crude inventories by the American 
Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were anticipating another slight decline in  
inventories, which have fallen 9 percent since the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries committed to increased production 
cuts last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	API reported after the close of the market that U.S. crude oil  
stocks fell 1.297 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 10, on 
the low side of analysts' expectations. U.S. gasoline stocks fell a 
less-than-expected 578,000 barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	October crude fell 35 cents to $23.86 a gallon; October heating  
oil fell 1.14 cents to 61.06 cents a gallon; October unleaded 
regular gasoline fell 1.26 cents to 68.42 cents a gallon; October 
natural gas fell 14.5 cents to $2.636 cents per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude oil for delivery in October  
rose 23 cents to $23.71 a barrel on the International Petroleum 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures pushed up nearly 4 percent on concerns over crops,  
the military conflict in Indonesia and the uncertainties of 
liberalization in the Ivory Coast and Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	The cocoa harvest is beginning in West Africa, and while the  
weather has been favorable the political climate is cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict in Indonesia, the world's No. 3 cocoa producer, has  
stirred worries over its impact on movement of the product in that 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's currency continues to be vulnerable to the unrest. A  
United Nations peacekeeping force is headed to troubled East Timor 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers and exporters in Ivory Coast are struggling to adapt to  
changes associated with political liberalization, and the overall 
effect is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	December cocoa rose $33 to $974 per ton on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP;  
Cocoa Exchange division of the New York Board of Trade.

<HEADLINE> GOP Fails on HMO Patient Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders failed Tuesday to  
produce a strategy on patient protection legislation, leaving the 
GOP struggling on the politically popular issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Members had hoped to emerge from a closed meeting united behind  
legislation aimed at giving patients new rights in dealing with 
restrictive health maintenance organizations and other managed-care 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	As they came out, however, participants made clear that deep  
disagreements over whether injured patients should get new rights 
to file lawsuits prevented any agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republican House leaders prefer only limited new HMO  
regulations, with no new right to sue. They fear a proliferation of 
lawsuits that would drive up the cost of insurance and prompt 
employers to drop coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to keep his fractured party together, House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert promised last month to bring a bill to the floor 
written by Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John Shadegg, R-Ariz., 
that would include a right-to-sue provision. When they introduced 
it last week, it did. 
</P>
<P>
	Since promising a vote, the speaker has been distancing himself  
from their effort, refusing to endorse the bill or even say what he 
thinks of it. Coburn and Shadegg said last week they expected an 
endorsement after they had met with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting, Tuesday in Hastert's Capitol office, adjourned  
without any such endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., kept his public silence. Asked if he would talk  
to reporters about the issue, he said from a distance, ``Not right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders are in a tough spot. Twenty Republicans have  
joined with Democrats in the House to back a sweeping bill, giving 
it more than enough support to pass on the floor if Democrats stick 
together, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear what alternatives Republicans have to the  
Coburn-Shadegg legislation. While GOP leaders like it better than 
the Democratic bill, they don't like it much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I described it as the least worst way to do the wrong thing,''  
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas., said after Tuesday's meeting. 
Coburn recalled that Armey also described the legislation as ``like 
driving over a skunk and putting it in your trunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Coburn and Shadegg said they will not back down on the right  
to sue, known as the liability provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can stick their head in the sand, but the fact is,  
whatever passes the House is going to have some type of 
liability,'' Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their bill would allow lawsuits, but only in federal court and  
only after a patient goes through the health plan's review process. 
Patients also would have to take their cases to more doctors for 
assessment of injuries and a determination whether a decision by 
the plan had caused the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would cap damages patients could collect and  
contains a variety of provisions that virtually every other HMO 
bill has: allowing easier access to emergency rooms and specialists 
and giving patients access to more information about how plans 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn and Shadegg said they will continue to build support  
among colleagues for their legislation. Meanwhile, Republican Whip 
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, planned to determine how much support exists 
among Republicans for new rights to sue.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Games Confident for Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The Sydney Olympics will meet its reduced goal for  
raising money through sponsorship, the head of the organizing 
committee said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though an outside marketing company was hired to help attract  
new sponsors, the organizers still are on course to meet their 
target, according to SOCOG president Michael Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said his committee had raised $515 million through  
sponsorships, and was ``still chasing'' another $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we will reach our targets with the sales of  
assets such as corporate boxes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight made his comments on the eve of the official  
``one-year-to-go'' date for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG cut its sponsorship target by $32 million after the Salt  
Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it recently reorganized its revenue-raising operations to  
help meet the new target, Knight said he was confident there won't 
be a shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have turned the corner,'' after the Salt Lake City scandal,  
Knight said. ``The fact that ticket sales have been such a success 
has excited sponsors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation, though, remains a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Sydney's rail network will work around the clock to handle the  
estimated 500,000 spectators and workers who will travel to the 
main Olympic site on the busiest days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Transport is probably the biggest concern, and after Atlanta,  
technology must always be a concern too,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting when Sydney won the 2000 Olympics six years ago  
organizers knew that smooth running at the games hinged on an 
effective transportation network. 
</P>
<P>
	It concern was magnified by problems at Atlanta in 1996 where a  
complicated hub transport system meant athletes and officials 
feared they would miss events and bus drivers often became lost 
because they were unfamiliar with the city's roads. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to head off similar problems, the Olympic Roads and  
Transport Authority (ORTA) was established in March 1997 to 
coordinate all elements of moving people around during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes and officials will mostly use ferries on the Parramatta  
River, in addition to dedicated Olympic traffic lanes in the city 
and Victoria Road, one of the main routes to travel the 12 miles 
from the central business district in Sydney to Homebush Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Olympic Park railway station, designed to cope with  
50,000 passengers an hour, was opened last year and has 
successfully coped with several tests of its capabilities.

<HEADLINE> 'A Fish Called Wanda' Director Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Charles Crichton, a director of comedy films in  
the 1940s and 1950s who made a resurgence with ``A Fish Called 
Wanda,'' died Tuesday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Crichton died at his home in the London neighborhood of South  
Kensington after a short illness, said his son, David Crichton. 
</P>
<P>
	Crichton directed 1946's ``Hue and Cry,'' the first so-called  
Ealing comedy, named after the west London film studio. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his best-loved Ealing productions was 1951's ``The  
Lavender Hill Mob,'' a classic about a timid bank clerk played by 
Alec Guinness who schemes to get even with his employer by 
masterminding a foolproof robbery. It featured a young Audrey 
Hepburn in one of its opening scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Crichton directed a steady stream of films throughout the '50s,  
but his career hit a setback in 1962 when an argument with 
producer-star Burt Lancaster during the making of ``Birdman of 
Alcatraz'' caused him to quit in mid-production. 
</P>
<P>
	``He Who Rides a Tiger,'' directed in 1965, wound up being his  
last feature film for 23 years, until John Cleese enticed him out 
of television work to direct ``A Fish Called Wanda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, at the age of 78, Crichton was nominated for an Academy  
Award as best director for ``Wanda,'' a comedy starring Cleese, 
Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis that rollicked along in the best 
Ealing tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Cleese and fellow Monty Python star Michael Palin  
found Crichton's ``grumpy schoolmaster'' attitude toward comedy a 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
	But he told them: ``People think that if you're directing  
comedy, you've got to be funny. On the contrary, you've got to be 
serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleese told The Independent newspaper, ``On the last day of  
shooting, I felt he was as sad as I was, so I went up to him and 
put my arms round him. But Englishmen of his generation do not 
embrace, and he wriggled out and retired to a corner of the studio. 
There, thinking he was unobserved, he wept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the movie's producers, Steve Abbott, told of getting a  
call from a Hollywood studio after ``Wanda'' became a smash. 
``We've got a comedy we need a director for,'' the call was said to 
have gone. ``Do you think your new young guy -- Crichton or whatever 
his name is -- would be interested?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crichton is survived by his second wife, Nadine, and his sons  
David and Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

<HEADLINE> NASA Unable To Handle Big Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA tried to protect its four space  
shuttles the best it could and then evacuated all but a handful of 
workers from the Kennedy Space Center, unable to handle storms the 
size and fury of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the shuttles are in hangars. But the buildings were  
designed to withstand wind of no more than 105 mph to 125 mph. 
Floyd was packing top sustained wind of 145 mph wind as of this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to live and hope -- that's what it's going to  
take,'' NASA spokesman George Diller said Monday as Kennedy Space 
Center's approximately 12,500 workers began evacuating. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA closed down the Space Center at midnight Monday, leaving  
behind a skeleton crew of 120 people that managers planned to 
reduced to 80 by later today. All who stayed would be volunteers, 
Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody else is gone. It's kind of eerie out here,'' Diller  
said this morning. He spoke by telephone from a fortified building. 
</P>
<P>
	At late morning, metereologists estimated the storm could pass  
within 35 to 50 miles offshore of Cape Canaveral, bringing wind of 
about 130 mph, Diller said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of can feel the concern growing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to fear of wind was the possibility of a storm  
surge. The center is only 9 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a direct hit on us, or even a skirting hit, we could  
lose a great deal,'' Bruce Buckingham, another NASA spokesman, said 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The center has never been completely evacuated. A skeleton crew  
remained behind when the place was evacuated for Hurricane Erin in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to be moved in a hurry like NASA's $2 billion shuttles,  
four multimillion-dollar rockets remained on launch pads at the 
adjacent Cape Canaveral Air Station. The rockets were being secured 
to their pads, with protective towers placed around them. In 
addition, loose objects such as electric generators were removed to 
keep them from becoming projectiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force launch towers are built to withstand wind up to  
120 mph. NASA's two shuttle launch pads can take wind up to 125 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kennedy, technicians closed the cargo-bay doors of each  
shuttle and bagged the main engines on the tail to protect against 
water damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The landing gear was also raised on the three shuttles in the  
Orbital Processing Facility, designed to withstand wind of up to 
105 mph. On Atlantis, parked in the Vehicle Assembly Building, the 
landing gear was covered with plastic bags. Its gear could not be 
raised because Atlantis was resting on its wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	The 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, where shuttles are  
attached to their booster rockets and external fuel tanks, can 
withstand wind of up to 125 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA expected the preparations -- not to mention any damage or  
destruction -- to delay upcoming shuttle flights, already postponed 
by wiring defects. Discovery is supposed to fly at the end of 
October on a repair trip to the Hubble Space Telescope, and 
Endeavour is set for lifotoff in November on an Earth-mapping 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time that Kennedy Space Center had to go through such  
drastic precautions was for Erin in 1995. In 1996, Hurricanes 
Bertha and Fran forced NASA to move Atlantis from the launch pad 
into the hangar, but no evacuation was ordered.

<HEADLINE> Drew Carey in Hometown Cleveland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Comedian Drew Carey punches his hand into the  
air near the goal line of Cleveland Browns Stadium as thousands of 
fans chant his name. 
</P>
<P>
	A dream episode on Carey's top-rated ABC sitcom, ``The Drew  
Carey Show''? 
</P>
<P>
	No, it's Carey taking a break from filming to acknowledge the  
thousands of Clevelanders who came decked out in orange and brown 
to play Browns fans for the show's Sept. 29 episode on the team's 
return to the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	The big guy with the crew cut and glasses is getting a welcome  
from his hometown not unlike the one the city gave its beloved 
Browns after a three-season absence from the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey is overwhelmed by the response. ``Thank you. God bless  
you,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	But a moment later, Carey is poking fun at the crowd, drawing a  
large laugh that echoes through the 72,000-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, good luck looking for your face on TV,'' he tells those  
who waited in line for hours to be part of the crowd on the show. 
More than 10,000 fans streamed through the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The out-of-pocket expenses are substantial but worth it,''  
said Lou Fusaro, one of the show's producers. ``This is a great 
town to work in when Drew Carey is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carey was clearly having fun during the recent four-day shoot in  
Cleveland. He went bowling -- a favorite pastime -- and watched the 
Browns win at home for the first time since the old team moved to 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome, man, awesome,'' Carey said of the Browns' 35-24  
preseason win over Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Carey's show takes place in Cleveland, the cast has  
only been on location once before in the city on Lake Erie. The 
musical opening of the show was shot three years ago at several 
well-known spots, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and 
Jacobs Field, home of the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The show decided to move off the sound stage and into the real  
world when the writers suggested an episode on the return of the 
Browns. Most of the 22-minute episode, the second in the show's 
fifth season, is shot at the Browns stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The show has Carey's character, his gal pal Kate (Christa  
Miller) and sidekicks Lewis (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald (Diedrich 
Bader) trying to get tickets. When that fails, they sneak into the 
stadium. (Not very likely, but hey, it's TV.) 
</P>
<P>
	Once inside, Drew sees his plumber girlfriend Sharon (Jenica  
Bergere) making out with another man on the stadium's gigantic TV 
screen. He flips out and takes off across the football field during 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	And to make matters worse, Drew finds out that his  
cross-dressing brother Steve (John Carroll Lynch) wants to marry 
his hated co-worker, Mimi (Kathy Kinney). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like doing 'Drew Carey: The Movie,''' Miller joked while  
cooling off in a stadium bar between scenes. ``It's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody wants a piece of Carey: an autograph, a handshake, a  
picture. Tim Conley, 44, who went to high school with Carey and 
described him as a ``geek,'' brought his yearbook to be signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel guilty that I'm not going to be able to talk to these  
people,'' Carey said while looking at the long line of extras 
playing Browns fans who camp out for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really only takes 30 seconds. There's what, 1,000 extras  
today? That's 500 minutes and that's like 16 hours. It would take 
me 16 hours, which I can't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carey said he realizes how popular he has become every time he  
returns home to his Old Brooklyn neighborhood where he owns his 
childhood house. 
</P>
<P>
	``The theory was to come back and relax here, but I really can't  
relax when I come back to Cleveland anymore,'' Carey said while 
puffing on a cigarette and drinking a soda. ``I'm not a regular guy 
anymore. I miss that. I really do. Those days are over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carey's success also is causing him to start feeling a bit out  
of touch with his blue-collar friends and family in Cleveland. 
Forbes magazine ranked him as the 24th highest-paid entertainer 
last year with an income of $45.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the kind of person that when things start getting popular,  
I start to hate them,'' Carey said. ``I'm already oversaturated 
enough that people like me hate me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the show, Carey portrays a hardworking manager in a Cleveland  
department store who never seems to get a break. During shooting, 
Carey cracks as many jokes as Mimi has layers of mascara. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the featured extras are from Cleveland. In one scene,  
Carey gives high-fives to the mother and sister of the show's 
writer Terry Mulroy, also a Cleveland native. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pulled some strings,'' Mulroy says with a sheepish grin.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	GET `REAL': One of the brightest (and oddest) of the new  
season's crop, ``Get Real,'' airs its second installment Wednesday 
at 9 p.m. EDT on Fox. The Green household consists of three high 
school-age kids, plus Mitch the dad (Jon Tenney), Mary the mom 
(Debrah Farentino) and Mary's recently widowed mother. And not only 
are they at each other's throats, they also take frequent pauses to 
talk to the camera about it. Wacky and self-aware, interlaced with 
soliloquies and fantasy interludes, ``Get Real'' also retains a 
hold on reality. Even adult reality: career demands, marital 
strains, children growing up, remodeling the kitchen without going 
bankrupt. This week: Mary and Mitch go to a therapist and elder son 
Cameron is expelled from school.

<HEADLINE> GOP Fails on HMO Patient Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders failed Tuesday to  
produce a strategy on patient protection legislation, leaving the 
GOP struggling on the politically popular issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Members had hoped to emerge from a closed meeting united behind  
legislation aimed at giving patients new rights in dealing with 
restrictive health maintenance organizations and other managed-care 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	As they came out, however, participants made clear that deep  
disagreements over whether injured patients should get new rights 
to file lawsuits prevented any agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republican House leaders prefer only limited new HMO  
regulations, with no new right to sue. They fear a proliferation of 
lawsuits that would drive up the cost of insurance and prompt 
employers to drop coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to keep his fractured party together, House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert promised last month to bring a bill to the floor 
written by Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John Shadegg, R-Ariz., 
that would include a right-to-sue provision. When they introduced 
it last week, it did. 
</P>
<P>
	Since promising a vote, the speaker has been distancing himself  
from their effort, refusing to endorse the bill or even say what he 
thinks of it. Coburn and Shadegg said last week they expected an 
endorsement after they had met with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting, Tuesday in Hastert's Capitol office, adjourned  
without any such endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., kept his public silence. Asked if he would talk  
to reporters about the issue, he said from a distance, ``Not right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders are in a tough spot. Twenty Republicans have  
joined with Democrats in the House to back a sweeping bill, giving 
it more than enough support to pass on the floor if Democrats stick 
together, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear what alternatives Republicans have to the  
Coburn-Shadegg legislation. While GOP leaders like it better than 
the Democratic bill, they don't like it much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I described it as the least worst way to do the wrong thing,''  
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas., said after Tuesday's meeting. 
Coburn recalled that Armey also described the legislation as ``like 
driving over a skunk and putting it in your trunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Coburn and Shadegg said they will not back down on the right  
to sue, known as the liability provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can stick their head in the sand, but the fact is,  
whatever passes the House is going to have some type of 
liability,'' Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their bill would allow lawsuits, but only in federal court and  
only after a patient goes through the health plan's review process. 
Patients also would have to take their cases to more doctors for 
assessment of injuries and a determination whether a decision by 
the plan had caused the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would cap damages patients could collect and  
contains a variety of provisions that virtually every other HMO 
bill has: allowing easier access to emergency rooms and specialists 
and giving patients access to more information about how plans 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn and Shadegg said they will continue to build support  
among colleagues for their legislation. Meanwhile, Republican Whip 
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, planned to determine how much support exists 
among Republicans for new rights to sue.

<HEADLINE> 'Honeymooners' Co-Creator Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Harry Crane, co-creator of Jackie  
Gleason's classic 1950s sitcom ``The Honeymooners'' and comedy 
writer for Red Skelton, the Marx Brothers, Bing Crosby and others, 
died Tuesday of cancer. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Crane died at his Beverly Hills home, according to publicist  
Warren Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
	The writer, who worked on movies as well as television, had  
another link to Hollywood: He was the grandfather of actresses 
Melissa Gilbert (``Little House on the Prairie'') and Sara Gilbert 
(``Roseanne''). 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City native was 19 when he started performing  
stand-up comedy. He was recruited by MGM as a screenwriter, earning 
his first credit on ``Air Raid Wardens'' (1943), starring Stan 
Laurel and Oliver Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Harvey Girls'' (1946) and ``Song of the Thin Man'' (1947)  
were among other films Crane worked on before moving to the new 
medium of television. He and Joe Bigelow were staff writers for 
``Cavalcade of Stars'' when Gleason, the variety show's new host, 
asked for help in developing a sketch. 
</P>
<P>
	Gleason told the writers he wanted to play an ``everyday working  
stiff'' who lived with his long-suffering wife in a little Brooklyn 
flat, according to the book ``Classic Sitcoms,'' by Vince Waldron, 
Silman-James Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The two created a scene involving squabbling Ralph and Alice  
Kramden, and the couple became a variety show mainstay for Gleason 
and then in 1955 the basis for the 39-episode sitcom ``The 
Honeymooners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his half-century career, Crane also put laughs into TV  
series, specials and nightclub acts for such singers as Crosby and 
Frank Sinatra and worked with other writers and performers, 
including Mel Brooks, Alan King and Neil Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote material for the Academy Award and Emmy ceremonies  
and humor for Robert F. Kennedy and other politicians.

	Drudge could not be reached immediately for comment. The site  
was repaired less than one hour after it was altered. 
</P>
<P>
	Although such electronic attacks aren't unusual, it was  
remarkable for a little-known hacker group to have claimed 
responsibility for raids on three remarkably high-profile Web sites 
over a period of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``ULG'' group also had claimed responsibility for the  
defacement of the Internet site for ABC just weeks ago and for an 
attack at C-SPAN one week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It's believed to be relatively newly formed, and its only  
previously known attacks have been the ones against C-SPAN and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	The defacement of the Drudge site was first reported on a  
computer security Web site, Attrition.Org, which monitors hacking 
activity on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The vandalism of Drudge's Web site comes during a period of  
stepped-up prosecution of hackers by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department weeks ago arrested Chad Davis, 19, of  
Green Bay, Wis., on charges that he vandalized the Army's Internet 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	And a colleague of Davis, Eric Burns, pleaded guilty recently in  
federal court in Virginia to charges that he vandalized a spate of 
Web pages and told others earlier this summer how to attack the 
Internet site run by the White House. Burns' sentencing was set for 
Nov. 19.

<HEADLINE> 'Today' Hires Duchess of York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Facing energized new competition this fall from  
ABC and CBS, NBC's ``Today'' has hired a royal new reporter: the 
Duchess of York. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Sarah Ferguson was hired Tuesday as a London-based  
correspondent for NBC's morning show. She'll contribute human 
interest stories, features and interviews about once a month, the 
network said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a very personable, warm, engaging personality and I  
know that this is something that she is interested in,'' said Jeff 
Zucker, ``Today'' executive producer. ``It struck me that she could 
bring a little panache to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The duchess, ex-wife of Prince Andrew, has some experience: She  
was host of a British talk show that ran for 10 episodes. It was 
called ``Sarah ... Surviving Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its first episode, Fergie, as she is popularly known in  
Britain, sat on a couch and discussed life's crises with guests who 
included a woman raped by a serial killer and a hit-and-run driver 
who confessed 20 years after the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first time I really felt comfortable with my job,''  
she said in a telephone interview. ``I want to learn and I want to 
grow, and I think television is a great place for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She may need a few more meetings with Zucker about story ideas.  
The duchess said she was interested in reporting about how children 
have coped with the war in Kosovo, something Zucker said he would 
like to see. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fergie, who's been a commercial spokeswoman for Weight  
Watchers in the United States, also said she'd like to report on 
health and weight issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Zucker said he would avoid that topic because of the duchess'  
commercial connection. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time ``Today'' has hired a British notable:  
Princess Diana's brother, Charles, was a reporter for the show for 
a time a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' is morning TV's dominant program.  
</P>
<P>
	But ABC has revamped ``Good Morning America'' and this week  
began airing it from a glitzy new storefront studio in Manhattan. 
CBS is bringing Bryant Gumbel to its ``This Morning'' show, which 
also is getting a new studio.

<HEADLINE> `MNF' Ratings Jump for 9 p.m. Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The ``Monday Night Football'' experiment is over  
and so are the plummeting television ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC posted a 16.1 national rating and a 27 share Monday night in  
the first regular season game since the network returned ``MNF'' to 
a 9 p.m. ET start. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season was the first time in its 29-year history that the  
program began at 8 p.m. and ``MNF'' finished with a 13.9 rating, 
lowest in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's 38-21 victory over Denver Monday night increased 9  
percent from last season's opener between New England and Denver. 
It was also up 7 percent from the first game in 1997, a 15.0 
between Chicago and Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very encouraged that our move back to 9 p.m. is going to  
work in our favor,'' ABC spokesman Mark Mandel said. ``We are 
pleased by the results, especially given the fact it was a lopsided 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC made the time change prior to last season hoping that  
ratings would increase with an earlier kickoff on the East Coast. 
However, the amount of viewers on the West Coast dropped 
dramatically and the network decided to revert back to the 
traditional time slot. 
</P>
<P>
	All eight of the metered markets on the West Coast increased on  
Monday from last season. Seattle, Sacramento, Portland and San 
Francisco all registered more than 20 percent jumps while Los 
Angeles was up 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's game peaked between 10-10:30 p.m. with a 17.6/27, when  
the Broncos retired John Elway's number. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of television households tuned to a  
broadcast, and each point represents 994,000 homes. The share is 
the percentage watching a program among those televisions in use at 
the time.

<HEADLINE> Jets Off To Painful Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Vinny Testaverde knew it right away. As  
he pounded the Giants Stadium turf in frustration, Testaverde 
understood that his 1999 season was over. Quite likely, so were the 
New York Jets' Super Bowl aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the running play and Curtis Martin got the handoff  
clean, and when he was hit, he fumbled,'' Testaverde said Monday as 
he sat on a podium with his left leg bandaged almost up to the knee 
following surgery. ``I saw the ball on the ground, pushed off to go 
get it and thought I heard somebody falling behind me. I thought 
somebody fell and hit my ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``My last thought was my Achilles' popped and I am out for the  
season. We put so much into preparing for this season and finally 
have everything in position to go and things are looking good. It 
is a big disappointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of many disappointments the Jets have sustained just one  
week into what they believed would be a championship season. While 
they are not abandoning hope, they fully realize how much injuries 
can change things. 
</P>
<P>
	Already they have surpassed last year's total of 29 man-games  
lost to injury in a 12-4 season that ended in an AFC title game 
loss at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Star receiver Wayne Chrebet is out for another five weeks with a  
broken foot. Starting cornerback Otis Smith (collarbone), hurt in 
training camp, isn't expected back for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, in addition to Testaverde, the Jets lost running  
back-kick returner Leon Johnson for the year with torn knee 
ligaments. Jason Ferguson has a knee and ankle injury that coach 
Bill Parcells expects to sideline the starting nose tackle for this 
week's game at Buffalo. Tight end Eric Green pinched a nerve in his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde, whose rehabilitation should take six months, isn't  
losing faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question they can win; no one player has that much  
of an impact on a team,'' he said. ``If there was any one player 
who had that much impact, you would see guys like Dan Marino and 
John Elway winning Super Bowl after Super Bowl. It just doesn't 
happen that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has expectations because of the team effort we put  
forth. People who are talking about the Jets to be a Super Bowl 
contender, right now it is without me and Leon and Wayne. They are 
going to have to get it done, and I know they will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, who added several veterans this year with the idea of  
taking the extra step the Jets couldn't manage in 1998, echoed his 
quarterback's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are certainly disappointed, but you just have to move  
forward and try to do what you can do,'' Parcells said. ``Right now 
this is a pretty difficult set of circumstances for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if anybody is in this boat yet, but in the last  
eight days we potentially lost four starters and, in Leon, a guy 
who is highly productive offensively. We have lost quite a bit of 
firepower there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most notably Testaverde, of course. After 11 seasons with  
generally mediocre teams in which he was asked to be the focal 
point, Testaverde prospered for the Jets when he no longer was 
forced to carry such a burden. If his 12th season was a coming-out 
party, his 13th could have been a coronation. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that happened (last year), there are people who  
thought it was a fluke,'' he said. ``I don't think last year was a 
fluke by any stretch. All the things I have been through in my life 
I have gotten through because I have perseverance. I need to stay 
mentally strong, to stay focused and get through this.''

<HEADLINE> Environmental Group Backs Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The political arm of the environmental group  
Friends of the Earth today endorsed Bill Bradley for president, 
saying his record was ``far superior'' than the one compiled by 
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a wide range of water, toxics and public lands issues,  
Bradley has been a forceful champion,'' said Brent Blackwelder, 
president of the environmental group's PAC. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has made the environment a central theme of his political  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of rhetoric of what Gore was going to do and  
he didn't follow through with that,'' said Friends of the Earth 
spokesman Mark Whiteis-Helm. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said Gore passed up the opportunity to take the lead  
on environmental issues and actually paved the way for ``draconian 
erosions of existing environmental protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whiteis-Helm lists protecting the ozone layer as one of Gore's  
failed opportunities. During Gore's tenure as vice president, the 
administration weakened the phase-out date for the chemical methyl 
bromide and opposed the stronger protection measures suggested by 
European nations, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends of the Earth gave the Clinton administration an average  
grade of ``D'' for its environmental record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disappointing to tell the American people who is the  
better candidate for the environment,'' since Gore has put 
environmental issues on the political agenda, said Whiteis-Helm. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing the two candidates while each served in the Senate --  
Bradley represented New Jersey and Gore was a Tennessee senator -- 
the vice president again falls short, the group said. It cited 
League of Conservation Voters rankings, which gave Bradley a 85.5 
score out of a 100 on the environment, while Gore only reached a 
66.5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bradley did more than simply vote pro-environment. He  
introduced legislation, did his homework, built constituencies, and 
got the legislation passed. He used his presence on the Senate 
floor effectively and he produced demonstrable results,'' the group 
said in a written statement.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Expresses Union Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley,  
campaigning in the heart of union country, said Tuesday that 
workers fired for union organizing should get triple their back 
wages and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're really interested in working families, you have to  
make it easier to organize,'' Bradley told about 50 union members. 
``Working families are better if we have labor unions that are 
vibrant and growing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said workers now get only back wages if they prove they  
were fired for union organizing. He proposed changing that so they 
could get triple their back wages as well as punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator said he doesn't expect to win many  
union endorsements, in part because he supports the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, as does his Democratic presidential rival, 
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he hopes unions will stay neutral in the Democratic  
race. 
</P>
<P>
	That appears unlikely, especially since AFL-CIO President John  
J. Sweeney accompanied Gore to Detroit and Iowa over the Labor Day 
weekend. The AFL-CIO is expected at its October meeting to throw 
the weight of its 13 million members behind the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was out courting labor support in Tennessee on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Printing company owner Roger Robinson of Grosse Pointe Park,  
Mich., said Bradley is making inroads with labor with his 
willingness to consider the unions' contention that free trade 
means lost jobs for U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The broad array of trade issues will determine how I behave in  
the contest for president,'' Robinson said. ``That's the bellwether 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several union members said they are willing to listen to Bradley  
because he has spoken out against allowing Mexican trucks that 
don't meet U.S. health and safety standards to cross the border. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the Teamsters standpoint, we've appreciated a few of the  
stances he's taken that Mr. Gore has not taken a position on yet,'' 
said Mark Gaffney, legislative and community affairs director for 
Michigan Teamsters Joint Council 43. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney, a candidate to replace outgoing Michigan AFL-CIO  
President Frank Garrison, said it's too early to say who will get 
his union's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	But he agreed with Robinson that trade issues will play a large  
part in the Democratic primary. ``We're hurt by trade that's more 
free than fair,'' Gaffney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Democrats will choose their presidential candidate in  
party caucuses on March 11, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Extend Rothschild Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays like the  
direction they're heading under Larry Rothschild and on Tuesday 
gave the manager a one-year contract extension through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild signed a three-year agreement on Nov. 7, 1997 and led  
the expansion club to 63 victories in its inaugural season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we hired Larry Rothschild ... we expected him to lead us  
through not only the developmental stages of our organization, but 
through the championship years as well,'' general manager Chuck 
LaMar said. ``In our first two years, he has demonstrated the 
skills that are necessary to take us to the championship level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 62 victories going into Tuesday night's game against the  
Seattle Mariners, the Devil Rays were one shy of equaling last 
year's total. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's record represented a six-game improvement over a year  
ago at the same time, the fourth-best improvement in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rothschild's first season, the Devil Rays finished second in  
the league in fielding percentage and fourth in ERA.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Juggles Sporting Calendar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins had to take a bus the final 2 1/2  
hours on their return trip from Denver. Savannah State football 
began its road trip three days early, only to run into problems. 
And The Citadel called off its football trip to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
	Without coming ashore yet, Hurricane Floyd already was wreaking  
havoc on sports schedules along the entire Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tricky,'' said University of Miami quarterback Kenny  
Kelly, who endured a 7:30 a.m. practice Tuesday, one day after 
being called in for an unscheduled workout. ``You never know what 
tomorrow's schedule is going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, Floyd was centered 170 miles southeast of Cape  
Canaveral, Fla., its winds stretching some 600 miles across. Its 
top sustained winds of 140 mph were down slightly, but still a 
Category 4 storm, the second-most powerful designation for a 
hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	No major events were scrubbed, though the massive storm claimed  
a Florida-Carolina NHL exhibition and the deciding Game 5 of 
baseball's Class-A Carolina League championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, it was travel and practice schedules that took the  
biggest hit as Floyd buzzed its way up the Atlantic coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins, flying home from Monday night's 38-21 win over the  
two-time Super Bowl champions, were forced to land at Fort Myers on 
Florida's west coast. They then boarded buses to travel the final 
120 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson canceled his weekly day-after-game press  
briefing, and team officials postponed ceremonies opening a new NFL 
youth center in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Dolphins nor the Jacksonville Jaguars were forced to  
cancel practice, since Tuesday is a day off for most NFL teams. But 
the Jaguars had to call off today's workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, our plan is to resume our normal work schedule  
on Thursday morning,'' coach Tom Coughlin said. ``Our first concern 
is clearly the safety and well-being of the families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was that kind of concern that led The Citadel to postpone its  
game Saturday at Western Carolina. Having lived through Hurricane 
Hugo 10 years ago, athletic director Walt Nadzak said the road trip 
should be the last thing on players' minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids have families, our coaches have wives and children,''  
Nadzak said. ``We want them to be with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, Savannah State's football team left Tuesday on its  
370-mile trip to face Tennessee-Chattanooga on Saturday. Though one 
of their buses broke down east of Atlanta, the Tigers still planned 
to conduct their final three practices in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	At Division I-AA power Georgia Southern, about 60 miles inland,  
players planned to gather in Kennedy Hall, a 2-year-old brick 
structure and one of the sturdiest buildings on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the thoughts was going to Atlanta, but trying to find  
rooms for 65 kids proved to be impossible,'' sports information 
director Tom McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In baseball, both the Carolina and Southern leagues saw their  
championship series affected by Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Double-A Southern League series between Orlando and West  
Tennessee was kept in Jackson, Tenn., for today's Game 3 before 
shifting to Orlando for the final two contests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Class-A Carolina League took even quicker action. Rather  
than play the deciding game of its title series, it declared 
Wilmington and Myrtle Beach co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports pales to other issues that are at hand, even a  
championship,'' Myrtle Beach general manager Steve Malliet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even NASCAR and the NBA couldn't avoid Floyd. NASCAR was forced  
to close its offices amid the evacuation of Daytona Beach, Fla., 
sending many staffers to Charlotte, N.C., for the week. In Orlando, 
the NBA postponed today's grand-opening celebration of its first 
theme restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	And in an odd twist, Floyd's approach prompted a mistrial in the  
lawsuit against Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn by a woman who 
said he sexually assaulted her at his home.

<HEADLINE> Players Charged in Parking Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cade McNown and two other recent UCLA  
football stars are now officially part of the school's handicapped 
parking scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, a Chicago Bears quarterback, Skip Hicks of the  
Washington Redskins and the Kansas City Chiefs' Larry Atkins stand 
accused of illegally using handicapped parking space placards while 
they were star athletes at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named Monday in new charges were former UCLA linebacker  
Brendon Ayanbadejo and current UCLA player Eric Whitfield. All five 
were expected to enter pleas today in Los Angeles Municipal Court 
on the misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Attorney's Office has brought charges against a total  
19 current or former Bruins alleged to be part of the disabled 
parking scam. 
</P>
<P>
	Both McNown and Hicks were unavailable for comment after they  
were charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hicks spoke of the situation at the start of training camp  
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was young. You do some things you regret when you're young.  
Yes, I had one. I never parked in a handicapped spot, but I guess 
that doesn't matter. I shouldn't have had one in the first place,'' 
he said. ``... It's one of those things where you've got to say I'm 
sorry, learn from your mistakes and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 28, nine defendants pleaded no contest to the  
misdemeanor charge of illegally possessing a disabled placard. 
Municipal Judge Sam Ohta ordered each to pay $1,485 in fines and 
perform 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the community service will be with the Special Olympics,  
which holds athletic games for the disabled. The other 100 hours 
were assigned to the city parks department or groups helping those 
with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and other disabilities. The 
athletes also must spend a day meeting with the disabled and their 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists for the disabled booed as the first nine defendants  
entered pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges also forced 11 UCLA players -- six of them starters --  
into a two-game suspension for the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, Hicks and Whitfield were said to have illegally obtained  
the handicapped parking placards in 1996; and Ayanbadejo and Atkins 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the Bruins will welcome back 10 of the 11 players  
suspended for the first two games for illegally obtaining 
handicapped parking permits. Six are listed as first-stringers on 
the latest depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a big chunk out of your team,'' coach Bob Toledo said.  
``We should be better. There's a reason why they were starters 
before and the other guys were backups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four returnees who will start on defense are linebackers  
Tony White, Robert Thomas and Ryan Nece, and strong safety Ryan 
Roques. Returning as first-stringers on offense are fullback Durell 
Price and guard Oscar Cabrera. 
</P>
<P>
	Also returning are linebacker Whitfield, Ali Abdul Azziz,  
offensive guard James Ghezzi and tailback Keith Brown.

	Floyd Hits Florida, Heads for N.C.  
</P>
<P>
	COCOA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- From Florida to the Carolinas, evacuees  
fleeing Hurricane Floyd streamed inland in bumper-to-bumper traffic 
today as one of the most fearsome storms of the century threatened 
to wreak havoc ``like a weed-eater going up the coast.'' Nearly 2 
million people were told to get out of the way as Floyd skirted the 
north-central Florida coast, menacing an area from Cape Canaveral 
to Jacksonville with its 140 mph winds. The monstrous, 600-mile 
storm -- wider than the whole state of Florida -- threatened to roll 
ashore early Thursday, probably in Georgia or South Carolina. By 5 
p.m., Floyd was centered 235 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, 
moving northwest at 12 mph.

	Plane Crash Kills Greek Minister

<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Greece's deputy foreign minister and  
five others were killed late Tuesday when their executive jet hit 
heavy turbulence and plummeted thousands of feet before leveling 
off, Romanian officials said. Deputy Foreign Minister Yiannos 
Kranidiotis, his son and four others were killed, said Romanian 
Transport Minister Traian Basescu. He said five others injured had 
been hospitalized. The pilot was unhurt and was able to land in 
Bucharest, Basescu said. Romanian television reports said 
Kranidiotis and the others possibly suffocated or suffered heart 
attacks after their aircraft suddenly depressurized as it rapidly 
lost altitude.

	Students Protest in Jakarta  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- In the Indonesian capital of Jakarta,  
nearly 1,000 students tried to march on parliament Tuesday, 
demanding the resignation of President B.J. Habibie and the end of 
military involvement in politics -- and blaming both for the 
bloodshed in East Timor. Protesters clashed with police firing 
plastic bullets and tear gas. ``The military kill people in East 
Timor. We students must challenge them,'' said one protest 
organizer. Hundreds of thousands of East Timorese are estimated to 
have fled in the wake of a campaign of violence, launched by the 
Indonesian army and pro-Indonesian militia after the province voted 
on Aug. 30 to secede from Indonesia.

	Forbes Tours Pregnancy Center  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate  
Steve Forbes said today that one of his first acts, if elected 
president, would be to sign a ban on a type of late-term abortion. 
``Life begins at conception and should end only at natural death,'' 
Forbes said during a campaign stop at a Christian-based pregnancy 
counseling center. He said the late-term procedures, which critics 
call ``partial birth'' abortions, should be banned, except in the 
case where the life of the mother was at stake. He said he would 
sign the ban regardless of whether it included exceptions for cases 
of rape or incest.

	Russia Beefs Up Security

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Police in black bulletproof vests swarmed through  
crowded places in Moscow on Tuesday, challenging visitors to 
identify themselves after two explosions in five days killed more 
than 210 people in the Russian capital. Across the capital, 
soldiers swept apartment building basements and storehouses, 
searching for explosives like those suspected in the two apartment 
building blasts. Many officials have linked the apartment building 
blasts on Monday and last Thursday to the fighting in Dagestan. 
Muslim fighters from the region want to establish an independent 
Islamic state, and they have threatened attacks elsewhere in 
Russia.

	Senators Give 'Silver Sewer' to Fox

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two days after Fox television's ``Ally  
McBeal'' won an Emmy for best comedy, the network was singled out 
by Sen. Joseph Lieberman and William Bennett for what they said 
were too many shows with vulgar, sexual content. Bennett and 
Lieberman -- culture critics who for years have tried to persuade 
the music, TV and video game industries to produce more wholesome 
fare -- gave Fox their third annual ``Silver Sewer'' award today. 
``Nothing seems too cheap or degrading to be played for a laugh,'' 
said Lieberman, D-Conn.

	Nets' Williams Out Until January

<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets' center Jayson  
Williams underwent arthroscopic knee surgery at the Hospital for 
Special Surgery in New York City this morning to remove loose 
particles and a tiny kernel of bone from his right knee. Nets 
general manager John Nash said Dr. Russell Warren, Williams' 
surgeon, advised that Williams shouldn't place any weight on his 
knee for another month, and gave a tentative date for Williams' 
return of Jan. 1. Williams will miss training camp and the first 
two months of the season, which begins Nov. 2.

<HEADLINE> Herbalife To Take Company Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Herbalife International Inc. shares rose 60  
percent after the chief executive of the dietary supplement company 
said he would buy outstanding shares he doesn't already own for 
$500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Herbalife rose $5.53 1/8 Tuesday to close at $14.68 3/4, a  
52-week high, on the Nasdaq stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Mark Hughes announced on Monday that he would  
buy the stock, citing the poor performance of Herbalife shares in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock closed at $9.15 5/8 on Monday before Hughes'  
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, worth $17 per share, will give Hughes 100 percent  
ownership and control of the Los Angeles-based company, which sells 
weight-management, personal-care and nutritional products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Herbalife has not been rewarded in the public equity markets  
and the conditions which may have contributed to this are not 
likely to change in the near term,'' Hughes said in a letter to 
investors that was posted on the company's Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a private company, without the distractions of day-to-day  
and quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our share price, I will have 
more flexibility in making decisions to bring Herbalife where we 
want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herbalife sales have declined in key international markets,  
including Russia and Brazil and the share price has dipped as low 
as $6 earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the company posted earnings of $48.5 million on sales  
of $867 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, Hughes said his buyback plan had the backing of  
Herbalife's board of directors and senior management. The buyback 
will be financed in part through $214 million in loans, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Offers Y2K Warnings Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department is warning Americans who  
plan to travel overseas for the New Year's holiday they likely will 
experience problems such as power failures or telephone outages, 
especially in parts of Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the department indicated it expected few problems  
caused by the Year 2000 technology problem across parts of Western 
Europe, North America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings issued Tuesday provided the most detailed picture  
to date from the government about where it anticipates trouble 
related to the so-called Y2K glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``This information will help Americans make their own  
decisions,'' Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
	No country's Y2K situation was severe enough to issue a formal  
``travel warning'' to discourage Americans from visiting, the State 
Department said, although it urged citizens traveling to Belarus to 
defer their trips or ``be prepared to withstand power, water and 
heat outages during cold winter weather that can last several days 
or more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we're not issuing travel warnings at this time  
... may be taken by some as being reassuring,'' said Kevin Herbert, 
the State Department's director of overseas citizens services. ``We 
would do a travel warning if we thought it was dangerous to go 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency published 196 country-by-country advisories on its  
Internet site -- http://travel.state.gov -- in updated ``consular 
information sheets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem exists because many older computers and software  
recognize only the last two digits of the year, meaning they might 
mistakenly interpret ``00'' as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's most severe warnings included Russia, where it  
predicted likely failures with electrical and heat outages and 
problems with phone and financial systems and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby Ukraine ``appears to be unprepared'' and the State  
Department warned of ``a risk of potential disruption in all key 
sectors, especially the energy and electric services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also described possible failures in China's banking and phone  
systems, and said inland Chinese cities may experience power 
failures and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations in Western Europe fared better in the government  
assessment. Spain, France and Germany were declared ``low risk,'' 
although the government said Italy should work harder on health 
care, telecommunications and transportation issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada and Mexico, the U.S. border countries, also were graded  
low risk. The government said Mexico could experience local 
problems with its phone system, but added that adequate manual 
overrides were in place for electrical or water failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate's Year 2000  
Committee, complained that the State Department ``barely scratches 
the surface of serious Y2K problems facing many countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In making its assessments, the department looked specifically  
for potential problems with health care, communications, financial 
services or transportation -- all crucial for travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	It acknowledged much of the information was self-reported by  
foreign governments -- then verified -- and insisted the countries 
``did not write these or determine what was in them,'' said John 
O'Keefe of the agency's office of undersecretary for management. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not our intention to impede travel or hinder tourism in  
any way,'' O'Keefe said. ``Nor have these analyses been geared to 
reflect any political considerations or the nature of the 
relationship between the United States and any country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government cited a moderate risk of telephone and power  
failures in Israel, adding that the nation's thousands of cellular 
phone customers might be affected. Japan also was declared low 
risk, although the State Department urged travelers with special 
medical needs to take precautions because of inadequate computer 
repairs in the country's health care system. 
</P>
<P>
	The task of naming which countries were likely to suffer serious  
failures was so sensitive that department officials refused to 
discuss problems in specific countries or regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also acknowledged that it warned foreign  
governments twice about how they would be graded before making the 
information public. 
</P>
<P>
	The earliest drafts were finished more than three months ago,  
but not published until Tuesday -- with fewer than 17 weeks before 
year's end -- to give governments time to provide more information 
about computer repairs and to argue for more positive portrayals.

<HEADLINE> American Eagle Employees Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- For the second time this year, American Airlines'  
parent company is dealing with employees who are unhappy about the 
company's acquisition of a small airline. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, American's pilots conducted a costly sickout. This  
week, flight attendants at American Eagle carried picket signs and 
handed out leaflets protesting AMR Corp.'s plans to merge Eagle 
with newly acquired Business Express. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants say they need a pay raise to be on par  
with their new Business Express colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Several dozen American Eagle flight attendants carried picket  
signs and handed leaflets to the airline's passengers Monday at 
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers, members of the AFL-CIO's Association of Flight  
Attendants, want the airline's parent company, AMR Corp., to raise 
their pay in line with wages at Dover, N.H.-based Business Express, 
which are about $3 an hour higher for the same seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not fair to have people with the same seniority  
working side by side with people who are paid more,'' said union 
spokeswoman Cynthia Kain. ``It would obviously create tension in 
the cabins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AMR announced in December it was buying Business Express to  
expand service in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees said about 1,100 American Eagle flight attendants and  
200 from Business Express are members of the same union. Sharon 
Abeling, vice president of the Business Express attendants' Local, 
said that airlines attendants support the American Eagle attendants 
and held their own protest Sunday at Logan Airport in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abeling said Business Express attendants are worried that  
AMR is reducing their work by changing Business Express flights in 
Washington and other cities to American Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	American Eagle's vice president of in-flight services, Patricia  
Hollinrake, told union members last month negotiations were ending 
because the union would not extend its current contract, due to 
expire in 2002. The company had offered pay increases, particularly 
for less experienced attendants, but not on par with Business 
Express wages, according to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Kincaid, an American Eagle spokesman, said the airline has  
made several offers to the union but received no response. He said 
the union wants to renegotiate a contract ratified last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many features of the American Eagle contract are better than  
the Business Express contract,'' Kincaid said. ``Do they want to 
cherry-pick the best of both contracts? This was a great contract 
last year, but now they want to reopen it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants' dispute marks the second time this year  
that AMR, based in Fort Worth, has encountered employees displeased 
with the company's acquisition of a small airline. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, about one-fourth of American Airlines' pilots  
called in sick to protest AMR's December acquisition of Reno Air, 
whose pilots were paid about half the scale as American pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The sickout proved costly for both the airline and the union.  
American said it lost $225 million due to canceled flights, and a 
federal judge fined the union $45.5 million for disobeying a 
back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants say they won't strike but are planning  
future protests in Chicago and Miami, two major centers for 
American Eagle.

<HEADLINE> Sam Donaldson To Host Web News Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television news' latest convert to the Internet  
is ABC's Sam Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran White House correspondent will be host of  
``SamDonaldson@ABCNEWS.com,'' a 15-minute news report that will air 
three times a week on the Internet only, the network said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of a restructuring of his duties that will include  
work as a national political reporter for ABC and occasional 
hour-long TV specials for the network. Donaldson is ending his 
second stint as White House correspondent and will no longer be 
host one night a week on ``20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Cokie Roberts, Donaldson will continue as co-host of the  
Sunday morning show, ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie 
Roberts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Webcast will air Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 12:30 p.m.,  
starting Sept. 27. The general news broadcast, with an emphasis on 
Internet issues, is an experiment that could expand if there's 
enough interest, Donaldson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of smart people tell me the Internet is the future,''  
said Donaldson, 65. ``If there is, there's nothing like being on 
the ground floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson was the odd man out when ABC's Barbara Walters decided  
she wanted to be a sole host of Friday's ``20/20'' edition 
following the retirement of Hugh Downs. Connie Chung and 
newly-hired Jack Ford will be hosts of ``20/20-Monday,'' and Diane 
Sawyer and Charles Gibson will anchor Wednesday's newsmagazine. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also announced that Thursday's ``20/20'' will be renamed  
``20/20 Downtown,'' with Elizabeth Vargas, John Quinones, Jay 
Schadler and Cynthia McFadden as revolving hosts. The network 
describes it as an ``edgier'' broadcast with a greater emphasis on 
first-person narratives. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, meanwhile, is on the mend from surgery to repair a  
nodule on one of his vocal cords. The owner of TV news' most 
insistent voices will know by December whether he's completely 
cured of hoarseness that has plagued him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Psychologically, it's been very bad,'' he said. ``If you cut  
off my right hand, I'll wear a glove ... But if you take my voice 
away, that's what I do for a living, that's my self-image.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Fuming About U.S.-Russia Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers criticized the Clinton  
administration's support for aid to Russia, as investigators 
widened their inquiry into allegations that Russian gangsters 
laundered billions of dollars through a U.S. bank. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, called the Clinton  
policy toward Russia ``the greatest U.S. foreign policy failure 
since Vietnam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The unparalleled financial graft in Russia -- much of it  
apparently involving money from U.S. taxpayers -- marks the 
effective end of the Clinton-Gore administration's approach to 
Russian reform,'' Armey said Tuesday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stated purpose of the Clinton-Gore policy was to help  
Russia become a peaceful and productive free-market democracy. 
Instead, Russia has become a looted and bankrupt zone of 
nuclearized anarchy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman David Leavy said Armey's remarks were  
irresponsible and ignored ``the events that have happened in Russia 
in the last 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has ``made important strides'' in promoting  
``Russia's transition toward a free-market democracy,'' Leavy said. 
He cited Russia's voluntary disabling of nuclear weapons and the 
rise of personal and press freedom and an independent judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been put on the defensive by suspicions  
that International Monetary Fund loans and U.S. food aid to Russia 
may have been illegally diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican criticism came as Russian investigators were in  
Washington to meet with State and Justice Department officials to 
discuss the money-laundering case and ways they can cooperate in 
their inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, as the IMF's biggest member, has delayed  
deciding whether it should approve new loans to Russia from the 
international lending agency until a full accounting is made of the 
money already lent. The 182-nation IMF has lent Russia some $22 
billion since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore is coming under fire from Republicans for  
his close relationship with Russian leaders and his hands-on role 
in U.S.-Russian diplomacy, particularly as chairman of a joint 
commission on bilateral ties with former Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a congressional GOP strategy, Rep. Benjamin Gilman,  
R-N.Y., chairman of the House International Relations Committee, 
announced that he would hold a series of hearings on U.S. policy 
toward Russia, including the bilateral commission headed by Gore 
and Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's support for Russia ``has apparently gone  
hand-in-hand with a willing disregard for the high-level corruption 
within the (Russian) government,'' Gilman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Banking Committee plans hearings next week on the  
alleged money-laundering scheme involving as much as $10 billion at 
the Bank of New York, the 15th largest U.S. bank. The Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee also plans to hold hearings soon, with 
topics to include corruption in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the House passed a measure, 419-0, aimed mainly at  
Russia that would impose sanctions on countries helping Iran 
develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said the president's senior advisers would  
recommend he veto the bill because it would ``have the effect of 
undermining multilateral support that is vital to effectively fight 
proliferation.'' President Clinton vetoed a similar bill last year.

<HEADLINE> Nets' Williams Out Until January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets will be without  
two of their centers until at least January. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Jayson Williams underwent arthroscopic knee surgery at  
the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City on Tuesday 
morning to remove loose particles and a tiny kernel of bone from 
his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets general manager John Nash said Dr. Russell Warren,  
Williams' surgeon, advised that Williams shouldn't place any weight 
on his knee for another month, and gave a tentative date for 
Williams' return of Jan. 1. Williams will miss training camp and 
the first two months of the season, which begins Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets will also be without backup center Evan Eschmeyer until  
January. Eschmeyer, the 34th player pick in the draft, ruptured a 
shoulder muscle while working out in Illinois last month. Team 
officials said he would be out for four months. 
</P>
<P>
	The team re-signed 37-year-old center Michael Cage to a one-year  
deal late Monday to fill in, coach Don Casey said. Cage, 37, played 
79 games for the Nets during the 1997-98 season, averaging 1.3 
points and 3.9 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's coming back as protection and as use for our front  
line,'' Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets are also turning to former NBA star Bill Walton to help  
train the team's other big men, 7-foot-7 Gheorghe Muresan and 
6-foot-10 forward Keith Van Horn. Walton, who led Portland to an 
NBA title and is now a TV commentator, will start next week, Nash 
said.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Gore-Bradley Close in NH </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley is in a close race with Vice  
President Al Gore in the Democratic presidential contest in New 
Hampshire, while George W. Bush has kept a big lead over his 
Republican rivals, a new poll indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	A WMUR-CNN poll released Monday shows Gore is favored by 46  
percent of likely voters in the 2000 Democratic presidential 
primary, compared with 41 percent who support Bradley, a former 
senator from New Jersey. That difference was within the poll's 
margin of error of 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore had 50 percent to 39 percent for Bradley among registered  
Democrats. But among independents who said they were likely to vote 
in the Democratic primary, 44 percent supported Bradley to 42 
percent for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley recently pointed to his appeal among independents as a  
major selling point for his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine percent in the poll were undecided and 4 percent backed  
other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 325 likely Democratic primary voters,  
conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center from 
Sept. 5 to Sept. 11, showed the same competitive trend as polls 
released last week by the Boston Globe-WBZ-TV and WNDS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the WMUR-CNN poll found Gore was favored by 68 percent,  
while Bradley was the pick of only 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's favorability rating is now lower than Bradley's, and  
Bradley's supporters were more strongly committed to their 
candidate, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-three percent of Bradley supporters said they were certain  
to vote for him, compared to 34 percent of Gore supporters who said 
they were sure to vote for the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 377 Republicans, the poll found that Bush, governor of  
Texas, had 45 percent while former American Red Cross president 
Elizabeth Dole was at 15 percent, Arizona Sen. John McCain was at 
12 percent, and publisher Steve Forbes had the support of 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates trailed in the single digits: political  
commentator Pat Buchanan had 5 percent; former U.N. Ambassador Alan 
Keyes had 4 percent; former Vice President Dan Quayle drew 3 
percent; conservative activist Gary Bauer and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch 
each had 1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Biotech Activists Plan Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opponents of genetic engineering have come up  
with a new tactic to stop the spread of altered crops: antitrust 
lawsuits against the companies responsible for the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits, to be filed in 30 countries later this year, will  
accuse the companies of using the technology to gain control of 
world agriculture, said antibiotech activist Jeremy Rifkin, 
director of the Foundation on Economic Trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Major grain traders and processors also will be named in the  
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, biotech opponents have focused their efforts on  
persuading food manufacturers not to buy genetically modified crops 
and getting governments to require the labeling of altered foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust actions will force governments to consider curbing  
the power of a shrinking number of giant agribusiness companies, 
Rifkin predicted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight major antitrust law firms have agreed so far to handle the  
lawsuits, he said. In addition to Rifkin, the plaintiffs will 
include individual farmers and the National Family Farm Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Biotech companies are genetically manipulating plants to make  
fruits and vegetables more attractive, speed the growth of crops or 
make them resistant to insects, disease and weedkillers. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies control the spread of the technology by patenting  
the seeds and then leasing them to growers, rather than selling 
them, to prevent the farmers from reproducing the seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	While the crops have grown quickly in popularity with American  
farmers, the technology has had trouble getting accepted by 
consumers in Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders of the technology say it can increase yields while  
reducing the need for pesticides and eventually will lead to 
nutritionally enhanced crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``Biotechnology is being adopted at an unprecedented rate by  
American farmers because it's giving them more choices than ever 
before in how they grow their crops. It's producing benefits for 
them in terms of higher yields and less use of pesticides,'' said 
Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say the technology raises a number of environmental  
concerns in addition to giving giant agribusiness companies, such 
as St. Louis-based Monsanto Co. and Novartis AG of Switzerland, new 
power over farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In less than five, six years from now virtually no farmer in  
the world will own any seed again,'' Rifkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	A third of the nation's corn crop and about 55 percent of the  
soybeans U.S. farmers are growing this year have been genetically 
engineered. The soybean seeds are sold by Monsanto for use with its 
popular Roundup weedkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Rifkin said the lawsuits would be filed before the next round of  
negotiations by the World Trade Organization starts in November. 
Biotechnology is expected to be a major issue of the global trade 
talks.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Assisted Suicide Bill Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to bar the use of controlled substances  
for physician-assisted suicide was approved Tuesday by a House 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,  
would discourage -- if not prevent -- Oregon patients from using the 
state's first-in-the-nation law allowing physician-assisted suicide 
for terminally ill patients with fewer than six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
	All 15 patients who died under Oregon's law during its first  
full year in 1998 used controlled substances to take their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal ``will help protect vulnerable people in this  
country from the misuse of controlled substances,'' Rep. Charles 
Canady, R-Fla., said before the Judiciary Committee's 16-8 
party-line vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, physicians who intentionally use controlled  
substances to cause death would face revocation of their licenses 
to prescribe the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Democrats, who opposed the bill, said it would  
discourage pain treatment because doctors would fear the loss of 
those licenses or criminal prosecution if patients unintentionally 
died from controlled substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also noted that Oregon voters have twice affirmed the  
law, saying Congress shouldn't intrude on states' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we have a state that worked long and hard to develop  
legislation ... and yet we come in with a big brother attitude that 
we should overcome the Oregon law,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, 
D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was written in response to Attorney General Janet  
Reno's announcement last year that federal drug agents will not try 
to prosecute or revoke the drug licenses of doctors who help 
terminally ill patients die under Oregon's law. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of Oregon's law say Hyde's bill -- and a Senate version  
by Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla. -- are poorly disguised 
attempts to overturn the state's landmark law.

<HEADLINE> More Encephalitis Reported in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the city prepared to complete the first round  
of aerial and ground spraying to combat mosquito-borne 
encephalitis, two more cases of the potentially deadly disease were 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest cases -- a 15-year-old boy who has been hospitalized  
and a 38-year-old woman who health officials say appears to have 
recovered -- bring the total number of confirmed cases to 11. Three 
of those have died. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until now, the youngest person who had a confirmed case was 58  
years old,'' said city Health Department director Neal Cohen. 
``Younger people, given stronger immune response, generally have 
milder forms of the illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city is awaiting lab results for 65 other people who may  
have been infected with the St. Louis strain, including a 
79-year-old woman who died Saturday in the Queens borough. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis encephalitis can cause seizure, paralysis and swelling  
of the brain that is sometimes fatal, especially to infants, the 
elderly and people with immune deficiency. Its symptoms include 
fever, headache and lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
	Spraying of the insecticide malathion was planned tonight for  
parts of Staten Island, which would complete the first round of 
citywide spraying. Additional spraying will take place over the 
next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, city health employees and consultants from the  
Centers for Disease Control continued trapping and testing birds, 
which, like humans, become infected with encephalitis through 
mosquito bites. Testing birds provides an indication of whether 
mosquitoes in a particular area are carrying the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the confirmed cases were in Queens, and one was in  
Brooklyn. The two new cases are the first in the Bronx. The city 
has been distributing bottles of free insect repellent at fire 
stations.

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Rejects Textile Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- An appeals court on Tuesday rejected a textile  
industry trade organization's claim that The Limited Inc. and other 
retailers committed customs fraud against the government to try and 
avoid paying customs fees and fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld lower court rulings  
against the American Textile Manufacturers Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Black, a Washington lawyer for the textile institute,  
said its lawyers will consider either asking the full 15-judge 
appeals court to rehear the case or for the U.S. Supreme Court to 
review it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited's management said in a statement Tuesday that it is  
pleased with the court's ruling and that it complies with all U.S. 
laws governing imports and asks that its suppliers do so as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The textile institute claimed that The Limited and the other  
retailers were lying to the government about the country from which 
the apparel was being imported. The apparel in question was from 
China, the lawsuit claims, but the retailers told the U.S. customs 
authorities it was from Hong Kong or Macau because of textile 
import quota limits that could have kept the Chinese-made goods 
from being brought into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Falsely labeling the imports enabled the retailers to avoid  
paying potential customs fees or fines, the textile organization's 
lawyers argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for The Limited, a Columbus-based clothing store chain,  
argued that the textile institute's lawsuit was filed under a 
federal law, the False Claims Act, that does not apply to such 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1863 law was enacted to allow citizens to sue to recover  
money in cases in which they believe the government has been 
defrauded, in exchange for being able to keep part of the money 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute represents U.S. textile and apparel manufacturers.  
At issue are undetermined amounts of import fees that the industry 
group argues were due the government on millions of dollars worth 
of garment shipments into the United States from 1986 to 1996, when 
the lawsuit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John Holschuh in 1997 upheld the defendants'  
argument that the False Claims Act does not apply to this case. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, the government has the option to take over the  
burden of prosecuting a citizen's lawsuit. The government is 
investigating the textile industry's allegations in this case but 
declined to take over the lawsuit, said Douglas Letter, a Justice 
Department attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants are The Limited, affiliated retailers including  
Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Lane Bryant, Structure, 
Express and Lerner New York, and apparel importers Tarrant Apparel 
Group, of Los Angeles, and Mast Industries Inc., of Andover, Mass.

<HEADLINE> Beach Oasis Copes With Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JALAMA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Surfers relish the waves along this  
secluded beach and vacationers savor the miles of undeveloped 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	There's only one major inconvenience: wayward rockets.  
</P>
<P>
	When neighboring Vandenberg Air Force Base launches its big  
Titan rockets, the campers and day visitors must leave, just in 
case there's trouble over what the military calls the ``impact 
limit zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vandenberg, about 180 miles northwest of Los Angeles, is the  
launch site for payloads being placed in a polar orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``About once a year, on average, we will have to ask Jalama to  
clear the beach for a launch for a Titan II or Titan IV,'' said 
Maj. John Cherry, a Vandenberg spokesman. ``We give plenty of 
notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liquid-fueled Titans ``move a little slower and stay over land a  
little longer'' so precautions are necessary, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	There's never been an accident, or ``catastrophic event,'' as  
the Air Force calls it, over the clearing of Jalama Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent evacuations were in May and June. The next  
beach-clearing launch is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 3, when an 
Air Force weather satellite will be hurled into space. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Kinney, a Santa Barbara County parks ranger, has lived at  
Jalama Beach for about 12 years and can only remember the beach 
being evacuated ``seven or nine times'' in that period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We work around the missile inconvenience,'' Kinney said.  
``People leave their tents and camping gear and go into town for 
dinner. There's usually a four-hour window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camper Art Feldman, 60, of Monrovia, has been coming to Jalama  
Beach for 30 years, ``back when it was a secret spot'' unspoiled by 
the explosion of tourists and modern conveniences like hot water 
and flush toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a possible wayward rocket, Feldman said: ``You have to  
worry about that, but the real thing you have to worry about is the 
hills are full of rattlesnakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinney said campers and surfers have always been cooperative  
when it's necessary to evacuate, and he dismissed reports there was 
a seething beach war, adding that the military has been a good 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, one businessman is upset over the launches, which he says  
cost him money. ``Rents and utilities go on for me. Yes, I'm 
annoyed,'' said Don Eittreim, owner of Jalama's, a store and cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``One launch in the 1980s was scrubbed 11 times and they  
evacuated the park every time. Then, on the 11th day, the thing 
blew up on the launch pad,'' Eittreim said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People got mad, having their vacations interrupted,'' he said.  
``People said, `Jeez, I'll never come back.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Eittreim has filed five claims totaling $2,888 for loss of  
business, all of them rejected by the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry is sympathetic.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that can get people frustrated is the change  
in launch days,'' he said. ``There's a myriad of things that can 
cause a 24-hour delay.... There's probably some frustration from 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warning about the beach clearing begin about two weeks before a  
launch and signs are posted as far away as 14 miles from the beach, 
Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies and rangers shoo people out of the park a few  
hours before launch and the 110 beach campsites are cleared. 
Military helicopters sweep the beaches and a Navy boat from Point 
Mugu scans the coast for boaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some boat skippers balk, but the military has figured out a way  
to get them out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``They smile very politely and tell them that their boat  
registration number is being called into their insurance company,'' 
Cherry said. ``They leave very quickly.''
