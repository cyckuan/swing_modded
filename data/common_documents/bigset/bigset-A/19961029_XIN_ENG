<HEADLINE> Rival Iraqi Kurds to Hold Talks in Ankara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) and its rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP)
are expected to hold talks in Ankara Wednesday in a bid to
secure stability and peace in northern Iraq, PUK Ankara
Representative Sazad Saib said here today.
</P>
<P>
Saib said that PUK Politburo Member Muhammed Tevfik would
arrive in Ankara today for the preparations of the scheduled
talks between the two Kurdish parties.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming discussions on details of the projected
settlement are to complement the talks U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Robert Pelletreau had held separately with the KDP and
PUK leaders in Turkey last week.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the U.S. envoy, KDP leader Massoud Barzani
and PUK chief Jalal Talabani agreed to order a cease-fire which
was declared to be holding.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish enclave erupted in violence once again when the
KDP ousted the PUK from Irbil, the seat of the now-defunct
regional government, and captured the control of vast swathes of
northern Iraq in a Baghdad-backed operation at the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
Launching a surprise counter-attack earlier this month with
Iran's suspected support, the PUK took back most of the territory
it lost earlier, including its strongholds of Sulaimaniyah, one
of the biggest cities in northern Iraq, and Koy Sanjaq, and
approached as near as 25 kilometers to Irbil.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has kept the Iraqi government informed of the ongoing
efforts toward a truce.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the KDP
and the PUK began fighting in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment, Salaries Both Up In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- In the first nine months of
this year urban unemployment and salaries both increased a little
in China, according to the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.4 million new jobs were created, but by the end of
September, the number of unemployed in cities and towns was 5.5
million, an increase of 300,000 over the end of last year, and
14.6 percent more than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry put the rate of urban unemployment at 2.98
percent, nearly 0.2 percentage points above the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official attributed the rise in unemployment to poor
performance of state-owned and collectively-owned enterprises,
which could not take all the job-seeking graduates fresh from high
and technical schools.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the average salary of Chinese workers in
the first nine months was 4,003 yuan (nearly 500 US dollars), up
497 yuan from the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
A labor ministry official pointed out that the growth in
worker's salaries had remained relatively low and showed a slight
downturn, saying "this indicates that the government's
macro-economic control on salaries has taken effect."
</P>
<P>
Figures show that there were differences in the growth of
salaries of workers in different enterprises. Workers from
collectively-owned enterprises saw an increase of only 9.2 percent
over the same period of 1995, while those of state enterprises
workers, and employees of private and other enterprises, rose 14
and 29.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, China had a total of 147.5 million
workers, an increase of nearly 40,000 over the same nine-month
period last year, and 108.842 million of these work in state-owned
enterprises, 500,000 more than the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Paris Suspends Sales of Flats Linked to World War Two Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Paris's city council halted sales
of public flats on Monday following charges that some apartments
may have been seized by the Vichy regime from Jews deported to
Nazi death camps in World War Two.
</P>
<P>
Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi today promised to investigate how many
Jewish properties taken by the regime, which collaborated with the
Nazis, are still in the hands of the municipality.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said the sale of about 10 apartments scheduled for
Tuesday had been stopped, along with plans for other sales, mainly
in the mediaeval Marais region of the capital near the
Saint-Gervais Church where many Jews live.
</P>
<P>
The Paris municipality currently owns 1,389 apartments valued
at between 1.2 billion and 1.5 billion francs (240-300 million
U.S. dollars), according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The suspension follows allegations by journalist Brigitte
Vital-Durand in a new book ``Domaine Prive (Private Estate)'' that
the Vichy regime seized many Paris properties from Jews who were
deported to Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
She said that after World War II some of the houses or
apartments were returned to survivors of the death camps, but many
remained in the hands of the city government, either because their
former owners had died or because their children were too young to
claim them.
</P>
<P>
She noted that some of these seized properties were transferred
to various public real estate companies in Paris and some became
the private property of the municipality.
</P>
<P>
Tiberi initially reacted to the claims by saying that some
people were trying to demonize the Paris city government, but
changed his tone today, promising to contact the relevant state
services and the prefecture of Paris, which holds the archives of
the city for the Vichy period.
</P>
<P>
The city will also contact historians, Jewish associations,
associations of deportees and the Chamber of Notaries, to clarify
the issue, said Tiberi, a member of the Gaullist RPR
party who succeeded Jacques Chirac as Mayor of Paris in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Socialist Party and Communist Party have called
for a thorough investigation into the issue.

<HEADLINE> Reshuffle in Pakistani Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's federal cabinet
was reshuffled today with Syed Naveed Qamar, minister for
privatization, given the finance portfolio, a post held by Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto for three years.
</P>
<P>
Naveed Qamar has now become the first full-fledged minister for
finance and economic affairs appointed by the present government.
</P>
<P>
During a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Bhutto
today, it was decided that Naveed Qamar will also look after the
assignment of an advisor to the prime minister on finance and
economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
V. A Jaffery, advisor to the prime minister for finance and
economic affairs with the status of a federal minister, intended
to take a three-month leave.
</P>
<P>
He was allowed to leave for one month for the time being, said
Federal Information Secretary Mohammad Akram while briefing
reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
The local press said Jaffery, the government's major economic
policy maker, had tended his resignation to the prime minister
earlier. But Bhutto turned down his request.
</P>
<P>
The government has recently been widely criticized for its
economic policies and relations with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), under whose pressure the government has introduced
heavy tax measures.
</P>
<P>
Jaffery led a delegation to hold talks with the IMF earlier
this month in Washington, trying to persuade the latter to release
the delayed second tranche of a 600-million-U.S.-dollar standby
loan.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF refused to release the 80 million dollars
badly needed by the Pakistani government. Instead, it presented a
package of tough measures to Pakistan as its condition for the
release of the loan.
</P>
<P>
On October 22, the government announced a new economic reform
package largely based on the IMF's proposal, which drew wide
criticism in the country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition called a countrywide strike last Saturday to
protest against the government's policies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sher Afgan Niazi, minister of parliamentary affairs,
has been given the additional portfolio of human rights to succeed
Iqbal Haider, who was recently appointed attorney general.

<P>
ABU DHABI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa al-Thani met today in Doha with visiting British
Secretary of State for Defense Michael Portillo and his
accompanying delegation, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
No details about the meeting were revealed, but reports said
that the two sides reviewed cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Britain signed in June 1993 a memorandum of
cooperation in the field of defense equipment. They also signed a
document on defense cooperation in London last April. Six months
ago, the two sides took part in joint military exercises in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source here has anticipated that Portillo will
discuss with Qatari officials matters related to military
cooperation between Qatar and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Portillo is scheduled to inspect the British warship
Edinburgh, which is currently stationed in the Gulf waters.
</P>
<P>

<P>
HARARE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A study to ascertain the impact
of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on agriculture is scheduled to begin in
Zimbabwe "soon", a senior official of the Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) said here today.
</P>
<P>
FAO population officer Erich Baier said similar studies had
been undertaken in many other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 500 people die each week from AIDS related
illnesses in this southern African nation of 10.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
It is also estimated at least 10 percent of the 10.5 million
people are infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected is the most productive group of 15 to 40
years age.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies in the country's rural areas showed that the
high number of AIDS deaths had resulted in the loss of
agricultural knowledge and management skills.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Sino-French Ties with AFP President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met with
President of the Agence France-Presse, Jean Miot, on Monday,
saying he expects French President Jacques Chirac's scheduled visit
to China to further bilateral friendly co-operation.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes the state visit of President Jacques Chirac, and
believes the visit will further promote the friendly relations of
co-operation between the two countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Miot's questions, Li said that China and France
are both countries of major influence in the world, and China
hopes to strengthen co-operation with France in international
affairs, in pushing for development of the world in a direction of
multi-polarization and making due contributions to world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
Li voiced appreciation for President Chirac' independent
foreign policy in handling international affairs and for the fact
that he has attached great importance to developing relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether China hopes to see an early lift of restrictions
on sales of military technology to China by France and the
European Union, Li said that the restrictions did not affect China
much, and only resulted in the loss of the Chinese market by the
imposers.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question on whether AFP's Hong Kong Bureau will
enjoy freedom of news coverage after 1997, when China resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, Li said that such freedom
is allowed within the framework of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Of course, li said, "there is no absolute freedom in the world
and freedom should be what is permitted within the scope of
law."
</P>
<P>
Quoting two great French philosophers, Li further defined
freedom as the right to do what is permitted by law and said that
only by observing laws people make for themselves can they expect
to enjoy freedom.

<HEADLINE> More Aid for Single-Child Farm Families in China's Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China is planning on offering
more help to farmers who have only one child, or two girls, in a
poverty relief program in its less-developed outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, a state councillor and minister of the State
Family Planning Commission, today made this remark while
addressing a national conference on combining aid-the-poor efforts
with family planning, in Guiyang, capital of southwestern Guizhou
province, where there is a large population of poor people.
</P>
<P>
She said that aid-the-poor projects must be combined with
family planning to try to co-ordinate population growth and
economic development in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
The only way to solve the population and development problems
in poverty-stricken areas is to help farmers with fewer children
to become better off faster, and that controlling population
growth and improving the quality of farmers' lives is the basis of
poverty relief, she said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should offer more funds and provide more
technological help for counties, towns, villages, and farmers that
implement the family planning policy, so as to help them overcome
poverty first, she added.
</P>
<P>
She called for an extension of rural family planning networks
and family planning schools to promote birth control.
</P>
<P>
During the previous five years, she noted, the natural
population growth rate in 18 provinces and autonomous regions with
greater numbers of poor farmers was higher than that in other
provinces.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Say They'll Release Financial Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Criticized for refusing to
file a pre-election financial report, the Democratic National
Committee announced today it would release a list of contributors
and provide a summary of its spending to the government.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to hide and we're proving that," said Amy
Weiss Tobe, spokeswoman for the committee. Tobe said the DNC would
ask the Federal Election Commission "to treat it as an official
FEC report," although she said the report would not contain a
complete accounting of spending.
</P>
<P>
Tobe said the information would be given to the news media and
the FEC today.
</P>
<P>
Don Simon, executive vice president of Common Cause, said even
before today's announcement that releasing a list would not
substitute for a formal federal filing, where any omissions could
carry legal penalties.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the DNC said it wouldn't release any of the report,
saying it was not legally bound to do so.
</P>
<P>
Tobe has maintained that DNC was legally entitled to skip the
report -- actually due last Thursday -- because it did not spend
any money on President Bill Clinton's re-election or on
congressional campaigns during the first 15 days of October, the
period covered by pre-election reports.
</P>
<P>
Federal Election Commission records dating back to 1984 showed
that each party's principal national committee has filed
pre-election reports each election year.
</P>
<P>
The Republican National Committee has submitted its report for
the period. The report lists all donors who contributed 200
dollars or more and all money spent or transferred to other
committees.
</P>
<P>
Under federal regulations, a party committee must file a
pre-election report when it "makes contributions or expenditures
in connection with any such election, if such disbursements have
not been previously disclosed."

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The group of 15 developing
countries should formulate strategies to deal with challenges
ushered in by the new world trade environment, Zimbabwe Industry
and Commerce Deputy Minister Obert Mpofu said here today.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the G-15 business investment forum, Mpofu
underscored the importance of cementing the relationship between
the business sector and the political leadership in order to reap
maximum benefits from liberalised world trade.
</P>
<P>
''The business community and its political leadership will
need to address itself on ways and strategies to face and handle
new issues that are being pushed into the multilateral trading
system,'' said Mpofu.
</P>
<P>
The international trading system, he said, needed particular
attention, especially following the conclusion of the Uruguay
Round (UR) negotiations and the forthcoming World Trade
Organisation (WTO) ministerial conference to be held in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He urged G-15 member states to use the business forum to take
stock of their achievements over the past year to come up with
new strategies that reflected the new international business
thinking.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 business investment forum aims to promote intra-G-15
trade and investment. It has drawn more than 50 representatives
from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The forum is a forerunner to the sixth G-15 summit to be held
in Harare from November 3 to 5. enditem

<HEADLINE> China's Yellow River Project Sets World Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Xiaolangdi Water Control
Project on the Yellow River, China's second largest river, has set
three world and six national records in project design and
construction.
</P>
<P>
The project is considered one of the most challenging in
dam-building history because of its complex geological structure,
large scale, and engineering difficulties, according to Lin
Xiushan, president of the Survey, Planning, Design and Research
Institute of the Yellow River Conservation Commission under the
Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
The intake tower, 275 meters long and 113 meters high, with 16
tunnels buried under the left bank of the river, is the largest
and most complex of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel intake has a length of 1,100 meters and a diameter
of 14.5 meters, the largest of its kind in the world, and the
dam's basin is 350 meters long and 170 meters wide, also the
world's largest.
</P>
<P>
The six national records are:
</P>
<P>
-- The most comprehensive water control project. Its main
objectives are controlling floods, ice jams, silting, irrigation,
water supplies, and power generation;
</P>
<P>
-- The largest rockfill dam with incline. The height of the dam
is 154 m., its crest length is 1,317 m, and total amount of
rockfill will be 50 million cubic meters;
</P>
<P>
-- The deepest concrete cutoff wall. The wall is inserted 70
meters into the river-bed, and is 80 meters high with a thickness
of 1.2 m.;
</P>
<P>
-- The largest underground power house. It is 250 meters long
and 61 meters high (equal to a 25-storey building) with a span of
26 meters;
</P>
<P>
-- The first water conservation project in China to use modern
concrete pouring methods; and
</P>
<P>
-- The first project to use environmental protection
supervisors in the planning.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi is 40 km north of Luoyang, in central China's Henan
Province, and is the second largest water project in China and the
country's first key water project built with overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
It will take 11 years to complete. The river is to be dammed on
October 31, 1997, and the first two generating units will start
operation in the year 2000. The whole project will be completed
by 2001.

<P>
ABU DHABI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Emir of Qatar Sheikh
Hamad Ben Khalifa al Thani issued today a decree appointing his
half-brother Sheikh Abdullah Ben Khalifa al Thani prime
minister, according to a media report from Doha.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad himself had been holding this post since he
assumed power in Qatar in June 1995 by ousting his father in a
bloodless palace coup. The coup took place when the former emir,
Sheikh Khalifa Ben Hamad al Thani, was on vacation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the history of Qatar for the emir to
relinquish his premiership and appoint someone else prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The official Qatar News Agency said Sheikh Abdullah Ben
Khalifa al Thani, born in 1959, obtained his secondary education
certificate in 1975 and graduated from the Sandhurst Military
Academy in Britain in 1976. He held some leading military posts
during the period from 1976 to 1989. He was appointed interior
minister 1989 and became deputy prime minister and interior
minister in 1995. He is fluent in English and French.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) - Premier Li Peng, in meeting with
president of the Agence France Presse, said that the Japanese
government should stick to a road of peaceful development to
improve Sino-Japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
Li met with AFP President Jean Miot in Zhongnanhai on Monday,
and responded to a question on the Diaoyu Islands, reiterating
that the islands are an integral part of Chinese territory,
despite dispute over the issue with Japan.
</P>
<P>
China always advocates settlement through negotiations over
territorial disputes between nations, and this applies with
China's territorial disputes with its neighbors, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, he said, Japanese militarism brought great
sufferings to the Chinese people. For historical reasons, however,
Japanese militarism was never fully exposed or criticized and in
Japan a small number of people are trying to return to the track
of militarism, Li noted, saying "this cannot but arouse grave
concern of the Chinese people and the people of Asia in general."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier expressed the hope that the Japanese
government will take the overall interest of Sino-Japanese ties
into account, face up to history, learn from lessons in the past,
and stick to a road of peaceful development to improve
Sino-Japanese relations.

<HEADLINE> German Chancellor Starts Visit to Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said here today that his visit to the Philippines has demonstrated
his country's interest in increasing investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who arrived here this afternoon for a three-day visit,
made the statement at a joint press conference with Philippine
President Fidel Ramos tonight after their talks.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Philippines as a country with a very bright
future, Kohl said he would urge German businessmen to consider the
Philippines as an investment site.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will learn from each other and increase
cooperation in economy, trade and technical training, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said at the press conference that he exchanged views with
Kohl on a wide range of issues in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said they were satisfied with the growth of bilateral
relations and the increasing cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We noted that the full potential of our economic relations
still needs to be explored, although Germany is one of our top
trade partners and a substantial source of investments in the
country," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, representatives of the two countries signed
several agreements on economic assistance, technology transfer and
investment protection. Kohl and Ramos attended the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the Philippines' second largest bilateral donor next
to Japan, exported 930 million U.S. dollars' worth of goods to the
Philippines last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the German Embassy in Manila, German investments
in the Philippines shot up from about 7 million dollars in 1994 to
24 million dollars in 1995 and "will continue to grow in the
coming years because more German companies have decided to put up
business here."
</P>
<P>
About 250 German companies are registered in the Philippines,
with most of them engaged in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by three federal ministers and 50 German
industrialists, Kohl arrived here from Indonesia and will proceed
to Japan.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals For Urgent Aid For Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Three UN agencies have appealed
for urgent humanitarian aid for Iraq, where it's estimated more
than half of the women and children are suffering from
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The agencies warned that the situation in the country is
deteriorating sharply due to the cumulative effects of the Gulf
War and the post-war UN-imposed economic sanctions,
hyper-inflation, unemployment and this year's 30 percent drop in
crop production.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries have so far contributed only 1.6 million
U.S. dollars to a 40-million-dollar appeal by the UN Humanitarian
Program for Iraq launched on September 27, a spokeswoman for the
UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
The department issued its latest appeal, in conjunction with
the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the UN World Food Program
(WFP).
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition, particularly among children under five, is
rampant. In northern Iraq, the effects of the recent conflict
between Kurdish factions have compounded the problem.
</P>
<P>
With the onset of winter, the humanitarian situation will
become more critical, the UN agencies warned. They called upon all
donors to respond quickly and generously to meet the urgent needs
of the country's people.

<HEADLINE> Article Preaching Fallacy of "Two Chinas" Refuted (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Today's "Guangming Daily," one
of China's leading newspapers based in Beijing, published a signed
article titled "The Daydreams of Terrill," which slams American
freelance writer Ross Terrill who preached the fallacy of "two
Chinas" in the US newspaper "The Washington Post."
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of the article signed by Li Rong:
</P>
<P>
Ross Terrill, a freelance writer in the United States, recently
published in the "Washington Post" a slanderous article titled
"'One China' Doesn't Make Sense Anymore."
</P>
<P>
Though Terrill's article was actually promoting nothing but
outdated garbage of the "two Chinas" fallacy, it is still
necessary for us to consider why this thought-provoking article
appeared at this very moment.
</P>
<P>
It is extremely ridiculous and absurd for Terrill to play the
trick of confusing black and white, and to claim in his article
that "one China is (just) an ideal, not a reality."
</P>
<P>
It is universally acknowledged that Taiwan is an integral part
of China, which has also been proved by the 5,000-year history of
Chinese civilization and the 47-year history of the People's
Republic of China. However, Terrill deliberately turned a blind
eye to the facts, and was bent solely on the temporary separation
of Taiwan from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
From this, people can see it is absolutely true that "prejudice
is farther from the the truth than ignorance," as a Chinese saying
goes.

<P>
Terrill also said in his article with ulterior motives and like
a poor soothsayer, that "Beijing's rule over today's Taiwan is
simply not feasible".
</P>
<P>
However, history is inexorable and reality is stern. Following
Hong Kong's smooth return to the embrace of the motherland in
1997, and Macao's in 1999, the Taiwan issue will be put on top
of the agenda of China's reunification in the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later, Taiwan will become an inalienable member in
the big family of the motherland. This is an objective law of
history, which is independent of man's will and no one can stop
it, let alone a trivial US free lancer.
</P>
<P>
And even if one day some foreign hostile forces attempt to
interfere with China's internal affairs by encroaching upon the
Taiwan Straits, or if a few advocates of "Taiwan independence"
harshly dare to take action to split Taiwan from the motherland,
China with its increasing might and the Chinese government
absolutely have the ability, and will surely take effective steps
to defend the unity of the country, and to safeguard China's
territorial integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
All of the far-sighted people around the world and all of the
Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots, will definitely
not doubt this. Only a few short-sighted characters, like Terrill,
will indulge themselves in fantasy, and love to spin daydreams.

<HEADLINE> China's Large-scale Power Grids to be Connected Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Almost all of China's power
grids will be interconnected before the year 2020, so as to make
power exchanges possible nationwide, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing economy has brought a new stage in power
development characterized by large capacity and large grids, said
Huo Ji'an, deputy general manager of the State Power Grid
Development Co.Ltd, and that China has 6 large grids and a group
of provincial ones, with 567,000 km of transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Three Gorges Power Station will allow for
interconnection of power grids nationwide, providing power for the
Central, North, and Sichuan grids, helping to form the Great
Central China Power Grid, spanning a distance of 2,000 km from
east to west. The grid will still serve as a link to the North,
Northwest, and South grids.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the framework of various inter-provincial
grids will take shape, involving perfection of the 500 kv and 330
kv grids.
</P>
<P>
Huo said that the Three Gorges Power Station will be completed
by 2009, and a 500 kv project ranging from there to Central,
North, and Sichuan power grids will be established with 9,100 km
of DC and AC transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
Thermal power production bases in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Jiangxi
provinces will ensure large power supplies for Beijing, Tianjin,
Tangshan, Baoding, and other cities in northeast China.

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has been part of China since ancient times: this fact
could not be altered in the past, nor can it be altered at present
or in the future. Any people and sober-minded, will acknowledge
that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is
inalienable part of China, so long as they are mentally healthy
and sober-minded. "Two Chinas" is only the sleeptalking of few
foreigners with ulterior motives and a handful of advocates of
"Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
Recently, the United States Government repeatedly declared that
it will strictly abide by the principles set in the three Sino-US
joint communiques, which stated that all Chinese on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits hold that there is only one China, and Taiwan
is part of China.
</P>
<P>
The US government also promised not to support the so-called
"Taiwan Independence," "One China and One Taiwan" or "Two Chinas."
This is a wise choice.
</P>
<P>
Then why did Mr. Terrill choose to defy world opinion and dish
up a theory of the outdatedness of the "One China" policy?
</P>
<P>
"I am not suggesting the United States should all of sudden
renounce 'One China' (policy). But the evolution of events is
undermining 'One China' (policy)," he went so far as to say. "The
premise of the Shanghai Communique - that all Chinese on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait uphold One China - is no longer true."
</P>
<P>
Terrill revealed his real intentions here. Then, considering
his point of view, how did the "events" evolve, and what did he
mean by the "premise of the Shanghai Communique"?
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the world has indeed experienced great changes
over the past 25 years, since the Shanghai Communique was issued
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
China's comprehensive national strength and international
status have increasingly increased, so has its international
influence.
</P>
<P>
The world has shifted from the previous dual-polar pattern, in
which the United States contended with the former Soviet Union, to
the current multi-polar pattern.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes US Article on Taiwan (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the only superpower in the present world, the United States
has seen its influence become relatively weakened. Its past
opponent and enemy - the former Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact
Organization - no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
Hence, from Terrill's point of view, China is no longer needed
to be taken as a "strategic partner" of the United States to
counter its enemies. But on the contrary, the US nevetheless needs
to find a new "imaginary enemy" to contend with.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, in Terrill's minds, China is his "imaginary enemy."
</P>
<P>
Since Terrill intended to be hostile to the Chinese people, it
is not at all surprising that he dished up the theory of the
outdatedness of the "One China" policy, and alleged that "the
evolution of events" would eventually force the US to "renounce"
the "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the adherence to this policy is the
basis for the development of bilateral relationship between China
and the US. Terrill is deliberately bent on undermining this
basis, but his attempt was ridiculous, just like an ant trying to
topple a giant tree.
</P>
<P>
As two big countries with significant international influences,
China and the US play important roles in maintaining the peace and
security of the whole world. The common interests of the two
countries far outweigh their differences.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has declared time and again that
China and the US should increase trust, reduce conflict, develop
cooperation and avoid confrontation. This is in conformity with
the fundamental interests of the people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Acting in a diametrically opposite way, Terrill and his like
can only indulge themselves in wishful thinking.

neighbors and the regional countries.

<P>
Lutfi Esingun, Turkish Minister of State for the Human
Rights, said at the meeting that the civil war in Afghanistan

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets With Croatian Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen met in
Beijing today with a delegation from the Croatian Assembly, led by
its speaker Vlatko Pavletic.
</P>
<P>
In extending a warm welcome to Pavletic and his party, Qian
said that since the establishment of Sino-Croatian diplomatic
ties, friendly co-operation in politics and other areas between
the two countries has developed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have supported each other in international
affairs, Qian noted, saying that China is satisfied with the
expansion of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also minister of foreign affairs, expressed the belief
that the exchanges and co-operation between the two parliaments
will help further friendly co-operation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the area of economic ties, Qian stressed that even when
Croatia was having difficulties, Sino-Croatian trade made great
progress, and that bilateral economic and trade co-operation will
develop further.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he is delighted at Croatia and Yugoslavia's mutual
recognition and the opening of diplomatic ties between them, and
that maintaining peace and stability in the former Yugoslavia is
beneficial to regional development.
</P>
<P>
Pavletic said that members of his delegation are all
influential members of the Croatian Assembly and this shows that
his country attaches great importance to friendly co-operation
with China in politics, economy, culture, art, and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Pavletic expressed thanks for the support and help China has
given Croatia after it gained independence, calling China "a

<HEADLINE> EU Responds to U.S. Anti-Cuba Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- European Union foreign
ministers on Monday unanimously approved a law to defend European
companies against the effects of U.S. legislation which penalizes
foreign companies investing in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved following a day of negotiations among the
15 EU member states and after Denmark was finally persuaded into
believing that the bloc's counter-measures to the
U.S. Helms-Burton Act would not compromise its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to make it illegal for European companies
or individuals to obey Washington's anti-Cuban Helms-Burton Act
and allow them to reclaim damages awarded under U.S. legislation
in EU courts.
</P>
<P>
The Act, which was passed in March this year in retaliation for
Cuba's downing of two U.S. planes allegedly violating its air
space, allows U.S. citizens to sue in U.S. courts foreign
companies or individuals deemed to have gained from investments in
property confiscated in Cuba after the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said the decision was "an
historic breakthrough which shows we have the will and capacity to
defend our interests."
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act, named after its two sponsors, has been
strongly criticized and opposed by America's major trade partners,
including the EU, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, has also
filed a complaint on the matter with the World Trade Organization
and an arbitration panel is due to convene on November 20.
</P>
<P>
Danish reservations had threatened to scupper the EU's response
to the U.S. legislation. But Brittan said amendments made to
bring Denmark on board were minor. "We have achieved this without
the regulation being in any way weakened," he said.
</P>
<P>
Denmark stunned the European Commission and EU countries last
week by saying concerns over national sovereignty would prevent it
approving laws to counter the U.S. act, an amalgamation of years
of anti-Cuban policy.
</P>
<P>
Denmark had objected to a catch-all clause in the EU law which
it said handed national powers to the bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Danish government is currently embroiled in a court case
with 11 of its citizens who have complained that Copenhagen is
giving away sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> ANC, SACP on Mandela's Threat to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) have
denied that President Nelson Mandela threatened to resign if SACP
leader Jeremy Cronin was not expelled.
</P>
<P>
Cronin once came out to criticize the government's
macro-economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published by today's newspaper ''the Star'',
the two parties said although intense debate had taken place in
the national executive committee of the ANC and in the ranks of
the tripartite alliance formed by the ANC, SACP and the trade
union, Mandela ''never threatened to resign''.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported on October 25 that Mandela had recently
threatened to resign as ANC Chairman should the party members and
SACP leaders not support his government's macro-economic plan,
including privatization.
</P>
<P>
In its report on October 25, the newspaper quoted senior ANC
officials as saying that Mandela was so angry with Sacp Deputy
Secretary-General Cronin for criticizing the ANC in public over
privatization.
</P>
<P>
The SACP said today in its statement that the story was
''outrageous''.
</P>
<P>
The two parties noted that there is a lively debate within the
ANC-led tripartite alliance on the macro-economic strategic plan.

<HEADLINE> 100 Feared Dead in Cairo Building Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- About 100 people are feared dead
following a two-day intense rescue operation, which was launched
30 minutes after the collapse of an apartment building in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
So far, 12 people were found killed and 30 others injured while
another 90 are still missing, due to the collapse of the apartment
building in northeastern Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Workers have pulled out 19 persons from the ill-fated 12-storey
building, which caved in like the folds of an accordion on its
residents Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rescuers are still fumbling through the mountain of
rubble while bulldozers removed concrete slabs and steel bars for
more survivors of the building, located in Heliopolis,
northeastern Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers, working against the time throughout the night,
blasted a hole in the front of the building, and by dawn removed a
man from whom they had heard cries for help earlier.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the rescuers managed to pull from the top of the
rubble mountain a woman survivor trapped beneath a ceiling, and
the body of a man who lay beneath her.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances and a heavy crane were parked at the base of the
apartment block, transformed into a burial ground of personal
belongings like TV sets, books and handbags.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, a seven-man voluntary team from the
International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) rushed to the scene
from Frankfurt, Germany, to take part in rescue operations. The
mission is accompanied by five trained dogs.
</P>
<P>
Japan has announced that it has dispatched a rescue team, which
will arrive here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sayed Mohammed, a rescue official, told reporters at the scene
that at least two more days were needed to recover all the bodies
from the huge heap of concrete chunks and steel rods.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said prosecutors were questioning the
owner of the building, Raouf Wissa Ibrahim, for illegally adding
five storeys after getting permission to build just one more
floor. Police today arrested Ibrahim, the country's Middle East
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Some engineers suspected that the tragedy was caused by
amendments to the basic columns of the building in recent
renovation work.
</P>
<P>
This view is confirmed by the fact that the front part of the
building crumbled while only a corner of the 25-year-old building
remains standing.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Continue Anti-Corruption Efforts: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government was
continuing its efforts to fight corruption and violations of
laws that affect public welfare, Information Minister Marwan
Muasher has said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters Monday that the government looked at all
cases of bribery and misuse of government office for personal
gains as well as violations of laws related to public health and
welfare and government revenues as part of the fight against
corruption, according to the English-language daily Jordan Times
today.
</P>
<P>
A special committee set up by the government early this year
was investigating corruption and bribery involving government
officials as well as violations of laws that involve forgery and
counterfeit.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the anti-corruption campaign, a prominent
pledge that the government of Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti undertook when it took office in February, had made
great achievements.
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, the number of such cases stood at more than
100, with about 150 people involved, Muasher said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures said that the special committee sent 63
corruption cases to the general prosecutor's office by the end
of July, and another 38 cases were transferred in August.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that many new cases have been referred to
court for legal proceedings. But he did not give any details.

<P>
SUZHOU, October 29 (Xinhua) -- An escaped female lion created
chaos at the Zoo of Suzhou after it made its way out of an
unlocked cage last Saturday, sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The lion was captured more than three hours later when it was
calmed by tranquilizers, according to zookeepers.
</P>
<P>
Several lion keepers left a door of the lion's cage unlocked
after putting hay inside to keep the animal warm.
</P>
<P>
The lion went out the door and was on a narrow path between the
cage and short iron railings that serve as a protective fence,
where a gate also was opened.
</P>
<P>
Visitors behind the railings were frightened by the lion and
ran for help. A dozen tigers in a nearby cage also stared
nervously at the creature.
</P>
<P>
Zookeepers rushed to the cage, shut the door, and used a
tranquilizer gun to capture the lion. Workers shot at it eight
times, until it lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
The lion's taste of freedom lasted three hours and 15 minutes.

SHANGHAI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Standard Life of Britain today

</P>
<P>
This is Shanghai's 36th foreign insurance company branch

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Launch First Communications Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to launch its first
telecommunications satellite by the turn of the century, official
report today quoted sources from the Directorate General of Post
and Telecommunications (DGPT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the system, including the installation of a
ground-control station, is estimated at 200-250 million
U.S. dollars, and the life expectancy of the satellite is from 12
to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the system will help to reduce
telecommunications and television broadcast charges and better
satisfy Vietnam's increasing demand in the area.
</P>
<P>
At present, Vietnam is receiving world-wide information through
foreign satellites such as Intersat, Intersputnik and Asiasat.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure nation-wide coverage of its television
programmes, Vietnam now has to lease telecommunications systems
from Thailand (Thaicom), Indonesia (Palapa), and Malaysia
(Masiasat) at high charges.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the project's feasibitity study will be
delayed until mid-1997 because the collection of data on satellite
requirements from relevant ministries and agencies has taken more
time than originally predicted.
</P>
<P>
The report said a number of international companies, including
Hughes Corporation and Loral Space of the United States, Alcatel
and Matra Maconi of France, and Nec of Japan, have shown interest
in the project.

</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- David Willetts, the Paymaster General, is to become the
first minister to appear before a public hearing of a Commons
disciplinary committee after MPs decided Monday night to allow
cameras into their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Willetts is expected to be questioned in public over
accusations that he tried to influence a Commons committee in its
inquiry into cash-for-questions allegations surrounding the former
Trade Minister Neil Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A Labor government would find it very difficult to join a
single European currency in the first wave, but would almost
certainly seek to join after the general election due by 2002,
Robin Cook, the shadow foreign secretary, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Tory fears that James Goldsmith's Referendum Party could
cost them the next election are borne out by a poll published
today. The survey of more than l,000 voters who backed the Tories
at the last election showed that more than a third of all wavering
Conservatives say they are likely to vote for Referendum.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The Home Office is to reconsider banning advertisements and
mail order sales of "Combat" knives, it emerged Monday. Earlier,
the Home Secretary, Michael Howard, pledged to ban the "Rambo"
style knives if a definition could be found that distinguishes
them from kitchen knives.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- A victim of a new variant of the brain disease CJD probably
died through exposure to BSE-infected meat, a Belfast inquest

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government Monday denied an allegation by the
Corsican nationalist group FLNC-Canal Historique that it secretly
held negotiations with the nationalists early this year.
</P>
<P>
Francois Santoni, the secretary of La Cuncolta, the political
wing of FLNC-Canal Historique, has accused French Prime Minister
Alain Juppe of going back on his promises given during the secret
negotiations held in Paris last winter. Santoni also provided the
names of the government envoys who were present at the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
-- Eastern Zaire has become a rebel country which is out of the
control of the Zairean government except the city of Goma, despite
the declaration of a state of emergency by Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The city of Uvira has already fallen to the Banyamulenge
militias engaging Zairean troops, while the city of Bukavu, which
is already deserted, will soon have the fate. The road toward the
refugee camps sheltering some 800,000 Hutu refugees is almost cut,
while the area bordering Uganda is reportedly infiltrated by
Banyamulenges.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French National Assembly today began to examine the
draft law on financing the country's social security programs in
1997. Prepared by Prime Minister Alain Juppe, the law has been
strongly opposed by some trade unions of doctors because of its
call for an austerity budget in social security programs such as
the illness insurance.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross announced on Monday
that he would go back to Washington after three weeks of fruitless
negotiations between Israel and Palestine on the withdrawal of
Israeli forces from Hebron. Both Israelis and Palestinians held
the other responsible for the failure of the talks.

<HEADLINE> 13 Die in Random Shootings in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people died and
over 17 others were wounded today when heavily armed gunmen
indiscriminately opened fire at a crowd near the Bar Ubah
junction of south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, more than 15 heavily armed young
men on a four wheel Toyota pick-up had descended from their truck
and opened fire at the civilians.
</P>
<P>
Eight men and a women died on the spot, while four more died
of their wounds just a few minutes later. The wounded had been
rushed to a local hospital in south Mogadishu for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified Toyota truck which the perpetrators had used
sped immediately when its gunmen had apparently ran out of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the gunmen were not targeting anybody in
particular even though one grenade from a German made g-3 assault
rifle was aimed at a kiosk where it killed three of its
occupants.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified gunmen who met no resistance from the
civilians are suspected to have been the sympathizers of Osman
Atto's faction who were being hunted by the supporters of Hussein
Aidid in south Mogadishu since the death of late general Mohamed
Farah Aidid on August 2. However, nobody has claimed the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen had used rocket propelled grenades, attack hand
grenades, heavy and small machine guns during their ten minutes
random shootings at the scene. This is the worst incident which
took place in Mogadishu since 1994 when similar heavily armed men
had indiscriminately opened fire at Bar Ubah junction of south
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, aid worker Abdullahi Mayow Mahad from the U.N.
Children Fund (UNICEF) who had been shot and seriously wounded
Monday in south Mogadishu was flown to Nairobi today for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
As a senior warehouse officer for UNICEF, Mahad was attacked
near Km-4 junction on Monday by five gunmen who dragged him on and
later deserted him, thinking he was dead.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislature Passes Township Enterprises Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Township Enterprises Law
was passed today by the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, China's top legislative body.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the state encourages and supports the
development of township enterprises by means of taxation and
credit, especially those in less-developed areas and areas
inhabited by ethnic minority groups in the central and western
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the enterprises should set aside funds out of their
profits to support local agriculture and rural social
expenditures. The percentage of funds can be decided by provincial
governments.
</P>
<P>
However, the law prohibits any governmental departments,
institutions and individuals from collecting undue charges from
the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the law stipulates tough punitive measures for such
problems as pollution, serious waste of resources, poor quality of
products, tax evasion or safety problems with the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
With a decree signed by President Jiang Zemin, the law will be
put into effect on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the law was deliberated twice at the committee's
bi-monthly sessions.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy to Enhance European Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The EU's newly-appointed Middle
East envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos has said his mission will secure
a more effective European role in realizing peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The European Union will try to complete mediation efforts,
exerted by the U.S. in the region, Moratinos, who is Spain's
ambassador to Israel, told the British radio BBC in statements
carried by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in Luxemburg Monday, the EU foreign
ministers named the Spaniard to be the special envoy to the Middle
East, with a mandate to observe the peace process, establish
relations with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators and to report
on possible EU actions.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed to appoint an envoy at their special summit
in Dublin on October 5. The 15-nation bloc, urged by France,
has been seeking to play a greater role in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the U.S. State Department Nicholas Burns has
welcomed the appointment of an EU envoy, saying that Washington is
encouraging Europe to play a greater role in the region as the
European countries are the major economic assistance source to
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that this participation will not change the
current formula of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that no party can imagine that it would
replace the united states in the talks or even join these talks.
He said that the U.S. will remain the main mediator in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has no objection to the visits of French President
Jacques Chirac or Russian Foreign Minister Evgeny Primakov to
the Middle East, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Human Resource Development
Working Group of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum will launch a computer-based network to pass on market
information among the 18 member economies.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine APEC News Bureau said today in a news release
that the network will be launched during the informal APEC
leadership conference held in Subic on November 25.
</P>
<P>
The network will reportedly serve as a forum for labor
information exchanges on market trends, prospects, policies and
programs in the region via the information superhighway -- the
Internet -- and other forms of communications like the printed
page.
</P>
<P>
"With good labor market information, businessmen and investors
are afforded with more and better options to invest in areas where
their investments will reap the highest rewards," the news release
said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos, host of the fourth APEC
leaders' meeting, will lead the launching by showing how to apply
and use the network in a 10-minute video presentation.
</P>
<P>
The network will consist of a software package that does
comparative analysis and manipulations of database elements such
as population by age, life expectancy and mortality by sex, per
capita gross domestic product, foreign investments, exchange
rates, unemployment rates and basic monthly earnings.

his country's trade concerns with U.S. President Bill Clinton when
the latter visits here next month.
</P>
<P>
The United States has begun the process of imposing trade
sanctions against Australia, threatening hundreds of millions of
dollars of Australian automotive and textile exports worldwide,
Fischer said in an interview with the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was reportedly to visit this country for five days in
late November before attending an informal leadership conference
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But the trade sanctions row, the subject of negotiations in
Washington and at the World Trade Organization in Geneva, is not
the only trade problem Australia has with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is American restrictions on Australian imports
of sugar, beef and other products, which contribute to a massive
trade imbalance of more than 10 billion Australian dollars (8
billion U.S. dollars) a year in favor of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have our worst trade imbalance with the United States,
these are matters Prime Minister John Howard and I and others will
take the opportunity to properly raise," he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest trade dispute arises from the success of the
Melbourne firm Howe Leather in breaking into the U.S. automotive
components market. The company manufactures leather car seat
covers at plants in Melbourne and Mexico for use in
top-of-the-range Buick cars.

<HEADLINE> China Passes Law on Controlling Noise Pollution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature today
adopted a law on noise pollution, the fourth in a series of
regulations on urban environmental pollution caused by foul air,
sewage, solid waste and noise.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Prevention and Treatment of Noise Pollution was
passed at the 22nd session of the Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that a legal structure to harness pollution in
China's urban areas has been formed, and that China has made
significant progress in formulating laws on environmental
protection," said Qu Geping, director of the Environmental and
Resources Protection Committee under the NPC.
</P>
<P>
China began work on legislation on environmental protection in
the late 1970s, shortly after the country started its reform and
opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
After that, China drew up laws on the prevention and control of
water, air and solid waste pollution.
</P>
<P>
The top legislature then revised existing laws on air and water
pollution, placing priority on prevention while stressing the
combination of prevention and control. The revisions hold the
polluters responsible for controlling the problems they create.
</P>
<P>
Also, environmental legislation has come to cover the
protection of resources, said Qu, who was formerly director of the
State Bureau of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has implemented laws on the protection of water
resources, forest, land, wild animals and plants, and mineral
resources.
</P>
<P>
After the Forest Law went into effect, random cutting of trees
was put under control, and China's forestry industry witnessed
rapid development, he said. Over the past decade and more, the
coverage rate of China's forests has increased by one percent.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislature Passes Civil Air-defense Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Air-defense Law was
passed today by the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, China's top legislative body.
</P>
<P>
With a decree signed by President Jiang Zemin, the law will be
put into effect on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the section of general principles, the law states that it is
aimed at effective protection of people's lives and property in
case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The law, defining civil air-defense a component of national
defense, consists of 53 articles in nine chapters. It stipulates
that the priorities of civil air-defense should be cities and key
economic targets.
</P>
<P>
It also includes articles concerning civil air-defense
projects, tele-communications, alarming, dispersion, air-defense
organizing work, and education on civil air-defense.
</P>
<P>
Those violating the law will face punishment ranging from a fine
to criminal charges, the law says.

<TEXT>
<P>
Though considerable achievements have been made in the
country's legislation on environmental protection, China still has
a long way to go to improve its legal structure in this regard,
and to ensure full implementation of existing laws, Qu noted.
</P>
<P>
"China also needs to work out laws on controlling pollution
caused by toxic chemicals and radioactive materials," Qu said,
calling the problems directly hurting the health of people.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the number of laws on environmental
protection is expected to reach 20.
</P>
<P>
However, Qu said, the implementation of such laws is not
satisfying, as some people are not fully aware of the importance
of environmental protection, while supervision remains weak.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, the increase rate of pollution is slightly
higher than reduction, and natural resources need better
protection, Qu said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Qu quoted what he called great efforts the
country has made to ensure environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"We recently closed more than 49,000 enterprises across the
country which had caused severe pollution," he asked.
</P>
<P>
The director said his committee will continue to conduct
law-enforcement inspections around the country to look into
environmental protection problems, a routine-round of the
committee for the past four years.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Clash with Israeli Soldiers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers this
morning fired in the air and used tear gas to disperse
Palestinian stone-throwers outside the West Bank town of
Bethlehem, injuring at least four people.
</P>
<P>
According to a Palestinian source, the incident occurred
after the funeral of 11-year-old Palestinian boy Hilmi Shoushi,
who was beaten to death by a Jewish settler Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Media and Communication Center said that
thousands of Palestinians participated in the funeral held at
the Bethlehem cemetery, chanting anti-settler slogans, and vowing
to revenge.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Shoushi had apparently been throwing stones at
cars, when Nahum Korman, a security officer from Hadar Betar, a
Jewish settlement near Bethlehem, allegedly chased him and beat
him, according to Israeli media.
</P>
<P>
The boy was badly beaten and was rushed by an ambulance to
the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where he was pronounced
death early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Shoushi's body was later taken to the National Forensic
Institute for autopsy, where the doctors determined he died from
a blow to the left side of his neck.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police Sunday detained Korman, who reportedly at
first admitted hitting the boy, but later denied this and has
not been cooperating in his investigation. He is still being
held by the police for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian eyewitness said that Shoushi, who lived in the
village of Husan near Bethlehem, was on his way home Sunday when
Korman sped into the village in a four-wheel-drive vehicle,
stopped, and then chased the boy on foot.
</P>
<P>
They said Korman grabbed Shoushi, kicked him in the head
threw him to the ground, hit him with a gun butt and kicked him
again.
</P>
<P>
When village women saw that the boy was unconscious, they
grabbed Korman and demanded he take him to the hospital.
however, Korman called for an ambulance instead.

<HEADLINE> Bicycles Recommended as Everyday Transport Means </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian cities will need to
turn away from cars and towards bicycles early next century in the
face of a world gas and oil shortage, a conference in West
Australia was told today.
</P>
<P>
Brian Fleay, professor at University of Western Australia
Institute of Technology, told the conference that Australia will
need to reduce its oil consumption by 70 percent by 2025,
according to a press release from Perth, West Australia.
</P>
<P>
World consumption of oil and gas, Fleay said, was now at its
highest levels since 1979, and was continuing to rise at a rate of
about two percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
"The whole world has now been explored for oil and no new major
reserves have been found," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The range of recent estimates for ultimate world oil
production is 1.8 to 2.3 trillion barrels, which at current
extraction rates represents a peak in production between 2000 and
2010. Therefore, world production will halve about every 25
years," Fleay said.
</P>
<P>
As transport consumes 70 percent of fossil fuel consumption,
that was where the biggest change should be made, he said. As
major innovation and research were not required to encourage the
wide-spread use of bicycles, Fleay said, it was logical to turn
towards them as an everyday method of transport.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Assembly Speaker Rules Out In-House Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani National Assembly
Speaker Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani today ruled out the possibility of
an in-house change in the parliament in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters in the city of Sahiwal, Punjab Province,
Gilani said Pakistan's history has no record of such a change.
</P>
<P>
He urged the opposition and the government to end their
political confrontation as it is neither in their interest nor in
that of the Pakistani people.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have launched a wave of protests across
the country since the government introduced a new mini-budget last
Tuesday, which raised taxes and prices significantly.
</P>
<P>
Gilani said the opposition has the right to oppose and reject
government proposals, but it should protest within the Assembly
building instead of on the roads.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Jamaat-i-Islami party's sit-in before the
parliament on Monday, Gilani said the sit-in proved that the party
has recognized the existence of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said peaceful sit-in demonstrations are the right of every
political party in a democratic society but the government cannot
tolerate violence and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Accountability Bill, Gilani noted that its
approval requires a two-thirds majority, which is enjoyed by
neither the government nor the opposition in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"But if the National Assembly approves the bill, then no
corrupt parliamentarian or official could escape," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto reshuffled her
economic management in a bid to improve the worsening economic and
political situation in the country.

<HEADLINE> Independence Movement Stages Protest in French Island Colony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The ethnic Kanak independence
movement today staged a large demonstration in the French colony
of New Caledonia in the South Pacific, to protest at what it
called uncontrolled immigration from France to the island.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 people took to the streets of the capital Noumea,
according to the organizers, the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front (FLNKS) and the Union of Syndicates of Kanak
Workers and the Exploited (USTKE), Agence France Presse (AFP)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The USTKE also staged a 48-hour strike starting Monday to
protest the "hindrance of union rights" in two private enterprises
in Noumea.
</P>
<P>
Rock Wamytan, president of FLNKS, urged the French government
to let local communities take part in decision-making over
immigration to the island. He said that excessive immigration from
France has worsened employment for ethnic Kanak people.
</P>
<P>
Out of 3,000 Kanak youths who enter job market each year, only
1,000 can find jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are here in our own home, on this land of Kanaky. We
practice hospitality, we receive all those who come to live here
with us, but they should respect us," said Wamytan.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the French government of lying about the
situation of immigration to the island, saying that at least
10,000 people have arrived over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, however, the share of ethnic
Kanaks in the colony's overall population of 118,000 remained
stable between 1989 and 1996, varying from 44.8 percent to 44.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS, the second largest political group of the island
next to the anti-independence Rally for Caledonia in the Republic,
has been fighting for independence for the island from France for
more than a decade.

<HEADLINE> Talks Stuck on Israeli Intransigence: Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A top Palestinian peace
negotiator said today the last round of talks with Israel failed
due to the Israeli insistence on introducing amendments to the
already-signed agreement on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have categorically refused to change one
letter of the binding agreement, said head of the Palestinian
negotiating team Saeb Erekat in an interview with Sawt al Arab
radio of Egypt this morning.
</P>
<P>
"There are still many points of differences between the two
sides," he said, citing Israel's insistence on retaining the
right to hunt down suspects in Palestinian self-rule areas in
Hebron and determining the kind of arms the Palestinian police
should use.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of trying to tailor the agreement to suit
Jewish settlers who are tantamount to a time bomb that could
torpedo the peace march.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have not set a date for the resumption of the
talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
After three weeks of intensive negotiations, the Israelis and
Palestinians have settled differences on civilian matters in
Hebron, the last West Bank town occupied by Israel. But there
were several remaining gaps on security-related matters.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has blamed the
Palestinians for the delay in signing the Hebron agreement. On
Monday he described the number of remaining differences as "less
than a finger on a hand."
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross returned home Monday after the
failure to press Israel and Palestine to finalize a deal.
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort to finalize a deal Sunday night, Ross
held separate meetings with Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority
(PA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
However, no breakthrough was yielded and Arafat departed
Monday for Oslo, Norway, on a European tour.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should have redeployed its
troops from Hebron by late March, but it froze the plan after a
wave of suicide bombings by Islamic extremists killed 58 people
in the Jewish state.

TEHRAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali today today called on regional countries to redouble
their efforts to bring about peace negotiations among warring
factions in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, contained in a message given by the U.N. chief, was

a cease-fire and peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
His message was read out at the meeting by Francis Che Ocloe,
special envoy of the U.N. chief to the conference on the Afghan
issue.
</P>

<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed and
dozens hurt as high gales and driving rain lashed Britain overnight,
leaving a trail of destruction and causing travel chaos across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Two people died after their car was hit by a tree blown down in
heavy winds near Bradford in northern England on Monday and two
anglers in South Wales died after being swept out to sea over the
weekend, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Strong gusts, which reached up to 90 mph (145 kph), pulled down
power cables and left thousands of homes in darkness.
</P>
<P>
Around 40,000 people in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and
Hertfordshire were affected by the power failure. Computers at the
police control room in Wantage, Oxon, were left without power.
</P>
<P>
In Dorset, 13,000 people in Portland were cut off from the
outside world as the road from the town was flooded.
</P>
<P>
Police issued a flood warning after waves topped the sea
defenses at Chesil Beach.
</P>
<P>
Rail services in southern England were badly disrupted and the
line near Bournemouth had to be closed Monday night as a train hit
a tree.
</P>
<P>
Wales and Northern Ireland were also badly hit as roads,
bridges, rail and ferry connections were disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Several major bridges were closed to traffic. A smaller one
over the river Wey, south of London, collapsed into the water.
</P>
<P>
In the southern English town of Warminster, drivers were
confused after the gales blew traffic lights round the wrong way.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Made for Continued Macao GP After Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Efforts have been made to ensure
that the annual Macao Auto Grand Prix could be held successfully
after the handover of sovereignty to China in 1999, organizers of
the event said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have already taken steps to ensure the smooth transition of
the administration and running of the Macao Grant Prix, following
the handover of Macao to China in December 1999," Joao Manuel
Costa Antunes, chairman of the organizing committee, said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Among the efforts is the on-going training of some 300 local
volunteers to cover track and observer positions, with assistance
from the Portuguese Automobile Club, he said.
</P>
<P>
And for this year's 43rd Macao Grand Prix slated for November
14-17, Macao officials will also understudy key jobs to be ready
to assume all race control and administration functions by 1999.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the administrative changes, which also include the
appointment of local officials for key positions for the annual
race, is to make the Grand Prix totally self-sufficient by
1999. That would ensure the future of the race, the organizing
committee chief said.
</P>
<P>
Of this year's program are the 30th Macao Motor Cycle Grand
Prix, the 43rd Formula Three Grand Prix, the GUIA Race for 1-Liter
Super Touring Cars and some supporting races.
</P>
<P>
To be involved in the event are some 350 racers, 430 track
safety personnel, 140 firefighters and 12 fire engines, 800
journalists and 21 TV stations from some 145 mass media
organizations, according to the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
And some 70,000 spectators are expected, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Religious Party Demands Caretaker Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The chief of Pakistan's
religious party of Jamaat-i-Islami, Qazi Hussain Ahmed, today
reiterated his demand for the dismissal of the present government
and the formation of a caretaker administration.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Islamabad's twin city of Rawalpindi, Qazi
called for the establishment of a caretaker government composed of
people who "fulfill the criteria set in the constitution."
</P>
<P>
He said current parliament members do not fulfill the criteria
and therefore the sitting parliament "should be dissolved as it is
unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
Qazi added that his party's agitation was not meant to pave the
way for martial law or any extra-constitutional step.
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept government of any general rather we will
bring about Islamic revolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our struggle is aimed at establishing God's rule in the
country," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said Jamaat's protest movement would continue till what he
called the end of the oppression.
</P>
<P>
"Our movement is still going on and I direct my workers to hold
 processions everyday throughout the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that women activists of Jamaat-e-Islami would hold
a sit-in on November 11 at Faisal Mosque, the biggest Muslim
mosque in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Jamaat-i-Islami had planned to stage a sit-in demonstration in
front of the parliament house here last Sunday to protest against
inflation, corruption and government policies.
</P>
<P>
The government deployed thousands of police personnel and
rangers in and around the capital and set up check posts and
barriers at all roads leading toward Islamabad in a bid to prevent
Jamaat activists from entering the city.
</P>
<P>
After failing to bring people into Islamabad on Sunday, Jamaat
announced to continue its struggle on Monday until it succeeded in
staging a sit-in.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand Jamaat workers managed to get near the
parliament house here on Monday afternoon after numerous clashes
with the police. However, there was no report of major
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Qazi and another Jamaat leader were arrested Monday but were
released in the evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Senate Chairman and
Acting President Wasim Sajjad today ruled out the possibility of
dissolving the National Assembly in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen in Lahore, capital of Punjab province,
Sajjad said there were now no such circumstances under which he
could think about using powers to dissolve the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad became acting president according to the constitution,
as Pakistani President Farooq Leghari is currently on a visit to
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the powers of Acting President to
dissolve the National Assembly, Sajjad said, "I have seen a number
of comments on this issue in the newspapers but I would think
about it when there would be the situation."
</P>
<P>
However, Sajjad refused to comment on the question regarding an
opposition demand for fresh elections to solve the country's
problems.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about the situation in Islamabad due
to a sit-in protest staged by the opposition party Jamaat-e-Islami
(JI) in front of the Parliament House, Sajjad said a Senate
meeting went ahead as scheduled on Monday despite the protest.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani opposition has unleashed a new wave of protests
in the country recently against the government led by Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto.

<HEADLINE> Investors Ensured Chance in China's Farm Products Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural products
processing in China has ample room for foreign investment,
according to a report submitted by the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization to a seminar on China's industrial
development held in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
An official with the UN group said that farm products
processing has long been the most important industry of China, and
that vast potentials exist for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has placed priority on the development
of agriculture in its Ninth Five-Year Plan and encourages foreign
investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
A rising standard of living and greater desire for a more
varied diet will increase the demand for sugar, fruits,
vegetables, and beverages, a situation which requires substantial
foreign investment, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he said, China is likely to become the world's
largest beer market by the year 2000, posing a vast potential
market for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Though a leading producer of pork and poultry products, the
country needs foreign investment in this sector, too, because the
next dacade will see a sharp increase of consumption, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed in the report are the prospects for investment
in the sectors of textiles, leather-processing, footwear-making,
and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization and the Development Research Center of
China's State Council.

JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A South African flag
which whizzed around the Earth 142 times and travelled nearly 6
million kilometers aboard the United States space shuttle
Endeavor has been brought back home, a source here told Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
The flag, still sealed in its plastic space wrapping, was
presented to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki at a ceremony at the
Union Buildings in Pretoria last night by U.S. astronaut Winston
Scott.
</P>
<P>
It was launched into space on January 11 this year with Scott
and the American crew of Endeavor. Scott took the flag with him
at the request of the then Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology during his visit to South Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Mbeki said the gesture by a U.S.
astronaut to carry South Africa's national flag into space
signified the strong links between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said millions of South Africans had been excluded from
access to science and technology during the apartheid era, adding
that taking the flag into space had made the country part of the
modern world.
</P>
<P>
Scott said it was a privilege to take South African flag along
during his nine-day space mission.

<HEADLINE> China's Own "Internet" to Start Operation at Year-End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- "Infohighway Space," a powerful
information network with all interfaces in Chinese, will go into
operation in eight Chinese cities by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said the move indicates that this information
highway with Chinese characteristics will be accepted by an
increasing number of ordinary Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
China Infohighway Communications Co. Ltd., jointly launched by
a number of Chinese departments with a total investment of 80
million yuan, will provide Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen,
Fuzhou, Xi'an, Shenyang and Harbin residents such services as
network-based education, E-mail, an line stock market, games,
shopping opportunities, medical information and other information
services covering almost all aspects of daily life.
</P>
<P>
President Zhang Shuxin said that the company will develop
high-speed connection technology in order to link up more Chinese
families, schools, hospitals, offices and public facilities in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"Infohighway Space" is one of the country's few Chinese
interactive networks. Some 2.3 million connections were made over
the past year of trial operation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the much-publicized Internet is based on the
social values, culture, language and customs of the United States,
which sometimes run counter to Chinese culture and actual
conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to build an interactive
network with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, China had hooked up 6,000 computers and
40,000 subscribers with Internet through its six international
channels. And both figures are expected to hit 10,000 and 100,000
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Some 40,000 to 50,000 local networks and 60 million people in
150 countries and regions have hooked up with Internet as of the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Latest IBM figures show that about 100 million computers, one
million local networks and 500 million subscribers will be
connected to Internet in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Privatization of Copper Mines to Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The privatization of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) will bring in about two billion
U.S. Dollars new capital investments, according to the paper
Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper today quoted Chief Executive Valentine
Chitalu of Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) as saying that the
new investments will be channeled back to the various ZCCM mining
units.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government hopes to complete the first stage of
privatization of ZCCM by the end of next year through
transferring 80 percent of it into private hands and disposing
its own shares the following year.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM earns the country 80 percent of its foreign exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chitalu said that the essence of privatization is not
primarily to make money but to remove the inefficiencies
synonymous with state ownership.
</P>
<P>
''With a population of less than nine million, it is easy to
make a considerable improvement in the living standards with this
amount of investment,'' said Chitalu.

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces Framework for Resolving Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran today announced a three-
point framework for the settlement of Afghan crisis, stressing
that the prospective Afghan government should be broad-based and made
up of various ethnic and religious groups.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference here that the Iran's solution to the Afghan issue has the
following components:
</P>
<P>
-- The Afghan people and factions should decide on the future
of Afghanistan;
</P>
<P>
-- Other countries should not meddle in the international
affairs of Afghanistan;
</P>
<P>
-- The would-be government of Afghanistan should be broad-
based and made up of the various ethnic and religious
groups.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question raised by Xinhua, he said "this is
the framework of the Iranian government for the Afghan issue.
We want lasting solution to the conflict there."
</P>
<P>
"We believe countries with more influence over Afghanistan
should contribute to the negotiated settlement of the crisis
there and its reconstruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Velayati held the press conference on the sidelines of a
two-day Regional Conference on Afghanistan, which opened here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
He said "this gathering as of now does not have a proposed
solution. It is a consultative gathering. We can say what the
solution is after the conference."
</P>
<P>
Eight countries, along with three international organizations
including the U.N. and the European Union, participated the
conference. The eight countries are Iran, India, Russia, China,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia turned down the Iranian invitation
and did not participate the conference on the excuse of "shortage
of time and lack of clarity about the agenda and proposed list of
invitees."
</P>
<P>
However, Velayati said that the Iranian government sent the
invitation to them two months ago. He expressed his hope the
two countries would join in their efforts in the future.
</P>
<P>
English daily Tehran Times revealed today that Pakistan
refused to attend the conference because Iran had invited
India to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Iran also accused Pakistan and Saudi Arabia of backing the
militant Taliban group militarily and financially.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Iran Wang Shijie attended the conference
on behalf of Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.

<HEADLINE> Laws, Law Enforcement Checks Urged for Promoting Ethical Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese legislator said
today that China should speed up the legislation process needed to
complete a legal framework for the promotion of its ethical and
cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, law-enforcement inspections and other
supervisory efforts must be intensified to make sure that such
laws are correctly enforced, said Cai Cheng, member of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), the
country's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting of the ongoing session of the
NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"These efforts are necessary for the implementation of the
recent decision made by the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) on the promotion of ethical and cultural
progress," said Cai, who was former minister of justice and is
currently vice-chairman of the NPC Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said the request made at the start of this session by Qiao
Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, to carry forward the
spirit of the resolution in the work of people's congresses at all
levels, is also important and must be done earnestly.
</P>
<P>
The decision highlights the objectives of ethical and cultural
progress in the next 15 years, which include the marked
enhancement of the quality of all citizens, the quality of
cultural life, and level of urban and rural civilization, in
addition to "many major questions of concern among officials and
the people."
</P>
<P>
"All these objectives must be safeguarded by the law, and many
laws are needed to standardize the behavior of the public, and
prevent or halt illegal and criminal activities that violate the
country's ethical and cultural progress," Cai noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past 17 years of reform and opening up, the
NPC and its Standing Committee have formulated a series of laws on
the promotion in ethical and cultural progress, while at the same
time building a legal system for the establishment of a market
economic structure.

Law on Scientific and Technological Progress, the Copyrights Law,
the Law on Protecting Cultural Relics, the Mother-and-Child Health
Care Law, the Law on Protecting Rights and Interest of Women, the
Aged and the Handicapped, and other legislation such as the
decisions on severely punishing those smuggling, manufacturing,
trafficking and spreading pornographic materials, on prohibiting
prostitution, and on abducting or kidnapping women and children.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that the NPC and its Standing Committee have
made achievements in legislation relating to the country's ethical
and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Those laws have played an active role in promoting such progress
in society, according to the legislator.
</P>
<P>
But they are far from enough to meet the requirements set by the
decision, Cai pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"To resolutely wipe out the passive corruption practices in the
Party and government bodies and among the ranks of cadres," China
still needs a law on civil servants, a law on reporting
possessions of civil servants, and an anti-corruption law, Cai
said.
</P>
<P>
These would "put the manufacturing and spreading of cultural
garbage to a drastic halt," he added.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, China needs laws to oversee its press and the
motion picture industry, and many others laws on education,
science and technology and medical care have yet to be formulated,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is making progress in the implementation of
the laws, but lax law-enforcement still exists, and it is
difficult to implement some laws in certain areas or by particular
departments.
</P>
<P>
He said that the percentage of fiscal educational expenditure in
the country's GDP should rise gradually, and the growth rate of
educational appropriations should be higher than the growth rate
of fiscal revenue, as stipulated in the Education Law. But a
recent law enforcement inspection tour revealed that the opposite
is true in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Violations of this law will naturally adversely affect the
country's educational development, and affect the growth of a new
generation in the areas of morals and education, Cai argued.
</P>
<P>
"These violations are also against the spirit of the CPC
decision," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged the NPC Standing Committee to continue its
law-enforcement inspections and other supervisory activities to
ensure the legalities of the promotion of ethical and cultural
progress be fully observed, and to warn government departments
about any problems.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Permanent Secretariat Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The group of 15 developing
countries has established a permanent secretariat based in Geneva
to coordinate its activities, Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs Minister
Stan Mudenge said.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of a secretariat followed the
restructuring process of the grouping that had just been
completed.
</P>
<P>
''The g-15 will now have the means to build itself as a
group,'' said Mudenge on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming g-15 summit to be held in Harare from
November 3 to 5, he said discussions at the summit would include
a review of the g-15's objectives and role in the light of world
political and economic changes that have taken place since the
inception of the group, possible expansion of the group, ways of
further enhancing south-south cooperation and strengthening of
the south's position in dealing with the north.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the level of trade and cooperation among the
g-15, launched in Belgrade in 1989 to promote south-south
cooperation and improve dialogue with the developed nations of
the north, is still very low.
</P>
<P>
He said this is largely due to the fact that most g-15
countries are poor and lack resources and technical know-how.
</P>
<P>
It was reported at least five heads of state as well as three
vice-presidents and prime ministers have confirmed participation
at the summit.

<HEADLINE> Family Planning in Tanzania Gets Boost From UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) has released 3.6 billion Tanzania
Shillings (about 6 million U.S. Dollars) to Tanzania for
implementing family planning services in the country.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this at a press conference in the city on Monday,
UNFPA Executive Director Nafis Sadik said the donation was aimed
at reinforcing the national efforts in family planning programs.
</P>
<P>
She said the assistance followed the agreements reached at the
International Conference on Population and Development held in
Cairo in 1994 with regard to the world's population now exceeding
5.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
"Last year the world population grew by nearly 100 million,
the largest annual increase in history. What is untrue about that
statistics is that 95 percent of that growth occurred in the
poorest parts of the world," Sadik pointed out.
</P>
<P>
She said the funds would be used for the advocacy on proper
mobilization and allocation of resources taking into
consideration of an increased number of the rural women living in
abject poverty in the developing countries which have increased
by almost 50 percent over he last 20 years, to an awesome 565
million.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Refugees Safe: Mkapa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Safe custody will
continue to be provided to refugees from Burundi until peace and
democracy are restored in their country, President Benjamin Mkapa
declared at the Kanembwa refugee camp in Kibondo District,
Western Tanzania on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, in an address to
about 20,000 Burundi refugees at the refugee camp, the president,
who was on a four-day tour of Kigoma Region since last Saturday,
said the Tanzanian government will, in collaboration with
neighboring states, continue to work to find a permanent and just
solution to the Burundi problem.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of democracy and guarantee of the safety of life and
property of the people of Burundi will compel us to continue
putting economic sanctions against th country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa emphasized that Tanzania and neighboring states would
do all they can to ensure that the Burundi people achieve their
rights to live in peace and democracy in their own country.
</P>
<P>
"This is no longer the time to rule by the barrel of the gun,
but rather with clear consent of the people themselves. We shall
keep on the pressure until the military regime in Burundi opens
its eyes and ears," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Tanzanians must make an effort to cope with the
side effects of the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi so as
to ensure that democracy prevails in the crisis-ridden state.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa called on the refugees from Burundi who
recently entered the country to live in peace until the situation
allowed them to go back to their country.
</P>
<P>
At present there is about 300,000 Burundi refugees in
Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Launch First Communications Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to launch its first
telecommunications satellite by the turn of the century, a local
press report said today.
</P>
<P>
Formalities for the orbit path registration of the system,
which is to be submitted to the International Telecommunications
Union, have been completed by the Directorate General of Post and
Telecommunications (DGPT) and the Vietnam Telecommunication and
Post Corporation, the report quoted DGPT sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the project's feasibility study would not be
completed until mid-1997 because the collection of data on
satellite requirements from relevant ministries and agencies had
taken more time than originally predicted.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the system, including the installation of a
ground-control station, was estimated at 200-250 million U.S.
dollars, and the life expectancy of the satellite was from 12 to
15 years.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the system will help to reduce the country's
telecommunications and television broadcast charges.
</P>
<P>
At present, Vietnam is receiving world-wide information through
foreign satellites such as Intersat, Intersputnik and Asiasat.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure nation-wide coverage of its television
programs, Vietnam has to lease telecommunications systems from
Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia at high charges.
</P>
<P>
A number of international companies, including the Hughes
Corporation and Loral Space of the United States, Alcatel and
Matra Maconi of France, and NEC of Japan, had shown interest in
the project, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Likely to Announce Shadow Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The mainstream opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is planning to announce a
shadow cabinet shortly "in conformity with the parliamentary
system to ensure check and balance of government activities,"
reliable sources said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are already working as a shadow cabinet and a formal
announcement is under active consideration," BNP Secretary General
Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bhuiyan also warned that if the Awami League (AL) government
does not change its attitude towards the opposition, the BNP would
be forced to start agitation to oust the government for a mid-term
election.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the BNP was not being allowed to function as
a responsible opposition because of the partisan outlook of the
parliament speaker and obstruction from the treasury bench in
discussing various national issues.
</P>
<P>
"While in power, we wanted to make parliament into the center
of all national activities. Now being in the opposition, we wanted
to see the parliament as nerve-center. But unfortunately, we were
deprived of playing our desired role as a responsible opposition,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Internet Craze in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Just five years ago, few South
Koreans knew anything about the Internet. Now they are finding
themselves surfing the global network, which provides a sea of
information.
</P>
<P>
The number of computers connected to the Internet has reached
36,000, a ninefold increase over last year, with the country's
major companies and universities capitalizing on the Net to
promote their image or products.
</P>
<P>
The Internet went into operation here when a network was set up
between Seoul National University and the Korean Institution for
Electric Technology in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Ten years elapsed before individuals with personal computers
were permitted to surf the network in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet domains now stands at 1,754 in South
Korea, according to the National Computerization Agency. It has
been grewing at an annual rate of 300 percent from 1990, one of
the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Companies subscribing to the Internet grew four times to 355
over last year. They are taking advantage of the Net to enhance
their corporate image, promote their products and recruit
employees.
</P>
<P>
Almost all South Korean universities have opened pages on the
World Wide Web. Internet cafes have become popular places among
the young Netizens.
</P>
<P>
Government policy and news media campaigns to foster an
information society have created an Internet boom.
</P>
<P>
In particular, leading news media in South Korea have
spearheaded the Internet craze. The media campaigns have made
people who do not know anything about the Internet feel left
behind.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by an Internet news provider
last July, 38 percent of the Web users are college students,
followed by science researchers with 17.8 percent, engineers with
16 percent and office workers with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
One out of every four respondents said that they click on to
the Net for news, 19.3 percent are searching the Web for academic
purpose and 19.3 percent for various purposes.
</P>
<P>
The performance of South Korean network companies is brisk as
interest in the Internet grows fast.
</P>
<P>
Currently, nine computer networks, including Hitel, Chollian
and Now Nuri, are offering indirect Internet service through their
local PC communication networks, while 12 other networks are
making direct on-line connections for surfers to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The major local communication networks -- Dacom, Korea Telecom
and Nowcom -- are scrambling to take initiatives in Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local subsidiaries of such foreign companies as IBM,
Hewlett Packard and Elex Corporation are expanding their Internet
business in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Internet dates back to 1969 when the Defense Department of
the United States linked four research laboratories to exchange
information. Through the 1970s and the 1980s, the network linked
U.S. university computers and personal computers as well.
</P>
<P>
One estimate puts the number of Netizens in the world at 40
million. Some experts predict it will reach 60 million in 1997.

<HEADLINE> US Court Summons Nepali Minister on Fraud Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A United States district
court has summoned Nepali Agriculture Minister Padma Sundar Lawati
on charges of breaching a fertilizer import contract with an
American company, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
A summon notice addressing Lawati from the US district court in
Washington DC was received Sunday by the agriculture ministry
here, the Kathmandu Post daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the notice, signed by a court clerk,
asked the minister to appear before the court on November 25, 1996
to answer the fraud charges by the American fertilizer supplier.
</P>
<P>
The company has complained to the court that it had been
defamed and financially damaged as Lawati suspended a contract
with it on the supply of 50,000 tons of chemical fertilizer a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, similar summon letters from the same US court were
received by Agriculture Secretary Dah Bahadur Shahi and General
Manager of the state-run Agriculture Input Corporation (AIC)
Tshering Sherpa, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Shahi, the AIC, which is under the Agriculture
Ministry, earlier awarded the contract to the American company but
canceled it later as the company failed to produce any proof of
credibility and supply the fertilizer in the given time.
</P>
<P>
The case is the first lodged at a foreign court regarding a
fertilizer deal in Nepal, where profitable fertilizer imports are
always sensitive issues with corruption charges against senior
officials and businessmen involved in these deals heard every
year.
</P>
<P>
The American company has also filed a case at the Nepali
supreme court here charging the AIC and the ministry with
breaching contract and claiming a loss of nearly half million
dollars in the case, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Early this month the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of
Authority (CIAA) -- Nepal's anti-corruption body -- accused Lawati
of being involved in a fertilizer deal scandal, alleging that he
canceled an earlier fertilizer contract and awarded it to another
supplier by taking heavy kickbacks.

<HEADLINE> Alatas: Indonesia Did Not Request Ban on Horta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said Jakarta had nothing to do with Manila's decision to
bar East Timorese separatist leader Jose Ramos Horta from entering
the Philippines during the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum meeting.
</P>
<P>
"You know that it was a decision taken by the Philippines
government themselves," Alatas told local press here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, Alatas welcomed Manila's decision.
</P>
<P>
Manila recently said "national security" was why it was barring
Horta from entering the Philippines during the APEC meeting which
will be attended by Indonesian President Soeharto and 17 other
heads of government.
</P>
<P>
The leaders' meeting is scheduled for November 25, after
ministerial and senior officials' meetings.
</P>
<P>
APEC is an economic forum which comprises Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Singapore,
South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Horta, who shared the Nobel peace prize this year with Roman
Catholic Bishop Carlos Pilipe Ximenes Belo, was previously
reported to have received an invitation from a leftist
organization to attend a human rights conference in Manila
coinciding with the annual APEC leaders' meeting.

<HEADLINE> EU to Retaliate Against U.S. Anti-Cuba Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union foreign
ministers decided today to make it illegal for Europeans to obey
the U.S. Helms-Burton Act, which was to enforce the U.S. economic
embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The measure lets European countersue to recoup damages assessed
in U.S. courts under the anti-Cuba law.
</P>
<P>
"Equipped with this weapon of self-defense, we will be much
better able to get a genuine negotiation from a fair and balanced
position," said EU Foreign Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan in
Luxemburg.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said
in response that it is inappropriate for the Europeans to
retaliate.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act allows lawsuits to be filed in U.S. courts
against foreign firms that own or operate properties seized by
Cuba from U.S. citizens who were Cuban nationals before the 1959.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Clinton ordered the sanctions to come into force but
delayed implementation for six months because of the alliance's
threat of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The law also allows denial of visas to shareholders and
officers of foreign firms operating these properties in Cuba. The
provision has already been used to punish a Canadian mining
company and a Mexican telecommunications firm. But it was also
backfired.

<HEADLINE> Goats Bring Wealth to Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Raising goats has proved to be
a solution to poverty in the Xiangxi Tujia-Miao Autonomous
Prefecture in central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Over 300,000 hectares of grassy hills there was not tapped in
the past, said Xiang Shilin, head of the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
So in 1994, the prefectural government set up a development
company and invested more than nine million yuan (about 1.1
million US dollars) to aid goat raising in the area.
</P>
<P>
It also sent more than 100 professionals to the countryside to
teach farmers techniques for successful goat raising.
</P>
<P>
It established 40 goat purchase centers in the region and six
information and sales offices in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Fuzhou and
other cities, Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
Goat raising, now a leading industry, has helped a group of
farmers in the prefecture overcome poverty. The prefecture
currently has more than 100 households that specialize in raising
goats. One household can earn nearly 100,000 yuan (about 12,100 US
dollars) from the undertaking.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that there will be more than one million goats
in the prefecture by the end of this year, which will bring an
income of nearly 100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars) to
local farmers.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Unpaid Blood Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China is calling on more
citizens to donate blood free of charge to relieve the gap between
the supply and demand, and to boost people's humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
"Free blood donation, which is conducive to the state and the
people, has been accepted by more and more people and become a
voluntary act," said Sun Baiqiu, vice-chairwoman of the Red Cross
Society of China.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the country's public health and blood
transfusion programs, many blood donation centers have been set
up, according to Sun, who is also honorary board chairwoman of the
China Association of Blood Transfusion.
</P>
<P>
She said that the State Council, China's highest governing body,
is drafting a law on the introduction of a free blood donation
system, which is expected to be submitted to the country's top
legislature for examination.
</P>
<P>
It has been a tradition in China that blood is collected through
free donations. Other people contribute through compulsory
donations and selling blood, but the quality of this blood cannot
be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Sun Baiqiu called on all sectors of society to pay attention to
protecting the quality of blood.
</P>
<P>
Some cities are succeeding in encouraging people to donate blood
free of charge, she said.
</P>
<P>
In Benxi, in northeast China's Liaoning Province, the number of
free blood donors accounts for over 60 percent of those donating.
</P>
<P>
"Free blood donation has become a new social trend among the
citizens here," said Li Yongzhi, director of the city's Red Cross
Blood Center.
</P>
<P>
The center has issued several slogans to the citizens: "Blood
donation is love, courage, dedication, and care." "Blood donation
is the duty of every healthy citizen of the right age." "Blood
donation is an important indicator to assess a society's
civilization."
</P>
<P>
Many other cities have launched successful promotional campaigns
to encourage blood donors, according to sources with the China
Association of Blood Transfusion.
</P>
<P>
In a ten-day campaign to promote blood donation in the Guangdong
Provincial capital of Guangzhou this May, 3,579 people gave blood,
and nearly 300 did so for free.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, 40 percent of the blood used in clinical treatment
comes from free donors.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, nearly 80,000 people took part in
blood donation each year in Dalian; 17,000 took no payment.
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months of the year, more than 2,400
people in Tai'an, Shandong Province, made free donations.
</P>
<P>
"Free blood donation should be the way out for China's blood
program," Sun Baiqiu said, adding that only in this way can the
quality of blood be ensured.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese garment
enterprise Monday set up a foundation to aid young music
conductors from the Central Conservatory of Music (CCM), according
to today's "China Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Pine Group, a suit-manufacturing giant in Ningbo, in east
China's Zhejiang Province, contributed three million yuan for
scholarships and funds for buying or upgrading musical
instruments.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Yonggang, president of the Pine Group, said that the new
or improved instruments can help the CCM educate more world-known
Chinese music conductors, such as former students Chen Zhuohuang,
Hu Yongyan and Shao En, who are now professional conductors.
</P>

The CCM established China's only department of music conducting
in 1956. At present, many famous Chinese music conductors such as
Huang Lifei, Zheng Xiaoying, Yang Hongnian and Xu Xin are teaching
in the department. In addition, a number of foreign music masters
such as Seizi Ozawa have given lectures there.

MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) threatened to abandon the upcoming peace talks if
government troops continue its assaults against the MILF members
in southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, vice chairman for military affairs of the MILF,
was quoted today by local press as saying that the military should
halt all offensives in Basilan province before the government-MILF
peace talks start. Otherwise, the MILF will call off the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine armed forces, however, said on Monday that it
would continue its military offensives in Basilan until the
situation in the area returns to normal.

Military reports said earlier that at least 50 MILF rebels have
been killed and a main camp of the MILF has been totally razed to
the ground after bombardment by air force gunships.

affairs Jafaar Ghaizali to lay down rules for future peace talks
was canceled last Friday.
</P>

But Torres was still very confident that a comprehensive
ceasefire agreement would be signed by the government and the MILF

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market fell
to a seven-month low on Monday in its biggest one-day loss this
year due to a deluge of sell orders triggered by weak earnings of
market frontliners, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index reportedly
nose-dived 110.44 points or 3.7 percent to 2,852.16, its lowest
since March this year. All sectors, except for mining, were down
with losers beating gainers, 100 to 26.
</P>
<P>
The turnover at the close was 2.97 billion pesos (113 million
US dollars) with a total of 6,933,781,441 shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the index tumbled as poor corporate earnings of
some blue chips continued to affect investor's sentiments, with
some of them heavily pulling out from the battered market.
</P>
<P>
The index was expected to suffer further losses before going on
technical corrections in the next few days, the analysts said,
adding that no positive news and development were expected that
could bring investors' confidence back.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Colombia is expected
to register a 2.5 percent economic growth this year, much lower
than the 4.9 percent forecast by the authorities, the country's
National Association of Financial Institutions (ANIF) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
One of the signs of economic sluggishness is the increase of
unemployment rate, which rose to 12.1 percent in September
compared with the 8.7 percent for the same month last year,
the ANIF said.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction will drop 11 percent this year while
commerce will increase by 0.8 percent, industry 0.4 percent and
agriculture - excluding coffee - 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sectors that will show better performance will be mining,
with a growth of 8 percent, infrastructure with 13.5 percent,
government services 7.6 percent and livestock breeding 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Insecurity, violence, transportation strikes which have forced
work stoppages, increased inventories and postponed shipments have
contributed to the slow growth of the economy.

previous games which put them atop the six-nation tournament.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Kuwait that was forced to the corners to win
the game, was all the way for the attacks although their attempts
in the first half was eithered denied by Qatar's keeper Younes
Ahmed or the post.
</P>
<P>
The Qataris only woke up in the second half and started to
unleash their own attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, it was substitute Bashar Abdullah who scored the first
for Kuwait in the 70th minute.
</P>
<P>
As the Qataris were eager to level the scoreboard, their back
court was left exposed, and forward Hamad Al Saleh stole the
opportunity in a swift counterattack to put Kuwait 2-0 six minutes
after the first goal.
</P>
<P>
As time running out, the Qataris were all out for attacks and
Mohammed Salem Al-Enizi found the target with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
In the last game, hosts Oman was held 1-1 by Bahrain. Bahrain
scored first through Mohammed Saleh in the 59th and Oman equalized
seven minutes later through striker Saif Al Habseey.

<HEADLINE> Further Expansion of Indonesian-German Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
called on German businessmen to increase their contribution to the
further expansion of Indonesian-German relations, especially in
the fields of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the improvement of our own life depends on
what we ourselves do about it. But we also realize that if we want
to be more successful, we must open ourselves up and cooperate
with other nations, the advanced countries," the president said
during a state dinner in honor of visiting German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl last night.
</P>
<P>
"Germany has been playing an active role in providing economic
help to Indonesia through, among other things, the former IGGI
(inter-governmental group of Indonesia) and currently the CGI
(consultative group of Indonesia) as well as sale of ships,"
Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was therefore inviting German businessmen to increase
their investment in the country, especially in the infrastructure
sector which was currently being developed on a greater scale, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from bilateral relations, the president also touched on
the assistance Germany had given to member countries of the
non-aligned movement (NAM).
</P>
<P>
"We hail the presence of Germany as a NAM guest. We hope
Germany will play an active role in NAM's efforts to develop
economic cooperation, to cope with environmental problems and to
solve debts of the under-developed countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kohl, who arrived here October 26, on the occasion
stressed the importance of enhancing bilateral relations,
especially in the economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that cooperation between the two countries has
so far been running well but there were actually more
opportunities to further develop their bilateral economic and
trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who is on a four-day state visit, is accompanied by his
economic minister, post and telecommunications minister,
technology and research minister and a delegation of over 70
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto and Kohl held 90-minute talks Monday morning, during
which they discussed various bilateral and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who spent Saturday and Sunday fishing with his host in
waters off the exclusive Bira island north of Jakarta, is
scheduled to leave for the Philippines this morning before
traveling on to Japan.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- An official with the
International Coffee Organization said that the coffee crisis
resulted from depressed prices will be overcome in two years at
the most.
</P>
<P>
"We are now reaching the end of the crisis. Just a little more
patience is needed," said Celsius Lodder, director of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic and I see good expectations for the growing of
coffee within this period," Lodder was quoted by today's "La

</P>
<P>
The coffee crisis stemmed from the collapse of the pact on
international quotas in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Lodder urged coffee-growing countries to look for new markets
in such areas as the Pacific rim, Russia and the East European
countries rather than fighting over shares of those already
established.

<HEADLINE> US Says There Is No Setback for Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said today that Yasser Arafat's departure to Europe and Dennis
Ross' return to Washington did not mean a setback for the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and predicted a deal would be
reached on redeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said U.S. envoy Ross,
who was returning to Washington today, was likely to go back to
the Middle East in some days to resume mediation.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed suggestions that Palestinian leader Arafat
stalled the talks by embarking today on a Europe tour.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wrong, and I think it's also just not consistent
with the facts to point at Chairman Arafat and say: `He's the guy
holding these talks up' or `had he stayed, these talks would have
succeeded today or tomorrow.'"
</P>
<P>
The departure of Arafat and Ross followed President Bill
Clinton's telephone call Sunday to Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging them to clinch an agreement on
the key issue of the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said talks would continue at a lower level until
the Palestinian leader returns from his Europe tour, which began
with a visit to Norway.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the Clinton administration confidently predicted an
accord would be reached within a month.
</P>
<P>
"There will be an agreement. We are confident of that," he said
after he talked to Secretary of State Warren Christopher and
telephoned Ross. "It may take a week or two or three or four more
weeks to get to the next step, which is a complete agreement."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President: Bosnian Peace Depends on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
said today that further stabilization in Bosnia and in its two
entities depended on peace which in turn depended on the pace of
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"A balanced development and an equal treatment of Republika
Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation in allocating funds for
economic recovery are basic and decisive prerequisites for
rebuilding trust and co-existence between the entities," Lilic
said in Sremska Mitrovica in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia's
northern province of Vojvodina.
</P>
<P>
The international community has allocated 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars for Bosnian reconstruction, but so far little sum of
financial aid has been sent to Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Lilic told the local executives that there would have been no
Republika Srpska "if it had not been for the policy of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic reached the Dayton peace
agreement in Ohio, the U.S., last November and then signed it in
Paris a month later on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of lasting peace demanded also a speedy
settlement of refugee problems, he said. More than 2 million
Bosnian people have become refugees or displaced persons, about
700,000 of whom have found shelter in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia urged a faster creation of conditions for a free and
safe return of all refugees to their homes, if they wished to
return, or a free choice of a place to live and compensation for
property destroyed or taken away by force, he said.

<HEADLINE> Krajisnik Meets With UN, Russian Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb
representative in the three-man presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik,
held separate talks today with U.N. special envoy Iqbal Riza and
Russian Defense Secretary Yuri Baturin.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held in the Serb administrative center of Pale,
15 kilometers away from the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, the
Tanjug news agency reported from Pale.
</P>
<P>
After the talks with Krajisnik, Riza told reporters he had
discussed the preservation of peace after the withdrawal of the
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The 55,000-strong multinational troops in Bosnia will end their
one-year mission on December 20. Some of the NATO-led peace troops
have started withdrawing from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"We also discussed preparations for a meeting on the future of
Bosnia, due to be held in Paris and London," said Riza.
</P>
<P>
A Paris conference on Bosnian reconstruction will be held in
Paris in mid-November, which is followed by the London conference
early December to discuss next year's peace process in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Riza said a final decision will be made on the modality and
mandate of the new multinational force after the Paris meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Krajisnik told reporters after talks with Baturin
that Russia wished to play an active political and military role
in preserving peace in Bosnia and its two entities -- Republika
Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Baturin said Krajisnik had informed him on the holding of a
constituent session of the Republika Srpska assembly and on the
political situation in the entity.

<HEADLINE> Rival Kurdish Factions to Hold Talks in Ankara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that its peace broker will preside over a reconciliation meeting
in Ankara Wednesday between the two rival Kurdish factions of
northern Iraq to distance them from the influence of Iraq and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between representatives of Massoud Barzani's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) will be chaired by U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau and representatives of the
Turkish and British governments, said State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
He said that the talks are aimed at convincing the KDP and PUK
to maintain their cease-fire in northern Iraq, which was agreed on
last week, and to "agree to some kind of process where they
resolve the political problems between them, which are
considerable."
</P>
<P>
Such a mechanism has "the added advantage of maintaining a
distance between Iraq and Iran from the situation in northern
Iraq," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Burns played down reports that Barzani and Talabani had held
contacts with the Iranian and Iraqi governments following the
U.S.-brokered cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that Mr. Talabani has been in touch with the
Iranians and that Mr. Barzani has been in touch with the
Iraqis," he said. "But I think you should ... look at who is
meeting in Ankara on Wednesday to understand who is really
influential in northern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The Ankara talks were arranged following separate meetings
Pelletreau held in Turkey last week with Barzani and Talabani.

<HEADLINE> US President Boosts His Credit for Deficit Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
boosted today that he has steered the budget deficit to its lowest
level since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning for his re-election in Minnesota, he said, "We got
some new good news about exactly how far the deficit has dropped
since I took office."
</P>
<P>
With the help of two students, Clinton literally unveiled a
huge chart with a graph at a rally, showing the deficit had
dropped to 107.3 billion dollars in the fiscal year that ended
September 30.
</P>
<P>
"The deficit was a ball and chain holding back our economy," he
said. "You don't have to listen to the shouting. You can look at
the showing."
</P>
<P>
But Republicans also asserted that they were responsible for
bringing the deficit down.
</P>
<P>
"This is a huge credit to the common sense Republican Congress
which fought for spending constraints," Republican Party chairman
Haley Barbour said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration disagreed. "The spending reduction
since the Republican majority's been in place has been relatively
modest compared to the overall total, although we have been able
to work with them in the last year on a mutually acceptable
budget," said White House budget director Frank Raines.
</P>
<P>
Budget experts, however, said credit for the four-year string
of deficit reductions needed to be shared by Clinton and former
President George Bush who backed an earlier 1990 budget deal.
</P>
<P>
But Raines acknowledged that the budget deficit of the U.S.
government is expected to climb in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The drop of the budget deficit was another bit of upbeat
economic news that has bedeviled Republican presidential candidate
Bob Dole's drive to unseat Clinton. With unemployment at a seven
and a half year low and the economy adding 10.5 million jobs over
the last four years, Dole has not been able to stir the economic
anxieties that Clinton exploited four years ago.

<HEADLINE> Jewell Criticizes FBI, Media for His Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Richard Jewell, who was
cleared of suspicion in the Atlanta bombing, today criticized the
FBI and news media for watching his every move following the
Atlanta bombing in July, and his lawyers intend to sue the news
media.
</P>
<P>
"I felt like a hunted animal, followed constantly, waiting to
be killed," Jewell said in a 15-minute speech to journalists in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Jewell was named the only suspect three days after the bomb
blast on July 27 at Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta,
which claimed two lives and injured more than 100.
</P>
<P>
He was working as a private security guard near the park when
he spotted a suspicious green knapsack at a crowded outdoor
concert. He alerted police and helped clear people from the
area before a pipe bomb in the pack detonated. For this, Jewell
had been hailed as a hero before he became a suspect.
</P>
<P>
He was finally cleared of suspicion Saturday when the Justice
Department issued a letter saying he was no longer a target of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) bomb investigation.
</P>
<P>
In his statement today, Jewell criticized the FBI investigation
of him and the U.S. news media coverage. "In their mad rush to
fulfill their own personal agendas, the FBI and the media almost
destroyed me and my mother," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Jewell told reporters that lawsuits would be filed
against some media for linking Jewell to the bombing and defaming
his character.
</P>
<P>
"We have already announced, definitely, that we will be suing
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. We've also announced that we
will be suing NBC and Tom Brokaw," lawyer Wayne Grant said.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution first reported that Jewell was
a suspect without identifying its sources. The story was quickly
spread by other news organizations.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Remodeling in Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Exchange
now is weighing a plan to keep its current location but
significantly expand the trading area, while closing one of the
most famous intersections.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the century-old
stock exchange is working on blueprints which are for erecting a
new building that will extend across Broad Street in lower
Manhattan from the exchange's 11 Wall Street address. The new
building will be effectively eliminating vehicle passage on Broad
Street, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The exchange has been exploring an expansion or relocation for
months.
</P>
<P>
The proposed structure, equal to an eight-story building,
features a glass atrium and is expected to cost 100 million U.S.
dollars or more. It will house a 20,000-square-foot trading floor.
Plans also call for the trading floor to be remodeled, putting it
on par with the technology planned for the facility.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the exchange's board has been briefed on the
proposal but hasn't been asked to approve it.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that the exchange is presenting this
new concept to the municipal government. It is believed that the
exchange hasn't yet chosen a developer.
</P>
<P>
There have been several proposals for creating new facilities
for the New York Stock Exchange, including a more expensive one
which suggests a complete new building several blocks away,
extending into the East River.
</P>
<P>
The exchange's current trading floor, which spans 36,000 feet,
has to pack an estimated 3,300 people.
</P>
<P>
Much of the exchange's growth has come from companies outside
the U.S. entering this market. That business is so important
that the exchange may begin trading in multiple currencies. It
is also considering the possibility of expanding trading hours
past the 4 p.m. closing bell in the eastern district, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Oxi Day Marked in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece celebrated the Oxi Day
(in Greek "oxi" means "no") today with a large military parade in
the northern town of Salonika in the presence of President Kostis
Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
On October 28, 1940, the Italian ambassador to Greece met the
then Greek Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas and asked for passage of
the Italian forces through Greece.
</P>
<P>
"Oxi," replied Metaxas, "I will not allow your forces to cross
through Greece."
</P>
<P>
The rejection of Benito Mussolini's ultimatum to surrender
marked Greece' entry into World War II against fascist Italy.
</P>
<P>
The military parade in Salonika was also attended by Defense
Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos, who represented Prime Minister
Costas Simitis, opposition party leaders and the leadership of the
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The parade was capped off by the appearance of four
ultra-modern apache helicopter gunships, recently acquired by the
Hellenic army.
</P>
<P>
In a message marking the Oxi Day, Simitis said the message of
October 28 is a message of unity, consensus and faith in defending
the integrity of the nation against whatever design.
</P>
<P>
"And this will always be the message of Greece in every
direction, at the same time with our persistent action to
safeguard peace and stability in the region and to develop
relations of friendship and cooperation with all our neighbors,"
the premier added.

<HEADLINE> Former ANC Member to Form Independent Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A former South African
deputy minister said today he will form a new political party if
he loses a court battle for his re-admission to the ruling
African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, General Bantu Holomisa said
should he lose his case, he will launch his own political
organization to contest the 1999 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The former deputy minister for tourism and environment accused
the government of President Nelson Mandela of failing to address
the needs of ordinary South Africans.
</P>
<P>
He said government officials and politicians are living in
luxury while the majority of the black people in South Africa are
still suffering.
</P>
<P>
The general was the former ruler of the Transkei Black
Homeland during the apartheid era, and was a member of ANC's top
policy-making body, the National Executive Committee. He was
expelled from the ANC for allegedly putting the party in
disrespect.
</P>
<P>
His expulsion resulted in losing his post as deputy minister
and member of the national parliament.
</P>
<P>
He began a court battle against his expulsion this week to seek a
judicial review of the ANC's disciplinary steps against him.

region alone."

deployments in the Gulf region would be made in February and
March.

<P>
ALMA ATA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev and visiting Pakistani President Ahmad Khan Leghari
today called for a peaceful settlement to the civil war in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents, in a press conference after their meeting,
urged the warring factions in Afghanistan to come to a ceasefire
agreement through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's population of 17 million has known nothing but
war for the last 18 years. The country's mountains and valleys are
littered with landmines which have already killed or maimed some
400,000 Afghans.
</P>
<P>
There has been no apparent progress in ceasefire efforts
between government troops and the Islamist Taliban movement,
while battles north of the capital Kabul between the two sides
have intensified over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia movement was born in religious schools in
Pakistan two years ago and has taken over much of Afghanistan
during its two-year war against government forces. The militia's
recent capture of Kabul gave its control of some three-quarters of
Afghanistan.

JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Flanders
today agreed to strengthen bilateral ties in fields ranging from
education to sports.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by South African Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad and visiting Minister-President of Flanders
Luc Van Den Brande.
</P>
<P>
A treaty to this effect also provided for the establishment of

<P>
Brande is in the country on a week-long official visit.
Flanders is a federated state of the Kingdom of Belgium.

<P>
In terms of the treaty, contact and cooperation between the
two sides would be encouraged in education, arts, culture,
science, technology and sports.
</P>
<P>
Brande told the press that his country intended to raise an
annual grant to South Africa from 5.5 million U.S. Dollars to 6.5
million U.S. Dollars a year. It would run until 1999.

<HEADLINE> ICAC Projects Record World Cotton Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- World cotton use is rising
to a record 18.9 million tons in 1996/97, and further growth is
expected in 1997/98, predicted the International Cotton Advisory
Committee(ICAC) today.
</P>
<P>
A monthly update report from the Washington-based committee
said consumption is rising the fastest in cotton producing
countries, including India, the USA, Turkey and Mexico. An
encouraging sign for future increases in cotton use is that
consumption is rising this season in Central Europe and Russia,
regions which saw substantial declines in textile activity in past
years.
</P>
<P>
World cotton production is estimated at some 19 million tons in
1996/97, one million tons less that last season as a result of a
reduction in harvested area.
</P>
<P>
The largest decline is occrring in China because of more
emphasis on grain production this season. Production in Pakistan
is being affected by disease and pests while cool weather in
Uzbekistan is reducing this season's average yield, the report
said. Increases in production are occurring in the U.S. and India.
</P>
<P>
Due to changes in production and reduced imports by China, the
report predicted, the pattern of world trade in cotton is
shifting. The share of world exports accounted for by the USA and
Uzbekistan are falling, but Francophone Africa, Australia and
India are likely to go up in export volumes and trade shares.
</P>
<P>
The International Cotton Advisory Committee is an association
of 40 governments of cotton producing and consuming countries.

<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The new council of All-China
Journalists' Association pledged today that in fulfilling the
tasks entrusted by the Party and people in the next five years,
Chinese journalists will adhere to Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and earnestly
implement the Party's basic line and policies, "with a high degree
of political responsibility and strong committment to work."
</P>
<P>
Shao Huaze, newly elected president of the association, made
the pledge in a work report delivered to the first meeting of its
fifth council here today.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Shao said, the association has adhered
to the Party's principles, worked in keeping with the Party
central committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, and strengthened
ties with journalists nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Also, the association has strived to improve the general
quality of the press, with great efforts to build up a contingent
of journalists with good political judgement, work style and
professional proficiency.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the organization worked to have achieved
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, while
pushing for exchanges and co-operation with the foreign press.
</P>
<P>
For the next five years, he said, the association faces a
glorious yet arduous task, as the nation is entering the critical
stage of developing the socialist market economy and completing
the second-phase of its modernization program, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Journalists Association Draws Up Work Plan  (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shao Huaze said the association should continue to implement
regulations on prohibiting journalists from taking money for
favors, and the Principles of Professional Ethics for Chinese
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the association is scheduled to develop a
reporting mechanism that will help handle reports and complaints
about journalists who have violated laws or regulations, including
those on accepting money for doing news stories as a favor.
</P>
<P>
Based on the "One China, Two Systems" principle, and the
guidelines of basic laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region and the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's
Republic of China, he said that his association is certain to
strengthen exchanges and co-operation with the press in Hong Kong
and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Under the "One China" principle, the association hopes to play
a positive role in increasing its co-operation with the media
circles in Taiwan and, in the next five years, it is scheduled to
enhance its international exchange activities, in a move to give
Chinese journalists greater and easier access to the outside world
and to get journalists from overseas to know more about China,
Shao said.

The association should get media people to study Party General
Secretary Jiang Zemin's speeches made during his visit to the
People's Daily and People's Liberation Army Daily and put the
guidelines of the speeches into practice, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
There must be no ambiguity about the crucial principles, such
as the Party leadership over the media, the press's Party Spirit,
and the role of the media as mouthpiece of the Party and the
people, and the work ethics, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the association should increase its capabilities
to distinguish between theoretical and political right's and
wrong's, promote the press's adherence to the correct orientation
while advancing media reforms in China, and continue to develop a
socialist journalistic theory with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Members of the media should generally have a strong sense of
political responsibility, obey discipline, and have a rather high
professional calibre, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In any case, he added, it should be pointed out that some
people in the media, especially young members, lack a systematic
study of Marxist theory, have little knowledge of the Party's
history and traditions, including its tradition in media work,
lack training in difficult conditions at the grassroot level, and
have a tendency to be foppish and chase comfort to varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
The main way to strengthen the ranks of people in the press is
to improve the ideological and political quality of the media
workers, he said.

<HEADLINE> Survey Projects Low Election Turnout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Voter turnout could be very
low for the U.S. presidential election on November 5, pulled down
by public apathy and the belief President Bill Clinton has a lock
on a second term, a survey by Louis Harris and Associates said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The poll said possibly fewer than 55 percent of the country's
eligible voters will go out and cast ballots this year, based on
comparisons to voter interest in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The study said of 943 voters questioned between October 17 and
October 20 only 53 percent qualify as very likely voters, compared
to 58 percent who fit into that category in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It said that nearly half of likely voters said it doesn't
matter to their families whether President Clinton or Republican
nominee Rober Dole is elected.
</P>
<P>
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Bridge Opens Linking Bosnia's East-West Rail Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, Oct 28 (Xinhua) -- A bridge repaired by Nato-led
Implementation Force (IFOR) opened on Monday, making ready for
service soon the railway across northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Bosansko Petrovo Selo rail bridge was in the middle of
railway linking Tuzla in the Muslim-Croat federation and Doboj in
the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
With the re-opening of the bridge, the railway from Zagreb to
Belgrade through northern Bosnian cities of Banja Luka, Doboj,
Tuzla and Zvornik will actually be in service when continued
repair and replacement works are completed by early December, an
IFOR statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This line can produce a robust military line of communication
for IFOR, now and into the winter...and provides a useful powerful
tool for civil and commercial opening up of the country (of
Bosnia)," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The project to repair Bosnia's east-west rail line cost Nato
3.32 million DEM and involved military engineers from Romania,
Hungary and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Bosansko Petrovo Selo bridge, IFOR engineers have
also repaired another bridge on the same rail line across the
River Una which is the border line dividing Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The three and half years of war have heavily damaged the
railway network throughout bosnia. There are only rail services
within the Muslim-Croat federation or the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
It still remain unclear whether the civilian and commercial
trains will be running across the inter-entity boundaries to make
full use of the IFOR repaired railway.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Albania to Hold Talks on Gold Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A high-level Albanian delegation
will hold talks with British Foreign Office officials on Tuesday
to discuss the issue of the Albanian gold held at the Bank of
England since being recovered from the Nazis during the World War
II.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian delegation, headed by Albanian central bank
governor Kristaq Luniku, is due to arrive later today in London
and the 18 million U.S. dollar-worth of gold will be high on the
agenda at the talks with British government officials.
</P>
<P>
The British government has recently expressed confidence that
the gold would be returned to Albania soon and a government
official is quoted as saying earlier today, "We're extremely
hopeful of concluding the Albanian gold question".
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the talks with Albanian officials on
Tuesday would be on "technical issues" covering the eventual
transfer of the gold to Albania from the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the gold is controlled by a tripartite
commission set up by three of the wartime Allies, Britain, France
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The British government agreed in May 1992 to return the gold
and as part of the deal, Albania agreed to pay compensation of
about two million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Cairo Building Collapse Rises to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the collapse
of an apartment building in Cairo Sunday rose to eight today,
while preliminary investigation indicates the tragedy was caused
by renovation work.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the latest toll number, Minister of Health and
Population Ismail Sallam said 19 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Police today arrested Wissa Ibrahim, owner of the building,
Ahmad Riyadh, engineering consultant, and Ashraf al-Bukhari,
executive engineer.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rescuers are still fumbling through the rubble for
more survivors of the ill-fated 12-storey building nearly 24
hours after it collapsed in Heliopolis, northeastern Cairo around
16:30 hours GMT Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An official source at the rescue operation headquarters said
sounds can still be heard from under the rubble, indicating there
could be more survivors.
</P>
<P>
Some engineers suspected that the tragedy was caused by
amendments to the basic columns of the building in recent
renovation work.
</P>
<P>
Moqbil Shafie, Chairman of the Armed Forces' Engineering
Department said today that something must have been done that
affects one of the underpinning pillars to cause the building
collapse.
</P>
<P>
This view is confirmed by the fact that only the front part of
the building had fallen while the back section remains standing,
the senior army officer said.
</P>
<P>
The building only got a construction license for a ground and
seven other storeys in 1969 and the owner secured an approval to
add another storey in 1977. But he added extra five storeys.
</P>
<P>
He was fined 121,000 Egyptian pounds (34,571 U.S. dollars) in
1979 and asked to remove the unlicensed storeys in 1993 but he
has failed to put the order into force.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Cairo Omar Abdel Akher also ruled out the
possibility that an act of sabotage could be behind the tragedy.

jails" in Britain, which would release inmates committing minor
non-violent crimes during the week but would keep them locked up
at weekends, is being seriously examined to solve overcrowding in
prisons.
</P>
<P>
Richard Tilt, Director-General of the Prison Service, made the
announcement Sunday, saying that the idea is being backed by
prison governors and is being put forward by Chris Scott, the
chairman of the Prison Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
"Prisons are full. We cannot take any more prisoners. Weekend
prison is an attractive proposition for society. At least it would
mean prisoners could retail their jobs and spend at least some
time in prison," Tilt said.
</P>
<P>
The current prison population in Britain is 57,633, which is
very close to limit of the Prison Service's capacity at the
moment, and is rising by about 1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that plans for providing more accommodation
were under way, and some 7,000 extra places were under
construction and would be delivered over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eighteen prefabricated buildings have been bought to
provide 720 emergency prison places.

<P>
MAPUTO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has granted 10,000
litres of pesticide to its east neighbour Mozambique to help
the latter combat the invading red locusts, the official
Mozambique Information Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will also send two planes to spray the pesticide over
the central and norethern parts of Mozambique, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The report of assistance from Zimbabwe came after the appeal
by Mozambique to the international community for help, when
large swarms of red locusts are spreading in the central

<HEADLINE> Israel Shows Flexibility on Golan Heights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- In a sign of flexibility on
easing tension with Syria, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai indicated today his government was open to partial
withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, Mordechai said the current government had not
put forward objection to some sort of withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
The minister, joined the meeting with senior Israeli
intelligence officials, again denied the allegation that Syria
intended to attack Israel despite the recent tension.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting mainly discussed the current crisis in the
Israeli-Syrian relations, which has fueled speculation about a
possible military attack on Israel by Syrian troops.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the upcoming massive Syrian military exercises
near the Golan Heights, Mordechai said they were common at the
time of the year. But he added that Israeli troops were prepared
for any eventuality while trying to avoid deterioration of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
"We have no interest in confrontation with Syria unless we are
threatened," he said, adding Israel would keep vigilance
especially when the November U.S. general election was
approaching.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, tension along the Israeli-Syrian border
increased since Syrian redeployment of troops near the Golan
Heights. And both sides have conducted large-scale military
exercises.
</P>
<P>
Binyamin Netanyahu's Likud government has vowed that it would
never relinquish Israel's self-claimed sovereignty over the Golan
Heights, which the country seized from Syria in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government has repeatedly called for resumption
of peace talks with Syria "without prior conditions," while Syria
insists that Israel must agree to full withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.

<HEADLINE> PC Makers Enter Battle with Network Computer Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturers of personal
computers and their rivals of network computers (NC) have stepped
up their competition as high-tech companies take sides.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the USA Today on Monday, the software
giant Microsoft reveals its plan to make PCs cheaper and easier to
use -- a move competitors say is designed to thwart the ambition
of network computers, low-cost devices that do many of the same
tasks as higher-priced PCs.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft is trying to gain the support of its allies like
Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computers, who have a deep
involvement in the PC.
</P>
<P>
The Sun Microsystems will unveils its NC for corporate users
Tuesday which is regarded as the "birth of a new ear in
computing", according to a department head of the company.
</P>
<P>
Other companies involved in NC such as Oracle and Netscape
Communications will also announce an alliance in which Netscape
products will be bundled with NCs based on an Oracle operating
system, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the NC was just a concept that most of the industry
dismissed. But the mood has changed, and even PC companies like
IBM and Compaq have committed to NC-like products under 1,000 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The driving force for NC is largely the lower costs. NCs do not
have local storage or much memory. And they won't require much
training. A NC user just import software applications from the
Internet -- or an internal corporate network, when it is needed.
</P>
<P>
Market researcher International Data predicts that 2.5
million NCs will be sold by 2000 as against 100 million PCs.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano today discussed with visiting South African Archbishop
Desmond Tutu on regional issues in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chissano briefed Tutu on Mozambique's economic situation which
he said recovered areas of increasing agricultural production,
stable prices, controlled inflation rate and enhanced export.
</P>
<P>
On Zambia's political impasse caused by a constitutional rule
against former president Kenneth Kaunda's presidential campaign,
Chissano expressed the hope that President Frederick Chiluba and
Kaunda would find a way out through negotiation to narrow their
differences on the general elections scheduled for November 18.
</P>
<P>
On the Angolan peace process, Chissano said he was
disappointed with the former rebel movement, the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which he said had
failed to implement the Lusaka peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Tutu, who was in the Angolan capital attending the two-day
conference of the Africa-Europa Institute from Saturday to
Sunday, said Zambia's economic recovery was a "miracle".
</P>
<P>
The archbishop, who is to wind up his Maputo tour later today,
also thanked Mozambique for its support of the struggle
against the former South African apartheid rule.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Accuses France of Rescuing Hutu Killers in 1994 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu today accused France of helping Hutu killers flee the
country in 1994 when France staged the "Turquoise" operation to
evacuate some 1.1 million Hutu refugees from Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Bizimungu as saying today
in Kigali that Rwanda does not approve any intervention by France
in eastern Zaire's Kivu region to stop the escalating fighting
between Zairean troops and the Banyamulenge militias.
</P>
<P>
"They would not intervene for saving the people victimized by
an ethnic cleansing in Masisi (in Kivu region). They have not
protested when the Banyamulenges are endangered. I don't see what
could justify their intervention," he said.
</P>
<P>
France is considering to evacuate its nationals and those of
other European countries, as well as the staff of U.N.
humanitarian groups, from eastern Zaire, but has not yet suggested
the use of its military force stationed in Africa to stop the
fighting there.
</P>
<P>
French troops intervened in southwest Rwanda in 1994 after more
than half a million Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed
by Hutu army and militias, many of whom fled the country after
being defeated by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Army.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda said that Zairean troops are trying to eliminate the
ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge people, who have lived in eastern
Zaire's mountainous region for decades.
</P>
<P>
"If they (French troops) intervene, I would compare their
intervention with the operation Turquoise launched under the cover
of humanitarian operation, which in fact allowed them to rescue
the killers," said the Rwandan president.
</P>
<P>
About half a million Hutu refugees were forced to flee their
camps in the past one week by fightings in eastern Zaire, and some
humanitarian groups have accused Rwanda of joining the attacks
upon the refugee camps in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda today also rejected the call by France to hold a central
African sub-regional international conference to negotiate a
political solution to the conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
About 800 Rwandan refugees and 2,500-3,000 Zairean refugees
crossed the border into Rwanda from Zaire in the past few days to
avoid being caught in the fightings, said international
humanitarian sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union today sent an envoy, Italian
diplomat Aldo Ajello, to the central African Great Lake region --
where Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi are located -- in an attempt to
find a political solution to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Exports Amount to 10.1 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran's exports amounted to 10.1
billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this Iranian calendar
year starting from March 20, 1996, an Iranian central bank
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports totaled 7.59 billion dollars in the same
period, thus creating a trade surplus of 2.5 billion dollars in
foreign trade, said Mohsen Nourbakhsh, Governor of the Central
Bank of Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the export of non-oil commodities earned the
country 1.4 billion dollars and the figure is expected to reach 3
billion dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank chief predicted that Iran's foreign exchange
reserves would increase by 2 billion dollars by the year-end.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Iran absorbed 1 billion dollars of foreign
investment, he said, adding that this year's figure would not be
less than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's foreign debts dropped from 22.56 billion
dollars last year to 20.37 billion dollars by September 21 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Nourbakhsh predicted that Iran's economy would grow at a rate
of 5.5 percent at the end of the year as against 4.5 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money deposited by people in banks in the first
five months of this year increased by 7.7 percent to reach 81,053
billion rials (about 27 billion dollars), the bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The price index of goods and services showed a 27 percent
rise on average in the first half of this year, compared to the
53.6 percent in the same 1995 period, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Iran's inflation rate would be
halved to 24 percent by the year-end compared with last year.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Creation of Fine Economic Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese representative
here today urged the international community, particularly the
developed countries, to carry out their commitments in areas of
resources, debt, trade and technology so as to create a favorable
external economic environment for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second (Economic and Financial Affairs)
Committee of the U.N. General Assembly, Wang Qun, the deputy
representative of the Chinese delegation, said that helping the
developing countries remove obstacles to their development
conforms with the interests of the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"When global economic integration is accelerating, there would
be no long-term prosperity in the developed countries and the
world as a whole without sustained and steady development in the
developing countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that six years ago, the United Nations adopted the
Declaration on International Economic Cooperation, in particular
the Revitalization of Economic Growth and Development of the
Developing Countries and the International Development Strategy
for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade.
</P>
<P>
However, the deep-rooted problems confronting many developing
countries in their efforts for healthy and sustained economic
development remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the North and South continues to widen. The
economic situation in African and the least developed countries is
particularly grim with the trend of their being marginalized
further growing, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to latest U.N. statistics, the per capita income of
over 100 countries with a total population of 1.6 billion is lower
than what it was 15 years ago. The impoverished population in the
world rose from one billion in 1990 to 1.3 billion in 1995 and
continues to increase by an average of 25 million every year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This situation shows that the implementation of the Declaration
and Strategy is far from satisfactory in the past years whereas
the inequitable international economic relations, unfavorable
external economic environment and stagnant international
development cooperation are the major factors that impede the
effective implementation of the Declaration and Strategy and
economic growth in the developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that economic development, social development and
environmental protection complement one another and none should be
slighted while healthy and sustained economic growth is the
foundation and engine of sustainable development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Warns of Major Human Tragedy in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) on Monday warned that a major human tragedy
is in the making in eastern Zaire given that the situation there
has deteriorated further in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the actual fighting, intolerance and terror
resulting from undisciplined behavior on the part of those
bearing weapons are giving rise to "the worst fears" for the
Zairian civilian population and the hundreds of thousands of
refugees in the Kivu province of Zaire, the ICRC said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the humanitarian organizations have withdrawn from
South Kivu due to security concerns, the Red Cross said there is
now no way of knowing what is happening to the Zairian civilians
and the refugees there.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC, which was forced to suspend its activities in Uvira
on October 22, withdrew on Monday its last two delegates from
Bukavu, where they were trying to bring medical aid to the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
"Security conditions in the town have degenerated to the point
where any movement is extremely dangerous," the ICRC said.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, several hospitals have been attacked and
looted in Bukavu, Red Cross vehicles have been stolen and
humanitarian workers harassed.
</P>
<P>
Near Goma, where seven Red Cross delegates are still working,
the ICRC has managed to distribute emergency aid to some 12,000
Zairians who fled their villages to escape the recent days'
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in Goma which are treating casualties received
medicines and other medical supplies on Sunday. The ICRC also
delivered assistance to the dispensary in Mugunga, where more than
150,000 refugees from the Kibumba camp have now arrived.

<HEADLINE> Russian Preier to Visit Chechnya Shortly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin is planing to visit Chechnya soon for meeting with
the separatist leaders of the breakaway local republic over
further Chechen settlement, a Russian government official said
today.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be named, told reporters here
that Chernomyrdin and the Chechen separatist leaders are likely to
discuss a wide range of problems including a draft federal law on
the creation of a free economic zone in Chechnya and on ways of
running the republic's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Russian premier's forthcoming visit was discussed during
his talks earlier today with Russian Security Council secretary
Ivan Rybkin, said the official who participated in the talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Ekho Moskvy radio on the same day,
Rybkin stressed that Chernomyrdin's direct involvement has become
necessary at the present stage of the Chechen settlement.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin, who returned to Moscow on Sunday evening after his
talks with Chechen separatist leaders including the number two
man, Aslan Maskhadov, in the Ingush city of Nazran not far from
Chechnya, noted that the talks were fruitful.
</P>
<P>
In his words, the sides reaffirmed during the talks their
readiness to continue the cause of settling the Chechen crisis by
peaceful means. The talks, which were held at Ingush President
Ruslan Aushev's country residence located 13 kilometers from
Nazran, touched on the withdrawal of troops, exchange of
prisoners, and continuation of the dialogue, Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin also told the Ekho Moskvy radio that he had handed a
draft law on the creation of a free economic zone in Chechnya and
a draft resolution by the Russian lawmakers on the procedure of
granting amnesty to the participants in the Chechen conflict and
proposals on implementing this resolution over to the separatist
leaders.
</P>
<P>
He also said he agreed with the Chechen separatists' decision
to hold presidential elections in the local republic on January
27, 1997. "A constituent member of the Russian Federation has the
right to hold elections at any time necessary for it," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, "Chechen territory should be demilitarized" prior to
the elections, he said adding that "this is the key demand."
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed national security chief praised his
predecessor Alexander Lebed for his efforts to settle the Chechen
crisis, but criticized him for his handling of personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
As to the fate of Doku Zavgayev, head of the Moscow-backed
Chechen government, Rybkin said the mandate given to him in the
1995 elections should be preserved until January 1997 when new
presidential elections in Chechnya are due to be held.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin noted that "Zvgayev's further fate will be decided at
the elections."

<HEADLINE> Bank of Canada Cuts Key Rate by Another 0.25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada today cut its
key rate by another quarter of a percentage point, this time to
3.5 percent from 3.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the central bank's move, big commercial banks
here announced a cut to their prime rates.
</P>
<P>
The prime rates, charged by these banks to their preferred
clients, will fall to 5.0 percent from the current 5.25 percent
effective Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Today's rate cuts had been expected last week, when they were
delayed by the strike at General Motors and the work-stoppage in
Canada's largest city of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The key rate of the Bank of Canada stands now at its lowest
point since the summer of 1963, and the bank prime rates are at
their lowest levels in more than 40 years. The lowest ever prime
rates were 4.5 percent during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada hopes that the interest rate cuts, which are
the 10th this year, will help to stimulate a sluggish domestic
economy.
</P>
<P>
Although Canada's interests rates are close to bottoming out,
there could be a couple of more cuts by the end of this year,
analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> African Women Leaders Condemn Violence Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- African women ministers
and parliamentarians today condemned violence and violation of
human rights against women and children in the continent, saying
they hamper economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
In their resolutions adopted at the end of a four-day
conference in Dar es Salaam this evening, African women leaders
said that preventive diplomacy would check the spread of violence
and armed conflicts in the continent.
</P>
<P>
They called upon all African women to stand up unanimously for
peace on the continent and send high-powered delegations to
countries afflicted by the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Women leaders urged the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
involve African women in all actions related to conflict
prevention, resolution, reconciliation and tolerance through
education, training and community actions.
</P>
<P>
They demanded the international community and the UN system,
particularly UNFPA, UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR and WFP, pay due
attention to the situation of women and children in Rwanda,
Burundi, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Uganda, Sudan, Somalia and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Declaration appealed to African countries to
allocate more resources for population and reproductive health
programs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the declaration recommended the holding of the
future regional conference every two years to enable the
effective implementation of previously adopted documents.
</P>
<P>
It proposed the setting up of a regional secretariat to assist
the national networks of women ministers and parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing of the conference, UN Population Fund
(UNFPA) Executive Director Nafis Sadik said that increased
funding for development efforts was essential to a prosperous
future for Africa.
</P>
<P>
She told participants that last year, UNFPA spent 74 million
U.S. Dollars in regular resources for African programs, and nine
million Dollars in multi-bilateral funding.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Tanzania,
Philip Marmo, also delivered a speech to the conference, saying
African women should make media a major tool in women
empowerment.

</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today by the spokesman for U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the secretary-general
chaired a meeting of the Administrative Committee on Coordination
(ACC) on October 25 and 26, which brought together the executive
heads of all the 25 U.N. specialized agencies, including the U.N.
Food and Agricultural Organization, the World Health Organization,
the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the United
Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the ACC reviewed the direction of ongoing
reform processes in the various organizations and their
implications for the strengthening of the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
The ACC participants emphasized that the ultimate aim of the
U.N.'s reform should not be cost-cutting for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
The ACC considered that executive heads, led by the
secretary-general, had a collective responsibility to contribute
to charting directions of the reform process, and defined the
elements of a broad system-wide program to this end.
</P>
<P>
Executive heads reaffirmed their individual and collective
commitment to pursue and deepen the reform effort.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President: Nation's Priority, Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
said today that the most important thing for the country was to
recover the economy and raise the living standard of the people.
</P>
<P>
Following the lifting of the international sanctions against
Yugoslavia on October 1, preconditions had been created for the
priority task at this time -- a higher living standard of Yugoslav
citizens, Lilic said in Sid, a town in Serbia's northern Vojvodina
province.
</P>
<P>
The four-year international trade embargo has crippled the
Yugoslav economy, reduced the per capita income by half compared
with 1989 and forced 50 percent of the work force out of
employment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local officials and business leaders, the president
said there were "many reasons to look forward to a better future."
</P>
<P>
After the lifting of the sanctions and the creation of good
conditions for business operations, Yugoslav businessmen would be
able to communicate normally with the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
"With the correct policy in the past period, Yugoslavia has
managed to preserve what is most important in this country --
people, production, know-how, knowledge," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We know what Yugoslavia will be -- it will be strong,
harmonious, and economically developed, and an equal and respected
partner in the international community. That is our objective, our
task, and our obligation toward future generations," the Yugoslav
president added.

<HEADLINE> East African Economies on Sound Footing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The current reforms in
monetary policy management being undertaken by east African
countries have substantially reduced inflation while boosting
business confidence.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed in a weekend communique issued in Arusha,
northern Tanzania, by the east African central bank governors
after a one-day formal annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the governors resolved to steer their
monetary policies to achieve and maintain a stable single digit
inflation not to exceed five percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rates within east African countries for the past
three years has been fluctuating. In Uganda, for example, the
inflation rate was 3.4 percent in 1994 and 1995 and, by June
1996, it reached 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya and Tanzania, the situation has been worse. In 1995,
Tanzania saw a 26.7 percent inflation rate and, by September this
year, the rate is projected to drop to 18.8 percent, still 3.8
higher than the target of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is next to Uganda with a low rate recorded as by
December 1995 at 6.9 percent. But the figure is projected to rise
up to 8.6 percent by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the Gross Domyestic Product (GDP), the governors
said Uganda was fairly well as in the year 1994/95, when the
country had a growth of 10.6 percent. However, its growth is
expected to decline during the 1995/96 period to 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Tanzania had growths of 4.9 percent and 4.5 percent
espectively. It is anticipated that Kenya will witness a rise up
to a six percent while Tanzania to five percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank governors noted that the east African economies are
in a better position for take-off. "We therefore urge governments
and business community to seize these opportunities to put your
economies on a sound footing and improving living standrds," they
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Credit for Deficit Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today took credit for the smallest budget deficit since 1981,
saying that "we have more evidence today that our economy is on
the right track."
</P>
<P>
Opening a campaign trip through three Midwestern states,
Clinton said that the deficit for the fiscal year that ended
September 30 was 107.3 billion dollars. The White House said the
drop was due largely to a stronger economy than the administration
had projected.
</P>
<P>
"So today, Missouri, you don't have to listen to the shouting.
You can look at the showing," media reports quoted Clinton as
saying at city hall in University City, a suburb of St. Louis,
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said it was their efforts that had brought the
deficit down.
</P>
<P>
"This is a huge credit to the common sense Republican Congress
which fought for spending constraints," party chairman Haley
Barbour said.
</P>
<P>
With the deficit falling four years in a row, the
administration said Clinton has more than fulfilled his promise to
slash the deficit by half in four years.
</P>
<P>
The deficit reduction was one item on Clinton's four-point
sales pitch as he woos voters from the Washington suburbs to
politically vital Pennsylvania and the Midwest in the final days
of the campaign against Republican nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Clinton told a crowd in Nashville, Tennessee, that
the nation would be better off with the targeted tax cut he has
proposed because his plan would not cause the deficit to climb
again.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's four-point agenda also includes education, safe
communities and welfare.
</P>
<P>
In Nashville, he called the welfare law he signed last August
"a good thing" that will succeed only if private sector companies
hire people as they come off the public assistance rolls.
</P>
<P>
Before traveling to Tennessee, Clinton addressed a rally in
northern Virginia, which last supported a Democrat for president
in 1964, when Lyndon Johnson won in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to campaign later in Minnesota, Illinois,
Ohio and Pennsylvania before going back to the White House Tuesday
evening. He is campaigning non-stop until the November 5 election.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Minister Criticizes Israeli Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Foreign
Affairs Amr Moussa today said the new Israeli leadership's
seriousness towards the Middle East peace process is now in
question.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 10th session of the Egyptian-European Union
Cooperation Council in Luxembourg, Moussa said the Middle East
peace process has gone through a critical stage since the
beginning of this year and particularly following the May
election of the Israeli right-wing government.
</P>
<P>
It took onerous efforts over the past few years to convince
the Arab public opinion that Israel is serious over achieving
just peace, and therefore, it should be accepted as a regional
partner, reports reaching here quoted Moussa as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, five years passed, hard-earned peace initiatives are
now at stake, said the Egyptian top diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The present Israeli policy has called into question the
ability of the Binyamin Netanyahu's cabinet to respect official
commitments, basic principles and requirements necessary for a
peaceful settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
On EU-Egyptian cooperation, he said the frank and
comprehensive exchange of views between the two sides should be
facilitated before a partnership deal can be reached within the
framework of the larger EU-Mediterranean cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Moussa today had a flurry of talks with senior European
officials, including the foreign ministers of the Netherlands,
Germany, Spain and Portugal, the European agricultural
commissioner, the European Commission chief and his deputy.
</P>
<P>
The meetings covered ways to enhance the European role in the
Middle East peace process and EU-Egyptian cooperation in various
domains.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Leader Launches Peace Crusade </HEADLINE>

<P>
LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chairwoman of the Liberian
ruling council of state, Ruth Perry, today launched a peace
crusade that is expected to take her all over the war-torn
country, a local report said today.
</P>
<P>
"Peace now, peace for Liberia", as the campaign is named, will
be conducted among Liberians both at home and abroad, said Perry.

"It will continue "until we put an end to this war and usher
in democratic rule and peace in our country," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of our forefathers, I am asking all of you not
only to talk about peace, not only to believe in peace, but to
take urgent and speedy actions to work at acheiving peace," Perry
appealed.
</P>
<P>
"The yearning of peace can no longer be ignored, and
generations yet unborn will not forgive us for failure to attain
peace in our time," she said.
</P>
<P>
The chairwoman called on faction leaders to support the crusade and
provide security as she travelled through the country.

<HEADLINE> Hans Blix Calls for Expanded Use of Nuclear Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Hans Blix, director
general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, today called
for an expanded use of nuclear power in efforts to achieve
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the General Assembly, Blix said the reason for
the call is that the fossil fuels are at the top of the scale of
energy sources contributing greenhouse gases while nuclear power
and renewable sources of energy contribute the least greenhouse
gases emissions.
</P>
<P>
"There should now be a general awareness among governments that
an expanded use of nuclear power and of renewable sources of
energy together with conservation measures could significantly
help to restrain greenhouse gas emissions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that this has not yet led to a common
conclusion at the global level and that only a few governments --
Japan, the Republic of Korea, China and in Eastern Europe --
expressly refer to environmental concerns in explaining their
expanded use of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
Safety in nuclear power operation and safety in nuclear
disposal and illicit trafficking in nuclear materials are the
common concern of governments in expanding use of nuclear energy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In this aspect, he said the development of conventions relevant
to nuclear safety and other legal instruments and standards,
together with a variety of international services and assistance
programs and heightened national attention to nuclear safety can
help establish an international nuclear safety culture.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals For Urgent Donation to Aid Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The heads of three U.N.
humanitarian agencies issued a joint appeal today for urgent
contributions to the current United Nations Humanitarian Program
for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian situation throughout Iraq is dismal and, with
the onset of winter, will become critical for tens of thousands of
women, children and other Iraqis, who already are living below the
the poverty level, according to Yasushi Akashi, U.N.
under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative effects of war, economic sanctions,
hyper-inflation, unemployment and this year's 30 percent drop in
crop production are starting to exact a terrible humanitarian
toll, especially among women and children.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of the women, children and the old are
receiving less than 50 percent of their caloric needs.
Malnutrition, particularly among children under five, has become
rampant. In the north, the effects of the recent conflict have
further worsened the situation.
</P>
<P>
Akashi noted that donor countries have contributed only 1.6
million dollars to the 39.9 million dollar appeal that the U.N.
issued on September 27 to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs
in Iraq through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian program is a transitional measure that will be
re-examined or superseded with the implementation of Security
Council resolution 986, known as the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Akashi, Carol Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF (the United
Nations Children's Fund), and Catherine Bertini, executive
director of the U.N. World Food Program, also urged all donors to
respond quickly and generously to the urgent humanitarian
situation throughout Iraq.
