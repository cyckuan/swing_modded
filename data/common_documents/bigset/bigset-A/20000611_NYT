   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   &UR; DREAMLAND &LR;  By Kevin Baker. HarperTorch, $6.99. Set in lower
Manhattan and Coney Island circa 1910, this wild novel is a stew of
real-life and fictional gangsters, Tammany pols, labor reformers
and carnival performers, all deployed in a sprawling plot that
begins with the ill-advised rescue of a midget by a gangster named
Kid Twist. ```Dreamland' is historical fiction at its most
entertaining,'' Thomas Mallon said in The New York Times Book
Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANNALS OF THE FORMER WORLD &LR;  By John McPhee. Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, $18. This Pulitzer Prize-winning opus about North America's
rockscape pulls together the author's four previous books on
geological history (focusing on the continent's dramatic eastern
and western extremes) and a new essay on the Midwest. The result is
an orderly march through deep time, exposing a lode of science and
digressions. In 1998 the reviewer David Quammen found McPhee an
overly cautious tour guide, but said, ``There are gemlike
sentences, richly rhythmic paragraphs, nicely burnished
synecdoches, metaphors as pungent as wasabi and, behind those
felicities, vast amounts of painstaking research.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO'S IRISH? Stories &LR;  By Gish Jen. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
The helter-skelter of the American immigrant experience is the
subject of these tales, most of which revolve around cross-cultural
skirmishes between an older generation of Chinese and their more
assimilated children. ``Jen's gift is for comedy that resonates,
and sadnesses that arise with perfect timing from absurdities,''
Jean Thompson wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AN ACTOR AND HIS TIME &LR;  By John Gielgud with John Miller and
John Powell. Applause, $16.95. In his modest memoir, the British
actor, who died last month at 96, reveals his passion for the
theatrical life while offering breezy portraits of T.S. Eliot,
Edith Evans, Marlon Brando and others in his varied and eccentric
supporting cast. ``He recounts his past with the same urbanity and
sensitivity that have characterized his art,'' Frank Rich wrote in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BREATH AND SHADOWS &LR;  By Ella Leffland. Ballantine, $14. At the
core of this melancholic novel about three generations of a
well-to-do Danish clan is the question of what we lose in a
lifetime, and what we leave behind to prove we existed. The result
is ``an exquisite and moving family saga,'' Brooks Hansen wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LUSTRE OF OUR COUNTRY: The American Experience of Religious
Freedom &LR;  By John T. Noonan Jr. University of California, $17.95. A
federal judge chronicles America's pursuit of religious freedom and
the difficulties of reconciling faith and politics. In 1998 the
reviewer Richard Wightman Fox called this a ``very enlightening
tour through a complex legal and religious history.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRUTH COMES IN BLOWS: A Memoir &LR;  By Ted Solotaroff. Norton,
$13.95. An editor and critic recalls his difficult childhood in

DRUG WOES LAID AT PRI'S FEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A report by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration lays out
the key features of Mexico's multibillion-dollar drug trade with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It cites the rugged, difficult-to-patrol 2000-mile border, vast
isolated areas ideal for growing illicit crops and ``powerful
organized criminal groups that exploit weaknesses in (Mexico's)
law-enforcement and judicial systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three major candidates in the Mexican presidential
race that culminates with the July 2 election has addressed the
issue of vulnerability more directly than the diplomatically worded
DEA declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates acknowledge that their country faces an enormous
problem with corruption and among government officials who have
sold themselves to drug traffickers and seldom been called to
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be successful in the battle against corruption and
impunity, we have to change the attitude of public servants and
citizens,'' declared Francisco Labastida, candidate of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   Labastida asserts a righteous determination to root out
corruption. But as a lifelong member of the PRI who has held
positions in several administrations, Labastida's professed zeal
for reform has made him the target of mocking criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can this plague be eradicated by the same system that has
governed us for 70 years, a system that in the last two decades has
let the problem grow worse by covering up for and even working with
the traffickers?'' demands Vicente Fox, candidate of the
conservative National Action Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
   During a nationally televised debate last month, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, the candidate of the leftist Party of the Democratic
Revolution, offered an even more cutting assessment of Labastida's
anti-corruption credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI equals corruption, and corruption equals the PRI,''
Cardenas claimed.
</P>
<P>
   North of the border, officials from the DEA and other federal
agencies tread softly around the topic even as they privately
acknowledge their frustration that corruption penetrates all levels
of Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that a change in the hierarchy would necessarily
have much of a trickle-down effect, because some of the problems
are so entrenched at the local level,'' said one government
official in Arizona who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Like many law-enforcement officials on both sides of the border,
the official said the ultimate solution lies in curbing the
American appetite that every year sucks billions of dollars' worth
of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroine and marijuana across the
border into the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of the leading newspaper in the state of Sonora,
which shares the international border with Arizona, says Mexico
would be able to mount a more credible offensive against the
narcotraficantes if the PRI is tossed out of the presidency next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be a much better chance of reducing the problem
with a new government,'' said Jose Santiago Healy, publisher of El
Imparcial, which has endorsed Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency of American officials to be suspicious of their
Mexican counterparts has even reached Labastida, who from 1987 to
1993 was governor of Sinaloa, one of the states where drug
traffickers have been most active.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Washington Times cited a secret CIA report claiming
that Labastida collaborated with the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, who was Mexico's Interior Minister at the time,
angrily denied the report. He said a top aide was assassinated by
drug traffickers who were enraged at his efforts against them. And
he said threats on his life became so great that he was forced to
leave the country, taking the position as Mexico's ambassador to
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, the New York Times published a report that said
former Sonoran Gov. Manlio Fabio Beltrones had created ``a haven
for smugglers who transport vast quantities of narcotics into the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltrones denounced the paper and denied the report, which cited
unnamed U.S. government sources.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican political scientist Denise Dresser, writing in the
weekly magazine Proceso, described Labastida as ``a good man
surrounded by bad men.'' &QL;

TENSION ON BORDER NOT LIKELY TO DIMINISH SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY DANIEL GONZALEZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins the July 2 Mexican election, volatility along
the Arizona-Mexico border isn't going away, analysts say. In fact,
there is a possibility that it could escalate.
</P>
<P>
   The two top candidates, Francisco Labastida of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and contender Vincente Fox
of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) have both pledged
to create stable, good-paying jobs that would help stem the tide of
Mexicans crossing the border looking for work in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say it would take years for either to raise
Mexico's economy to levels that would drastically eliminate the
poverty that encourages tens of thousands of Mexicans to cross the
border every year.
</P>
<P>
   They worry also that the potential for political and economic
instability following the election could trigger a new wave of
migration, adding to an already explosive situation along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is going to be at a very critical juncture, not only on
July 2, but on July 3 and in the weeks that follow,'' said
political scientist Armando Navarro of the University of California
at Riverside. ``Certain historical forces are at play that could
lead to increasing instability across the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro recently returned from a two-day mission to Douglas to
assess the tensions that are straining relations between the United
States and Mexico. He has scheduled a July 29 summit in California
to develop solutions to the border crises.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATES TAKE NOTICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, armed ranchers in Arizona and Texas have been
capturing Mexican migrants and turning them over to authorities,
sparking outrage and indignation in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls put Labastida and Fox in a neck-and-neck race for the
Mexican presidency, and leading up to the election both candidates
have tried to gain votes by speaking out against the treatment of
Mexicans who cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   At a foreign policy forum in Mexico two weeks ago, Labastida
blasted the rounding up of illegal Mexican immigrants by U.S.
ranchers and pledged to ``use all the resources available to stop
the wrongs against our compatriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, meanwhile has raised eyebrows by proposing an open border
with the U.S., allowing the free movement of workers similar to
that of countries within the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also has proposed an aggressive economic growth plan that he
hopes will coax back Mexican workers living illegally in the United
States, along with the job skills they acquired here.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernando Martinez, a Mexican attorney at the National Law
Center for Inter-American Free Trade in Tucson, calls both
proposals pie in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Wide economic disparity
</P>
<P>
   An open border policy between the United States and Mexico is
``inconceivable'' because, unlike European countries, the disparity
between the Mexican and U.S. economies is too great, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   And the higher standard of living even among poor people in the
United States will prevent most Mexicans working illegally in the
United States from returning to their own country, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Ramirez, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who has lived
in Arizona for eight years, said he has no intention of returning
to Mexico, no matter how much the economy improves.
</P>
<P>
   Life here is ``one thousand times better,'' said Ramirez, 23,
who earns $8 an hour as a landscaper in northeast Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   About 3.3 million Mexicans are working in the United States
without documentation, and 150,000 Mexicans enter the United States
illegally every year, according to Immigration and Naturalization
Service estimates.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering two major crises in the past 20 years, Mexico's
economy has been steaming ahead, but 40 percent of the country's
100 million people still live below the poverty line and the
economy has failed to generate the approximately 1 million jobs
needed to keep up with the number of new workers entering the work
force each year.
</P>
<P>
   Many have crossed the border seeking jobs in the U.S. Over the
past 10 years, the movement has included a growing number of entire
families.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico ``is losing a lot of talented people,'' said Roderic
Camp, an expert on Mexico and professor of government at Claremont
McKenna College in Claremont, Calif. ``These are the people willing
to take a tremendous amount of risk to improve their standard of
living, and Mexico needs these kinds of people.''
</P>
<P>
   William Ackroyd, a political science professor at Arizona State
University West, is optimistic that Mexico's economy will continue
to improve, no matter which candidate wins the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida represents the safer status quo and if he is elected
Ackroyd predicts, the crises along the border will improve
``incrementally,'' with a steady increase in real wages resulting
in fewer migrants crossing the border and a greater demand for U.S.
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, on the other hand, represents momentous change that could
lead to rapid economic growth, perhaps followed by an economic
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Two possible outcomes
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fox gets in, two things are possible,'' said Ackroyd. ``One
is, we could see a rapid and dramatic increase in real wages and
demand for U.S. products; (the second is) a rapid increase in wages
followed by inflation and a decrease in real wages that could lead
to devaluation and another economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackroyd warns the presidential elections could result in a
possible ``doomsday'' scenario if either candidate fails to win
convincingly and loses the ability to govern effectively,
triggering an economic crisis and possibly even civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means is, you get a massive influx of Mexicans coming
across the border without documentation, an impoverished border
area and maybe even a spillover of violence,'' Ackroyd said.

TRADE BONDS MAY BEND, WON'T BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY HAL MATTERN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona businesses that thrive on exports to Mexico are casting
a wary eye south of the border as the Mexican presidential election
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) is facing a serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   That has Arizona businesses, investors and trade experts
wondering what a victory by the National Action Party (PAN) on July
2 could mean for their fragile cross-border partnership with
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it will be business as usual, no matter which party
wins. Others, however, predict at least a temporary period of
instability if the PAN unseats the PRI, which has held power in
Mexico since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who feels there is not going to be some interruption is
foolish,'' said Art Martori, a Phoenix businessman who is
developing a resort community near Mazatlan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If PAN wins, the dinosaurs are going to be out, and there is
going to be change from one end of the government to the other,''
Martori said. ``It's going to disrupt everything, but it will be
short-term, and in the long run it will be a breath of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has been Arizona's No. 1 trading partner since the late
1980s, with exports approaching $4 billion annually, and most
experts expect that to continue no matter who is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show PAN candidate Vicente Fox running
neck-and-neck with Francisco Labastida, the PRI nominee. Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) is
running a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the leading candidates have expressed their support for
free trade, although neither has provided details. Cardenas opposes
the North American Free Trade Agreement. &QL; 
PRO-BUSINESS POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Labastida likely would continue the pro-trade policies of
current PRI President Ernesto Zedillo. Fox, a former Coca-Cola
executive, is expected to embrace similar policies, although he is
considered a little more pro-business and friendlier to foreign
trade and investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think either one would make a good president,'' said John
Kugler, operations manager for Concise Fabricators, a Tucson
company that does about 75 percent of its business in Mexico.
``Regardless of who makes it, Mexico will continue to grow, and
free trade is what is going to make it grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts on trade with Mexico tend to agree, although they
don't rule out the possibility of some minor problems associated
with a change of ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any striking differences between the candidates,''
said Patrick Cronin, an assistant professor of international
studies at the American Graduate School of International Management
in Glendale. ``Whatever way the election goes, I wouldn't look for
any change in trade policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arizona businesses are understandably skittish about any
change of leadership in Mexico, which historically has been
followed by upheaval, even with the same party retaining power.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994 elections, Mexico experienced a severe peso
devaluation that sent the country's economy into a tailspin.
Arizona exports to Mexico declined by nearly half a billion dollars
between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although such a negative reaction is not expected after this
year's election, some trade experts still say a brief disruption is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every six years, after the elections, there has been either a
devaluation or a little instability,'' said Steve Sullivan, the
director of Arizona's trade office in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994 it was a crisis, but this time we have been reassured
that there will be no collapse. If Fox wins, there might be a
little disruption, a little uncertainty . . . but the country is
going to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   MINOR CHANGES EXPECTED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Margie Emmermann, Gov. Jane Hull's policy advisor on Mexico,
said any changes would be minor because Mexico has such a large
contingent of multinational companies influencing trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses have more say than they used to about trade
policy,'' Emmermann said. ``No president can change that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, some concerns that a PAN president's
policies could conflict with those of the PRI governors of Mexico's
various states. If Fox were to win, he wouldn't have a political
infrastructure in place in those states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a bit of gridlock,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa, Arizona's two largest
Mexican trading partners, both have PRI governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fox wins, we're not sure what will happen in states with
PRI governors,'' said Gail Howard, director of economic development
at Arizona State University. ``It could be a whole new ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmermann doesn't see a problem, although she said having a
president with ties to states close to Arizona would be helpful.
Labastida is a former governor of Sinaloa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't endorse one or the other,'' Emmermann said. ``We
would continue to pursue a good relationship with the Fox
administration. It just might take longer to get to know the
players.'' &QL;

ONE MORE BLAST FROM THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Fourteen years ago this month, I spoke for the first
time to a grieving mother named Dolores Heil.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was about a week after Heil's daughter, Susan Dina, had been
killed by a stray bullet while sunning near the pool of a Mesa
motel.
</P>
<P>
   Susan and her husband were in town from Philadel phia for a
friend's wedding. Across the street, two men were busting up a bar.
As they did, a patron named Martin Olsen went outside to get a
handgun he kept in his car. Before he got back, the men left and
were driving away in a truck. Olsen tried to shoot out the
vehicle's tires. He missed. One of the bullets hit Susan Dina in
the face, killing her.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of a ``Wild West'' place is Arizona, Susan's mother
asked me at the time. Adding, ``I hope that people out there will
learn a lesson from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course they will, I told her. The story of Susan Dina's
tragic death was in all the papers and on TV. People would see the
danger of fire arms, even in the hands of those foolish enough to
be lieve they're doing ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   But time passed and bodies continued to pile up. I'd check in
with Dolores Heil every year or so, sometimes writing about her.
She told me how Susan's husband had suffered a mental breakdown.
She described the pain of watching Phoenix residents show more
sympathy for her daughter's killer, Martin Ol sen, than they did
for Susan. Mostly because Olsen was older and sickly. She spoke of
how Olsen spent a couple of years in prison while Susan's family
got life.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, I spoke to Dolores Heil about another senseless
shooting death in Phoenix, one that reminded me of her daughter's
killing. I told her if people heard from her _ again _ it might
teach the lesson she'd talked about years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this deep pain way inside you that you can't get at,''
she said at the time, ``and it just keeps throbbing and
throbbing.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, I called Dolores Heil one more time. It was
after another family lost a girl to a senseless shooting. There
were still les sons to be learned, I said.
</P>
<P>
   The pain in Heil's voice hadn't diminished in 13 years. She told
me, ``When people are reckless with guns, it echoes forever.''
</P>
<P>
   It does, I'm sure of it, but only to a victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, a man and woman approached 18-year-old Danny
Marquez at a local Circle K. They pulled a gun and carjacked
Marquez's 1984 Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   As the suspects drove away, Marquez took out a 9mm pistol and
fired about 10 shots. One of the bullets hit 23-year-old Jonathan
Ward in the head, killing him. He was an innocent bystander, like
Susan Dina.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors haven't charged Marquez yet, but a spokesman for the
Maricopa County Attorney's Office says they probably will soon.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there will be talk of the danger of firearms and of
the cowboy mentality. And people will come for ward to say that
Marquez is basically a ``good'' guy who didn't mean to hurt anyone.
Then, as time passes and legal proceedings drag on, Jonathan Ward
slowly will be forgotten. And I'll drift back 14 years, brooding
over les sons we still haven't learned.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned not to call Dolores Heil. &QL;

WHAT TO DO WITH WHITE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers officials are hopeful Devon White can
return to the lineup from his partially torn left rotator cuff by
July 1, but the injured center fielder continues to resist putting
a date on a possible return.
</P>
<P>
   However, determining what will happen with White, who is also
the leadoff hitter, is crucial for the Dodgers in attacking the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers want White back because they quietly believe he is
the best center fielder on the roster, and his presence at the top
of the lineup is needed to be a championship club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten stronger,'' White said of the shoulder before
Saturday's game against Oakland at Dodger Stadium. ``It's
progressing, but I don't really know. There's good days and bad
days. I can't really put a timetable on it because what if I don't
meet it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say I'll be ready by early July and then not
be ready. I might wake up one day and feel great and be able to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the miracle cure hasn't happened. But neither
has the decision to end White's season with surgery, so the Dodgers
are left in a bind.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers don't want to make a trade if White could be ready
to play in three weeks. But if they wait and surgery is needed, the
price for acquiring a starting center fielder goes up.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers talked with speedy outfielder Jacob Brumfield about
signing a minor-league deal that could have eventually led to a
shot with the Dodgers, but that's on hold because there's no room
in the organization for him.
</P>
<P>
   There's also interest in Kansas City outfielder Johnny Damon,
two sources said, though everyone in the organization isn't sold on
him. Damon is playing left field for the Royals, but spent most of
his career playing center field.
</P>
<P>
   He's hitting .268 with five homers and 25 RBI from the leadoff
spot for the Royals, has 17 stolen bases in 20 attempts and a .336
on-base percentage. In his career, Damon has a .342 on-base
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' lineup is powerful, potent and fixed, except for
the leadoff spot. It's been an area manager Davey Johnson worried
about, but decided to plug it with White, who won championships
with Toronto batting leadoff.
</P>
<P>
   White was hitting .289 with three homers, nine RBI and a .326
on-base percentage. Todd Hollandsworth, currently nursing a sore
right hamstring, F.P. Santangelo and Shawn Gilbert, who led off one
game, are hitting a combined .239 with five homers, 15 RBI and a
.324 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Dodgers' leadoff spot is hitting .256 with 43 runs
scored and has an on-base percentage of .325.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLANDSWORTH'S HEALTH: Hollandsworth, platooning in center
field with Santangelo since White's injury, isn't improving at the
pace the Dodgers wanted. One way to temporarily stem the numbers
crunch on the roster is putting him on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   With Adrian Beltre and Orel Hershiser due back at some point
next week, Hollandsworth's right hamstring could buy the Dodgers
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely behind Beltre (in recovering),'' Johnson said.
``If it looks like it's going to be another four or five days
before he's 80 percent, it's possible we'll retroactive him (to
last Sunday) to the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a pull and not a spasm or something. It's
definitely more serious. He's not that close.''
</P>
<P>
   HERSHISER'S RETURN: Hershiser is expected to be recalled from
Single-A San Bernardino during the upcoming four-game series
against Arizona, but for the time being it would be as a reliever.
For now, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our starters are doing fine,'' Hershiser said. ``I
don't think it's fair for our starters to think they're on a short
leash because I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser is scheduled to throw a bullpen today, then talk to
Johnson. Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly and
Hershisher are expected to converse Monday about the matter. &QL;

VICTIM, HERO? MYS TERY IN AJ KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY PETER ORTIZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Within a 72-hour period last February, Bricie Tribble
went from a puzzling victim to hero to suspect in a murder
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Apache Junction police are still unraveling a
case that includes a killing that may or may not have been
self-defense, a dead man with no traceable past, a mysterious
package filled with potentially incriminating evidence, and notes
on a corpse that ended Tribble's brief status as a National Rifle
Association poster child.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, police disclosed their investigation in hopes of
finding people who knew the man Tribble shot in her kitchen and
locating the unknown person who sent the package.
</P>
<P>
   Their objective: pull together the final parts of a case against
Tribble, 28, for conspiring to kill her husband, Jeffrey.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed so far. Tribble could not be located
for comment, although police say they know where they can find her.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre case began shortly after midnight Feb. 1 when Sgt.
Ron Martin and other police responded to a call at Tribble's home.
On the kitchen floor, they found the body of Erick Fuentes Ramirez,
25, with bullet wounds in the neck, back and side.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tribble said she shot Fuentes Ramirez because he had
broken into her home and threatened to kill her family, police were
suspicious: There was no sign of forced entry or struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had the same question: `Why this house? Why did he
pick this house to enter the back door?' '' Cmdr. Brian Duncan
said. ``I mean this house sits out in the middle of nowhere. Was it
as random as Bricie would like us to believe it was?''
</P>
<P>
   But their suspicions quickly evaporated when Tribble identified
the victim as a former employee of her husband's excavating
business.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Tribble became somewhat of a hero when police
learned that just hours before he was slain, Fuentes Ramirez had
kidnapped, raped and shot a 33-year-old woman from a Wal-Mart in
Chandler, leaving her for dead in a Mesa desert.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes Ramirez was wearing that victim's wedding ring on his
left pinkie finger when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Tribble quickly drew nationwide attention from pro-gun
advocates, who said her case showed the value of keeping firearms.
Police believe that the NRA hired a Phoenix lawyer to represent
her. &QL; 
THE 1ST CLUE &QL; 
But on Feb. 3, Martin and an identification technician, Karen
Gwaltney, discovered the first clues that ended Tribble's brief
ride as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   In Fuentes Ramirez's wallet, they found a note in which Tribble
had told the man she killed, ``You know how I love you.'' They
found a second note that read, ``If Jeffrey dies from overdose of
drugs, Bricie is { responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribble not only signed the note, but stamped her fingerprint
next to her signature, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both startled,'' Martin said. ``We weren't expecting
to find something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said Fuentes Ramirez kept the note in his wallet as an
insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to us that Erick wanted some assurance from her
that he wasn't going to be left holding the bag,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand this is a correspondence signed by
Bricie to Erick, and we are looking at this note that says,
`Jeffrey dies,' '' he added. ``Automatically, the antennas are
going to go up and say something is wrong here.'' &QL; 
MORE EVIDENCE &QL; 
Police found more evidence that Tribble and Fuentes Ramirez were
having an affair. Her co-workers at the Mesa Christian Center said
she and Fuentes Ramirez had been seeing each other since October
and had been together the day before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after the killing, an unaddressed package sent from
a Phoenix post office arrived at the Apache Junction police
station.
</P>
<P>
   It contained photos of Tribble standing next to Fuentes
Ramirez's car and exposing her bra and panties, Tribble's wedding
photo, an eight-page letter and other love notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not confused about what I want or who I want to be with. I
love you and I want you in my life,'' the letter read.
</P>
<P>
   Police also learned that Fuentes Ramirez had used Tribble's gun
to shoot the woman he had kidnapped and raped.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer had advised Tribble not to talk to investigators,
Martin said. After Martin notified him that there were criminal
charges pending against his client, the lawyer referred her to the
Public Defenders Office. The office has declined to represent
Tribble until charges are filed, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Police don't know why Fuentes Ramirez kidnapped the woman before
driving off in her sport-utility vehicle to Tribble's home. And
they don't know why Tribble shot Fuentes Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Tribble, who gave a statement to police on the day of the
shooting, moved out of her Apache Junction home in March. She
submitted handwriting samples and fingerprints under court order,
but refused to speak any more with police.
</P>
<P>
   The samples showed she wrote the notes to Fuentes Ramirez,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police plan to eventually turn the case over to the Pinal County
Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Tribble learned of his wife's affair from police after
she moved out of their home. He has since cooperated with
investigators but declined to comment. &QL; 
SEEKING INFORMATION &QL; 
All police know about Fuentes Ramirez is that he is an undocumented
citizen who may have lived in Chandler. Other than a citation for
an expired motor vehicle registration, he does not appear to have a
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they fear friends of Fuentes Ramirez who may be
undocumented may be avoiding police and emphasize they are
interested only in information about the victim and not the legal
status of the people who may provide information.
</P>
<P>
   To contact Apache Junction police, call (480) 982-8260.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking that she shot and killed Erick,'' Duncan
said. ``We have no evidence to show she did not do it in
self-defense. We are focusing on these letters and conspiracy to
kill Jeffrey.'' &QL;

ONE MORE BLAST FROM THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Fourteen years ago this month, I spoke for the first
time to a grieving mother named Dolores Heil.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was about a week after Heil's daughter, Susan Dina, had been
killed by a stray bullet while sunning near the pool of a Mesa
motel.
</P>
<P>
   Susan and her husband were in town from Philadel phia for a
friend's wedding. Across the street, two men were busting up a bar.
As they did, a patron named Martin Olsen went outside to get a
handgun he kept in his car. Before he got back, the men left and
were driving away in a truck. Olsen tried to shoot out the
vehicle's tires. He missed. One of the bullets hit Susan Dina in
the face, killing her.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of a ``Wild West'' place is Arizona, Susan's mother
asked me at the time. Adding, ``I hope that people out there will
learn a lesson from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course they will, I told her. The story of Susan Dina's
tragic death was in all the papers and on TV. People would see the
danger of fire arms, even in the hands of those foolish enough to
be lieve they're doing ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   But time passed and bodies continued to pile up. I'd check in
with Dolores Heil every year or so, sometimes writing about her.
She told me how Susan's husband had suffered a mental breakdown.
She described the pain of watching Phoenix residents show more
sympathy for her daughter's killer, Martin Ol sen, than they did
for Susan. Mostly because Olsen was older and sickly. She spoke of
how Olsen spent a couple of years in prison while Susan's family
got life.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, I spoke to Dolores Heil about another senseless
shooting death in Phoenix, one that reminded me of her daughter's
killing. I told her if people heard from her _ again _ it might
teach the lesson she'd talked about years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this deep pain way inside you that you can't get at,''
she said at the time, ``and it just keeps throbbing and
throbbing.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, I called Dolores Heil one more time. It was
after another family lost a girl to a senseless shooting. There
were still les sons to be learned, I said.
</P>
<P>
   The pain in Heil's voice hadn't diminished in 13 years. She told
me, ``When people are reckless with guns, it echoes forever.''
</P>
<P>
   It does, I'm sure of it, but only to a victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, a man and woman approached 18-year-old Danny
Marquez at a local Circle K. They pulled a gun and carjacked
Marquez's 1984 Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   As the suspects drove away, Marquez took out a 9mm pistol and
fired about 10 shots. One of the bullets hit 23-year-old Jonathan
Ward in the head, killing him. He was an innocent bystander, like
Susan Dina.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors haven't charged Marquez yet, but a spokesman for the
Maricopa County Attorney's Office says they probably will soon.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there will be talk of the danger of firearms and of
the cowboy mentality. And people will come for ward to say that
Marquez is basically a ``good'' guy who didn't mean to hurt anyone.
Then, as time passes and legal proceedings drag on, Jonathan Ward
slowly will be forgotten. And I'll drift back 14 years, brooding
over les sons we still haven't learned.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned not to call Dolores Heil. &QL;

SOUTHERN CAL HANDS FLORIDA STATE ANOTHER CWS SETBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ At the end of a long afternoon presented in
scorching detail to a national viewing audience, the Southern
California Trojans had 16 hits and a small problem Saturday in the
College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Their continuous barrage had produced a mere two-run lead, and
in the bottom of the ninth, Florida State had two runners on base
with one out. Mindful of the opportunity for a dramatic finish,
Seminoles catcher Blair McCaleb smashed a rocket toward the gap.
</P>
<P>
   At which point, the most useful weapon in the USC arsenal became
the glove of shortstop Seth Davidson, who leaped into the air,
speared McCaleb's drive, and tossed to second baseman Anthony
Lunetta to double up an FSU runner and seal a 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 16th consecutive victory for the Trojans (44-18), who
are scheduled to face Louisiana State on Monday in the second
round. For Florida State (51-18), which has never won a national
title in 17 previous trips to the CWS, it was another unhappy
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess saying I had a good day is one way of looking at it,''
said FSU first baseman Ryan Barthelemy, who was 4-for-4 with two
home runs and three runs batted in. ``But I'd give all four of
those hits for a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans matched Barthelemy's homers with clouts from Beau
Craig and Lunetta, and scored three runs in the fourth and two in
the fifth to take the lead and chase FSU starter Blair Varnes
(11-3) from the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Cal coach Mike Gillespie praised the performance of
starter Rik Currier (15-3) and the overall play of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual, Rik gave us a real good, competitive performance,''
Gillespie said. ``He didn't get rattled when they had an early
lead. ... he's a very poised pitcher and perfect for a game like
this. It was frustrating to score so few runs on so many hits, but
we had good execution, a little luck and a big play to end the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Currier pitched strongly before being relieved with two out in
the eighth by Ronald Flores, who gave up back-to-back singles with
one out in the ninth before being rescued by Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy really scorched it,'' Davidson said, ``It wasn't
exactly a sno-cone, but it almost put a hole in my glove.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a big day for Lunetta, who was diagnosed with strep
throat when he arrived and had a temperature of 101 on Friday, but
awoke Saturday ``feeling great.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the home run, he launched a crowd-pleasing
defensive play by going to his right for a ground ball and flipping
it to Davidson, who made the throw to first for the out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice that, and I know Coach likes to see it,'' he said,
``and when I heard Seth yelling, `flip, flip, flip,' I did it. I
guess it's a good thing it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   For Varnes, who lost the CWS final to Miami last year while
gamely pitching with a knee injury, it was another disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not very happy right now,'' he said. ``It wasn't a
good day.'' nn

LEAVE IT TO CHEEVER: IRL DRIVER WINS IROC EVENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Eddie Cheever looked worn out after hopping
a plane from Michigan Speedway to the Texas Motor Speedway on
Saturday afternoon. But the smile on that worn-out face said it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday morning, Cheever took advantage of his front row
starting position in the 50-lap International Race of Champions
event in Brooklyn, Mich., to win his first event in the all-star
series and the first for an active driver in the Indy Racing
Northern Light Series.
</P>
<P>
   The four-race series concludes during the Brickyard 400 weekend
at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat (Dale) Earnhardt today. I beat (Mark) Martin,'' Cheever
said with a grin during a news conference at the infield media
center at TMS. ``For me to go down there and do well, that says a
lot for our racing series. I'm sure the `Good Ol' Boys' thought I
was crazy. I was as crazy as a fox, and it was the right way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever admits his previous performances in the invitation-only
series, which features drivers from various forms of motorsports in
identically prepared Pontiac Firebird Trans-Ams, have not been
good, and he was tired of getting beat.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning he proved that he can mix it up with the boys
from NASCAR's Winston Cup Series on their turf by using a different
line than several of the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever stayed low on the track, while others ran higher in the
groove. Cheever rolled to the first victory by a non-Winston Cup
driver since Al Unser Jr. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``He roughed me up a little coming off (Turn) 4 one time, but I
got over it in a lap or so,'' Earnhardt said. Cheever has ``raced;
he's paid his dues. I think Eddie could run in NASCAR with the
right equipment. It's fitting he won. It wasn't given to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever fell back no farther than fourth in the 50-lap event and
took the lead for good on Lap 33.
</P>
<P>
   He beat former IRL champion and current Winston Cup star Tony
Stewart by 0.711 seconds on the two-mile banked trioval, with
Earnhardt finishing third and Martin fourth.
</P>
<P>
   IRL regulars Greg Ray and Mark Dismore, who also flew to and
from Michigan with Cheever, competed in the event. Dismore finished
10th and Ray 11th in the 12-car field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty laps in (IROC) is a lot more nerve-wracking than 200
laps out here,'' said Cheever, whose previous best IROC finish was
a third at IMS last year. ``I am not relaxed in the car because it
is closed in and there is a lot of dust in the car. And you have
(11) maniacs behind me trying to get even with me. My car was
working, and I was lucky that Earnhardt and Martin were fighting
because I would lose 10 yards and gain 10 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever, driver of the No. 51 Excite &LR; Home Dallara/Infiniti on
the IRL circuit, said he is slowly learning the subtle nuances of
driving in the series by racing with NASCAR's top stars on tracks
that NASCAR drivers sometimes visit twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Like learning that when the cars touch it's all right, or what
certain hand singles mean, especially from people such as Earnhardt
and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only mistake I made that I really regret is coming out of
Turn 2, I got a little close to Dale Earnhardt,'' Cheever said. ``I
just rubbed up a little, what they call `rubbin'. ' I think I
knocked the (heck) out of it, but they call it rubbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I went by I looked at him in a very differential way. I had
a full facemask on. He didn't.'' Cheever continued. ``You could see
his expressions. I was like, `I am really sorry.' He just gave me
the thumbs-up, and I guess there is no death warrant on me, so I
just continued on.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Cheever it was further proof that the Indy Racing
Northern Light series has drivers who can compete in any series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last five years, Indy Racing drivers _ thanks to
CART's excellent PR work _ are (perceived) at a level that
everybody is incompetent who drives in the Indy Racing Northern
Light Series,'' he said. ``I don't believe that. I'm very proud of
the fact that we have such good races.'' nn

INCOME TAX BAN SCARES OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY CHRIS MOESER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) 
Even as lawmakers contemplate a sales tax hike to raise $450
million a year for education, Arizona faces the possibility of
losing annual revenues five times that amount.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A citizens group has been amassing signatures to place on the
November ballot a proposal to abolish the state income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has Arizona leaders so alarmed that they have
launched an all-out, largely behind-the-scenes assault on the
supporters behind the plan, hop ing to hobble the measure from
making it on the Nov. 7 ballot, or to defeat it at the ballot box
should it survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to open the prisons and close the schools, this is
the initiative for you,'' said Gov. Jane Hull, who predicts massive
budget cuts and huge increases in sales and property taxes to make
up the lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and other state leaders fret that voters might approve her
proposed state sales tax in crease in November and, at the same,
give themselves a break on income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the income tax initiative say that it is an idea
whose time has come. They say it would also force legislators to
cut the fat from the budget, among them tax exemptions that benefit
special groups to the tune of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which would eliminate individual and corpo rate
income taxes over four years, is the most comprehensive reform
package ever to go before voters, the backers say.
</P>
<P>
   Besides eliminating $2.6 billion in revenue - it makes up nearly
half of the state's budget - the initiative requires a two-thirds
vote of the Legislature and a public vote to replace any of the
money. It also would identify candidates on the ballot who favored
eliminating the federal income tax. &QL; 
LONG ROAD AHEAD &QL; 
It faces a long road. The group behind the initiative, Taxpayer
Protection Alliance, is still short of the 152,643 signatures
needed for the issue to qualify as a ballot measure. And then
there's the political heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will absolutely be out cam paigning,'' Hull said. ``That
one, Growing Smarter and the educa tion proposal will be the three
main initiatives I'll be involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Two high-profile politicians who had signed onto the ini
tiative, former Attorney General Grant Woods and U.S. Rep. Matt
Salmon, have withdrawn their support. And a powerful devel oper,
Suncor, withdrew a $10,000 donation to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mahoney, a former secretary of state who endorses the
plan to scrap the income tax, accuses Hull of being the puppet
master behind the moves.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has mobilized a powerful opposition group, in
cluding the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, police and firefight ers
groups, unions, and cities and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said Hull and other opponents are playing a game of
Chicken Little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those people have a piece of the pie,'' Mahoney said.
``They have a vested interest on the inside in that money and they
don't want to let go.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the state's $6 billion budget comes from in come
taxes: 40 percent from indi viduals and 9 percent from
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the money comes from sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and other critics say it would be virtually impossible to
make up that revenue with other taxes, particularly with the re
strictions the income tax initia tive proposes on tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about elim inating half of the money in the
general fund, I don't think there's ever been a proposal before vot
ers that's been more dangerous,'' said Kevin McCarthy of the Ari
zona Tax Research Association. ``The reason they don't include
replacement revenues is they don't want that in the debate. It's a
sham.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy points out that law makers have already cut the state
income tax by 30 percent in recent years. Arizona has the fourth
lowest income tax burden of states that have the tax.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, which depend on the tax for a portion of their
revenues, warn that city services would be dramatically curtailed.
Phoenix Councilman Phil Gordon predicts cuts in fire and police, as
well as social services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything in this community that has been more
devastating than if this passes,'' Gordon said. &QL; 
SCARE TACTICS &QL; 
But Lori Klein, executive direc tor of the Taxpayer Protection
Alliance, says those predictions are nothing more than scare
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   She said eliminating the in come tax would make the state more
attractive to corporations, which would dramatically expand the
economy. And it would make government more accountable to voters,
who would have more control over spending and taxa tion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most taxpayers on the street would rather pay a penny on the
dollar for police and fire than pay an income tax,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney adds that lawmakers would have four years to cut the fat
in state government. Cutting the income tax would force politi
cians to make tough choices, something supporters say is long
overdue. He, for one, suggests a 10 percent budget cut.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney also points to 600 exemptions in the sales tax code that
total about $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these are handouts to people who have their own lobby
ists down at the Capitol,'' he said. ``The people who are paying
taxes are the working poor. The people who don't pay are the guys
with accountants who can find the loopholes.'' &QL;

KARROS TIES HOMER MARK IN DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Right-hander Kevin Brown did his typical gig. He
baffled Oakland hitters with an array of pitches from a bunch of
arm angles in a complete-game 7-2 Dodgers victory Saturday at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was Eric Karros who became the center of attention with
one historic swing. The first baseman, a symbol of the Dodgers, not
to mention a link to the O'Malley days of a family-run business,
stepped to the edge of Los Angeles Dodgers lore with a sixth-inning
homer.
</P>
<P>
   It gave the Dodgers a 7-1 lead, but the meaning was far deeper.
With it, Karros tied Ron Cey for the L.A. franchise record for
career homers with 228. With his next homer also comes the
distinction of being the most prolific home-run hitter since the
franchise moved from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice, but when I hit the one that breaks it, it'll
probably have a little more meaning,'' Karros said. ``It's nice to
be mentioned in the same breath as Ron Cey and Steve Garvey, but I
want to mentioned in the same breath as them when you're talking
about the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros' 17th homer of the season came off Oakland reliever Scott
Service, carrying just beyond the thigh-high wall in left field.
Dodgers reliever Mike Fetters then got the ball from the fan and
gave it to Karros.
</P>
<P>
   The home run also ended Karros' second-longest homerless streak
of the season at 24 at-bats. His 227th career homer came last
Saturday at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a slider,'' Karros said. ``I haven't been swinging
the bat well the last few days. It was more luck than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros is tied with Gary Sheffield for the team lead in homers,
and leads the Dodgers with 55 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Even Karros, a Dodger throughout his nine-year career, admitted
passing Cey was as much as a given could be this side of death and
taxes, especially since he signed a three-year contract extension
in February.
</P>
<P>
   But becoming the Dodgers' all-time home run leader is more of a
long shot. That distinction belongs to Duke Snider, who hit 389.
He's followed by Gil Hodges at 361 and Roy Campanella at 242.
Karros is 10th on the franchise RBI list with 789, which is fourth
all-time in Los Angeles history.
</P>
<P>
   Karros hit at least 30 homers in four of the last five seasons,
including matching a career-high in 1999. He's homered once every
21.1 at-bats in his career and once every 12.5 at-bats this season.
Karros is on pace to hit 47 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a clutch guy, he's a special hitter,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``He grinds it out. The more I see him the more
I appreciate him. He may start slow, but he's a special player.
He's giving it everything he has every time up there. Before I came
here, nobody had to tell me he was the one who got the clutch hits,
and it didn't have to be a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama wasn't as grand for Karros' record-tying homer because
the rest of the Dodgers' power hitters gave Brown an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield gave Brown a rare early cushion with a two-run
double, and Shawn Green followed with a run-scoring single to give
the Dodgers a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the first off former Angels
hurler Omar Olivares.
</P>
<P>
   Brown added an RBI single in the third and Green hit his 11th
homer, a two-run shot in the fourth, as the Dodgers built a 6-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have to pitch (even with an early lead),'' Brown
said. ``Early in the game, you can't go out and say, `OK, I'll
throw it over the plate.' Not with every guy from first to ninth in
the order hitting homers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed seven hits, walked one and struck out four in his
second straight complete game, his third of the season. By
comparison, Olivares (3-8) allowed six runs on nine hits in four
innings. He's lost his last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's going on, (but) I'm not able to physically
(change) it,'' Olivares said. ``I'm not throwing the low strikes. I
haven't been able to hit my spots.'' &QL;

 &HT;    When it comes to sex, power struggles can be deadly
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dr. Robert Hatcher is recognized worldwide as an
expert in family planning and population control, but at Emory
University in Atlanta his medical students just call him Captain
Condom.
</P>
<P>
   In a week when the Vatican and Muslim nations tried mightily at
the U.N. meeting in New York to weaken the reproductive rights goal
of the 1995 Beijing conference on women, Hatcher, a professor of
obstetrics and gynecology, offered insights on the volatile issue.
They are based on a lifetime of research and experience with
real-life situations around the world. One of his books, ``The
Essentials of Contraceptive Technology,'' published by Johns
Hopkins University Press and translated in many languages, is
distributed by the United Nations to health care professionals
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Modern medical technology and the availability of
contraceptives, even in developing nations, should make unwanted
pregnancies and abortions rare, Hatcher says. But male attitudes,
cultural mores and religious views still are obstacles. The
solution hinges on improving the status of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' he says, ``men don't want to relinquish this
important (sexual) power over women.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher tells two stories to illustrate his point:
</P>
<P>
   In the Congolese capital of Kinshasa, Dr. Manzila Tarande, a
gynecologist with the Centers for Disease Control in Africa,
counseled a man who was HIV-positive and his spouse who was not. He
advised the couple of the risk to the woman and instructed them on
how to use condoms. Two weeks later, the woman returned with an eye
swollen, her body bruised and cut. ``See what your condom advice
got me,'' she said. She later died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman didn't die because of a lack of access to
contraceptives or of a lack of understanding about how to use
them,'' Hatcher says. ``She died because of the status of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in America, where women have led the way in improving their
status and choices, there are underlying problems of power and
control in relationships. For example, a woman who worked in the
OB-GYN department at Atlanta's Grady Hospital decided after her
fifth child she wanted to be sterilized, but her husband objected.
And for religious reasons, he also rejected contraceptive use. Soon
after the woman became pregnant with her sixth child, she died of a
self-induced abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't die because she had no access to contraceptives or
legal abortion,'' Hatcher says. ``She died because of her lack of
power. She died because of the status of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hatcher is encouraged that the education of women and the
availability of contraceptives through the U.N. and other world
health organizations has helped decrease the average family size in
many nations. In Kenya, for example, the birth rate between 1976
and 1999 dropped from 8.4 children per family to 5.4. In Peru, from
6.7 to 3.5.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, teenage pregnancy is down, but not by
enough. Studies show 93 percent of young people engage in
premarital sex, most while still in high school, Hatcher says.
Although he preaches abstinence to teens and believes strongly sex
education should be taught in a framework of moral values, he also
believes in offering the safety net of education about
contraception. But much of American society is not ready for that,
he says. ``If I suggested such to some (parent) groups I speak
to,'' he says, ``I wouldn't be asked back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing goal of reproductive rights for women and sex
education for girls must be more than just a women's effort.
Hatcher says: ``Improving the status of women has to include men _
husbands, boyfriends, physicians and political leaders.''

 &HT;    Lawrence pinned life to the canvas perfectly
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was in a New York gallery that I met Jacob
Lawrence, five years ago, just before his powerful Migration Series
opened at the High Museum in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He had traveled by plane from Seattle, as I had from Atlanta. As
we sat chatting about his work, neither of us said anything about
the underlying significance of a couple of plane trips. But, as we
talked, two gray-haired men, I couldn't help thinking of the irony
of how our ordinary travels had become a stark counterpoint to
Lawrence's series, his best-known work and the definitive artistic
statement about the pain and the promise surrounding black people
as they left the Deep South for the industrial North in the 1920s
and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   While our flights were without disrespect, the travelers in the
black exodus Lawrence depicted in his 60 paintings suffered and
endured Jim Crow's worst, in a world already afflicted with
lynchings, race riots and denied opportunities throughout society.
</P>
<P>
   I knew these paintings, I knew these travelers and I knew these
stories. Many of my relatives and family friends had migrated from
rural Alabama, north to the rubber factories in Akron, Ohio, to the
railroad yards in Cleveland. The packing houses in Chicago and
steel mills of Pittsburgh. And, in a continuing version of the
migration from Down Home to Up South (the North often treated black
people as badly as the South) my own parents left Meridian, Miss.,
in the 1950s for East St. Louis, Ill., site of a 1917 race riot
ignited by tension over the hiring of black factory workers. That
riot, in which at least 48 people died _ 40 black, eight white _
was depicted as No. 52 in Lawrence's series.
</P>
<P>
   Another painting, No. 15, showed one reason my parents and I had
left Meridian. It was a stark scene of a figure in red, bent in
grief after a lynching (no body shown). Like many other black
Southerners, we left after hearing about the lynching of Emmett
Till, who in 1955 at the same age as I _ 14 _ was murdered near
Money, Miss., after allegedly flirting with a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   Moved by my familiarity with the lives and times that inspired
these paintings, I exclaimed, ``You painted my story.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence replied, gently: ``It's our story. One of the
greatmovements through United States history. People are always on
the move, trying to better themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He understood that hope for a better life has put countless
other groups in motion, too, including white Southerners, Irish
immigrants, Salvadorans, Mexicans, Laotians, Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to tell the American story through the
black-American migration, Lawrence made it universal. Meeting him
made it clear that he was a universal man.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he painted the story that so many black people had
lived, Lawrence did it with such elegance and force of talent that
he rose above the injustices he illuminated. That quickly became
apparent when he walked into the room at the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing taupe trousers, brown-patterned jacket, blue sweater and
a friendly smile, he exuded both confidence and accessibility. As
important was what he did not show. There was no weariness, that
sense of being beaten down by injustice. He showed no rage, but
rather a clear sense of purpose. And a recognition that change is
to be embraced.
</P>
<P>
   His work, of course, has always shown purpose, telling stories
and history in bold, primary colors and with a fine sense of
economy _ an almost abstractness all the more powerful for its
absence of sentimentality and preachiness. In some ways, Lawrence
was a vessel through which stories with lives of their own flowed.
</P>
<P>
   During our 1995 conversation, he talked about a project he had
been working on, ``a builder's theme,'' drawing on his own love for
tools; he had collected saws, planes, hammers, chisels. ``I
consider tools a metaphor for uplift,'' he said, adding that tools
in Renaissance paintings still look perfectly beautiful: ``I use
them the way some painters use fruits in still life.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest fruit borne from the works of Jacob Lawrence may be
his essential Americanness. Like any true artist, he painted truths
about the place he knew, caring enough about it to tell its story
and try to make it better. That's what Norman Rockwell did. What
Carl Sandburg did with poetry. What Bob Dylan and Billie Holiday
sang about .
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great country,'' Lawrence said at one point during
our conversation. His work helped make it that way. By telling the
truths he told, he helped Americans understand where our country
had been and where it might go if it could acknowledge its past: He
painted people who worked hard in desperately trying times to get
the good from society, including abolitionists Frederick Douglass
and Harriet Tubman. And, when you looked at the people in his
migration series, you always wanted them to go north and do well,
even though you knew that wouldn't always happen. What you did know
was that they had to go, and the country had to aspire to making
change for good.
</P>
<P>
   His portrayals of these migrants demonstrated the power of
positive self-perception. Though born in Atlantic City, N.J., he
embraced Southern culture, learning about it from his childhood
peers and from his mother, who was born in Fredericksburg, Va.
Thus, his paintings carry the weight of cultural intimacy that you
can't make up.
</P>
<P>
   And, because all of us, in some way, have lived his story, we
look for ourselves in his work and his life.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and his wife Gwen (also an artist) were married in
1941, the year I was born. When, as newlyweds, they visited New
Orleans, they found, not unexpectedly, wide and deep segregation.
Returning years later, he found changes that were equally profound:
``There was a mix of the races, going to bars and things like that.
It looked as if whites welcomed this change. This was true
throughout the country. They seemed freer.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the same feeling I had when returning to live in the
South in the 1970s, after living in the North for almost 20 years.
Freedom seemed at hand. Possibility, at last, certainly was.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Lawrence's paintings of train travelers never
fail to recall my own trips in segregated cars, where black people
ate home-prepared sandwiches wrapped in greasy paper and stored in
shoeboxes. Those paintings, too, always remind me of treks by car
when none of the restaurants would serve us, so those sandwiches
served again.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about those times, and those reminders, but we agreed
that we were fortunate to have moved past the pain, just as America
moved past the behavior that brought the hurt. And, that is why we
didn't have to talk about the plane ride anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to learn, teach and move on is what I'll always
remember about Jacob Lawrence, artist. American artist.

 &HT;    Get a whiff of this city
 &HT;    by John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ This city smells terrific.
</P>
<P>
   I find this realization startling. Cities commonly stink, and
this city has its smelly moments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more than one moment recently caused me to stop and cock my
head toward something _ something pulling me to pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   I deduced shortly that at least part of what I was smelling was
new landscaping on the exterior of this newspaper's grounds.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know an Indian hawthorn from a Mexican marigold.
Couldn't tell you if a red sage had me at gunpoint. But all of
those are in the ground on these grounds, and every day they take
stink away. Or they distract us from it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the multi-dimensioned distraction of the crape myrtle.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago the persuasive activists of Keep Waco
Beautiful convinced the city council to pronounce it Waco's town
tree. The organization backed its promotion with a donation of 150
of them.
</P>
<P>
   COLOR _ AND AROMA
</P>
<P>
   With blossoms varying from white to purple to melon and more,
the crape myrtle stays blooming for months. And, said local
beautification stalwart Frances Sturgis, ``even when it's bare its
limbs are pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Keep Waco Beautiful considered the blossoms' scent when
making its pitch?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Sturgis said. ``We considered the beauty.'' She then
granted that the group had missed a lick. Scent would have sealed
any deal.
</P>
<P>
   Now the crape myrtle is all over. While its scent varies in
intensity _ boosted by a generous rain, for instance _ there's no
question that fragrance comes with the package.
</P>
<P>
   A landscaper has a lot in his bag of tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the butterfly bush, genus buddleia davidii, a floral
hedge that gives off a scent that drives butterflies wild.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are non-blooming aromatic plants like rosemary, mint
or sage.
</P>
<P>
   I looked on the Internet for a term for this scent science _
this side benefit of urban forestation. We have experts devising
strategies for shade, promoting energy savings from green (turf
around a building lowers ambient temperation by 15 degrees, you
should know.)
</P>
<P>
   We know green gives off oxygen and consumes carbon dioxide. But
clearly one of the most compelling reasons for greening a city is
rarely discussed, this smell thing.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Waco Inc. Executive Director Margaret Mills, Waco's
chief urban revivalist, ought to have a name for this science, but
all she can do is fall back on the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides a serenity and peacefulness to what can be a loud
and cumbersome sort of environment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the other day Downtown Waco Inc. was promoting the
concept without knowing it. To kick off an outdoor concert series
downtown, she invited Tinker Clift of the Texas State Technical
College turf management department to come and sell beddable
flowers and ferns grown by students in the TSTC greenhouse. Sold
out.
</P>
<P>
   Clift knows the attraction of plants, not just in terms of
earning people's affection but also in urban centers bringing
people back. In a host of ways, plants improve shoppers'
dispositions, diners' appetites, and property values in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a city that has a lot of plants, your whole well-being is
better,'' said Clift. ``Everyone in the world wants to live in
Austin and that's one of the reasons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Nealy, whose Town and Country Gardens remade the Trib's
beds, says such plants as roses, gardenias, wisterias and magnolias
are big aroma makers, as are the mountain laurel he planted at one
corner of our property.
</P>
<P>
   A city that wants to win people back, or businesses that want to
earn customers' good graces, could do so leading them right by the
nose.

 &HT;    Helping teens apply themselves
 &HT;    By Ruth Innis Quast
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Thousands of high-school teen-agers are pounding
the pavement looking for summer jobs. What are their prospects?
What opportunities are available to them? And how will they go
about seeking employment?
</P>
<P>
   Retail stores and fast-food restaurants are popular places of
employment for teen-agers _they can usually get hired on the spot.
But sometimes it takes a village to put teen-agers to work, and the
Miami Valley is doing just that with help from business
organizations, high-school guidance counselors, federally and
state-funded programs and family members.
</P>
<P>
   The Kroger Co., in conjunction with the Dayton Urban League,
will launch its annual registration drive this month to prepare
hundreds of teens 14 and older to apply for bagger positions that
start at $5.40 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we get them ready for their first job,'' said
Krista Austin, Kroger's Cincinnati labor-relations specialist. ``We
teach them how to fill out an application, basic interview skills
and how to act on the job,'' she said. ``After training, they go
out to a Kroger location of their choice and apply for a courtesy
clerk position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen-agers who go through our training program get preference
over any other job applicant,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal aide positions starting at $8.50 an hour are available
at the City of Dayton Parks, Recreation and Culture Department.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers should apply through civil service, be at least 16
years old and have one year of paid or volunteer youth leadership
work experience, said Peggy Collins, the department's recreation
superintendent. After training, they assist program directors in
running community-center programs, city day camps, swimming pools,
park playground activities and cultural affairs programs.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD WORK HABITS ARE ESSENTIAL
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bayless, a career specialist at Colonel White High School,
scans the ``Employment Guide,'' a free ``help-wanted'' publication
that can be found at most grocery chains and retail outlets. He
posts jobs of interest to teen-agers on the high-school bulletin
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also do referrals,'' Bayless said. ``Recently, we posted a
flyer received from the Potter's House Relief Center, announcing
its annual application drive to attract teen-agers into its Dayton
Youth Program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any teen-ager between 14 and 17 years old can apply,'' said
Duane Darden, executive director of the relief center, where
assistance is provided to the needy and to the homeless. ``The
program's designed to put teen-agers to work and to keep them off
the streets and involved in positive activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the kids come into our program, we teach them the proper
way to dress, how to talk to people, the importance of getting to
work on time and the necessity of obeying authority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After training, participants earn a weekly paycheck by raising
funds for the relief center. ``We set up booths at prearranged
business locations throughout the city, where program donations are
solicited, under the direction of one of our adult mentor
volunteers. We sell candy, cookies, custom return-address labels
and household cleaning products,'' Bayless said.
</P>
<P>
   When students aren't working, they have access to the
organization's activity center, where they mingle, play games,
practice basketball and sign up for monthly chaperoned field trips.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 jobs will be available to teen-agers through the Jobs
for Graduates program, said John McConnell, Partnership for Youth
program manager. ``We give students, usually 14 and 15 years old, a
chance to get job experience working at nonprofit organizations
throughout the county,'' he said. ``They're paid through grants and
work for minimum wage ($5.15 an hour).
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they go out on the job, we teach them the basics about
being punctual, getting along with co-workers, how to follow
directions and how not to be afraid to ask their boss a question.''
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER JOBS AS CAREER STARTS
</P>
<P>
   Another arm of Jobs for Graduates is a ``school-to-work
transition'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stationed at 22 high schools throughout the Miami
Valley,'' said McConnell. ``Students start the program as freshmen
and take classes for academic credit where we teach them
employability skills. We also work closely with the business
community and when students get close to graduation, we help match
up employers with their career interest and give them assistance in
getting a job.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Shannon Jones, 15, a freshman, plans to do. Last
summer, to prepare herself for the work force, she took a volunteer
job at the YMCA West Area Branch assisting counselors at the summer
day camp for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I want to go for Jobs for Graduates,'' she said,
``in hopes of getting on at the VA Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Jones would like an internship in the computer industry
because her career plan is to become a computer engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to find a job you can make a career out of and get
on-the-job training,'' said Rhett Walters, a Vandalia Butler high
school junior. He works at THT Presses, a tool-and-die shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut metals with a band saw and sandblast parts,'' he said.
After graduation, ``I'll go on to Sinclair to learn CNC machining
and end up with a degree in tool-and-die.'' Walters said he got his
job through a friend of the family who works at THT.
</P>
<P>
   Francine Howell, 17, a senior, encourages teen-agers to use
family connections to get summer jobs. Last summer, she painted
houses for her brother, a painting contractor. ``By the end of the
summer, I was earning $7.50 an hour,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, she's worked at Crown Equipment Co., where her
sister recommended her for a clerical job. Howell recently applied
for an escort position at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where
her mother works. She found an ad in the Skywrighter, a base
newspaper, that lists summer jobs for teen-agers, a good source for
other students who are looking for summer work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Schirmer, a senior, is involved in one of nine Miami
Valley Tech Prep programs.
</P>
<P>
   Schirmer takes automotive technology classes in the morning and
works at Slone's Automotive garage in the afternoon, where he does
oil changes, tuneups, brake jobs, and engine repairs _ getting
hands-on experience while working under this mentorship program.
After graduation, he plans to go into the two-year automotive tech
program at Sinclair and someday open up his own automotive-repair
shop.
</P>
<P>
   TECH PREP PROGRAM SERVES HUNDREDS
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Jayne, assistant coordinator for the Miami Valley Tech
Prep Consortium said, ``We serve 64 area high schools and have
1,500 students participating in our tech prep programs. We look at
it as a four-year college-bound program starting in the junior year
of high school and leading to a two-year associate's degree at
Sinclair,'' she said. Programs include information technology,
electronics and computer engineering, business technology and an
interactive media program, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tech prep program is federally funded, it operates
under the Ohio state educational system and, in the Dayton area,
the consortium is housed at Sinclair Community College.
</P>
<P>
   For the noncollege bound student, the Occupational Work
Experience program is available to juniors and seniors at most high
schools in the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a state-funded program,'' said Bob Sells, Vandalia Butler
High School's OWE coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are in school part of the day earning required credits
towards graduation and work in supervised jobs in the afternoons
and evenings to earn their elective credits,'' explained senior
counselor Donna Moosbrugger. In most of these jobs, ``students earn
about $6.50 an hour, but we did place one young woman at Henger's
Nursery as a flower arranger and she's earning $9 an hour,''
recalled Sells. Most of these jobs can turn into summer jobs as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Sudie Jacques, a high school guidance counselor, recommended
that students check the school's Job Opportunity Bulletin Board,
dedicated to job listings available in the community. Most high
schools maintain them. Jacques said they get requests for help from
veterinarian offices, nursing homes, summer day camps, grocery and
discount stores and some hospitals, who have volunteer positions
available for those students too young for most other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been taking applications since March,'' said Erthale
Barnes, a Montgomery County Department of Human Services
supervisor. ``We provide students with academic enrichment programs
and work experience throughout the summer.'' After they take life
skills and pre-employment classes, students are placed in
prearranged jobs in the business community at $5.46 an hour, Barnes
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce also is involved in putting
teen-agers to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a Web site that holds over 2,400 jobs open in the
Miami Valley,'' said Wendy Smith, work force development manager.
``Some are internships or summer jobs for teen-agers, and we
encourage companies to get these jobs on our Web site at every
level,'' she said. The address is www.nationjob.com/dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Web site is also the main site used by the Job Bank,
located at the Montgomery County Job Center, a resource center for
job seekers. It's free and it's a great place for teen-agers to go
to access the internet. They have about 30 computers, as well as
copiers and fax machines, plus career guide books.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those teen-agers who want to leave the county and have
fun working at an amusement park, Paramount Kings Island hires up
to 4,000 employees during peak season. The park holds a job fair
every January and February but continues to hire all summer long,
stated Jeffrey Siebert, marketing communications area manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can come here during park hours, fill out an application,
and we interview them on the spot,'' he said. ``We also offer
internships to high school seniors who want to enter the field of
marketing, public relations or advertising.'' Siebert said they're
taking applications now for internships.

   CANADA-BOMBING-RANGES (Tsuu T'ina, Alberta) _ It is a
little-known footnote to the military history of North America that
when wars loomed in the 20th century, military planners in Canada
and the United States repeatedly turned to the defeated native
peoples of the West and took control, through leases or outright
expropriation, of large swaths of land for bombing ranges. In the
United States, at least 16 tribes have land contaminated with the
litter of bombs. In Canada, the pattern was similar, with old
bombing ranges on about half a dozen Indian reserves, ranging from
British Columbia to Ontario. By James Brooke.

<P>
   SCHOOLS-CHEATING (Potomac, Md.) _ Six students at the highly
regarded Potomac Elementary School complained at home about some
odd things they noticed about the way their fifth-grade state
achievement tests were administered last month. They thereby
precipitated the resignation of the school principal, the
suspension of a teacher, and the discovery of what officials
describe as substantial evidence of administrative cheating on a
test that lends ranking and, inevitably, cachet to the best schools

 &HT;    Seven new faces joining hit MTV show
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ It's kind of a real world: the Belfort mansion,
facing the St. Charles Avenue streetcar tracks in the Garden
District, home this year to MTV's ninth season of ``The Real
World,'' which premieres at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Greek Revival house's white pillars, a cell phone is
ringing. Somebody's explaining to somebody else about the robot
dog: the . . . stupid . . . robot . . . dog. A grandfather clock
contains a fish tank. Dozens of plain-covered books are bolted to a
wall along the stairs (``20 Reasons Why Danny Isn't Gay'' somebody
scribbled on one).
</P>
<P>
   The upstairs hall is lined with armoires; these old New Orleans
mansions didn't bother with closets (and ``Real World'' doesn't
allow interior doors). Giant metal bug sculptures hang from the
bright, funhouse walls. So do carved skeletons and local folk art
and . . . name it. One ``Real World'' cast member sums up the
unisex bathroom's decor: ``Where Martha Stewart and Busta Rhymes
got together.''
</P>
<P>
   But after 124 days, the tiny cameras and microphones planted
everywhere in this house are no longer recording each twitch and
syllable of the seven young cast members. (From January to May, a
director sat in front of 26 monitors, behind a temporary wall,
dispatching camera crews to anywhere in the house any time of day).
Their unobserved lives will take some getting used to; they're only
back inside the mansion on this sultry May morning to tout the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like what people must feel like,'' says Danny Roberts,
a University of Georgia graduate from Rockmart, Ga. about being
freshly unobserved. ``It's the oddest feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an odd sign of these unblinking times how once the reality
of a ``reality'' show ends, the real world feels not quite so real.
You'd think we'd be better acclimated to the blur by now; that as a
species we'd have contorted to the televised realityquake that
``The Real World'' has spawned in the form of ``Survivor'' and the
upcoming ``Big Brother,'' in the same way our spines shot upright
after we developed an opposable thumb.
</P>
<P>
   But after walking out of the house unrecorded for the first time
in four months the day before, the cast spent the evening screening
the season's hourlong ``Real World'' premier. They watched
themselves arriving at the house for the first time all over again,
and some got that down-the-rabbit-hole feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intriguing to walk out the door here at noon, and then
watch ourselves walk in this same door on the show,'' says Matt
Smith, a 21-year-old Georgia Tech junior from Hiawassee, in far
north Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something else, man,'' he adds of the whole ``Real
World'' experience. ``No one can prepare you for it.''
</P>
<P>
   CAST MEMBERS
</P>
<P>
   ``The Real World'' is one of MTV's highest-rated series, and it
has never been more popular: Last season's Hawaiian cast averaged
3.2 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Each year's septet becomes a kind of one-season-only,
love-'em-or-hate-'em boy-girl band. Cast members are known to
viewers _ the demographic bulge is 18- to 24-year-olds _ by their
first names , their obvious character traits (especially the
nauseating ones) and the city they lived in.
</P>
<P>
   There's a kind of paint-by-numbers method to the casting that's
designed to keep things stirred up: a gay guy, a black guy, a naive
white girl, an ambitious white guy. . . . Two thousand hours are
taped, then edited story line-style down to 22 half-hour episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a crazy chemistry experiment that can explode in
your face, or make great TV,'' says Jon Murray, who developed the
show with Mary-Ellis Bunima, former daytime soap producer.
</P>
<P>
   He adds of the show's granddaddy status amid TV's current
reality craze: `` `Big Brother' and `Survivor' wouldn't be there if
this show didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   This season's Georgians are key. Danny, 22-year-old UGA grad
(class of '99, French major), is the gay guy. A visit by his armed
forces boyfriend Paul, whom he met weeks earlier at Blake's bar in
Atlanta, is Tuesday night's most dramatic event. (Because of
possible repercussions from the military, Paul's face is blurred,
like a ``Cops'' suspect.)
</P>
<P>
   Matt, a Tech industrial design major, is the blond hip-hop moral
compass Webmaster (his Web page: www.supa-fly.com). He's a Life
Teen leader at Atlanta's Christ the King Catholic Church, and in
New Orleans he attended mass daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them both _ they had the biggest lasting effect,'' says
Julie, the questing, wide-eyed Mormon chick. ``Danny is so tolerant
and such an awesome person. And Matt is a genuine, caring person.
And he has such a cute butt!''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Kelley, the babe, from Arkansas, playing up the small-town
roots she shares with Danny and Matt: ``Georgia just makes a good
buncha boys _ there's some good breedin' down there.''
</P>
<P>
   TWO SMALL TOWN GUYS
</P>
<P>
   Danny and Matt aren't much alike, except for coming from small
towns, moving to Atlanta and winding up in ``The Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny and I would allude to Atlanta about every three
minutes,'' says Matt. ``It was, `In Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   this . . . ' and `In Atlanta that. . . . ' ''
</P>
<P>
   Danny's biggest accomplishment was exiting Rockmart.
``Everything I did there was about getting the hell out.'' He left
for UGA. He planned to teach high school French, but hated student
teaching. He landed a job with an Atlanta accounting firm.
``Everything that happened after college has been a complete
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed up for a ``Real World'' audition ``to escape.'' He
hadn't watched the show in five years, but made the final cut,
among 35,000 applicants, last December. He came out to his parents
on Christmas Eve. ``A nice Christmas present for my folks,'' he
sighs. ``I wouldn't think of coming here without telling them
first.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows he's the show's Gay Guy _ ``It's definitely part of my
package, but it's not all of my package'' _ and his relationship
with Paul is a vital part of the season. Like his housemates, Danny
says the ``Real World'' experience was an emotional, Freudian
roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I didn't think I'd be able to finish, and
times I was on a natural high,'' he says. ``It was day to day. Your
natural moods are increased tenfold _ there's so much in this
environment to annoy you. ``But I learned an important lesson in
life: how to listen.'' I had a big ego before I came here and
didn't listen to anyone. The majority of people here have their
egos blown up. People were really wanting to be the center of
attention, and not just because of the camera. You get to a point
where you tune the cameras out.''
</P>
<P>
   Each cast member went every Monday into a ``confessional'': a
private room where they were interviewed about the week before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was out of the interviews that I learned about myself,
having people questioning me about things I'd said and done,''
Danny says.
</P>
<P>
   Is he ready to have it all out there on TV?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no choice,'' he says. ``But just thinking about seeing
myself on TV weirds me out right now.''
</P>
<P>
   REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE
</P>
<P>
   Matt wanted out of Hiawassee, but not because he hated it. He
loved it. He just wanted more. More . . . everything.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to be an artist, but when he got to Tech, he also
wanted something practical. Solution: industrial design. He was
active in clubs, hosted a video show on the Georgia Tech Cable
Network. When a GTCN segment on a ``Real World'' audition fell
through, he made his own audition tape. ``I'm about knocking on
doors,'' he says. ``If you don't knock, they'll never open.'' He
describes MTV's final-cut phone call as ``the most intense moment
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt was more prepared than most for living with six new
roommates: His parents took a total of 38 foster children into
their home while he was growing up. But even that wasn't quite up
to what he faced in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house was a whirlpool of relating _ it was a shock,
people all hours of the day wanting to relate,'' he says.
``Sometimes I just wanted to tell everyone to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, fun, exciting, trying _ nothing like this ever
happened to me. Two thirds of the way into it, I asked myself why I
came here. But I came out a confident, happy man. I'm more
fine-tuned in my communicating skills. You have to communicate with
six weirdos _ we're all weirdos _ all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have to talk and cry and fight about everything.
I'm not about that. I thrive off being productive. So I did a lot
of reading and Web design, while they were relating 24 hours a day.
`How do you feel? How do you feel?' Almost makes you want to puke
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   So was his ``Real World'' experience real?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it absolute reality? No. In reality, there are no
cameras,'' Matt says. ``But nothing could have been done to make it
more real.''
</P>
<P>
   Really.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood was stunned last summer when Kenn Viselman's Itsy
Bitsy Entertainment Co. beat out several big studios for the
merchandising and film rights to the Eloise books, the classic
1950s children's series about a cheeky little girl who lives in the
Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. Variety called it ``not just an itsy
bitsy surprise: it was a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Viselman was enchanted by Eloise's comic antics, it
wasn't just the appeal of the character that turned his head. As
the man behind the marketing of ``Teletubbies,'' Viselman saw in
the Eloise books a long-term brand franchise that could be
transformed into everything from dolls to a television series to a
string of feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can build a brand or you can build a movie franchise: a
brand generates a lot more money and a lot more exposure over
time,'' Viselman said. ``A successful book will sell 100,000
copies. A hundred million is a successful movie, but a successful
licensing program can do $1 billion in its first year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eloise licensing program is still in its infancy, so exactly
how much revenue it generates remains to be seen. But one thing is
certain: in this year of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, Eloise will
have lots of famous company from the world of children's
literature: Dr. Seuss' Grinch, ``Clifford the Big Red Dog'' by
Norman Bridwell and ``Curious George'' by H.A. and Margaret Rey.
</P>
<P>
   All are getting expanded merchandising, from key chains and
lunch boxes to puzzles and CD-ROMs, as the licensing of children's
book characters becomes a story in itself.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight is on book characters at a moment when movie
marketing has slowed and Harry Potter has captured the imagination
of millions. The Potter books _ the latest one will be published
next month _ are the most obvious touchstones. But the exploitation
of book characters also fits into a trend of conservatism in the
often-brazen world of licensing.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the wariness emanates from the outrageous
expectations and hype of films like last summer's ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' Book characters, in contrast, are
recognizable brand names with an established fan base that
presumably makes them easier to sell as broader media and
merchandising properties. Classic books also appeal to adults, who
are the gatekeepers in the children's market.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Eloise and the others will be on display at Licensing
2000 International, the annual trade show of the International
Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association, which opens Tuesday
at the Javits Convention Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of buzz around Harry Potter and around Eloise _
these are two very big deals,'' said Charles M. Riotto, president
of the trade group. ``But it's part of the whole trend. Even before
Potter or without it, you'd still see this move into building the
publishing segment. There's a higher comfort level to deal with
properties that have an established audience base.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers, which has the worldwide rights for Harry
Potter, will begin releasing selected products based on the first
book in the fall, with another round next year linked to release of
a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   The Universal Studios Consumer Products Group, a unit of Seagram
has awarded licenses to 70 companies to produce merchandise tied to
the holiday release of Dr. Seuss' ``How The Grinch Stole
Christmas!'' directed by Ron Howard and starring Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   And after years as a book, ``Clifford The Big Red Dog'' is being
turned by Scholastic Entertainment into a television series on PBS
this fall, with the actor John Ritter as the voice of Clifford and
the Nickelodeon star Kel Mitchell as the voice of his friend
T-bone.
</P>
<P>
   Itsy Bitsy Entertainment will turn Eloise _ who made her debut
as a fancy doll at F.A.O. Schwarz _ into the first of several
feature films next year and is also working on an animated
children's series.
</P>
<P>
   Universal has awarded licenses to 150 companies to produce
Curious George products _ triple the number of companies three
years ago _ and it plans to bring the little monkey to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The licensing of children's book characters is not new. Indeed,
licensing based on the characters of Beatrix Potter, which include
Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin, dates back almost a century, and
there are a lot of perennial favorites like ``Winnie The Pooh'' and
``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the business of licensing publishing properties
saw a 33 percent increase in royalty revenues to $40 million,
according to a study by the licensing industry association. Even
some adult book series are benefiting, like ``Chicken Soup for the
Soul,'' which is now a television series and a board game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literary properties are great assets because they have a
history and a familiarity,'' said Dan Romanelli, the president of
Warner Brothers Worldwide Consumer Products. ``Today there is some
risk involved in any business, but when you have 20 million books
sold like Harry Potter, and a fourth about to be released, you know
that there's continuity, and that's difficult to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is no one big movie this year, like ``The Lion
King'' or ``Jurassic Park,'' that would drive a huge merchandising
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry is wary. Walt Disney, a virtual marketing
machine, has not had a blockbuster movie merchandising property for
some time, said Viselman. The Star Wars film generated an estimated
$1 billion in retail sales, but that was not always enough for
companies to cover the cost of the licenses and still make a
profit. Producers saturated the market, and some retailers were
stuck with too many products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation of how much you could do got so out of hand
that people lost all sense of reality as to what was possible,''
said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of The Licensing Letter in
New York. ``It was a marketing machine that fed on itself, and a
lot of people ended up paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers say it is exactly this kind of fad-chasing that
is playing into the growth of treasured book characters. At
Scholastic Inc., the executive vice president Deborah Forte said
she sensed a growing weariness among retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this hype for a six-week window, and then they have to
find the next big thing,'' Forte said. ``I think the longevity and
sustainability of publishing properties tends to be better than
some of the just-media properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Overpromotion is a concern in expanding book characters as well,
and Viselman and others said they were carefully controlling
expansion of their product to avoid saturation. Warner is so
concerned about keeping a brand franchise for Harry Potter over the
long term that it went to Madison Avenue for help and hired Grey
Advertising to advise the company on building a brand.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the book character trend is just one inside the $74
billion licensing industry that spans a broad spectrum of
businesses and pop culture. The publishing category generated some
$1.3 billion in retail sales last year, a tiny portion compared
with huge categories like the $17.9 billion business of corporate
branding, or the $15.9 billion in licensed retail sales from the
entertainment industry, according to The Licensing Letter.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the classics are coming to life now by sheer
happenstance. The Eloise books became available after the death in
July 1998 of the author, Kay Thompson, who did not market the
property. And licensing around Dr. Seuss occurred after the widow
of the author Theodor Seuss Geisel learned that copyright laws
required that she use the rights or risk losing them.
</P>
<P>
   One big reason books make popular licensing is that they have
inherent value as an educational tool. Parents, who wield some
control over these purchases, often prefer book properties in a
world where shielding children from violent and inappropriate
material is a daily chore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books in world culture are viewed as very important and
well-respected,'' said Nancy Cushing-Jones, Universal Consumer
Products' president for publishing rights. ``A good book has an
intrinsic value that a T-shirt doesn't have. And the process of
bonding with kids through reading is extremely important.''
</P>
<P>
   But Seth Siegel, co-chairman of the Beanstalk Group, a licensing
agency and consulting firm in New York, said the entire trend was
simply entertainment licensing, albeit inspired from books. He said
the classics had been around forever, but the products did not move
off the shelves until they were made into a media property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't elevated literary properties,'' he said. ``We've
just given Hollywood another way of taking pop culture icons and
turning them into images that can be absorbed by the mass
population.''
</P>
<P>
   And what will become of it all? Siegel predicts a rash of
children's stories will be turned into films followed by a few wild
successes and then, the inevitable losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then one day we'll be reading a trend report that says
properties based on books don't work,'' Siegel said. ``I think it
was Balzac that once said all fashion ends in excess. He was
speaking of something else. But he should have been speaking of the
licensing industry.''

LET ARTISTIC GRAY AREAS BE, AS LONG AS TRUTH IS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given how many things _ politics, economics, cultural moods and
movements _ we preface with amorphous terms like ``post,''
``trans,'' ``global'' and ``multi,'' we're clearly in a state of
high anxiety about how to define them. Definitions mean boundaries,
and all of these terms make clear that the boundaries we once knew
are disappearing. At most we have borders now, meant to be crossed,
redrawn or erased.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the furor over the Tony-winning show ``Contact.'' It was
nominated as a musical. It is all dance and music built around
three revuelike sketches, one in pantomime. But the American
Federation of Musicians protested the use of tape instead of live
music. So did others, Tony voters among them.
</P>
<P>
   A musical must have an original score, people I spoke to said.
(The dances in ``Contact'' use an antic mix of music: classical,
jazz and rock; Tchaikovsky, Bizet, Stephane Grapelli, Benny
Goodman, ``Do You Wanna Dance?,'' ``Runaround Sue'' and more.) What
kind of encouragement does this give to lazy, cynical producers who
don't want to risk money on more expensive productions with new
music that the public must learn to love?
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the musical can't thrive without new composers.
But consider the cultural crimes that have been committed in their
name? No sooner did Andrew Lloyd Webber loosen his hold on Broadway
than Frank Wildhorn and Elton John arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The best new composers and lyricists are getting their start in
small houses off Broadway's beaten, musically abused track.
``Contact'' imitators aren't likely to be anywhere near as smart or
talented as its choreographer and director, Susan Stroman, or its
book writer, John Weidman. But that's always the case with
imitators, whatever they're copying.
</P>
<P>
   The musical has been in such bad shape for so long that I'm game
for all experiments. Call ``Contact'' a dance play or a musical
performance piece; invent a new category for shows that put music,
movement and language together in unpredictable ways.
</P>
<P>
   However it's done, let a show like ``Contact'' stir people to
keep inventing musicals instead of copying them. Its form was
unusual, but its impulse was primal. It showed us that musicals
don't exist except to convince us that the people onstage always
feel a song coming on, and therefore, in the succinct words of Gene
Kelly, ``Gotta dance, gotta dance, gotta dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Literature, too, is in something of a tizzy over definitions,
appropriations, genres and such. Fiction and nonfiction use each
other's techniques. History and fantasy combine forces; memory is
both lying and truth-telling. And nowhere is all of this clearer
than in the historical novel.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the furor that broke out a few weeks ago over Susan
Sontag's historical novel ``In America'' (Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux).
It was based on the life of the great Polish actress Helena
Modjeska, who emigrated to the United States in 1876 and lived a
glamorous and dazzling life.
</P>
<P>
   Sontag has been accused of taking passages from the works of
historians, journalists and Modjeska herself that are virtually
unchanged and unacknowledged beyond a briefly expressed debt to
``material and anecdotes used and altered.''
</P>
<P>
   And naturally other writers of historical fiction, as well as
historians, began debating the conjunction between what you invent
and what you borrow, and what you need to tell the reader about
this process. Some go no further than acknowledging the libraries
where they did their research. Others supply short bibliographies.
I suspect it's often a struggle: What novelist doesn't want to get
as much credit as possible for creativity and inventiveness?
</P>
<P>
   Sontag's solution, as reported in The New York Times on May 27,
was to dismiss the historians and journalists in question, along
with Modjeska, as being merely information sources, not writers.
She said that while they supplied the raw matter, she produced a
work of art. But what interested me most in the end was the
question of how history _ fact if you will _ shapes
characterization.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing her surprise that Modjeska scholars were not
thrilled, Sontag concluded: ``She was a great figure. I made her
into a marvelous person. The real Modjeska was a horrible racist.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I thought, the race card does pop up in unexpected places.
Sontag certainly tries to make her heroine marvelous by propping
her up with period dialogue, letters, journals and aphoristic
musings.
</P>
<P>
   But I would much rather read about a woman of great talent and
charisma _ a marvelous creature indeed _ who was also a woman with
monstrous beliefs. I want to feel and understand all of this. I
don't want things to be prettified and simplified in the name of
literary uplift.
</P>
<P>
   While I was thinking about all this, a 12-year-old friend with
excellent taste recommended a historical novel that she loved, Ann
Rinaldi's ``Hang a Thousand Trees With Ribbons''(Gulliver
Books/Harcourt Brace).
</P>
<P>
   It was about yet another immigrant artist (an immigrant by
force, not choice), the 18th-century slave and poet Phillis
Wheatley. And it presented a good test; I am not alone in having
always found poor Phillis an aesthetic trial and psychological
embarrassment, despite her interest historically.
</P>
<P>
   She was taught to read and write by her relatively enlightened
Boston owners, petted and coddled as she began to write poems, and
then examined on her Greek, Latin and verse by a group of
Massachusetts men who included the governor and John Hancock. It
was then certified that she had indeed written the poems in
question.
</P>
<P>
   One heard from childhood about her precociousness, her piety and
her well-behaved poems. What could one feel besides pity or
contempt for lines like these, in ``On being brought from AFRICA to
AMERICA''?
</P>
<P>
   'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
</P>
<P>
   Taught my benighted soul to understand
</P>
<P>
   That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too;
</P>
<P>
   Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.
</P>
<P>
   Rinaldi doesn't quote these lines in her novel. She quotes very
few of Wheatley's proper, Alexander Pope-inspired, acutely
melancholy poems. She gives us the Phillis Wheatley who had to
learn how to be pious and conventional _ the price of a slave
girl's education _ and who sometimes fought, sometimes embraced her
role as the symbol of how a debased race might prove itself worthy
of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She shows us how the writing, which always had to meet the
approval of her owners and their friends and doubting publishers,
was as much genteel bondage as intellectual or spiritual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   She gives us a spunky, high-strung Phillis Wheatley, but also a
Phillis who is crushingly dependent on the kindness of strangers
who become first her owners and then her family. She needs to
believe in some form of salvation, and she needs to display
spiritual obedience. Thanks to Rinaldi, I now understand what it
took for her to write the next lines of that poem, the only racial
defense that Puritan Boston and Christian Britain would understand.
</P>
<P>
   Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
</P>
<P>
   ``Their colour is a diabolic die.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Christians, Negros black as Cain,
</P>
<P>
   May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.
</P>
<P>
   Do I like these lines any better than I did before? No. But now
I understand the circumstances and the needs that make her
admirable, infuriating and, almost unbearably, sad.
</P>
<P>
   Give us the infuriating, the shameful and the horrible. The
purely noble and marvelous are much too simple.

NEW ECONOMY COLUMN: TECHNOLOGY STOCK SLUMP HASN'T EASED MANPOWER
CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the recent sell-off in technology stocks and the steady
drumbeat of failing dot-coms, the search for the best
high-technology employees continues. And recruiting them still
takes extreme measures _ not the least of which is learning the
names of potential recruits.
</P>
<P>
   One ploy currently in vogue _ with many variations on the theme
_ has a headhunter call a company, posing as a prospective date who
has lost the name and phone number of the nice guy she met at the
gym the night before. ``He said he was director of engineering,''
the headhunter confides to the company receptionist, who can't help
but oblige by producing a name and extension. In another ruse, a
recruiter phones a company's front desk and pretends to be the
manager of the new restaurant that just opened up down the street:
``We'd like to send everybody in marketing a gift certificate for a
free lunch. Now if I could just get their names.''
</P>
<P>
   And so goes the race to hire away the best minds of the
information technology industry. Even as some dot-com companies
hand out pink slips, true high-technology jobs remain a employee's
market, with far more jobs than job candidates. Microsoft, which
has not let its antitrust travails slow its talent search,
currently has 3,000 unfilled positions. Cisco Systems hires 3,000
people every quarter _ if it can find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the point of view of companies trying to hire, this has
been the worst few years in the history of the planet,'' said John
Holman, a San Francisco recruiter. The hardest workers to find are
technical ones _ software designers, test engineers, programmers.
And start-ups are also plagued by a shortage of managers.
</P>
<P>
   While demand for workers shows no sign of abating, what has
changed recently is what it takes to lure away a new senior-level
employee: cash. Stock options, particularly in companies not yet
public, have considerably less allure than they did just a few
months ago, according to the recruiters helping to craft
compensation packages.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, executives changing jobs might have agreed to
pay cuts as long as they received plenty of stock options. Now,
though, companies are finding they must pay more in salary and
options, as well as a bonus and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   Pay for a marketing vice president now runs between $170,000 and
$250,000 plus stock options and, often, a bonus. That compares with
top salaries of about $150,000 six months ago. And potential
employees are scrutinizing companies' financing and management more
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would rather go to more established companies,'' said
Valerie Frederickson, president of a high-technology recruiting
company in Menlo Park, Calif., that bears her name, so they need
not worry about when or if a promised initial public stock offering
actually happens. ``Employees are getting angry that their
companies are delaying their IPOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederickson did note that layoffs at smaller Internet companies
had helped create a noticeable increase in job candidates in May.
</P>
<P>
   David Pritchard, Microsoft's head of recruiting, said there was
no end in sight to the shortage of workers, though he added that
competition from Internet start-ups for new recruits had
diminished. ``Given what's been happening in the stock market
lately, people are looking a little less at the big payoff that the
dot-coms are offering,'' he said. ``When candidates have a
competing offer, we tell them to go do some research.''
</P>
<P>
   Holman, the recruiter, said he, too, had noticed greater caution
on the part of job candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine months ago, you could say to someone at Hewlett-Packard,
`Sure, we're going to pay you less, but your stock may soon be
worth $50 million,''' Holman said. ``Now, that same stock looks
like it will be worth only $10 million. It's a change in the
risk-reward trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Thomas Blanco, who just last month took a job at a
publicly traded Internet music company in San Francisco after a
year at a telecommunications company and 20 years in banking before
that. He spoke on condition that his current employer not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   A human resources director, Blanco had considered a competing
offer from an Internet start-up that planned to go public soon, but
he decided the risk was not worth it. Had he been making the move a
few months earlier, before the Nasdaq's dive in April, he said his
decision might have been different. ``I knew that the number of
IPOs from here on would be smaller,'' Blanco said.
</P>
<P>
   To lure new hires, companies continue to add perks, including
catered dinners on a daily basis. In a recent survey by Deloitte &AMP;
Touche of chief executives at high-technology companies, a quarter
said they offered their employees free meals at work. Six percent
said they allowed employees to bring pets to work. Other flourishes
included in-house gyms, dry cleaning and even flu shots.
</P>
<P>
   But few things beat more money. Back in February, Microsoft's
management in Redmond, Wash., raised salaries in the company's
Silicon Valley operations 15 percent across-the-board. That move
came after Microsoft concluded that it would otherwise be unable to
compete in the Northern California job market, where housing costs
and living expenses were far higher than in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And in April, Microsoft's president and chief executive, Steve
Ballmer, announced a new companywide stock option program. The hope
was to bolster the confidence of current employees and attract new
ones in light of both the lower stock price and the vagaries of the
government's intention to split the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq uncertainty is not scaring everyone away from start-ups.
Michael Marrow, an executive with more than 10 years experience in
providing outsourced customer service, recently signed on as chief
operating officer of a new company called ShipServ, which plans to
develop an e-commerce marketplace for the deep-sea shipping
industry. He turned down more lucrative offers in order to ``create
something that has not been created before,'' he said, despite the
fact that other dot-coms were facing layoffs and delayed stock
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a 25-year-old programmer,'' Marrow said. ``I know
there are not guarantees, that the payoff may be further down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, joining a start-up is still considered boot camp for
managing larger companies. In fact, Frederickson said some of her
clients in large, established corporations would consider only
candidates with some experience at companies before they went
public. ``You have to get your ticket punched at a pre-IPO company
or you don't get any respect,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference now, she says, is job candidates may want more
cash along with the respect.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: IN TV GAMES OF `LET'S PRETEND,' REALITY LURKS
</HEADLINE>
  By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dressed in authentic Victorian clothing, members of the Bowler
family step inside 50 Elliscombe Road, the 19th-century house in
suburban London that will be their home for three months. They have
agreed to live there as their ancestors would have _ without
telephones, computers, dishwashers (or detergent, shampoo, tampons)
_ except their ancestors weren't televised, as the Bowlers will be.
</P>
<P>
   The house, stripped of all modern trappings and painstakingly
refurbished, is a pristine example of turn-of-the-century
middle-class propriety. After gasping at the elegance, the family
matriarch, Joyce Bowler, says slyly of her new home, ``It's an
original, but I'm a fake.''
</P>
<P>
   With this, the excellent new PBS reality show ``1900 House,''
(which the network is coyly billing as a ``docu-soap''),
immediately distinguishes itself from the pack. While capitalizing
on our apparently insatiable voyeurism, this British-produced
four-part miniseries (which begins Monday) has a sense of humor
about itself, a quality noticeably absent from CBS's ``Survivor''
and even from MTV's coltish ``The Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference: You can emerge from the ``1900 House''
experience with new insight, not only into the obvious (differences
between life then and now) but also into the nature of reality
itself. Or at least the nature of reality as television presents it
these days.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Survivor,'' which had its premier on May 31, 16 men and
women were stranded _ with a camera crew _ on a deserted island.
Every week they vote to eject one person. The final ``survivor''
wins $1 million. Later this summer on ``Big Brother,'' CBS installs
a group of people in a house under nonstop surveillance. Every week
the audience votes someone out, with a half-million-dollar prize to
the last remaining tenant.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday's season premiere of ``The Real World'' seven
strangers, all young and attractive, move together into a house in
New Orleans, where they will spend the next few weeks producing
their own cable-access show. Will they get along? Who will sleep
with whom?
</P>
<P>
   The CBS ``Survivor'' Web site, cbs.com/survivor, which is more
interesting and complex than the show itself, does venture a bit of
anthropologic theorizing: ``The behavior of B.B. (the 62-year-old
real-estate developer who was kicked off the island last week) and
Joel closely matched that of Rwanda's Silverback gorillas,'' says
one article about two of the island dwellers. ``In every tribe of
gorillas one dominant male assumes control. No other male is
allowed to mate with the group's female gorillas or lead the group
in any way. Through age and infirmity, a dominant male can lose his
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Shows like ``Survivor'' and ``The Real World'' seem most like
the audience participation segment at an improvisational theater,
performed by amateurs but cleverly packaged by entertainment
professionals. By carefully choosing their subjects and settings,
the producers can almost predict possible scenarios and edit the
material accordingly. Unlike actual reality, which is distressingly
random and unedited, these shows fall into a predictable pattern.
There will be quarrels, flirtations, danger and revulsion. On
``Survivor,'' bugs have already been eaten.
</P>
<P>
   What do we learn about the human condition? People apparently
enjoy watching other people's pettiness and problems, even when the
people themselves aren't all that interesting. The ``Survivor''
ratings, already high, increased for the second show and topped
those of the ratings Goliath ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
People (in general and on these shows) in their early 20s are
obsessed with themselves and sex: ``The Real World'' entices with
the prospect of a good-looking young man who shocks the group by
declaring that he intends to remain a virgin until marriage.
</P>
<P>
   These shows are very different from old reality television,
which earnestly believed in truth with a capital T. Most famous was
``An American Family,'' the PBS series _ controversial in the '70s
_ which followed the Loud family right through the breakup of the
parents' marriage. On the other hand ``Candid Camera'' planted the
seeds for ``Survivor,'' by contriving situations in which people
could be ``caught in the act of being themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``1900 House,'' too, plays to our desire for story and drama,
indulging our increasing cultural inability to digest unsweetened
information. So the Bowler family undergoes its share of
deprivation and reacts with satisfying outbursts of temper and
frustration, and subsequent reconciliation and renewal.
</P>
<P>
   But this series has a larger purpose that it fulfills with great
success. The Bowlers know from the outset that the only prize
they'll win is knowledge, about the Victorian era and about
themselves. There is no cash award. In a clip from the Bowlers'
audition interview (they were chosen from more than 400
applicants), Joyce explains that she wants to know if her family is
held together by 20th-century technology. Can its members be happy
without it?
</P>
<P>
   Designed as an experiment rather than a contest, ``1900 House''
tries to honor its documentary duty. The producers present not only
the family's travails but lots of miscellaneous information about
the Victorian era, including the kind of earthy detail Edith
Wharton couldn't divulge (about feminine hygiene, for example).
</P>
<P>
   A narrator periodically informs us about the hardships: the
dearth of hot water for baths, the terrifying rate of infant
mortality (one in four children didn't survive past age 6) and
household dangers like wallpaper containing arsenic.
</P>
<P>
   Fashionably, the producers have made the process part of the
program. The first episode is devoted to the enormous task of
refurbishing the house and choosing the family. This proves to be
surprisingly engaging, in part because the man who does much of the
explaining _ a social historian named Daru Rooke _ turns out to be
perfectly cast. A mild, balding man in his 30s, he's like a good
character actor playing a crucial secondary part, the fellow who
help moves the plot along. (Such men are valuable in life, too, but
appear more frequently on television.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   During the selection it would become obvious who couldn't stand
yesterday's realities. ``If we go more than two weeks without a
proper curry, I mean a proper Indian curry, we become very
irritable,'' says one of the fathers who wasn't picked.
</P>
<P>
   A consulting psychologist explains why the Bowlers were chosen:
``They have a sense of adventure, a good sense of humor, and
they're also quite comfortable with the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   All true, but even the good-natured Bowlers will become cranky
at times. After their initial infatuation with the house subsides,
they learn some hard truths about Victorian life, even for a
comfortable middle-class family. The indoor light was gloomy, the
food was bland, and people were more pungent because it was so
difficult to wash clothes and bodies. And there was an awful lot of
family togetherness, too much, perhaps, for people accustomed to
the diversions of television, movies, computers and Gameboys.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce, who dragged her husband and four children into this
adventure, emerges as the leading lady. A small, thoughtful
44-year-old, she offers a running commentary on her expectations
and disappointments. Her battle with the demands and restrictions
on a Victorian woman fulfills both the program's documentary and
dramatic needs. The roots of feminism are easy to see.
</P>
<P>
   Her real struggles with her whalebone corset brought to mind a
vivid description from a Louisa May Alcott novel, ``Eight
Cousins,'' written in 1875. The heroine is Rose, a young orphan
girl being raised by her uncle, a doctor with radical ideas. When
he finds out someone has tried to put a corset on the girl, he
asks, ``Have you lost your senses that you can for a moment dream
of putting a growing girl into an instrument of torture like
this?''
</P>
<P>
   But Joyce's true awakening comes when she decides to hire a maid
(who has to agree to abide by the show's rules while working at 50
Elliscombe Road). Thrilled with her new-found freedom (without a
machine, the laundry alone consumed three days a week), Joyce goes
to the library. She reads about the burgeoning feminist movement
and feels at one with the suffragists. But her appeal lies in her
self-awareness, as both would-be suffragist and quasi-actress, so
she soon feels guilty about having someone else _ a woman no less _
cleaning up after her.
</P>
<P>
   In an act that seems chivalrous to her, she decides to let the
maid go, but is too cowardly to do it in person. She fires her by
mail. This shocks and wounds the maid _ who in fact is an actual
maid, like her mother and grandmother _ and makes Joyce feel
ashamed. This sort of no-win situation feels very real.
</P>
<P>
   The others have their own problems and pleasures. The husband,
Paul, has to shave with a straight razor and the teen-age daughter,
Kathryn, is overwhelmed by her unshampooed ``dirty, smelly, greasy,
skanky'' hair. Nine-year-old Joe refuses to eat almost everything.
The 11-year-old twin girls, however, adapt best, concocting
theatrical performances with paper-doll puppets and a homemade
stage and otherwise amusing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, reflecting on their experience, Joyce says she would
like to be able to say the family will change. ``You have to make
more time _ more thought _ more time for each other,'' she says.
Kathryn, on the other hand, can't wait for the family's first stop
after vacating the ``1900 House,'' at Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to sympathize with Kathryn. Maybe soon all of us will
reach our saturation point with artificial reality (though the
climbing ratings of ``Survivor'' indicate that soon may be later).
Maybe after watching ``1900 House'' everyone should turn off the
television for a while. Consider the words of the French
existentialist Albert Camus, born just after the Victorian age, in
1913.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a sin against life,'' wrote Camus, ``it consists
perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another
life and in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a group of grandmothers from Atlanta were running the
Internet, there would be no chat rooms and absolutely no government
involvement. And they would enlist Bill Gates, the church and the
United Nations to help them oversee the global network.
</P>
<P>
   College students, on the other hand, want the CIA, the National
Security Agency and the Internal Revenue Service involved, since,
as they see it, ``these people pretty much run who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman from Nebraska suggested that Oprah Winfrey would make
a good Internet watchdog. The candid and sometimes contradictory
opinions were offered in focus groups held around the country the
last two weeks as the Markle Foundation began taking what may be
the first comprehensive look at public attitudes about the
Internet, its regulation and governance and online privacy and
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The results from the 10 two-hour sessions, with groups of six to
eight people, offered only preliminary insights and were mainly
intended to help the researchers narrow their focus and redefine
their questions before beginning more in-depth surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions were perhaps most significant in underscoring the
complex and tough task facing policy makers around the world as
they seek to govern the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Participants seemed to trust business over government to
regulate the Internet. On privacy and fraud, they echoed the call
of buyer beware. When pressed, however, most seemed to expect some
type of rules or protections. And few knew anything about
consumer-protection programs implemented by Internet companies or
about a new international body that administers the Internet's
system of domain names.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe Baird, president of the New York-based foundation, a
nonprofit organization, said the goal of the six-month survey and
follow-up research was to dig beyond public opinion polls to see
how people really feel about and act on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to conduct a test to figure out if what people
are saying is in response to what they have read and heard or what
they really do,'' Baird said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, polls show that the public is concerned about
whether their privacy is protected on the Internet. Many say they
would never give out private information like credit cards numbers.
But, researchers are asking, would they change their minds when
offered a $20 gift certificate?
</P>
<P>
   The final report, to be published in September, is intended both
to engage the public in Internet policy discussion and to provide a
basis for lawmakers and companies to develop intelligent, long-term
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these focus groups are beginning to show, these are very
complicated issues,'' Baird said. ``We hope this will help in
developing and understanding what policies are sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   The research is being conducted with Greenberg Quinlan Research
Inc., a Washington public policy research firm. To begin the study,
focus groups were held recently in Omaha, Atlanta, Scottsdale,
Ariz., and Syosset, N.Y. Participants included adults between 18
and 75, split between Internet users and nonusers.
</P>
<P>
   Because the focus group participants were promised anonymity,
the foundation provided only first names and ages of participants.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Greenberg, who is leading the research, said he was
struck by the shift in attitudes about whether government should
try to regulate the network. In a study he did two years ago for
the Direct Marketing Association, he said, people were more
inclined to want government to try to regulate things like
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't understand the Internet as well,'' he said.
``They understand more now about the difficulty of regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even older people who have never used the Internet
seemed hesitant over the prospect of new laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it's the one thing that government doesn't control,''
said Evaughn, a 69-year-old retired federal worker from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she and others in her group thought there should be some
rules. Evaughn even brought in an e-mail message from someone she
knew that discussed the case of a young girl who had been lured by
an online sexual predator.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for anybody to be in chat rooms,'' she
added, saying they were dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The questions and exercises in the focus groups tried to explore
participants' attitudes about online privacy and to get a sense of
what kind of groups they would want running the global network.
</P>
<P>
   Although initially most people said they were hesitant about
having government involved, many seemed to think that the Federal
Trade Commission's recent request to Congress to pass basic rules
for how companies handle personal information collected online had
some merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have the right to know where your stuff is
going,'' said Kristin, an 18-year-old restaurant worker in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Most participants said they were wary of giving away personal
information. But during simulations, few seemed to recognize the
seal of a popular program called TrustE, begun by the industry to
certify sites that comply with basic privacy standards. And most
acknowledged that they never read the privacy policies posted by
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   During a discussion about information that companies have
compiled on people on the Internet and elsewhere, Donna, a
21-year-old nurse from Long Island, said, ``Everybody can find
anything, so forget about it _ we should all just crawl in a
shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, she said she still shops online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should just stop giving stuff out on the Internet, but
it's so convenient,'' she said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   On the topic of Internet regulation, only one person had heard
of the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, a
nonprofit group appointed by the Clinton administration to oversee
the administrative functions of the Internet and set rules for its
addressing systems.
</P>
<P>
   Though when asked what kind of group they would appoint to run
the network, most called for a group similar to that Icann is
trying to put together _ one that is international and run by
Internet companies and individual users.
</P>
<P>
   And in nearly every focus group, a top choice to be part of that
board was Gates, the Microsoft Corp. chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Although most groups said the United Nations should be involved,
few wanted any other government representation. But many of the
older women thought the church or a theologian should be involved,
``someone with morals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should put Oprah on there,'' said one middle-aged
woman in Omaha. ``She has a lot of pull. She'd be pulling for all
of us. She has a loud voice with good morals. She's always for the
underdog.''

NEW YORK CITY BALLET APPOINTS BRITON AS MUSIC DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Ballet has named Andrea Quinn, the
music director of the Royal Ballet in London, as its new music
director.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Quinn, 35, a conductor whose experience has
included work with major opera and symphony orchestras as well as
the recording of Paul McCartney's recent composition, ``Tuesday,''
ends an unabashedly public search by the company. In the last two
years 12 guest conductors, including Quinn, have led the City
Ballet's orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to find a music director to succeed Gordon Boelzner,
who has been ill, came in the wake of complaints from the company's
artistic management and members of the public about the
inconsistent quality of the musicians' performances.
</P>
<P>
   A monthlong strike by the orchestra's members last winter was
settled after they agreed to a formal commitment stating that City
Ballet is their primary employer and to new work rules that will
not permit outside engagements to affect rehearsals and performance
at City Ballet as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who will join the company officially as music director in
August 2001, went out of her way to call both the dancers and
musicians outstanding. In an interview at the end of last week at
the New York State Theater before she returned to London, she said
she looked forward to the company's range of music and to being
involved in the creation of new works. She also said she hoped the
company could sponsor independent concerts for the musicians in the
way the Royal Opera House does for its musicians.
</P>
<P>
   The works of City Ballet, which has the widest musical repertory
of any ballet company in the world, are frequently set to music,
often difficult, that is most often heard in concert halls, rather
than to scores specifically written for ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn will begin her three-year contract in 2001 after her
contract with the Royal Ballet expires. Until then she will
continue to conduct as a guest at City Ballet, and Boelzner, who
will retire after 41 years with the company, will remain music
director, a post that involves advising Peter Martins, City
Ballet's artistic director, on the choice of music. Hugo Fiorato
will remain principal conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, whose liveliness in the pit is reflected in her
conversation about music, said she had been interested in
conducting since she was a teen-ager. Born in London but brought up
mainly in the town of Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, she began
clarinet lessons at 13. At 15, she heard a recording of Brahms'
First Symphony, and ``that was that,'' she said, explaining that
the music led her to explore ``what is inside a score and find the
heartbeat.'' That, she added, is ``the wonderful part of
conducting.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying music at Nottingham University, Quinn specialized
in conducting at the Royal Academy of Music until 1989 and won two
prizes there. In 1993, she won the Conduct for Dance Competition
and was appointed music director of the London Philharmonic Youth
Orchestra. She was also guest conductor at the Birmingham Royal
Ballet in 1993-94 and became music director of the Royal Ballet in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if some of the musical repertory at City Ballet was new to
her as a conductor, she said she had not previously conducted
Stravinsky's ``Agon,'' which was written by the composer for George
Balanchine, the company's co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balanchine was so forward looking,'' she said, adding that
while she enjoyed conducting full evening 20th-century story
ballets, their scores were often fashioned out of pieces of music.
City Ballet's respect for the integrity of a score appeals to her:
``These scores are untainted by someone coming in and cutting the
music up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who has conducted the English National Opera and symphony
orchestras in Europe and Australia, expressed particular interest
in new music. Her preferred contemporary composers are James
MacMillan and Thomas Ades, both British, and Poul Ruders, a Dane.
</P>
<P>
   As City Ballet's fourth music director, she will be its first
female conductor. But she said: ``I hate being talked about as a
woman. I should be considered as a conductor.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn is married to Rod Champ, a doctor, and has two daughters.
Champ expects to qualify to practice in the United States and the
family is to join her in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think of coming without them,'' Quinn said.

NEWS ANALYSIS: NET JOURNALISM TRIES TO REGROUP AFTER LAYOFFS AND
SETBACKS
</HEADLINE>
  By FELICITY BARRINGER and ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Web journalism is usually cast as savior or savage. For some
people, online journalism is a path to interactive enlightenment
and economic liberty. But to the puritans of the old media world,
Web journalists are apostates who have confused liberty with
license and whose delusional disregard for profit can end only in
self-immolation.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for the puritans not to act smug last week.
</P>
<P>
   The aftershocks of the Nasdaq's April collapse, which had
already shaken the e-commerce world, hit news and information
sites. Salon and CBS.com both announced layoffs. And the crime news
site APBNews.com became an undead dot-com, dismissing its staff of
140, then allowing some to hang on, unpaid, while the bosses sought
new partners to bring the site back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's tremors forced analysts and other Web publishers to
conduct various forms of industry damage assessment _ and consider
what it may take to make surviving sites earthquake resistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to be terribly surprised that this sector of
the industry is going to consolidate,'' predicted Peter Petrusky,
director of new media for the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
``The future belongs to those sites that are developing multiple
revenue streams.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mooradian, an Internet analyst at Jupiter Communications,
said that the week's events clearly signaled the more cautious
approach by investors. ``It is mostly a testament to the fact that
capital availability is drying up,'' he said. ``If these guys want
to lessen their burn rates in any substantial way they have to slim
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Burn rate, of course, refers to money up in smoke. And Mooradian
noted that many of the Web companies, including online journalism
sites, had spent lavishly on marketing because they had been
assured that they would be able to raise second rounds of
financing, whether through venture capital investments, strategic
investment or public offerings. But, he said, ``that window has now
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   An exception might seem to be Inside.com, the new, richly
financed media news site led by the author and editor Kurt
Andersen. But because it takes money to burn money, some analysts
wonder how long such a site _ providing expensive, original
reporting _ can withstand budget-minded competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Take MediaNews, the daily roundup assembled by Jim Romenesko.
For a good deal less than $100,000 a year, coffee included,
Romenesko can match much of Inside.com's speed and depth on his
MediaNews site, simply by studding his digest with hyperlinks to
the work of other journalists _ including Inside.com's. ``You're
right, I rely on reporters around the world to give me the good
content, and I'm the editor,'' said Romenesko, who works for an
$80,000 annual salary from the Poynter Institute for Media
Studies..
</P>
<P>
   Even more automated is Moreover.com, founded by a former
newspaper reporter. The site uses technology that monitors content
sites for articles, then lists them as headlines and provides hot
links to originating sites _ including the Web sites of the BBC,
CNN and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Readers can customize a Moreover.com home page to get the kinds
of news they are most interested in, and other publishers can
arrange links _ as George magazine's Web site (georgemag.com) does
for Moreover's political headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters and Advance.net, the Internet arm of Advance
Publications, which owns Conde Nast, are expected to announce
Monday that, along with Soundview Ventures, they have invested $21
million in Moreover.com.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the aggregation game is not restricted to tiny
upstarts. America Online's news section draws 14 million distinct
visitors monthly, 70 percent more than the nearest old-media news
site, MSNBC.com. America Online offers wire-service dispatches from
Bloomberg News and Reuters; readers can also link to the reports of
other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   When Editor &AMP; Publisher Online did not include America Online in
a recent analysis of news sites, Gary Kebbel, director of AOL's
news, e-mailed Carl Sullivan, Editor &AMP; Publisher Online's editor,
to take issue. Kebbel contended that in many communities more
people use AOL as an online news source than use the Web sites of
their local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   So what does the trend toward sites that repackage someone
else's journalism mean for online publishers that are intent on
actually reporting, writing and editing their own material?
</P>
<P>
   Slate, the online magazine with probably the highest profile in
online journalism, has the advantage of a giant parent: Microsoft.
After Slate's debut in 1996, its early setbacks were closely
watched by the envious. And after its much-admired editor Michael
Kinsley had to abandon his attempt to lure paying subscribers, for
instance, most others did not even try.
</P>
<P>
   So far, The Wall Street Journal, with its subscription-based
Wall Street Journal Interactive online service, seems to be one of
the few news and information sites finding a steady audience of
paying customers. Meanwhile, Slate now runs promotional
advertorials _ Blue Nile diamonds, anyone? _ in its table of
contents, although the Magazine Publishers of America guidelines
ask print magazines not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   With little hope of subscription revenue, Web sites have
imitated the broadcast TV model, seeking to attract big audiences
and sell them to advertisers. And advertisers have obliged,
increasing their Web spending from $906.5 million in 1997 to $1.9
billion in 1998 and $4.6 billion in 1999, according to the Internet
Advertising Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, of that 1999 total only 8 percent went to news and
information sites, according to a report prepared for the bureau by
Pricewaterhouse. By comparison, search engines and portals, like
Yahoo.com or About.com took in 38 percent of the total.
Technology-related sites took in 18 percent; financial sites, 15
percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In search of other forms of revenue, some online publishers have
turned to licensing deals. CBS's MarketWatch.com, a leading
financial news site, owns a service called Big Chart that creates
financial charts. MarketWatch's chief executive, Larry Kramer,
estimates that while 75 percent of the site's revenue in 2000 will
probably come from advertising, most of the rest is likely to come
from licensing the chart technology to other online publishers.
</P>
<P>
   And not everyone has given up on the subscription model.
Inside.com, for example, plans to charge $217 annually for
subscriptions _ despite the rollback on subscription charges by
other high-maintenance sites with lots of original content.
</P>
<P>
   Inside.com executives contend that readers will be willing to
pay for high-quality material. But Deanna Brown, the chief
operating officer at Inside, said that the expense of the site's
comprehensive coverage was worth the freedom from old-media
constraints. The established media companies have the benefit of
established brands and experienced managers, she said. The
drawback, she said, ``is that they have legacy publications they
have to be concerned with, and they don't offer entrepreneurial
opportunities to talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Established media companies, however, do not necessarily see
their legacy publications as dead weight.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bart, editor in chief of the entertainment trade
publication Variety, contends that the best efficiencies come from
a new-media offshoot borrowing from and contributing to an
old-media original. Thus does Variety play give-and-take with its
Variety.com Web site. ``The key to the Variety site,'' he said,
``is that it is derived from the basic old brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart said that last week he hired four new staff members and
planned to hire 20 more this year. He also plans to expand the Web
site's coverage of raw entertainment industry data, a franchise on
which Inside.com is also placing an emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   So who's winning _ the puritans or the apostates? It may be too
soon to tell, but certainly last week's upheavals were enough to
try a Web journalist's soul.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Ken Layne, a columnist for Online Journalism Review
(www.ojr.org), posted a piece saying, ``Whenever the dot-com
business/media system is bumming me out beyond my ability to type _
generally, every three or four months _ I convene other disgusted
new-economy scribes and present the question, `How in hell did we
end up doing something so gut-wrenchingly stupid?'''

   WEB SITE TRACKS PARCELS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a monthly fee of $9.95, a new Web service will track the
status of a customer's FedEx and United Parcel Service shipments,
alerting the sender whenever a package arrives later than the time
guaranteed by the delivery company.
</P>
<P>
   Once alerted, the shipper can then use that information to
demand that the delivery service fulfill its on-time guarantee by
paying a full refund for the cost of shipping the package, which
typically ranges from $10 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   The new service, OnTimeAuditor.com, is aimed at businesses that
send large volumes of packages, typically more than they could
track manually, said Robert Morse, the company's vice president for
marketing and its co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 million packages that FedEx and UPS ship each day,
more than 5 percent _ about 800,000 _ arrive late, Morse said,
citing industry estimates. Assuming about $12 a package, that would
be $10 million a day in unclaimed refunds.
</P>
<P>
   At OnTimeAuditor.com, customers can total their potential
savings using an onscreen calculator. A company shipping 100
packages a month could save about $1,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The service is based on a program that Michael Harris, a
software entrepreneur, developed in the 1980s to track the arrival
of software packages he shipped to customers. He was frequently
frustrated by customer complaints that packages had arrived late
without the delivery service ever alerting him to the delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just kind of assumed that it got there, and suddenly a
customer would call and say it hadn't,'' Morse said. ``You're
paying for a certain level of service.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, OnTimeAuditor is able to track only FedEx and UPS
shipments, but the company is planning to add other carriers this
year. Morse estimates the entire package-refund market is worth
about $2.5 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   E-SIGNATURES BILL PENDING
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to pass legislation this week that would
make electronic signatures and records as legally binding as
pen-and-paper versions. Passage would end a long stalemate over how
far a law should go in freeing financial institutions from current
consumer notification laws.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill, approved by a House-Senate conference
committee late last week, would confirm that electronic signatures
and electronic records were legal. It would also provide a way for
banks and insurers to notify consumers of late payments or changes
in credit card or loan contracts by e-mail rather than postal mail,
and it would allow financial institutions to begin keeping more
records electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation incorporates a measure sought by the Clinton
administration, requiring a company to conduct a test e-mailing
with customers before sending any subsequent e-mail notifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news for both the Internet economy and American
consumers,'' Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia and
chairman of the House Commerce Committee, said.
</P>
<P>
   SITE PROMOTES BANNER ADS
</P>
<P>
   It is an online advertiser's dream: an Internet site consisting
entirely of banner ads, those animated rectangles found at the top
of a Web page that exhort viewers to ``click here'' for sales
information.
</P>
<P>
   But the 70 examples of banner ads found on the new
``clickhere!'' site, www.soulbath.com, do not try to sell products.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, they are selling the concept of banner ads, in a
backhanded answer to the growing perception that the tiny,
billboards are a costly and ineffective way to advertise.
</P>
<P>
   Florian Schmitt, who has a Web-design firm, Hi-Res
(www.hi-res.net) in London, asked fellow designers from around the
industry to submit alternate approaches to banner ads by filling a
400-by-80 pixel space with ``sense or beauty, or both.'' The
results were put on the Web site last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the entries are crudely anticommercial or
blatantly self-promotional, many do induce an irrepressible urge to
click.
</P>
<P>
   Mat Poprocki's minimalist offering, for example, is all white
except for the text ``don't click here.'' You just can't help
yourself, even if nothing happens when you inevitably do click.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Ed Burton's ad, a rectangular cage for a series
of squirming geometric creatures. Chris McDermott's banners explode
into shards or sag down the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio Poletto's ad acts as an actual Web browser, forcing
users to view a page through a banner-size slit. And Andrew
Cherry's entry mimics the on-screen display for a Windows file
transfer but shows money flying out of a wallet, with the message
``Please Wait _ Extracting Cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The site may be an exhibition of antibanners, but, Schmitt said,
``I don't hate banner ads. They're just not as good or as clever as
they could be, so no one watches them anymore.''

PURSUING MICROSOFT: U.S. ACTIVELY CONSULTED COMPANY'S RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, has no doubts about who
is responsible for his company's antitrust woes. During a news
conference last Wednesday, hours after a federal judge ordered that
Microsoft be split in two, Gates spoke pointedly of the
``competitors that have been behind this lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   What part did Microsoft's rivals play? The competitors, to be
sure, played a crucial role throughout the investigation,
litigation and sanctions phase of the suit by the Justice
Department and 19 states. It was, in fact, a 222-page white paper
written in the summer of 1996 by lawyers for Netscape
Communications, Microsoft's main rival in the market for Internet
browsing software, that caught the attention of Joel I. Klein, head
of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and prompted him to
order an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, a procession of competitors _ representing
Netscape, Sun Microsystems, America Online and others _ testified
against Microsoft. And in the months and weeks before the
government presented its proposal in April to break up Microsoft,
industry executives _ some rivals of Microsoft and some not _ were
shown or read individual sentences and paragraphs in drafts of the
remedies plan by government lawyers, who then asked if the
provisions seemed sensible.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the antitrust case, including the extent of
consultation with industry rivals, was extraordinary, government
officials acknowledge. But the methods employed were not: Despite
all the information and interpretation given to the government from
other companies, industry executives and government lawyers say the
Justice Department kept its own counsel as it sifted evidence and
built its case.
</P>
<P>
   The government charged, and the court found, that Microsoft is a
monopoly that has thwarted competition and innovation. Some of the
evidence came from competitors, but much of it came from
Microsoft's e-mail and internal documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry's role in a case like this is as a resource _ a
source of ideas, comments, facts and analysis,'' said David Boies,
the Justice Department's chief trial lawyer. ``But the government
brought the Microsoft case because the evidence was there. And the
most powerful documents were ones created by Microsoft itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to bring and win the Microsoft suit, the government had to
build a relationship of cooperation and trust with the industry.
When the investigation started in 1996, there was skepticism in
Silicon Valley _ home to many of Microsoft's rivals _ about the
wisdom of working with the government.
</P>
<P>
   A consent decree with Microsoft that the Justice Department
signed in 1994, and that a court approved a year later, had mainly
focused on a modest change in Microsoft's licensing practices. In
Silicon Valley, the consent decree was regarded as a slap on the
wrist that did nothing to loosen Microsoft's control of computing.
So, many companies were reluctant to cooperate with the government
and risk angering Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   To meet with the Justice Department, some industry executives
insisted on strict conditions to ensure anonymity. Late in 1997,
the chief executive of a Silicon Valley company agreed to meet only
at a hotel suite in Washington _ not at the Justice Department's
offices _ and only with a promise that any notes of the meeting
could not mention him or his company, recalled Daniel Rubinfeld,
former chief economist in the department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive did eventually agree to send a senior member
of his management team to testify in the Microsoft trial, which
began in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that kind of visible industry support _ sending
witnesses to testify in a high-profile, high-pressure trial _ was
needed to present a convincing case in court. And Justice
Department officials stressed that point in meetings with industry
executives. ``They did say repeatedly that if you don't stand up
and take this on, neither will we,'' recalled William J. Raduchel,
a former senior executive at Sun Microsystems who is now chief
technology officer of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Yet throughout the case, the government and Microsoft's
competitors had a delicate, often wary relationship, according to
both prosecutors and industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. The Justice Department's antitrust division
receives a steady stream of complaints from companies about their
rivals. Much of this proves untrue or exaggerated upon
investigation, prosecutors note. And the government's policy is not
to inform anyone in advance about whether it will take action.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry executives who cooperated in the prosecution
described dealing with the Justice Department as ``speaking through
a one-way mirror.'' The government officials asked questions, and
they answered. That approach, apparently, remained consistent _
from the initial investigation, right through to consulting on the
proposed remedies.
</P>
<P>
   One executive recalled being asked to comment on the
government's sanctions plan. ``It was, `Does this sentence make
sense to you?' or `If the following rule were in place, do you
think PC makers would choose operating systems other than
Microsoft's Windows?''' the executive said. ``But you never quite
know what they're up to. I had no idea they were going to propose
breaking Microsoft in two.''
</P>
<P>
   Raduchel, who spoke with Justice Department officials several
times in the last few years, remarked: ``I really believe that you
can't lobby them. But what you can do is educate them. They
gradually came to realize that seemingly arcane details of software
really do matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The education process did take time. It took the government
investigators a while to appreciate the legal significance of a
meeting in June 1995 between Microsoft and Netscape executives, for
example, even though the Justice Department received a detailed
account of the meeting two days after it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The account came in a letter to the department from Gary L.
Reback, a lawyer representing Netscape, who described how Microsoft
had used access to its industry-standard Windows operating-system
technology to threaten Netscape. He also attached notes of the
meeting taken by Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, which
strongly suggested that Microsoft had made an offer to Netscape to
divide the market for Internet browsing software _ an offer that,
if proved, was a violation of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That June 1995 episode eventually became an accusation in the
government's suit against Microsoft, one that Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson accepted as a fact and ruled to be illegal. Yet at the
time, word of the meeting did not set off alarm bells in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that back then, the Internet was just
starting to take off,'' said Roberta Katz, the former general
counsel of Netscape, ``and people other than techies did not
understand the Internet or software. The troops at Justice,
understandably, had a lot of learning to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Netscape certainly helped. ``My whole approach,'' Katz said,
``was to get to the point where they really understood what was
going on. After that, if the government did anything or not was
obviously up to them. And they totally held their cards closely.
There was never a time when the Justice Department let us know what
they were going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape white paper in August 1996 helped get things
started. Despite its dull title, ``White Paper Regarding the Recent
Anticompetitive Conduct of the Microsoft Corp.,'' the paper often
reads more like a book than a legal document. Indeed, its 222 pages
are formatted and laid out like a book, with attractive typefaces
and chapters with headlines like ``A Fork in the Road'' and
``Microsoft's Fear: The Threat to Its Desktop Monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape white paper was never made public, but it was
passed to some industry executives and state attorneys general, in
addition to the Justice Department. An industry executive allowed a
reporter for The New York Times to read parts of the document. It
was written mainly by Reback and Susan Creighton, then both lawyers
at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif., with
contributions from Garth Saloner, an economist at the Stanford
University business school.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape document includes a litany of accusations against
Microsoft. These were backed up with e-mail messages that Netscape
had received, from personal computer makers and others, about
Microsoft's actions.
</P>
<P>
   But the one assertion that really interested Klein, the Justice
Department's antitrust chief, was that in June 1996 Microsoft had
threatened to cancel Compaq Computer's license to use Windows
unless Compaq stopped featuring Netscape's browser over
Microsoft's. To Klein, this seemed to be evidence of Microsoft's
selling its Windows operating system to PC makers on the condition
that the manufacturers also take Microsoft's browser. To him, the
threat violated the 1994 consent decree and raised broader
antitrust issues about Microsoft's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has argued that its browsing software should be
considered part of Windows _ one product, not two, and thus not an
antitrust violation. In June 1998, a federal appeals court agreed
with Microsoft in a related case. But after reviewing the evidence,
Jackson ruled that Microsoft had illegally tied two products.
</P>
<P>
   The government pursued some accusations in the Netscape white
paper and set others aside. Over all, though, the legal and
economic theory in the Netscape document is remarkably similar to
the themes laid out in the government's suit two years later. The
core of the case the Justice Department lawyers presented at trial
was that Microsoft had illegally maintained its monopoly by
engaging in a broad pattern of practices intended to stifle the
competition posed by Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, at bottom, a very simple case,'' the Netscape white
paper stated. ``It is about a monopolist (Microsoft) that has
maintained its monopoly for more than 10 years. That monopoly is
threatened by the introduction of a new technology (Web software)
that is a partial substitute _ and, in time _ could become a
complete substitute for the monopoly product.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Netscape white paper also pointed toward a broader
public-policy issue surrounding Microsoft. Personal computers were
the way people get onto the Internet and thus, the paper asserted,
Microsoft's industry-dominant Windows operating system could give
the company a gatekeeper's control of the flow of information and
electronic commerce in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to believe,'' the Netscape document warned,
``that Microsoft's monopoly power will be confined to a single
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   That broader message resonated beyond the software industry, and
eventually led executives in other industries to raise concerns
about Microsoft with the government. Andrew Steinberg, who was then
general counsel of Sabre, the computerized airline reservations
system, recalled traveling through Silicon Valley early in 1997.
Sabre had recently begun a travel Web site, Travelocity, and
Microsoft had a competing site, Expedia. Steinberg was told of the
Netscape white paper, and he obtained a copy from Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the document had a ``profound effect'' on him, recalled
Steinberg, who is now an executive vice president of Travelocity.
``It struck me that this was a serious threat to competition over
the Internet and the future prospects of our company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry executives had similar worries about Microsoft's
power and its potential use of that power. Executives from many
companies expressed those concerns in meetings with the Justice
Department _ including those from Time Warner, Disney, Sabre,
General Motors and Palm, according to people who attended or knew
of those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Further white papers were produced. Netscape updated its
original document, and then provided still another with a more
detailed focus on e-commerce and media over the Internet, ``Access
Denied: Microsoft's Strategy for Overriding Consumer Choice.'' The
other companies that sent white papers to the government included
Apple Computer, Sabre and the makers of speech-recognition
software, according to people familiar with those documents.
</P>
<P>
   The suit the government brought against Microsoft was based on
accusations about what Microsoft had done, rather than what it
might do. But the government has said it took action partly to
protect innovation in the future and to keep the Internet open to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the browser as the gateway to the Internet was
significant to bringing this case,'' said Boies, who presented the
case against Microsoft in court for the Justice Department. ``It's
what made this case important.''

PIERCE TRIUMPH ENDS 33-YEAR DROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ They would forgive her anything, these citizens of
France. Mary Caroline Pierce couldn't get arrested in Paris today
if she swiped Mona Lisa from the Louvre, spray-painted graffiti on
the Arc de Triomphe, or trampled flower beds in the Tuilleries
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   She can do no wrong around here because she did so much right in
restoring to France the tennis championship of France, her adopted
post office box.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it took the French a while to overlook her abundant supply
of American blood, her high school French, and the fact that she
has always lived elsewhere. She made them uncomfortable, drove them
to tears and boos while failing, often miserably, during 10
previous shots at the French Open title.
</P>
<P>
   But that was all forgotten just before 5 p.m. Saturday when
Mighty Mary pounded a 93 mile-per-hour serve that handcuffed a
Spaniard who had beaten her here a year ago in the second round.
Conchita Martinez fought a pesky delaying action, and held chances
to go ahead, 3-0, in the second set, but it was Pierce and France's
day at Stade Roland Garros, 6-2, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez's feckless last swing sent the yellow ball trickling
along the muddy-looking soil toward the net, the mob filling Court
Central exploded with the kind of roar that must have accompanied
the storming of the Bastille. One of the 15,166 stood up and
shrugged her shoulders joyfully. She was Francoise Durr, the most
recently crowned queen of France _ and that was 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, my shoulders feel lighter,'' she said with a laugh.
``I'm not carrying that around anymore. Now we have Mary and it's
wonderful. There is more attention now, more good players. I beat
an Australian, Lesley Turner. The stadium was smaller then, and it
wasn't full. We were amateurs in 1967, the year before prize money
began, and I received a voucher that I could exchange for $200 in
merchandise at a store. What did Mary get _ $575,000?''
</P>
<P>
   It's been 33 long, frustrating years (17 since Yannick Noah won
the men's title). This was a hungry crowd, starving for a champion
of their own _ so hungry they would have even eaten American food
if that were required to get it done. Instead, they were presented
with a magnum of half-and-half, and it went down splendidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is French, my father American. The reason this
tournament means so much to me, more special than my Australian
title in 1995, is my Frenchness,'' said Pierce. ``When my father
made the decision to play for France, I was 13. Twelve years ago. I
didn't like it because I had to leave my friends at school in
Treasure Island (Fla.). Other than that, you're 13 and your parents
make the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted funding from the US Tennis Association, and I think
they were willing but didn't want my father involved. So my mother
contacted the French Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought me here to practice. I lived in a dorm room here
at Roland Garros for a while. I couldn't speak French. I was alone,
13. I cried myself to sleep every night. It was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever had come up short so many times before becoming the
French champ. But 11 was Pierce's winning roll. She made the final
six years ago but was so tight and useless she could have
impersonated Venus de Milo. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario thought she was
up against a creation of Rodin.
</P>
<P>
   But lately Pierce has trained her emotions and nerves like a pet
dog: sit; be still; down. All the while, her strokes growl and
bite. Never had she attacked so forcefully and with such
self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the sluggish clay underfoot, she was looking to
charge at every opportunity, banging daring swinging volleys,
scoring sometimes from her shoe tops. She set up shop inside the
baseline and hammered her groundies ferociously, particularly the
double-barreled backhand.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was trying, countering with more spins than a White
House spokesman. Martinez, a wizard of swirl and angles, threw
every imaginable slice, topspin, chop, moonball, drop shot and
trajectory at Pierce. That kept proceedings moving, almost two
hours' worth, but couldn't short-circuit the firepowering Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   With one set in her purse, Pierce paused and faltered enough to
let Martinez breathe, grab the first two games of the second, and
twice have points with serve for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the important game,'' Pierce said. It stretched nine
minutes and four deuces, during which the sun momentarily pierced a
cold, oily sky, and concluded with Pierce goading Martinez to a
backhand error.
</P>
<P>
   Rugged backhands sank Martinez's serve to 6-5, and ``my dream,
this championship'' began to fill out. It was Pierce's turn to
serve. One game for the bundle, and it wasn't easy. The nerves
wouldn't entirely roll over and play dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Durr's year, 1967, a band called Procul Harum had a hit
called ``A Whiter Shade of Pale.'' The blond and fair Pierce fit
the title as she went to the line to serve. Another nine-minute
ordeal. She butchered two match points, was beached at deuce three
times, and Martinez even had a break point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was always my dream . . . and I never thought I'd do
it,'' said Pierce. ``I went through so many emotions here, so many
disappointments. Now I was so close. The third match point I got
fired up, and I was like, `OK, you've lost two. This is the third.
Usually the third is the good one. Let's try and win this one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's valedictory serve was too much for Martinez, and the
color returned to her cheeks, the sparkle to eyes that soon dripped
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was the girl who had been pushed, and pushed around, by
her father, hired out to a foreign land where she wasn't really
wanted. She became the woman who won Australia _ and then was
dropped by famous coach Nick Bollettieri (as her ranking dropped to
No. 20) because ``she's out of shape and won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   She could identify with the Perils of Pauline. But Saturday it
was the Marvels of Mary. Maybe she hadn't always seemed sweet
French toast, but at last she was the toast of France.

 WASHINGTON: was it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush's aides could not cite a time when the governor, responding
to Gore or a news development, ripped up a speech and turned a
day's schedule on its head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to control our own agenda,'' said Karen P. Hughes,
Bush's communications director and one of his closest aides. ``That
doesn't mean that he's inflexible. When Cardinal O'Connor passed
away, the governor wanted to attend the funeral. That's an example
of something that changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the decision to attend the funeral of Cardinal John
O'Connor of New York came at the suggestion of an aide, not Bush.
``I don't think it initially came from him,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair, though, to portray Bush as passive. He does
not hesitate to overrule his advisers, and when he does he is often
guided more by instinct than policy.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing a speech he was due to deliver on Social
Security before a group of newspaper publishers in May, Hughes
said, Bush was puzzled by the content because he was scheduled to
deliver a Social Security address the following week. She recalled:
``He turned around and looked at me: `Why are we talking about just
Social Security? Why aren't we talking about the importance of
reforming education and rebuilding the military?''' The speech was
retooled.
</P>
<P>
   Before the South Carolina primary, Bush's advertising team had
produced a 60-second commercial that opened with black-and-white
shots of lobbyists in cigars in a smoke-filled room. The intent was
to portray McCain as in the pocket of lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush rejected the commercial as too harsh. Mark McKinnon,
Bush's media consultant, said: ``He was very affirmative about it:
`This isn't going out under my name.' It was not a debatable
point.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon said he argued that because of time pressure it was not
advisable to change the spot. ``Listen, this was in the pressure
cooker of South Carolina and minutes mattered,'' he said. The
governor prevailed and the shots of the lobbyists were pulled.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And the night Bush defeated McCain in the Virginia primary, his
aides had prepared a blistering victory speech. But in his heavy
black marker, Bush deleted several pages of the most negative
sections. For example, he kept the sentence, ``On the next step of
welfare reform, he has no plan.'' But he crossed out the next
sentence: ``His policy agenda is narrow and shallow, and it makes
no place for the poor and the forgotten and the frail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling was we needed to keep the pressure on Senator
McCain,'' Hughes said. ``I told him there was a lot of frustration
at headquarters.'' She said Bush telephoned several aides to
explain that he did not want to undermine them, but felt the speech
was too strident.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Candidates of Divergent Styles
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore fume when staff members arrive late for meetings.
They have little tolerance for aides who are not prepared. Yet
their styles are quite different. Gore is more like a sometimes
overbearing teacher, while Bush often plays the impatient student.
</P>
<P>
   The governor prefers oral presentations to leafing through
briefing books. ``I've seen the governor say, `Why don't you close
the book and tell me what you think is most important?''' Hughes
said. ``He gets to the heart of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald L. Evans, the campaign chairman and Bush's best friend,
put it this way, ``His classic question is, `Have you told me
everything I need to know?'''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's biggest pet peeve at meetings is when aides leave
their cell phone or pagers on, he is also known for not abiding
long-winded presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't sit there and let a briefing go on that isn't a
good use of his time,'' said Josh Bolten, his domestic policy
adviser. ``You get maybe 60 seconds in. If there's a really good
briefer who's doing a good job, you might get three or four minutes
before he's interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not bashful about pleading ignorance, and will even joke
about how he failed a reporter's pop quiz on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't know, he'll say, `Hold it,''' Bolten said. ``If
somebody uses an acronym he doesn't know, he'll stop them and say,
`What does that mean?' Sometimes he says, `Use plain English.' He's
not afraid to say when he doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Bush's aversion to too much detail about the
campaign's finances, Evans said: ``We talk about the budget a fair
amount. All he wants to know is, `Are we under or over?'''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has no use for flip charts, aides said, Gore often
draws charts on an easel. ``Some days I think he is a professor,''
said Donna Brazile, the campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore acknowledged that his grasp of issues, and his
certainty about how to proceed, can be intimidating. ``I think
sometimes a young staffer or a new staffer who hasn't gone through
the process before may feel sometimes a little hesitant to speak up
in disagreement,'' he said. ``But it doesn't last long because I
try to encourage it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some who know Gore worry that his vast knowledge can
sometimes lead him to foreclose other points of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore comes off to me as a guy who has absolute confidence in
what should be done and really isn't all that interested in what
you think substantively,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., a
Delaware Democrat who supported Gore in the primaries. ``Al is
interested in getting briefed, forming an opinion and then it's
settled. That reflects a political certitude: a guy who will make
decisions a la Harry Truman and go home and go to sleep. Except
Truman operated on a gut assessment based on a historical context.
Al operates on an intellectual assessment that doesn't accommodate
much input.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also compared his style to Harry Truman's. But he said that
was a positive attribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of Harry Truman's philosophy,'' he said. ``The
essence of it was: `Go ahead and make good decisions and then move
on to the next decision.' Right. You live with the consequences and
you get better as you go along.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The operating approaches of Gore and Bush not only reflect their
experiences but also their personalities and interests. Gore had a
deep interest in his campaign's logo _ as well as in helping dream
up a logo for the Democratic National Convention _ because he has
dabbled himself in painting and thinks political branding is
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that logos and other visual symbols that are
seen over and over and over again actually are pretty important,''
Gore said. ``And if you get one that really hangs together well,
it's much better than having one that's kind of mediocre.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush does not share that passion. In fact, asked about his
logo, he replied, ``You mean what's on the bumper sticker and
stuff?'' Saying that such artistic endeavors would waste his time,
he added, ``There are people smarter than me on designing logos.''

TRIBES ARE STILL CLEANING UP FORMER BOMBING RANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Ariz., Calif., Minn., Nev., N.M., S.D.)   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TSUU T'INA, Alberta _ As a boy during the Korean War, Samuel
Simon would ride his horse through buffalo grass to a prairie
bluff, where he watched Canadian war jets fly out of Calgary,
scream overhead and then unleash ground-shaking rockets on a
bombing range built on tribal land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would watch the planes flying over and shooting rockets;
they used old cars as targets,'' Simon, now 58, said recently.
``But sometimes we would see two rockets and then just one
explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the same bluff almost half a century later, Simon
surveyed a different view. To the east, the suburbs of Calgary have
swallowed the old air base and now lap at the edges of the Indian
reserve. To the west, with the snow-covered Rockies as a backdrop,
teams of Tsuu T'ina Indians, trained as ordnance-disposal workers,
methodically probed the prairie with metal detectors. A military
ambulance was parked on a hill, its large red cross prominent in
the dun landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little-known footnote to the military history of North
America that when wars loomed in the 20th century, military
planners in Canada and the United States repeatedly turned to the
defeated native peoples of the West and took control, through
leases or outright expropriation, of large swaths of land for
bombing ranges.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, at least 16 tribes have land contaminated
with the litter of bombs, or with a more dangerous kind of
pollution: unexploded bombs lying buried in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes buried ammunition in two native areas in
Alaska, an old gunnery range at the Fort Apache Reservation in
Arizona, a target range on Timbisha Shoshone land in Death Valley,
Calif., a bombing range on the Red Lake Reservation in Minnesota, a
weapons-testing range on Paiute land in Nevada, old ranges on the
lands of three New Mexico pueblos, and four bombing ranges in South
Dakota, including the 54-square-mile Badlands Bombing Range on
Lakota Sioux land in Pine Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the pattern was similar, with old bombing ranges on
about half a dozen Indian reserves, ranging from British Columbia
to Ontario. Brian Lloyd, a former British army bomb-disposal expert
who directs cleanup operations here, said: ``In Canada, the
military acted like a giant, using Indian land like steppingstones
across the country. You find an Indian nation, and you find range
contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement on that comes easily on this reservation of 1,200
people, linguistic cousins of the Navajos and Apaches of the
American Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured, `It's Indian land, and what the heck, if we use
bombs and explosives and the Indians come and blow themselves up,
what's the loss?''' Simon said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   One early spring morning in 1953, when he was 11, Simon was out
on the range, picking up casings to sell to a Calgary scrap-metal
dealer. He recalls retrieving from the brush a shell without a top.
After moving it, he continued, ``I saw heat waves; I thought, `This
thing is going to blow up.'''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to throw it, but the ice-covered casing slipped in his
hands. The ensuing explosion threw him 150 feet. ``My grandmother,
my brother and my auntie were all blown flat,'' he said, all
injured in the blast. Today he carries 11 pieces of shrapnel in his
body.
</P>
<P>
   But now things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, the 90-year military lease on Tsuu T'ina land
expired, ending military control over 12,000 acres _ one-sixth of
the reservation _ that had started in 1910. As other Canadian and
U.S. tribes study cleaning up old bombing ranges on their lands,
this one plans to hold in July what it bills as North America's
first native conference on military cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   For this tribe, which operates a business park and golf courses,
there is money to be made in explosives disposal. In 1986, after
the Canadian military did a half-hearted cleanup job here, the
tribe formed Wolf's Flat Ordnance Disposal Corp., the only such
native-owned and operated company in North America. On government
contracts, this company, with 136 full- and part-time workers, has
also worked clearing mines in Kosovo, Panama and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   The recent protests against the use of part of the island of
Vieques as a live fire-training site for the U.S. Navy have
fostered hopes here for eventual cleanup contracts in Puerto Rico.
Right now, however, Tsuu T'ina leaders complain that the U.S.
ordnance-disposal market is closed to Canadians because of Pentagon
rules requiring technicians certified in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's government, which promotes land-mine clearance
worldwide, has paid the tribal company to clean up the range here,
believing the natives had more incentive to clean up their land
than the soldiers did.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1981, the military had 1,000 soldiers in here for 16 days _
they certified the land free and clear of explosives, and then
dumped it back on the nation,'' Lloyd said. ``Since the military
declared the land cleared, we have pulled out 1 million items of
ordnance, expended rounds, live rounds.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the oldest pieces dating to 1896, the range here was
littered with weaponry from Canada's participation in the Boer War,
World War I, World War II and the Korean War. There were
high-explosive mortar shells, 60-pound shrapnel-filled howitzer
rounds, .50-caliber machine-gun bullets, air-to-ground rockets,
land mines, flares, riot-control projectiles and even two rusting
rifles, apparently lost by absent-minded soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule was `If you sign it out, don't bring it back,''' said
Roy Whitney, the tribal chief. ``We found boxes of grenades from
the Second World War that were just buried in the ground because
they didn't want to take them back.''
</P>
<P>
   For cleanup crews, one of the biggest dangers has been buried
phosphorus shells. On contact with air, they can resume burning
after a 50-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   With about 90 percent of the 12,000 acres cleaned up, entirely
without accident, tribal leaders now are debating development plans
for border lands already disturbed by military construction: 45
holes of golf, shopping centers, a casino, residential developments
on 75-year leases, even a freeway with electronic toll collection,
to link the sprawling southern and western suburbs of Calgary, a
city expected to hit 1 million in population by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   On the spiritual side, tribal elders are planning to hold a
land-renewal ceremony this summer. Joe Big Plume, an 82-year-old
retired professional pool player, said he plans a cleansing
ceremony that would include traditional prayers, feasting and
dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we did the army a favor, leasing our land to them,
letting them train on it,'' Big Plume said. ``We did not know they
would abuse the land. You still can't just go and plow anyplace _
you are going to hit a live bomb.''

EASIER-TO-USE SITES WOULD HELP E-TAILERS CLOSE MORE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Internet retailers were troubled to learn
that, according to a report by Forrester Research, two-thirds of
Web shoppers abandoned their ``shopping carts'' before actually
buying something. At the time, and throughout last year, e-commerce
companies pledged to improve the shopping experience, giving
customers no reason to leave without passing through checkout.
</P>
<P>
   But because investors showed little inclination to penalize
e-tailers for such basic deficiencies as failing to close the sale,
these resolutions were frequently shuffled to the back burner, in
favor of planning television ads and making business development
deals.
</P>
<P>
   And so, consumers are still abandoning their Web shopping carts
at the same rate as they did in 1998, according to a recent report
by Shop.org, an industry trade group. But now, with e-tailers under
increasing pressure to start actually making money, Web merchants
are suddenly getting serious in their efforts to squeeze whatever
cash they can from site visitors.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report planned for release today by Creative
Good, a consulting firm in New York, e-tailers could generate
substantially more revenue by focusing on basic customer needs,
like speed and simplicity. The report estimates that e-commerce
companies could realize an additional $20 billion in sales this
year _ bringing overall Web sales to some $57 million _ by
improving site design, navigation and overall ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Good's chief executive, Phil Terry, concedes that
prescribing these changes may be much easier than getting sites to
implement them. ``We've seen a real resistance to the basics in the
industry,'' he said, ``which indicates that this is just the tip of
the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Terry said, many e-commerce sites still fail to
track their order conversion rates _ the rate at which visitors
become paying customers. Shop.org recently pegged the average
conversion rate at 1.8 percent, but Terry, said e-tailers could
easily raise that rate to 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring such a core statistic, he said, indicates how little
attention many sites are paying to what visitors actually do once
they get to the site. The Creative Good report focuses on a number
of key categories in which merchants typically fail their
customers, including page design, site search and the checkout
process. The report criticized Martha Stewart.com, for instance,
for letting customers add out-of-stock items to the shopping cart
without informing them until reaching the final checkout that the
items are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart, the chief executive of Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia, acknowledged this shortcoming, but disputed the notion
that changing it would be easy. ``We're working on that,'' Stewart
said. ``But the coordination between the catalog and the Internet
operations has to be perfect before we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company that handles inventory and fulfillment for
MarthaStewart.com, the Time Customer Service unit of Time Warner,
has an older computer system, she said, so it takes a while for the
site to search Time's database for in-stock items. Because of this,
Stewart and her executives decided not to slow things down with a
real-time inventory check of each item as a shopper selects it.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart said the company was searching for a fulfillment
partner that will enable the site to display real-time inventory
without slowing down the customer. ``It's a minute-to-minute task,
to keep up with technology and customer demands,'' she said. ``It's
a constant thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web is littered with glaring examples of poorly designed
pages and features, of course. The Creative Good report
acknowledges as much, pointing out sites that label products poorly
(or not at all), sites that try to pack too much information onto a
page, and sites that require customers to fill out a lengthy
questionnaire before they can actually browse for goods.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there is a common criticism from those within the
industry, it is that e-commerce sites may be interesting to look at
or listen to, but they are not easy enough for many customers to
use. And that, says H. Robert Wientzen, president of the Direct
Marketing Association, may be because e-tailers are still
struggling to shed their high-tech habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to a reverence for technology,'' Wientzen said.
``A lot of the people who started these sites are technologists,
and in the beginning, at least, the people who used the sites were
more savvy about technology.'' Now that the Web is more closely
aligned with mainstream culture, he said, the sites must cater to
the capabilities of nontechnical customers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, technology itself is making it easier for Web sites
to be more shopper friendly, according to Ford Cavallari, who heads
the e-business practice for Renaissance Strategy, a consulting firm
in Boston. Cavallari said that in the last year, companies that
made software that helped Web sites create their pages _ ``content
management'' software, in industry argot _ had ``moved forward a
light year from where they were.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Webmasters were always behind the eight ball,'' Cavallari
said. ``They were throwing content together on the page. But as
this software has gotten better, the staff has more time to get
more creative and spend time on value-added activities. So the net
effect will be higher quality sites.''
</P>
<P>
   The new urgency on the part of retailers to make a profit could
be a boon to shoppers. Too often, consumers have been lured to the
Web by the promise of convenience, only to find the experience less
convenient than shopping at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hanners, executive vice president of JCPenney.com, said
competitive pressures had forced his site to become more user
friendly. He said the company planned to introduce a new version of
its site in October _ an overhaul that will have taken a year and
the efforts of about 300 people to create.
</P>
<P>
   Through the redesign, he said, the company has focused on its
average customers: women, ages 25 to 55, with a household income of
$55,000 to $70,000. ``It's the sweet spot of middle America,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And a conclusion from the many customer focus groups the company
has conducted while testing the redesign, Hanners said, is that
middle America is most interested in ``noncluttered'' Web sites.
The challenge in putting this insight to use is that JCPenney.com
has 10,000 product images to display.
</P>
<P>
   Hanners would not disclose specifics of the site's new design.
But he said it would give customers options on how they would like
to shop, although not so many options that they would be confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started the redesign, I thought it'd be easy,'' he
said. ``Then I moved to thinking of it as extremely impossible. Now
I'm somewhere in between. People talk about e-commerce being easy.
Well, I'm an old retailer, and I don't recall ever working this
hard at retail.''

CNBC CHANGES MAY BE MORE THAN COSMETIC  
 NO MORE DOG DAYS OF SUMMER IN TV LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Changes are afoot at CNBC that could mean more statistics and
data and less Geraldo Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   In one sign of changes in the air, workers began building a new
set at the network's studios in Fort Lee, N.J., over the weekend.
When it is completed, a 47-foot-wide wall of video screens will
stand behind the anchor's desk.
</P>
<P>
   The wall will somewhat resemble the busy electronic data board
used by reporters in the glass Nasdaq market studio in Times
Square. The screens will display either separate bits of
information or a single image, while an anchor or correspondent
addresses viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a correspondent at the New York Stock Exchange
could be shown on the wall while being interviewed by an anchor. Or
producers could use the wall to flash facts or charts of interest
to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC executives said that it would take some time for them to
become used to the wall and that they had not fully figured out how
to meld it into all their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly complex device,'' said Bruno Cohen, CNBC's
senior vice president for business news. ``No one has built one
before, so we'll have to figure out how to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, it was expected to dominate CNBC's business news
programs eventually. The wall will make its debut in July.
</P>
<P>
   That also happens to be when executives are considering dropping
Geraldo Rivera's ``Upfront Tonight'' program _ which covers the
general news of the day and runs on weeknights at 7:30 _ and
replacing it with more business news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upfront Tonight'' is the lead program of CNBC's evening block
of nonfinancial programming, which also includes ``Hardball with
Chris Matthews,'' Rivera's talk show, ``Geraldo Live,'' and ``The
News with Brian Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   For some time, CNBC executives have been considering expanding
business news into that block. Earlier this year, they said, Rivera
let them know he was less interested in continuing with ``Upfront
Tonight'' and would prefer to concentrate on his talk show and
other projects for NBC, like stand-alone specials.
</P>
<P>
   One executive, however, said that no decision had been made and
that nothing would change until midsummer. Rivera was not available
for comment.

   No More Dog Days of Summer in TV Land
</P>
<P>
   The main thing that the latest television phenomenon, CBS'
``Survivor,'' has in common with the previous television
phenomenon, ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' is not the $1
million ultimate prize.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing is that both started as answers to the question
``What did you do on your summer vacation?''
</P>
<P>
   Summer, which for most of the history of television has been a
desert of reruns and reject programs, has suddenly become maybe the
best place to roll out a new show, especially if it is one that
takes some risks and breaks new ground.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, as numerous television executives have begun to
realize, is that in the summer, competition is all but nonexistent.
But more important, a show with a fresh approach can fill a crying
_ and growing _ need in the rest of the media for something _
anything _ to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   As Stu Bloomberg, the co-chairman of ABC Entertainment put it,
``In summer, if you have a hit, you have all the attention to
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   All the attention means dozens upon dozens of interview shows on
cable channels and radio stations, joke after joke from David
Letterman and Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien, reams of newspaper copy
and endless chat on Web sites. The media have become a ravenous
beast, with a massive maw, that demands to be constantly fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a show can get all that media to itself, it's much much
easier to become a hit,'' said Steve Sternberg, a senior vice
president with TN Media, a firm that buys television commercial
time for advertisers. ``Just like with `Millionaire,' the media was
all over `Survivor.' It instantly became a water-cooler show. The
idea that people won't watch anything in the summer is nonsense.
Not everyone is on vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   The media wave that has emerged from ``Survivor'' has caught the
attention of one network that had not committed many resources to
summer programming, NBC. Garth Ancier, the president of NBC
Entertainment, acknowledged, ``With `Survivor' grabbing all that
attention, we have to have a different strategy for summer.''
Ancier said NBC had already prepared a new budget for programming
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see every network gearing up for next summer,''
Sternberg said, ``especially this kind of escapist programming. The
key to launching new shows may become finding the place where
everybody else is doing repeats.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS already has much of the rest of this summer locked up with
the next iteration of the genre, a broader experiment in
televoyeurism called ``Big Brother,'' set to occupy 90 nights
beginning on July 6.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg said that one interesting angle to the networks'
sudden interest in summer may be how the surge in viewing affects
cable channels, which have always taken advantage of the networks'
``gone fishing'' attitude toward the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely may be people who watch less cable this
summer because of all this,'' he said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A sharp contrast in weather conditions will be noted between New
England and the Middle Atlantic region. Thunderstorms will mark a
cold front pushing southward from New Jersey and Pennsylvania into
Maryland and northern Virginia. A 150-mile-wide band of low clouds
with patches of drizzle will follow the front covering southern New
England much of the day. Skies will clear across parts of the
interior Northeast, but it will be cool. However, hazy, hot and
humid air will occupy the Southeast as far north as Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical wave will trigger thundershowers in northwestern
Florida. A stream of humid air from central Texas to the central
Plains will be the focus of afternoon storms. A push of extremely
warm air into the Dakotas will produce several strong storms as the
Northwest turns damp and rather cool. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DALLAS WEEKEND  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive weekend, heavy rain fell on the
Dallas-Forth Worth metropolitan region. A stream of tropical
moisture attendant to a dissipating tropical depression in the
western Gulf of Mexico brought as much as three inches of rain to
the east side of the metroplex. During the previous weekend,
torrents of rain flooded the suburbs of Fort Worth with nearly a
foot of rain. The current wet weather pattern is helping to erase a
long-term deficit in rainfall across eastern Texas. Longer-range
forecasts indicate that another band of tropical showers may reach
the region by next weekend. &QL;

GE'S MANAGEMENT METHODS ARE PUT TO WORK ON THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems intuitively obvious: Anyone who is buying a new
refrigerator or washer wants it delivered as soon as possible. So,
an appliance manufacturer setting up a Web-based order-and-delivery
system would put next-day delivery high on the list of lures,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Right _ if the Web designer was trusting to intuition. But one
thing that the folks at General Electric have had drummed into them
the last four years _ or, ever since the company embraced the
quality-control regimen known as Six Sigma _ is that they act on
gut instinct at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the Six Sigma sensibility evolved out of old
economy rules; it is informing every aspect of GE's push into new
economy mode.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened when GE Appliances decided last year to
set up a Web-based system to arrange delivery of GE products to
people who bought them at Home Depot. GE Appliances used focus
groups, what-if scenarios and other Six Sigma methodologies to
discern how much value customers placed on having new appliances
show up in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Shock one: The answer was, not much value at all. ``Six Sigma
eliminated any perceived need for evening deliveries, next-day
deliveries, Sunday deliveries, all sorts of costly things that we
had wrongly thought would be important to customers,'' said Michael
P. Delain, GE Appliances' quality manager for local delivery
service.
</P>
<P>
   Shock two: If the delivery people had a professional, soothing
demeanor, customers would tolerate just about anything, even late
deliveries or damaged products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, customers cared that we accommodated their choice of a
delivery date, and that we showed up in the window that we
promised,'' said Steve LeClair, program manager for e-business at
GE Appliances. ``But Six Sigma studies showed that they cared most
about the softer, less measurable skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting system, which is operating in about 600 of Home
Depot's 980 stores, lets sales representatives enter a customer's
order onto the Web and arrange for delivery to the customer's home
directly from a GE warehouse. GE Appliances, meanwhile, now trains
installers and delivery personnel on people skills.
</P>
<P>
   Six Sigma, of course, is the quality program that big companies
including Motorola, Honeywell and GE have credited with squeezing
billions of dollars in costs out of products and processes, without
losing quality or service. It is a statistical method of breaking a
customer's requirements into tasks or steps, and setting the
optimum specification for each part of the process, based on how
the parts interact.
</P>
<P>
   It means taking nothing for granted, checking out even those
things that seem intuitively obvious, and running countless what-if
scenarios to see what kind of cascade effect changing even
seemingly innocuous variables can have on the result. When GE
Medical Systems designed its Lightspeed diagnostic scanner, for
example, Six Sigma studies showed that widening a few tungsten
wires could increase the machine's accuracy _ something that the
design team had thought would require a costly tube redesign.
</P>
<P>
   And Six Sigma means having all GE departments, from accounting
to production to customer service, analyze the impact that their
ways of interacting with one another could have on a customer's
total experience with GE.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, at the dictum of GE's chairman, John F. Welch Jr.,
Six Sigma has been a way of life at GE. The company has applied it
to pretty much every aspect of its business _ designing products,
interacting with customers, fine-tuning delivery.
</P>
<P>
   So early last year, when Welch said he expected every GE
business to have an e-commerce strategy up and running by the
spring of 1999, it took just nanoseconds for most to realize that
Six Sigma was a natural for guiding GE onto the Web, particularly
if they thought of a Web page as a product and of e-business as a
process. All the GE businesses met Welch's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Sigma processes let us demystify the whole concept of
e-business,'' said Piet C. van Abeelen, GE's vice president for Six
Sigma Quality. ``They let us get organized without handing off
pieces of the process among 55 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say that GE is way ahead of other old economy
companies in embracing the Web. Indeed, it is turning its Web savvy
into a business itself. Just last week, GE announced a joint
venture with Cisco Systems that would help manufacturers use
Internet technology to tie their factory data systems in with their
office systems. GE also introduced a host of new Web-related
services for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've figured out how to transfer their brand identity to
the Internet,'' said Geri Spieler, an e-business analyst with the
Gartner consulting firm. ``They grab people with depth and breadth
of services, and keep them with multiple opportunities to click for
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, GE Lighting, GE Appliances and others have Web-based
programs that let architects and builders design lighting systems
and kitchens from a list of specifications. Most GE businesses have
self-help sites that give users step-by-step guidance for fixing or
maintaining products. And all of them give browsers a chance to buy
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of their businesses is transactional on the Web, and no
other old-line company can say that,'' said Nicholas P. Heymann, an
analyst at Prudential Securities. ``Six Sigma was a real
turbocharger for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound. Through Six Sigma analyses, many GE businesses
concluded that customers, given a modicum of extra information,
would willingly handle a lot of repair work themselves. Other
studies showed that if information about optional features was easy
to find, many customers _ businesses as well as consumers _ would
configure their own products, without waiting for a sales
representative to call.
</P>
<P>
   For GE, that meant saving a fortune on service personnel and
``selling'' to customers who were either geographically remote or
too small to warrant sales calls.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, the Six Sigma studies showed, was that customers
often could not find the model numbers on their appliances or
machines. So, several GE businesses put ``how to find your model
number'' sections on their Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   And, several GE businesses have given their Web sites so-called
configurators and wizards _ electronic guides that enable customers
to customize their own systems, be it a redone kitchen or a
lighting system for a new plant, and even help customers fix them
in the future.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Six Sigma analyses also showed that house builders _ prime
customers for GE Appliances _ wanted to give their own customers a
way to design their homes at one Web sitting. So, GE is designing
Web sites for major builders that enable the builder's customers to
configure what GE appliances they want in their homes, but that
also help them explore what's available in cabinetry, carpeting and
other essential home items that GE does not sell itself. One such
site, called Selectioncenter.com, is being tested at the U.S. Home
Corp., and GE Appliances hopes it will be fully operational in a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an important site for builders, and for
distributors like us,'' said Joe Dumstorf, president of Trend
Technologies, a distributor of building products that helped GE
design the site.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every GE business can point to ways that Six Sigma forged
a path to the Web. When GE's CNBC unit first put up a Web site last
year, for example, the home page seemed to take an awfully long
time to load. Instead of blaming traffic or Internet glitches
outside GE's control, analysts used Six Sigma methods to
deconstruct the page; they discovered that one of the page's
distinctive features, the trailing stock ticker at the bottom, was
slowing up the loading time. The site designers gave viewers the
option of loading without the ticker, which cut the upload time in
half, to four seconds. They have since whittled it down to 2.46
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And when GE Appliances wanted to lure consumers to check out new
products on its Web page, the company performed a Six Sigma
analysis to determine what kind of information customers wanted,
how many mouse clicks they would be willing to make to get it, and
whether they would settle for schematics of appliances that could
be loaded quickly rather than full-color digital photos that might
take forever to load.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intuition told us the bigger and more detailed the picture,
the better,'' recalled Joseph J. Deangelo, vice president for
e-business at GE Appliances. ``Six Sigma analysis showed that
customers preferred speed to detail when they were first comparing
models, and were only willing to wait for detailed pictures when
they were close to a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Six Sigma has also played a role as GE's consumer businesses
have set up Web-based help desks. GE's telephone help centers had
been through their own Six Sigma rigor, which had led to a
computerized body of knowledge that operators could consult to
answer any question. Now questions that come in by e-mail, by
direct query on a Web site, or by phone, all receive answers from
that same database within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tenet of Six Sigma is that you take variability out of
results,'' Deangelo explained, ``and this enabled us to get rid of
an entire category of potential defects, which is wrong, incomplete
or late answers.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another Six Sigma tenet at play with the help sites:
running what-if scenarios on how to convert questioners to
self-help mode enabled GE to fine-tune the information offered
through self-help mechanisms on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   For example, owners of GE's new Advantium Oven, which cooks with
a combination of light and microwave energy, often write in with
questions on how to translate recipes for use with the Advantium.
GE Appliances refers such questions to home economists on its
staff, e-mails answers to the questioners, and then includes the
information on its self-help sites, where anyone hoping to try a
similar recipe can find it.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Six Sigma means approaching every problem with the
assumption that it has a data-oriented, tangible solution in the
end. The process does not yield perfection, but it provides a
handle on how much variability from a standard, be it a product
specification or a delivery time, customers will tolerate before
they perceive it as a defect.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration between GE Appliances and Home Depot is a case
study. Until this year, GE shipped a small assortment of appliances
to Home Depot, which kept them in inventory until they were sold
and then delivered them to customers. Home Depot wanted to offer
more items but to stock less inventory.
</P>
<P>
   So GE Appliances and Home Depot worked out a Web-based model
whereby Home Depot sales representatives could use a kiosk at the
store to enter a customer's order for any GE appliance. The kiosk
transmits the order to the nearest GE warehouse via the Internet,
and the item can be shipped from the warehouse to the customer's
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lets us offer quicker delivery of a wider assortment of
products, without maintaining big warehouses full of products,''
said Donald E. Galloway, Home Depot's national product manager for
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was simple, the economics were not. Home Depot
wanted to offer the service to every customer; GE used Six Sigma
analyses to discern how wide a geographic radius around each
warehouse it could economically serve.
</P>
<P>
   Both GE and Home Depot finally agreed that it made sense to
forgo serving a handful of customers in order to guarantee stellar
service to the vast majority. For customers who do not fall within
the delivery radius, Home Depot resorts to the old methods _ it
places an order with GE, which ships the appliance to the store,
which arranges delivery to the customer's home.
</P>
<P>
   The process of applying Six Sigma continues, as GE moves toward
being ever more Web-centric. According to Gary Reiner, GE's chief
information officer, GE has dedicated about 1,000 employees to its
e-commerce effort. And 80 percent of those e-business mavens are
home grown; most old-economy companies hire their Web expertise
from the tech world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was essential that our Web sites reflect out customer's
needs, not our organizational structure,'' Reiner said. ``That kind
of customer focus is an underlying principle of Six Sigma.''

   U.S. FOCUS GROUPS GAUGE ATTITUDES ABOUT INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the first comprehensive look at public attitudes
about the Internet, results from focus groups around the country by
the nonprofit Markle Foundation showed that participants seemed to
trust business over government to regulate the Internet, echoed the
call of buyer beware when it came to privacy and fraud but also
seemed to expect some type of rules or protections.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions were perhaps most significant in underscoring the
complex and tough task facing policy makers around the world as
they seek to govern the Internet.

   INTERNET COOLDOWN HASN'T HIT JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent sell-off in technology stocks and an
increasing number of failing dot-coms, the search for the best
high-technology employees continues. True high-technology jobs
remain an employee's market, with far more jobs than job
candidates. But what has changed recently is what it takes to lure
away a new senior-level employee: cash. Stock options, particularly
in companies not yet public, have considerably less allure than
they did just a few months ago. Now companies are finding they must
pay more in salary and options as well as a bonus and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   PLEDGES RENEWED TO EASE SHOPPING
</P>
<P>
   A report in 1998 showed that two-thirds of Web shoppers
abandoned their ``shopping carts'' before buying something, and
e-commerce companies pledged to improve the shopping experience.
But because investors showed little inclination to penalize
e-tailers for failing to close the sale, these resolutions were
neglected, and consumers continued to abandon their carts. Now Web
merchants are under pressure to make money, and they are suddenly
getting serious in their efforts to squeeze whatever cash they can
from site visitors.

   A `GEORGE LUCAS' SLEEPER HIT
</P>
<P>
   ``George Lucas in Love,'' a nine-minute parody of ``Shakespeare
in Love'' in which the lovesick, college-age George Lucas is
surrounded by people recognizable as prototypes for the characters
in his Star Wars series, rapidly became an underground hit last
summer in Hollywood. But it did not end there. In October, the
movie became the debut attraction on Mediatrip.com, a
streaming-video Web site. And in April, it was released on
videotape, sold exclusively through Amazon.com. On April 21, the
film's first day of release, it immediately shot to No. 1 on the
site's sales charts.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER TV BECOMES LESS STAGNANT
</P>
<P>
   Summer, which for most of television history has been a desert
of reruns and rejects, has suddenly become perhaps the best place
to roll out a new show, especially if it takes some risks and
breaks new ground.

 &HT;    AMA may ask Florida legislators to abolish the state exam
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As the American Medical Association board
convenes this week, its members could decide to step into a Florida
dispute over the licensing of foreign-trained physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Florida became the only state in the nation to offer
its own medical licensing exam, an alternative to the United States
Medical Licensing Examination.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 450 people, mostly Cubans who arrived in South
Florida in the mid-1980s, were eligible to take it. They have been
unable to produce sufficient documents to obtain licenses here or
to pass the national licensing exam required of all other doctors
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other foreign-trained doctors licensed in Florida, this
group doesn't have to be certified by the Educational Commission
for Foreign Medical Graduates and can skip internship and hospital
residency requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these legal loopholes, Frank Cuneo, a Coral Gables
attorney for a group of doctors who have taken the state's special
exam, says they have been hindered by quirks in testing policy and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including the Federation of State Medical Boards and
the Florida Medical Association, disagree and say Florida is
setting a dangerous precedent by licensing the doctors under a
different standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the laughing stock of the nation,'' said Dr. Bernd
Wollschlaeger of Aventura, 42, a member of the FMA's international
medical graduates section. ``The standard of care in Florida is
unsafe if we let politicians gamble with licensure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Medical Association has passed a resolution asking
lawmakers to abolish the state exam and require the doctors to
follow the same rules as other doctors. An AMA committee meeting in
Chicago this weekend passed a similar resolution and has forwarded
it to the AMA's House of Delegates, which is convening there
through Thursday. If it passes, the AMA could throw its weight
behind the FMA in lobbying Florida legislators next year.
</P>
<P>
   A state investigator testified before the Florida Board of
Medicine in April that it should be deeply skeptical of Cuban
doctors seeking Florida licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The last five plastic surgeons arrested for unlicensed activity
were Cuban and all claimed to have trained in a Havana hospital's
burn unit, said investigator Enrique Torres, himself Cuban-born.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be more per capita burn victims in Havana than
any other place in the world,'' he said. ``Their certificates are
questionable and suspect at best.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Cuneo responds, ``Unfortunately, that is some of the
bigotry and bias that is presented against foreigners . . . It is
wholly unfair to label any group simply because a few bad apples
have been discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first two state exams given, more than 90 percent of
test-takers failed. Cuneo blames the state for requiring a higher
passing score than the national exam requires and asking ambiguous
test questions. The state test, he says, focuses too much on basic
science instead of clinical knowledge. Cuneo said his group, known
as the Florida International Medical Association, hasn't ruled out
filing a lawsuit against the state.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 people, mostly from Miami-Dade and Broward counties,
registered to take the test again last month in Miami. State law
lets them sit for the exam five times within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cuban-American lobby failed to get a bill passed
during this year's legislative session that would have gotten rid
of the state exam entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami, proposed
giving the doctors full licenses to practice medicine after working
for three years under close supervision of a physician. Diaz-Balart
didn't return calls for this story.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have changed a 1996 law that requires the doctors
to practice medicine under supervision for two years once they pass
the state or national exam.
</P>
<P>
   Cuneo said Medical Examiners phased out the test for which they
had studied, called FLEX, and replaced it with the USMLE. The two
tests are supposed to be comparable. More than 90 percent of U.S.
and Canadian medical students taking the USMLE for the first time
pass it, compared with about 60 percent of foreign-trained
students, according to the federation. Doctors say the disparity is
because of difficulty with English and differences in how schools
train students to treat patients.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the legislature authorized the creation of a state exam
for doctors who had taken the refresher course. The first state
test was given in May 1999. Of 282 taking it, 14 passed. The state
gave the test again in November, offering it in Spanish for the
first time. Eighty

 &HT;    Scientists hurry search for prehistoric human remains threatened
by development
 &HT;    By Stephen Kiehl
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE SALT SPRING, Fla. _ Eighty-five feet down into the cold,
dark water of this secluded gulf coast spring, scientists hope to
find the oldest human remains ever unearthed in the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Like a prehistoric time capsule, the 220-foot deep Little Salt
Spring has almost perfectly preserved evidence of Florida's first
people _ and the other animals they shared this land with thousands
of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But as University of Miami scientists uncover the spring's
secrets, its purity is threatened by nearby development. So they
are working quickly to find proof that people reached Florida
12,000 years ago _ a discovery that would thrust Little Salt into a
raging debate over who the first Americans were, where they were
from and when they got here.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for the first time, the UM researchers plan to go
into an underwater cave 85 feet below the surface. They hope the
cave holds prehistoric human remains from when the first people,
called Paleo-Indians by scientists, entered Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced there were Paleo-Indians here 12,000 years
ago,'' said John Gifford, 53, a marine archaeology professor who
has been exploring Little Salt since 1983. ``The question is, can
we find anything earlier?''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gifford and his colleagues have found animal remains,
such as the bones of saber-tooth tigers and mastodons, and wooden
tools that are up to 12,000 years old. They also found a
7,000-year-old human skull with its brain tissue intact.
</P>
<P>
   The sinkhole is like a funnel _ about 200 feet wide at the top,
with a gentle slope that once was above water. That is where people
probably skinned animals and made tools and weapons. The slope
narrows to a sharp drop-off, below which was an oasis of freshwater
for humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Little Salt is considered one of the best archaeological sites
in Florida, and even in the United States, because the water is
almost devoid of oxygen, meaning there's no bacteria or other
marine life to destroy the prehistoric treasures the spring holds.
Wooden artifacts that regular water would have eaten up in a few
hundred years have endured thousands of years with little damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This site is exceedingly significant,'' said Steve Koski, a
marine archaeologist who has studied sites throughout the state and
is assisting Gifford here. ``The spring has a wealth of information
for our understanding of Florida's past peoples and environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the perfect composition of the water is threatened by
encroaching development in the town of North Port, on Florida's
west coast halfway between Fort Myers and Sarasota. A new high
school is rising from the dust just a few miles from the spring,
which also neighbors a golf course, an elementary school and a new
homes subdivision. The spring and 112 acres around it were donated
to UM by a land developer in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford is worried that pollutants and water runoff from the new
development could alter the chemistry of the spring. An increase in
the water's oxygen level would hasten the decomposition of the
artifacts and human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford will analyze the water and is meeting with local
officials to make sure the site is protected. Meanwhile, he and his
graduate students are moving forward with the spring's excavation.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of June, they are scuba-diving about 30 feet
into the sinkhole, vacuuming up sediment from a 6-foot square and
sifting through the sand for artifacts. They've found burnt wood _
likely from a campfire _ and deer bones.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 years of exploration here, the UM scientists have pieced
together evidence of a Florida much different from today's.
Mastodons, huge white-tailed deer, llamas and giant sloths had the
run of the land, and they came together at the few freshwater
springs like Little Salt.
</P>
<P>
   During the Ice Age, when the sea levels were so low that Florida
was twice its current size, Little Salt was freshwater. But as the
seas rose, the spring became brackish, meaning its salinity is
one-tenth that of saltwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire peninsula was like a dried-out sponge,'' Gifford
said. ``That's why a place like this would have been such a magnet
for all animals _ human and non-human.''
</P>
<P>
   People hunted the animals with tools made from wood, bone and
antler. One object recovered was a 9,500-year-old L-shaped throwing
stick called a ``non-returning boomerang'' used to hunt small game
at a range of 65 yards. People also may have killed animals by
running them into the spring.
</P>
<P>
   On the ledge 85 feet down, Gifford's predecessor found a giant
tortoise with a wooden spear spliting its shell. The spear is
12,000 years old, according to radio-carbon dating. That's
convinced Gifford that people were in Florida then, and the spring
could hold even more evidence. The best artifacts will be sent to
the Historical Museum of Florida in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, Gifford and UM's chief diving officer
will dive down to the ledge, where there is a cave 15 feet deep and
6 feet tall. Using a video camera and lights _ it's pitch black at
that depth _ the divers will poke around the ledge and enter the
cave that was last above water at least 12,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If human remains are found there, they would be the oldest in
the Western Hemisphere. Human bones that are 10,000 years old were
found in Warm Mineral Spring, just 2 miles from Little Salt.
Evidence has also been found in Miami-Dade County that people
reached South Florida 11,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those discoveries, and others on the Eastern Seaboard, run
counter to the traditional belief that the first Americans came
across the Bering Strait from northeast Asia. Some anthropologists
contend it would have been difficult for those Asians to make their
way to the East Coast 12,000 years ago, when glaciers still covered
much of North America.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative argument, then, is that people also could have
come here from Europe _ crossing from England to Nova Scotia on ice
sheets, then moving down the coast to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If Gifford and his team are successful in their quest for
12,000-year-old human remains in Little Salt Spring, they would
poke more holes in the traditional theory of human migration. They
would also be the new record-holders in this hemisphere, beating
out by 500 years a skeleton found in Brazil. The oldest North
American so far is a 10,000-year-old skeleton of a woman found in
Buhl, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for the whole shooting match,'' said Gifford, donning
a wet suit and oxygen tank before a dive last week. ``We infer
there were people here, but it would be even better to have the
actual human traces.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he slipped beneath the surface, quickly disappearing into
the still, green water, on another run to another world.

LONE VOICE NO LONGER, JAPANESE GADFLY CATCHES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Crowds build ever so slowly around Zensaku Sakurai, a
sidewalk crusader who berates Japan's leaders for what he calls
their arrogance, corruption and failure to serve the needs of real
people.
</P>
<P>
   Political apathy has long been the norm in this country. But
with Sakurai's followers brandishing political banners and charts
that purport to track the failings of members of Parliament, people
stop one by one to listen these days.
</P>
<P>
   Many nod in approval or even volunteer to join the movement. But
in a country where direct criticism of others _ even public figures
_ strikes an uncomfortable chord, there are always one or two
people who jeer him and denounce what he is doing as
``un-Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   The hecklers are not the only people jarred by Sakurai's
movement, known as the Rakusen Undo, or blacklist campaign, the
most successful of several grass-roots movements that are catching
fire here.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the governing party and its coalition partners, who
are already on the defensive as hotly contested national elections
draw near, have shown their anxiety by crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movements like these are not democratic,'' Muneo Suzuki,
campaign director of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has
governed Japan for over 43 of the last 45 years, told the daily
Asahi Shimbun. ``There is a fear that opposition candidates may
take advantage of this campaign. Their criteria are not clear, and
it is not appropriate for the media to report about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Its aim is to encourage people to vote against politicians who
receive low ratings from the movement. The unlikely figure at the
center of the campaign, Sakurai, is a lifelong _ but until now
mostly solitary _ activist who operates from the kitchen in his
modest suburban home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a people, the Japanese are deeply reluctant to criticize
others, and always mindful of harmony; we never want to stick
out,'' said the salt-and-pepper-haired 65-year-old former
insurance-company employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general that means that people don't express their
thoughts,'' he said, ``especially in politics. The result is a
perpetuation of the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   If that were not enough, over the years the government has
created rules that seem intended to stifle insurgencies by
reformists.
</P>
<P>
   Independent candidates, for example, are sharply limited in the
number of campaign posters they are allowed to put up. Recently the
government outlawed partisan campaigning on the Internet. And there
is already talk about sharply limiting, or even barring, movements
like the blacklist campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sakurai cut his teeth in dissent in the loneliest of ways,
taking the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party to task for
corrupt schemes like the Lockheed scandal, a defense-contract
kickback scheme in the early 1980s. He has also long railed against
what he sees as the party's gradual encroachment on the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   How his movement has gained steam, finally, is an illustration
of the unpredictable nature of political cross-fertilization
brought about by technology, particularly the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's far more vibrant civil society successfully
introduced the theme of fighting corruption in politics into the
most recent legislative elections with a similar blacklist
movement. More than 50 politicians who were targets of the campaign
were defeated at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Sakurai is unabashed in acknowledging that he is imitating the
South Korean effort. He says he more or less copied wholesale the
South Korean model of using the Internet to generate voter
complaints about politicians in the interest of barring the worst
of them from re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not be as successful as the Koreans,'' Sakurai said.
``But they showed us how to trigger something.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He seems to be attracting interest. There have been well over
100,000 hits on the blacklist campaign's Web site, a very high
number for Japan. And the group has been inundated with complaints
about politicians. There are so many volunteers these days that
Sakurai said he no longer recognizes all of them.

   AMA-CUBANS _ As the American Medical Association board convenes
this week, its members could decide to step into a Florida dispute
over the licensing of foreign-trained physicians. Last year,
Florida became the only state in the nation to offer its own
medical licensing exam, an alternative to the United States Medical
Licensing Examination. Only about 450 people, mostly Cubans who
arrived in South Florida in the mid-1980s, were eligible to take
it. Now the AMA may ask Florida legislators to abolish the state
exam. (Bhatt, Palm Beach Post). MOVED.

   UM-DIG _ There's a 50-50 chance the oldest human remains ever

Miami marine archaelogist and his graduate students. The 220-foot
deep Little Salt Spring, near Port Charlotte, has already yielded
human remains dating back 7,000 years and evidence of human
activity 12,000 years ago. The 9,000-year-old bones of Kennewick
Man were found in Washington state four years ago. The UM scientist
hopes to find 12,000-year-old remains in Little Salt Spring, which
is devoid of oxygen and so has preserved everything exactly as it
once was, even wooden spears, skin and hair. But now, on the verge
of these great discoveries about Florida's first inhabitants,
encroaching development threatens to damage the spring and what it
holds. (Kiehl, Palm Beach Post). MOVED.

TECHNOLOGY BY DALLAS ENGINEER INCREASES AVAILABLE PHONE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the telephone was invented, phone numbers have been
growing longer. Richard Levine remembers when his number jumped
from seven to ten digits after a second and then third area code
was created in Dallas. So four years ago, he started working on a
system that would dramatically increase the number of telephones
that could be reached with a single phone number.
</P>
<P>
   In pre-World War II movies, characters placed operator-assisted
calls with just a few numbers. Through the 1950s and into the
1960s, phone numbers grew to seven digits.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the '60s, demand for phone lines increased enough to
spark the idea of three-digit area codes for different regions so
phone numbers could be used more than once. And in the 1990s, when
demand for phone numbers soared as people added faxes and modems to
their homes and offices and cellular phones became more popular,
some phone companies split more metropolitan areas into two area
codes.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, phone companies have begun what they call
overlaying _ draping yet another area code over an already-coded
region for use with any new phone numbers. But that may not be the
end of it. The telecommunications industry predicts that four-digit
area codes could be necessary in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, a telecommunications engineer and professor of
electrical engineering at Southern Methodist University in Dallas,
says that with a three-digit area code and a seven-digit number,
about 8 million distinct combinations of numbers can be cobbled
together to give people as phone numbers. In a city like New York,
with millions of residences and workplaces requiring multiple phone
lines, it's easy to see how that maximum can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Levine has patented a system that would help telephone companies
overcome that problem by allowing people to have just one phone
number for all their telecommunications devices. If his system is
adopted, each individual would have a single number for their voice
line, fax machine, modem, cell phone, radio pager, and even phone
lines assigned to teen-agers or others living under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 7,920,000 distinct telephone numbers for each area
code now,'' Levine explained. ``I could go to 160 million or more
distinct telephone lines in that one area code.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine's invention makes this possible by adding binary codes to
a telecommunications database for each phone line. Each of the
codes represents a particular type of phone line the user wants
available on his single number.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a person might be issued phone number 555-0000 by
the local telephone company. He would then dial a predetermined
number similar to the star-number codes already in use for services
like Caller ID. That would activate the binary codes to be appended
to his single phone number to identify different multiple lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I install it, I'd pick up the handset and dial
star-333 to identify the line as a fax line,'' Levine explained as
an example. The user would dial other star-number combinations to
code for modems, cell phones and voice lines.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when a caller tries to reach Levine on his cell phone, he
would simply call Levine's one phone number. He could use the same
number later that evening to reach Levine at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would make a call to me,'' he said. ``When you call from
your voice phone, the system checks your original line and verifies
that it is a voice line, sees that the destination number has a
voice line, and connects you in the normal way.''
</P>
<P>
   But if someone is sending a fax, the system responds
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telephone network checks the original line and sees, hey,
it's a fax machine,'' he continued. ``The destination number
actually dialed is a voice line, but the system sees that the
fourth line down on that number's list is coded as a fax. So it
translates, or changes the destination. All this happens in 70
milliseconds, and the call goes through to my fax machine.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if a voice line was used to call a cell phone? The
caller would dial a separate star-number code to direct the call to
the cell phone. Levine expects that these codes would be widely
known if the system were universally adopted. Anyone using their
voice line to reach one of several voice lines in a single house
would enter a star-number code for the type of line _ say, star-352
for a teen-ager line. The codes would be the same star-number codes
used universally to install the system.
</P>
<P>
   The binary code would be internal, to prevent anyone from
dialing it by mistake or tampering with it. It would be entered
into existing telecommunications computers.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said his software would be easy for telephone companies
to install. ``There are databases in the network already,'' he
said. ``You're paying for them now. Your phone bill probably has a
line item for Local Portability Service. It costs between 30 and 90
cents a month in every metropolitan area. The purpose is to foster
competition, to allow customers to move their telephone lines to
another switch in a local community but retain their original phone
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine also predicted that his invention would save money for
industry. Each of the 50 area code changes required every year
costs around $20 million each, and the change to a four-digit area
code system is estimated to cost $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He described several other advantages to his invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want to call someone, you don't need to remember all
the phone numbers,'' he said. ``People with medical problems can
pre-register a code so that if they dial 911 it will alert
emergency personnel that the caller is diabetic or epileptic or is
a heart patient. In a large-scale emergency, the carrier can block
non-essential calls so police, ambulance and hospitals can get
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to block calls, you can block them by type or
category,'' he added. ``Telemarketers don't want to waste time
calling people who are going to hang up on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine's invention would work best if it were adopted as a
universal standard for the entire country. He presented his
invention to the Alliance for Telecom Industry Solutions, the
standards body for the telephone industry, but he said the group
tabled discussion of his idea until demand increases. He said he
then approached independent telephone companies, which might
license his invention for their own proprietary use. , meaning the
software might be adopted by some phone systems but not others.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to circulate his idea, Levine has also posted an
explanation of his invention at www.betalab.org. He receives patent
6,076,121 this week.

 &HT;    A MOURNFUL SYRIA PREPARES FOR RULE BY ASSAD'S SON
 &HT;    500 words &AMP; add
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria A day after his death, Syrians embarked Sunday
on a smooth and speedy transition of power from the late president
Hafez Assad to his 34-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad, who six years ago was studying in London to become
an
</P>
<P>
   eye doctor, was named Sunday as commander of the Syrian
military. It was
</P>
<P>
   the next step in a process that is due to end with his being
named president
</P>
<P>
   in two weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, in the streets of this Arab capital, black-clad
residents marched along chanting prayers and slogans while holding
aloft posters of both Assads. They began 40 days of official
mourning for Hafez Assad, highlighted by a state funeral here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the mourners celebrated the rise to power of
his son. ``God, Syria, Bashar Only!'' one group chanted as they
walked in a traffic
</P>
<P>
   circle near the presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad is a new face for this country and for the
turbulent region. So far, his fondness for the Internet and singer
Phil Collins are as well known as his plans for a nation that his
father ruled with an iron hand for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process with Israel, which had faltered before the
longtime leader's sudden death, will likely be on hold for at least
several months while his son seeks to consolidate his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``God willing, he will be like his father,'' 25-year-old Ahlam
Alia said,
</P>
<P>
   with tears in her eyes. ``He was born in the Assad school.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of like-minded marchers spread throughout the
downtown, sometimes banging drums and playing horns. They were
often organized around the youth groups that pervade this rigidly
structured society.
</P>
<P>
   But there also appeared to be a genuine feeling of relief that
Assad's sudden death at age 69 did not immediately to create the
kind of instability that many here had feared.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Assad's rule, Syrian governments changed frequently --
either through bitter political maneuvering or sometimes violent
coups.
</P>
<P>
   Assad governed for a longer time than any ruler here in the
prior 13 centuries. Although he was known to be ailing, his death
nevertheless shocked the country and much of the volatile region.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have problems like this, the whole country acts like
one hand.'','' said Mohammed Khalil, 38, a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the country prepared to host incoming foreign
dignitaries for
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's funeral. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
head the U.S. delegation. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Iranian President Mohammed Khatami and French President Jaques
Chirac were also among those expected to attend. Syria effectively
won independence from France in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Khaki-clad units from the Republican Guard, armed with AK-47
assault rifles, cordoned off the hilltop presidential Palace of the
People and the al-Shami Hospital, where the body will remain until
the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   After the funeral, his family will fly with his body to the
small
</P>
<P>
   town of Qardaha, 125 miles to the northwest. There, where he was
born, Assad
</P>
<P>
   will be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bashar Assad remained in seclusion, he accepted
condolences by phone from President Clinton and other world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of political activity continued to pave the way for
Bashar Assad's rise to power as the leading Baath Party has
nominated him for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That nomination is set to be approved when the rubber-stamp
parliament meets June 25. It will be the culmination of an unlikely
rise for a young man who once shied from power.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had spent more than a decade grooming his first son Basil
for the presidency. But Basil Assad died in a car accident on his
way to the Damascus airport in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Bashar, the second son and third of five Assad
children,
</P>
<P>
   returned from his ophthalmology training abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He is a fluent English speaker in an Arabic country that remains
deeply suspicious of the West. Some people who know him wonder if
he is too gentle to keep the job.
</P>
<P>
   His father crushed descent with brutality and arrests.
</P>
<P>
   After his brother's death, Bashar began a crash course in Syrian
leadership with training as an army officer. Without any formal
government title, he began speaking out for reform of Syria's
stagnant economy while leading a battle against official
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   That fight gained him credibility while silencing potential
rivals. One former prime minister committed suicide under the cloud
of a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad's most important post was as Syria's point man in
neighboring Lebanon, where this nation keeps more than 30,000
troops. That
</P>
<P>
   position lets him dole out the patronage to Syrian businesses.

AS SUPPORT GROWS FOR WORLD CRIMINAL COURT, U.S. PUSHES FOR
CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States, isolated among the nations
of the world, is going into a crucial conference Monday on the
soon-to-be-established International Criminal Court still asking
for changes its charter.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is trying to protect American soldiers and
officials from falling under the court's jurisdiction. But all
members of the European Union and other members of NATO support the
court and have told the United States that there should be no
attempt to reopen debate on how it will work.
</P>
<P>
   Unless some compromise can be found, legal experts say, a major
step in international law will be taken without United States
participation, even though Americans have been at the forefront of
demanding trials for war criminals like Pol Pot and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been unable to win support for
the court from the Pentagon and Sen. Jesse Helms, the North
Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. He has declared that the court treaty would be dead on
arrival if submitted to his panel. So American officials
acknowledge that they are now fighting a rearguard action to try to
exempt countries that do not join from having to face prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The court, which was created by a treaty signed in Rome in July
1998 as a permanent body to try war criminals, may come into
existence by 2002, legal experts say. Its jurisdiction will include
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, 120 nations voted for the court. The United States was
one of seven countries that did not, among them China and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, more than 95 nations have signed the
statute establishing the court and 12 have ratified it, with 60
ratifications needed for the court to begin functioning.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, France became the first permanent member of the
Security Council to ratify the statute. Experts expect the French
example will be followed by a stream of European and other nations.
``France hopes that the required number of ratifications will soon
be reached,'' said a statement from the French government.
</P>
<P>
   William Pace, convenor of the Coalition for an International
Criminal Court, an umbrella group for more than 1,000 human rights
groups and independent legal organizations, called the French
action ``a clear signal to the United States that major nations and
allies are continuing to progress toward completing the
ratification, and they are not willing to reopen the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace called the renewed American effort to change the rules an
``ill-timed and misguided effort.'' Exempting citizens of countries
who have not ratified the treaty, he added, ``would drastically
undermine the effectiveness of the International Criminal Court and
would provide an opening not only for the United States to protect
its officials and soldiers but also for the so-called rogue
countries the court should have as it primary focus. The Pol Pots,
the Saddam Husseins, the Hitlers will not ratify the treaty
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dicker, counsel for Human Rights Watch, said that legal
experts who support the court are puzzled at the strength of the
opposition to the court, since it gives countries whose citizens
are charged with international crimes the right to try them in
their own courts, as the United States has frequently done through
courts martial when American soldiers are involved in criminal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why they seem to be driving this thing over the edge to get
something they don't need is an intriguing question,'' Dicker said
in an interview. ``The treaty has more than enough assurances to
meet their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Dec. 31, countries can sign the International Criminal
Court treaty and ratify later. After that date, a nation will have
to ratify before being able to join. In a recent interview here,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright indicated that there was no
chance that the United States would sign this year unless the court
statute is changed. The issue is likely to be handed over to the
next administration.
</P>
<P>
   European and other diplomats here say that most nations would
like to find a way to include the United States because the court
would be considerably weakened and undervalued without American
involvement. But the conference ends on June 30 and diplomats are
doubtful that there is enough time, or any flexibility in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the court object to what they say is the legal
authority it would have without an acceptable constitutional base.
John Bolton, a former assistant secretary of state for
international organizations in the Bush administration, calls the
establishment of the court ``a stealth approach to eroding our
constitutionalism'' _ for all branches of American government.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is for this reason,'' Bolton wrote in The National
Interest last year, ``that whether strong or weak in its actual
operations, the ICC has unacceptable consequences for the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This court is going to happen,'' John L. Washburn, co-chairman
of the independent Washington Working Group on the International
Criminal Court, wrote last month in an Internet column for the
Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs in New York.
``In fact, it is expected to come into being as early as 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. demand tries to reverse a great moral achievement in
international law,'' Washburn wrote. ``The 1945 Nuremberg tribunal
established forever the personal responsibility and accountability
of those who are guilty of the worst of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power, position and rank cannot absolve them; nor can their
governments. After almost 50 years of lip service and neglect, the
temporary tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda began to enforce this
personal responsibility in real trials that sent real criminals to
real prisons. The ICC will make permanent this enforcement and the
moral commitment it represents.''

 &HT;    A MOURNFUL SYRIA PREPARES FOR RULE BY ASSAD'S SON

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria A day after his death, Syrians embarked Sunday
on a smooth and speedy transition of power from the late president
Hafez Assad to his 34-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad, who six years ago was studying in London to become
an
</P>
<P>
   eye doctor, was named Sunday as commander of the Syrian
military. It was
</P>
<P>
   the next step in a process that is due to end with his being
named president
</P>
<P>
   in two weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, in the streets of this Arab capital, black-clad
residents marched along chanting prayers and slogans while holding
aloft posters of both Assads. They began 40 days of official
mourning for Hafez Assad, highlighted by a state funeral here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the mourners celebrated the rise to power of
his son. ``God, Syria, Bashar Only!'' one group chanted as they
walked in a traffic
</P>
<P>
   circle near the presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad is a new face for this country and for the
turbulent region. So far, his fondness for the Internet and singer
Phil Collins are as well known as his plans for a nation that his
father ruled with an iron hand for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process with Israel, which had faltered before the
longtime leader's sudden death, will likely be on hold for at least
several months while his son seeks to consolidate his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``God willing, he will be like his father,'' 25-year-old Ahlam
Alia said,
</P>
<P>
   with tears in her eyes. ``He was born in the Assad school.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of like-minded marchers spread throughout the
downtown, sometimes banging drums and playing horns. They were
often organized around the youth groups that pervade this rigidly
structured society.
</P>
<P>
   But there also appeared to be a genuine feeling of relief that
Assad's sudden death at age 69 did not immediately to create the
kind of instability that many here had feared.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Assad's rule, Syrian governments changed frequently --
either through bitter political maneuvering or sometimes violent
coups.
</P>
<P>
   Assad governed for a longer time than any ruler here in the
prior 13 centuries. Although he was known to be ailing, his death
nevertheless shocked the country and much of the volatile region.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have problems like this, the whole country acts like
one hand.'','' said Mohammed Khalil, 38, a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the country prepared to host incoming foreign
dignitaries for
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's funeral. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
head the U.S. delegation. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Iranian President Mohammed Khatami and French President Jaques
Chirac were also among those expected to attend. Syria effectively
won independence from France in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Khaki-clad units from the Republican Guard, armed with AK-47
assault rifles, cordoned off the hilltop presidential Palace of the
People and the al-Shami Hospital, where the body will remain until
the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   After the funeral, his family will fly with his body to the
small
</P>
<P>
   town of Qardaha, 125 miles to the northwest. There, where he was
born, Assad
</P>
<P>
   will be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bashar Assad remained in seclusion, he accepted
condolences by phone from President Clinton and other world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of political activity continued to pave the way for
Bashar Assad's rise to power as the leading Baath Party has
nominated him for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That nomination is set to be approved when the rubber-stamp
parliament meets June 25. It will be the culmination of an unlikely
rise for a young man who once shied from power.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had spent more than a decade grooming his first son Basil
for the presidency. But Basil Assad died in a car accident on his
way to the Damascus airport in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Bashar, the second son and third of five Assad
children,
</P>
<P>
   returned from his ophthalmology training abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He is a fluent English speaker in an Arabic country that remains
deeply suspicious of the West. Some people who know him wonder if
he is too gentle to keep the job.
</P>
<P>
   His father crushed descent with brutality and arrests.
</P>
<P>
   After his brother's death, Bashar began a crash course in Syrian
leadership with training as an army officer. Without any formal
government title, he began speaking out for reform of Syria's
stagnant economy while leading a battle against official
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   That fight gained him credibility while silencing potential
rivals. One former prime minister committed suicide under the cloud
of a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad's most important post was as Syria's point man in
neighboring Lebanon, where this nation keeps more than 30,000
troops. That
</P>
<P>
   position lets him dole out the patronage to Syrian businesses.

(FM)SHREW': HIGH ENERGY ESCAPE ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Take a great company like American Ballet Theater,
give it a piece of fluff like ``The Taming of the Shrew'' in John
Cranko's ingenious dance treatment, and you have a terrific piece
of escape entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Among ballets for the tired businessman, this ``Shrew,'' first
seen in New York in 1969 with the Stuttgart Ballet, has held pride
of place. There were lots of laughs as Cranko's Petruchio and his
Kate tripped each other up in pratfalls and were entangled in
hammerlocks. Except for its bravura duets, the choreography got by
on a great deal of sleight of hand, or foot.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday night at the Metropolitan Opera House when Ballet
Theater performed ``The Taming of the Shrew'' for the first time,
the work appeared reborn. Alessandra Ferri and Julio Bocca were
sensational as a tantrum-prone Katherina and a jaunty Petruchio.
The company performed with the same brilliance, energizing the
ensemble on a level one doesn't recall from other productions.
</P>
<P>
   Ferri and Bocca channeled their fiery dramatic temperaments into
comic acting, slapstick and even dancing. The paradox is that sheer
dance power from all concerned carried a ballet short on complex
dance elements. If this production comes across more strongly than
expected, it is thanks to the staging of Reid Anderson and Jane
Bourne, but also to the projection that Ballet Theater provides
through the force of its technique.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stuttgart made its triumphant New York debut in 1969,
Richard Cragun and Marcia Haydee took to the tosses and lifts of
Cranko's high-flying Soviet-style duets with fearlessness and
flair. Unlike anyone else, Cragun could execute triple turns in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Bocca remains satisfied with the usual double air turns, but his
overall technique puts him on a higher level and he gives his
dancing and acting a transformatory power. Like his drunk act in
``The Merry Widow,'' his tipsy Petruchio goes beyond cliche through
the forcefulness of his movement, echoed later in the onrush of
leaps and whizzing turns that are among his trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Ferri is a bit cautious in the duets: the tosses are low. But
from the moment she stamps on stage in her harridan act, she throws
herself fully into her role and brings out its emotional nuances.
The lily-swatting reluctant bride married off to the highest bidder
becomes a tender spouse who never loses her own temper.
</P>
<P>
   Like the best of vaudeville comics Ferri and Bocca are a perfect
team. The scene in which Petruchio starves his new wife into
submission is funny rather than offensive. They make every grab for
a drumstick and every wrestling hold part of a clearly developing
relationship. They won't need a marriage counselor. The
understanding between the two dancers is so complete that they can
make falling off a wooden horse seem significant rather than just a
crossover sequence during a set change.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery, in fact, comes from the National Ballet of Canada,
where a Canadian, Susan Benson, has designed new sets and costumes.
These are similar in concept to the originals at Stuttgart by
Elizabeth Walton, keeping a two-tier Renaissance arched structure,
adding a fine and occasionally impressionistic style. Kurt-Heinz
Stolze's arrangement of compositions by Domenico Scarlatti,
conducted exuberantly by David Briskin, still provides the right
period-piece flavor. Robert Thomson's lighting adds to the
merriment.
</P>
<P>
   Cranko's adaptation of Shakespeare's play makes skillful use of
theatrical symbols to replace words. Ashley Tuttle, engaging and
sweet as Bianca, Katherina's sister, is wooed by three suitors.
Joaquin De Luz, in plumes and turquoise, shows a new side of his
stage personality as a very funny fop, Hortensio; he gives Bianca a
fan. Vladislav Kalinin, marvelous as Gremio, becomes a doddering
dolt without overdoing anything; he gives her a glove. As Lucentio,
Marcelo Gomes looks more alive than ever onstage in his comic
timing and virile nobility; he gives Bianca a rose and dances the
lyric duets with her.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast the uninhibited antics of Cheryl Madeux and Michele
Wiles as two whores, of Brian Reeder as a priest and of Ethan Brown
as an exasperated patriarch are low comedy, expertly put across.
</P>
<P>
   The corps members, streaming out in nightclothes to rail at
Katherina's tantrums, or as revelers at a carnival and aristocrats
at a ball, have a lot of silly time prancing and wiggling. The
first of the ballet's two acts is stronger. But the beauty of the
staging is the opportunity it gives so many dancers to shine as the
individuals they are. Its success is a welcome surprise and one
looks forward to other casts next week, from June 19 to 22.

INTERNET PREMIERE OF 9 MINUTE PARODY LEADS TO VIDEO SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All Joe Nussbaum wanted was to have his foot in
the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we made this short film last year, me and some old
college friends, trying to get noticed by development executives
and studio executives,'' said Nussbaum, a 27-year-old director.
``We made it as a calling-card film, which hopefully would open the
door for major projects for us. Which it did. Which is great.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine-minute film that Nussbaum directed is ``George Lucas in
Love.'' It is a parody of the Oscar-winning ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' except that instead of Shakespeare working through his
writer's block to create ``Romeo and Juliet,'' it features a young
actor playing the lovesick, college-age George Lucas surrounded by
people recognizable as prototypes for the characters in Lucas'
``Star Wars'' series. As did Nussbaum, Lucas attended the
University of Southern California's film program. So didNussbaum's
co-writer on the film, Daniel Shere.
</P>
<P>
   The film rapidly became an underground hit last summer in
Hollywood, where private videotapes of it were eagerly passed
around, resulting in a burst of national publicity and the
beginnings of a directing career for Nussbaum. But it did not end
there. In October, the movie became the debut attraction on a
streaming-video Web site called Mediatrip.com. In April, it was
released as a video, which is being sold exclusively through
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   On April 21, the film's first day of release, it immediately
shot to No. 1 on the Amazon sales charts and has been in the top 10
almost every day since. On many of those days, it has even outsold
the heavily promoted video release of Lucas' own ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace.'' Even as recently as late last
week, ``George Lucas in Love'' ($7.99) was No. 3 on the Amazon
sales chart, and ``Episode 1'' ($16.95) was a distant No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's strange, huh?'' said Austin Harrison, chief executive
of Mediatrip. ``It's No. 3. That just cracks me up.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation in Hollywood about how the
Internet might prove to be a solid showcase and lucrative marketing
tool for films, like shorts, that never get real theatrical runs.
But ``George Lucas in Love'' is one of the first films actually to
open on the Internet and then have success as a video release.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Levy, the producer and another of Nussbaum's college
friends, said the $25,000 it cost to make the film came out of the
pockets of the director, the producer, the composer, the writers
and others involved in the project. All the money they made selling
the Internet rights to Mediatrip _ about $1,500 _ was plowed back
into the film, Levy said, producing film prints that could be shown
at film festivals. Only now, with the video sales, do the
filmmakers stand to make some money.
</P>
<P>
   Inadvertently, Levy said, the filmmakers seem to have tapped
into the audience of the ``Star Wars'' films and science-fiction
fans, exactly the sort of people who are most likely to watch short
films on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only intention back when we made it last year was to do
something that would get agents and producers to put the tape into
their VCRs instead of throwing it away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the video is now available only through Amazon,
Harrison said plans are being made to expand distribution to video
stores and other outlets. International rights and sales to
airlines and others are also being discussed. And by the end of the
year, there will be a ``George Lucas in Love'' videodisc that will
include the nine-minute short, profiles of the filmmakers and some
extra features that Harrison was reluctant to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has been a good sport about it all, praising the film and
even requesting a copy of the poster promoting the movie, which was
promptly sent to him.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Nussbaum said, no thought was given to posting the
film on the Internet. But then, several of the new,
entertainment-oriented dot-coms began calling and making offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, wow, we certainly didn't make this for the
Internet, but we'd be fools not to put it on the Internet,''
Nussbaum said. ``What is it they say? If three people tell you
you're drunk, you'd better sit down? Well, if four Internet sites
tell you they want your movie, you'd better put it on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   When the numbers of people watching the movie on Mediatrip grew
into the hundreds of thousands, with active chat rooms about the
film and more than 600 posted reviews, it seemed only natural to
try to release it on videotape, Harrison said. ``People would
literally post on the bulletin board, `When is the video coming
out?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the film had its first burst of publicity last
summer, Nussbaum signed a couple of development deals for films
that were never made.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ended up going the way of many Hollywood movies,'' he
said. ``They dissolved.'' He is not complaining, though. He has
been working regularly, making television commercials and is in the
final stages of negotiating another studio deal for his
feature-film debut. Since the movie came out, meanwhile, Levy has
taken a job creating digital entertainment for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would always say to each other, `How long is our window?'''
Nussbaum said. `` `How long can you be the buzz? How long can you
be the hot thing?' We figured it would be quite short. Of any
industry in the world, Hollywood has been built on flashes in the
pan. We fully expected that if we did well, it would have to be
quick, we'd have to jump on it. But here it is, what, a year later?
And it's still going.''

ASSAD'S DEATH LEAVES ISRAEL CALM BUT UNCERTAIN  
</HEADLINE>
    By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli leaders proclaimed on Sunday that the death
of President Hafez Assad of Syria had ushered in a new era or at
least ushered out an old one in the Middle East. But no one could
predict what that portended beyond a potentially problematic
transition period.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mourning, no celebration of the death and no
re-assessment here of an Arab leader familiar to generations of
Israelis as a sworn enemy of their state, yet one who inspired
sometimes ambivalent feelings as a cunning leader and a worthy
adversary, too.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most agreed with Nahum Barnea, the dean of newspaper
columnists, who wrote Sunday morning: ``We Israelis have no reason
to shed any tears over the death of Hafez Assad. It's a waste of
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis expressed the hope that positive change would
prove inevitable. ``Assad's successor is the times and not any one
man,'' said Shimon Peres, Israel's minister for regional affairs.
``Because if his successor doesn't adapt himself to the times,
Syria will remain a very poor and isolated country in a very
difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some worried aloud that Syria would degenerate into chaos, which
could destabilize Lebanon, and spread violence into Israel. But
more said wishfully that Assad's death could help Syria shed its
insularity, open up to the West and perhaps even lose what is
perceived here as its intransigence in pursuing peace.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted hopefully that Assad's designated successor, his
34-year-old son Bashar, was educated in England, that he heads
Syria's computer society, and that he is not bound by the same
personal entanglements in history. Bashar Assad was just two years
old in 1967, when Syria, with his father as defense minister, lost
the Golan Heights to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the widespread calm here, the Tel Aviv stock
exchange, usually a good barometer of geopolitical anxiety,
registered barely a flutter. And the Israeli military, after a
24-hour alert, reported quiet on Israel's northern borders and said
that no new forces would be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking on the other side, and everything looks as
usual,'' the senior official said. ``Our military estimation is
that the regime will focus internally, on stabilizing itself. We
don't think that the death of Assad will stimulate the area or
light any fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad's death almost certainly puts the prospects of regional
peace talks on the back burner until Bashar Assad, if he is indeed
made the new leader, wins over the political and military
establishment, calms ethnic tensions and grows into his authority.
</P>
<P>
   For all his hostility, the Syrian leader did preserve peace on
the border with the Golan Heights for most of his rule. But despite
the fact that Assad had made what he considered a ``strategic
choice'' to pursue peace, he was the oldest hardline skeptic in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   And many here said, again hopefully, that the absence of his
ideological dominance in the Arab world could shift the tenor of
debate. It could also, they added, make it easier for Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to make a final deal with Israel
without being accused of selling out. Teams of Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators are to resume talks in the United States this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad personally was a cloud hanging over the possibility of
reaching a reasonable arrangement in the region,'' said Shlomo Ben
Ami, Israel's security minister and senior peace negotiator with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Several right-wing leaders used the occasion to promote their
belief that there are grave risks in pursuing peace with aging
leaders in an unstable region. Zalman Shoval, a former ambassador
to the United States and now the spokesman for the rightist Likud
Party, wrote Sunday that Assad's death ``underlines just how
unreasonable was Israel's head-long rush into negotiations'' with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must realize that what goes for Syria goes for the
Palestinians as well,'' Shoval wrote in the Jerusalem Post. ``In
the Arab Middle East, nothing is permanent and everything is
volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Cabinet meeting Sunday, Barak criticized this line of
thinking, noting that peace lasted with other Arab countries, like
Egypt, even after the death of the peacemaker. He also agreed with
diplomatic analysts who noted Sunday that it was a good thing that
Israel had withdrawn its troops from Lebanon before Assad died.
Pulling out now _ the original withdrawal date was July 7 _ would
have been complicated by the period of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few decades, Assad's face, on banners, hovered over
Damascus. Here, less explicitly, it had become part of the scenery,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life without Hafez, after all these years, is an unknown, and
we will all have to go through a weaning period,'' Chemi Shalev
wrote Sunday in the Maariv newspaper. ``But along with the worry
there is also room for hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, Assad was a bitter enemy who cast a giant shadow
over the entire Middle East. This morning, now that he's gone, we
can see the sun once more, even if it is blinding at present.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AN EMPTY OPEN WITHOUT PAYNE STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time the son filled out an entry form for the U.S.
Open, the father, who had played in the 1955 Open, had some words
of advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the national championship,'' the father said. ``When
you send your entry in, you put your real name on the entry form,
your full name.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades the son did just that, writing ``William
Payne Stewart.'' But for the 100th U.S. Open, which begins Thursday
at Pebble Beach, that name was not on an entry form. The golfer who
won last year's Open with a dramatic 15-foot par putt at Pinehurst
No. 2, died Oct. 25 on a ghostly Learjet that eventually plunged
into a South Dakota field.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a half-century, there will be no defending
champion in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1949, when Ben Hogan was recuperating from severe
injuries suffered when his Cadillac was crushed by a Greyhound bus
on a Texas highway, has the reigning Open champion not teed off in
defense of the title. And never had the reigning champion died
before the next Open.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, it will be an empty Open without Stewart, who
also won the 1991 Open at Hazeltine National outside Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the defending champion tees off with the British
Open champion and the U.S. Amateur champion in the first two rounds
before the 36-hole cut. Stewart's slot will be filled by Jack
Nicklaus, a four-time Open champion, in a threesome with Scotland's
Paul Lawrie and the Texas amateur David Gossett.
</P>
<P>
   In Stewart's honor, the U.S. Golf Association, which governs all
the national championships, has planned a sunrise service at 7 a.m.
Wednesday near Pebble Beach's 18th tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In accordance with Tracey's wishes,'' said David Fay, the USGA
executive director, referring to Stewart's widow, ``the service
will be a tribute to Payne, not a memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Stewart and their two children, Chelsea and Aaron, also
will attend a Tuesday evening celebration at this 100th U.S. Open
of 24 living Open champions.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart almost won two other Opens, finishing second to Lee
Janzen both in 1993 at Baltusrol and 1998 at Olympic, but his
defining moment occurred at Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   In her memoir, ``Payne Stewart: The Authorized Biography
(Broadman and Holman, $24.99), Tracey Stewart, an Australian who
met her husband in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when he was playing on
the Asian Tour, wrote of a suggestion she made after Saturday's
round. He had shot a spotty 72, mostly because of poor putting. As
she watched, she noticed that when he putted, he made the mistake
of moving his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to keep your head down,'' she told him later.
``You're trying to watch the ball go in rather than keeping your
head down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dusk at Pinehurst that Saturday night, Stewart spent 45
minutes on the putting green with one thought: not moving his head.
</P>
<P>
   In his duel with Phil Mickelson in Sunday's final round, Stewart
made an undulating 25-foot putt at the 16th hole to tie for the
lead, then took the lead with a 3-foot birdie putt at the short
17th. Minutes later, he sank the winning 15-footer on the 18th
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it,'' he told Tracey as they hugged. ``I kept my head
down. All day, I did it. I kept my head down.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, other Open champions have thrown the winning
golf ball to the gallery around the 18th green, but after Stewart's
ball clunked into the cup on that 15-foot putt, he grabbed it,
kissed it and slipped it into his pocket. This ball was a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Other Open champions have eventually donated one of their
Open-winning clubs for display in Golf House, the USGA headquarters
in Far Hills, N.J., as Ben Hogan did with the 1-iron he used at
Merion in his comeback victory in the 1950 Open.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart died too quickly for that, but maybe the putter that
sank the 15-footer, the longest putt to win the Open, will be there
someday.
</P>
<P>
   Hauntingly, before that final round Stewart watched an NBC
television segment on him and his father, Bill Stewart, the
Missouri amateur who shot 83-88 in that 1955 Open at Olympic in San
Francisco, the father who advised the son to put his real name, his
full name, on his Open entry form. The son who would win the Open
twice. &QL;

`VOICE': ELVIS COSTELLO AND CAST, COMMANDING AT ARTISTIC
BORDERLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new patch on the border between art music and pop
is being cultivated, and Elvis Costello is its chief gardener. Even
when he was an angry young punk, Costello wrote unusually intricate
melodies and lyrics. Now, at 45, he seeds his compositions with
overt jazz and classical influences and uses his popularity to
promote the work of equally ambitious hybridizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Voice,'' a ``contemporary opera'' composed by
Steve Nieve and performed by Costello and others on Friday night at
Town Hall, raised the thought that Costello hadn't found this
artistic borderland on his own. Nieve has been Costello's pianist
and arranger for much of his career. After his fruitful liaison
with Burt Bacharach, Costello reunited with Nieve for a sweetly
nostalgic retrospective tour last year. Those shows made reference
to the work performed on Friday, but only hinted at the confident
step into the spotlight Nieve has now taken.
</P>
<P>
   Although Costello sang the heroic part in this theater piece, he
was not its star. That role belonged to the music itself, more a
meditative song cycle than a traditional opera. Nieve, leading the
Brodsky String Quartet and saxophonist Ned Rothenberg from behind
his piano, used laudable restraint as both composer and conductor.
His themes disclosed themselves gently, without the obviousness
that sometimes afflicts ``serious'' work by pop-based writers.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting celebration of the voice, this one featured plenty of
singers. Its libretto, written by Muriel Teodori, followed the
overwhelming obsession of the Drunkman, played by Costello, with an
opera singer he had heard on a recording.
</P>
<P>
   Interlopers tried to turn the Drunkman away from his muse. The
Workman, played with characteristic self-effacement by Ron
Sexsmith, extolled gainful employment. Three Ghosts of Opera, sung
by the classically trained Elsa Higby, Alexandra Picard and Heather
Gilles, lured the Drunkman toward a suitably operatic death.
</P>
<P>
   He resisted and was rewarded by an encounter with his singing
idol, played by Julie Leibowitch. The Chief of Police (John
Flansburgh), then tried to arrest the Drunkman for loitering,
spiritually, in the halls of Art. But love conquered all, no one
stuck herself with a dagger, and all joined the rousing final
chorus.
</P>
<P>
   This simple plot worked best when kept in the background.
Friday's performance hit its stride when individual singers offered
meditations on the lure of the voice. All were in fine form, with
Sexsmith using the angelic tenor that makes his own albums so
wonderful, and Flansburgh screeching with the comic flair he
employs in the band They Might Be Giants. The ghosts fulfilled
their roles as figments of the familiar heroines Norma, Butterfly
and Carmen and Leibowitch, though constricted at first, lent an
ingenue's freshness to her part.
</P>
<P>
   The night's one impossible role belonged to the dancer Yarmo,
who had to fill in the work's many balletic passages alone. He
worked very hard, and was graceful, but his calisthenic moves
sometimes distracted. In a fully staged version, one presumes, more
dancers would enhance the story, although a Robert Wilson-style
approach using lights and scrims might also well serve the
glimmering score.
</P>
<P>
   Neither opera nor jazz, ``Welcome to the Voice'' found its own
ground, one that will be enjoyed by fans of the sophisticated song
book Nieve and Costello have written. This work took their style
into a more elaborate structure, doing its part to break down
generic divides further.

LIFE IN BALLET LAND, AS TOLD BY A CHOREOGRAPHER (RATHER THAN
HOLLYWOOD) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harald Lander's ``Etudes'' ought to be required
viewing for anyone who believes that the current film ``Center
Stage'' presents an accurate picture of a life in ballet.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, performed by American Ballet Theater last Wednesday
afternoon and evening at the Metropolitan Opera House, is a long
journey through academic ballet training. Spectacular, cornball and
dull in turn, the ballet progresses from the most basic steps
performed by the smallest of small fry to demanding sequences
performed by those who have mastered not just the steps but also
the physical and spiritual discipline the art demands.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's lead cast _ Irina Dvorovenko, Jose Manuel Carreno
and Vladimir Malakhov _ stood out on the whole for the glitter of
its performing. In the afternoon the emphasis was more on
expansiveness and simplicity in a performance headed by Amanda
McKerrow, Marcelo Gomes and Maxim Belotserkovsky. Dvorovenko's
dancing had a weight that made it regal. McKerrow was delicately
lyrical. Lander did not allow for much pyrotechnical ornamentation,
and both Carreno and Malakhov looked uncharacteristically subdued.
The greatest beauty of their dancing was their contrasting
qualities. If Carreno could be said to be earth, Malakhov is air.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon Gomes stood out for his big, unforced approach
to classical technique. Like Dvorovenko, Belotserkovsky has a more
forceful Russian-style attack, mixed here, characteristically, with
a winning clarity of line and shape. The score, composed by
Knudaage Riisager and based on Czerny etudes, was conducted at both
performances by David Lamarche.
</P>
<P>
   The matinee performance also included Malakhov's role debut in
Martha Graham's ``Diversion of Angels,'' dancing with Sandra Brown
as half of the Couple in Red. The purest of classicists, Malakhov
has obviously paid close and devoted attention to the distinctive
shapes and propulsive quality of the Graham modern-dance technique.
</P>
<P>
   His is somewhat airy Graham dancing, but that quality of
devotion keeps him sufficiently tethered to the earth. Isaac
Stappas, who danced the Fourth Man, looked as if he had been born
dancing Graham, in a fine lead cast completed by Stella Abrera,
Gomes, Erica Cornejo and Herman Cornejo.

`BEE SEASON': FICTIONAL JEWISH FAMILY'S TROUBLES WITTILY
CHRONICLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While it may be true, as Tolstoy famously wrote, that every
unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, the unhappiness of the
Naumanns in Myla Goldberg's unusual first novel, ``Bee Season,''
seems so particularly original and intriguing that you almost want
the author to go on denying the family members the fulfillment they
so ardently seek.
</P>
<P>
   Saul Naumann, the father, is a cantor whose feelings of love for
his wife, Miriam, have ebbed ``into gratitude.'' His passion is to
retire to his study and read the great Jewish mystics, although he
knows that he lacks whatever it takes to achieve true communion
with God.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam, a partner in a law firm, spends her hours at home
cleaning and organizing, ``a hummingbird in human form, her wings
too fast to be seen without a stop-motion camera.'' Orphaned while
in college by a car accident, she seeks to heal herself by
occasionally stealing from stores what she thinks of as the missing
pieces of her world.
</P>
<P>
   The Naumanns' oldest child, Aaron, 16, dreams of becoming a
rabbi. Inside his father's synagogue ``he is junior class
president, football captain and star of the school musical.'' But
outside he has few friends and is terrorized by bullies. His
11-year-old sister, Eliza, can't forgive him for failing to resist
during a fight she secretly witnessed. She also suffers from
feeling less smart than Aaron is, from failing to be picked as he
was for her school's talented and gifted program.
</P>
<P>
   Everything changes when Eliza exercises her talent for spelling.
To everyone's surprise, she wins her class, school and district
spelling bees and qualifies for the nationals, to be held in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Her delighted father pitches in to help her study. He begins by
drilling her with Webster's Third International Dictionary. But he
sees in her the potential to be what he cannot be, namely a
practitioner of the teachings of Abraham Abulafia, a 13th-century
cabalist who taught that the key to transcendence is language
itself.
</P>
<P>
   As Saul tells Eliza: ``Abulafia believed that, by concentrating
on letters, the mind could loose itself from its shackles to
commune with a presence greater than itself, what Abraham Abulafia
called shefa, the influx. He believed that barriers separated
personal existence from the larger stream of life, the Divine
Intellect.'' Eliza, Saul is convinced, can achieve shefa, if
properly trained.
</P>
<P>
   While Eliza is thrilled by her father's attention, Aaron suffers
from the loss of it and begins to question his own devotion to
Judaism. Concluding that ``he's bought Judaism without consulting
the side of the box'' it came in, he begins to look at other
religions and eventually falls in with a Hare Krishna group.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miriam steps up her quest for what she calls
Perfectimundo, feeling that something is ``growing inside her,
waiting for the right moment to make itself known.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliza, sensitive to these changes in the family dynamic, feels
guilty for her part in causing them.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who has published short stories in various magazines,
does a sensitive and witty job of plotting the back-and-forth
lurches of these seekers after the divine. Aaron, at breakfast on
his first overnight at his Hare Krishna temple, ``longs for cereal
and not prasadam, has his first pang of homesickness at the thought
of Frosted Flakes with sliced banana.'' Miriam longs to match the
Perfectimundo implied by a bubble-gum pink Spalding rubber ball.
</P>
<P>
   As for Eliza, ``her new powers of concentration astound'' her
father. ``He laughs to recall a time when she struggled to ignore
the sounds of television. He has sneaked up behind her during her
chanting and dropped all three volumes of Webster's Universal. She
hasn't moved, as far as he can tell not even hearing its unabridged
collision with the hard floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything works in ``Bee Season.'' As eloquently as Eliza's
experience is described, there seems something a little forced
about equating Abulafia's prescription of language with the
chanting of children spelling words like propagate and manicotti
and gherkin.
</P>
<P>
   Faintly off-putting, too, is Goldberg's adherence to the new
form of English in which ``like'' substitutes for ``as if,''
``different than'' for ``different from,'' ``lay'' for ``lie,''
``enormity'' for ``enormousness,'' ``disinterest'' for
``uninterest,'' ``access'' for ``get'' and ``a moment in time'' for
``a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she keeps her story alive with witty modulations of her
characters' feelings. As Eliza approaches the ecstasy of
experiencing God, she also the sees practical advantages in her
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shefa will erase years of average report cards, undo seasons
of unfulfilled expectations, and legitimize Eliza's new place by
her father's side. Shefa will neutralize the guilt she feels when
she sits opposite Aaron at the dinner table. Shefa is Eliza's
national bee backup plan. ... With God on her side, the national
trophy is as good as in her hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As mundane and unmystical as these longings of Eliza's may be,
you never stop caring about whether she will fulfill them.

   ZHONGSHAN, China _ Every Monday for seven years, Wang Tai-ching
has boarded a ferry in Hong Kong and chugged up the muddy waters of
the Pearl River delta. His destination is a factory in Zhongshan,
one of the slapdash cities that have sprouted in Guangdong Province
over the last decade, crowding out rice paddies and duck ponds with
smokestacks and elevated highways.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, and thousands of Hong Kong entrepreneurs like him, have
helped transform Guangdong into the fastest-growing region in China
_ a capitalist hothouse on the South China Sea. As China moves
closer to its dream of entering the World Trade Organization,
however, people here are nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Far from relishing the prospect of free trade and wide-open
markets, they worry that the new competition could threaten their
livelihood. To enter the WTO, China will have to throw open its
doors to foreign companies. And by reducing tariffs on imports, it
will level its commercial playing field _ depriving the frontier
capitalists in Guangdong of many of their advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of WTO is that it is a signal to foreigners to come
in,'' said Wang, 55, who bunks in a spartan dormitory with his
workers during the week. ``But it's different for the people who
are already here. I don't know how many will survive and how many
will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang's factory makes disposable diapers. His company, Disposable
Soft Goods, is one of 15 such manufacturers in China _ a remarkable
statistic for a country that regarded throw-away diapers as an
unattainable luxury a few years ago. Procter &AMP; Gamble began selling
Pampers throughout China last October, setting off a ferocious
price war.
</P>
<P>
   That is just the beginning of Wang's headaches. As part of its
agreement to join the WTO, China is committed to reducing duties on
imported raw materials like plastic and fabric by 40 percent, and
to open up its tightly controlled distribution system. This will
greatly benefit global manufacturers like Procter &AMP; Gamble,
enabling them to cut their prices even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very tough for the local companies to
survive,'' said Andy Xie, an economist who specializes in China at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong. ``The WTO deal means that
in industries with large economies of scale, the American companies
will dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   As one bounces along the pothole-pocked roads here, Zhongshan
seems the very picture of a swaggering gold-rush town. Tacky hotels
and karaoke bars line the streets, while prostitutes troll for
visiting businessmen. But there is something new in the air these
days: fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local people are scared,'' said Wang, who employs 130
workers, most of them women. ``They're worried about losing their
jobs. They're worried about their factories being closed. To them,
this is a revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the threat to Chinese-owned companies is not confined
to Guangdong Province. But it resonates powerfully here because of
Guangdong's hard-won prosperity. An economic backwater as recently
as 1984, this province of 60 million people capitalized on its
proximity to Hong Kong and its distance from Beijing to transform
itself into a free-market powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Hong Kong companies moved their factories across the
border to escape rising labor costs in Hong Kong. The increasingly
blurry line between Guangdong and Hong Kong enabled the garment
industry to evade strict quotas placed on clothing exported from
China.
</P>
<P>
   Later, business people from Taiwan came, attracted by
Guangdong's anything-goes atmosphere and the access to Hong Kong's
duty-free port. More than 4,000 Taiwanese companies set up
footwear, electronics and other factories.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, Guangdong was producing two-thirds of
China's exports. When Deng Xiaoping made a famous visit here in
1992, he held up the province as a model for China. Guangdong, he
declared, would become the ``fifth tiger of Asia,'' alongside Hong
Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But the political winds have shifted, and the country's leaders
are now promoting development around Shanghai and in the northern
provinces, notably in its garment industry. Guangdong's economic
growth slowed to 9.4 percent last year from 10.2 percent in 1998.
Although it still grows faster than China as a whole, its share of
the country's exports dropped to 41 percent in 1999 and 38 percent
in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of China's economic development is moving north,''
Xie said. ``Guangdong will remain successful, but it will no longer
be central to China's growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Guangdong is simply suffering the same growing
pains as any region that struggles up the economic ladder. With its
labor costs the highest in China outside of Shanghai, it is trying
to attract more capital-intensive industries, like
telecommunications, computers and software. It is also trying to
hold on to the higher-end segments of its traditional manufacturing
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Guangdong needs to do is move up the value chain,'' said
Vincent Chen, the founder of Texwatch.com, a Web site that tracks
the garment industry. ``They will be known for making high-quality
products, like polo shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang Tai-ching is not about to wave a white flag. He notes that
he, too, will benefit from lower duties on imported raw materials.
Lower duties on machinery will allow him to install another
assembly line in his factory.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the threat from Procter &AMP; Gamble, he wants to build
warehouses in the north to deliver diapers in Shanghai and Beijing.
Eventually, Wang predicts, his factory will produce 300 million
diapers a year. With 19 million babies born in China every year, he
says there are more than enough bottoms to go around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic about WTO,'' Wang said gamely. ``But the
changes haven't happened yet.''

KUERTEN STAYS CALM THROUGH FRUSTRATIONS AND WINS THE FRENCH OPEN
TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Roughly 40 minutes had gone by since Gustavo Kuerten had
begun walking merrily toward the net to celebrate his second French
Open title Sunday, roughly 40 minutes since a cross-court backhand
struck by Magnus Norman had been called out only to be overruled by
the chair umpire, Francois Pareau, to Kuerten's stupefaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I was watching white and he was watching black,''
Kuerten said.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 40 minutes, and the fifth-seeded Brazilian was still on
Center Court, still in the fourth set chasing down Norman's heavy
forehands and trying his best to forget all the match points that
had gone by. He had squandered three in the 10th game; four more in
a marathon 12th game and three more in the ensuing tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Ten match points lost in all; 10 opportunities to raise his
skinny arms overhead and hug his coach and confidante, Larri
Passos. There was no precedent for this kind of frustration in a
Grand Slam final. Lesser men would have been an emotional wreck,
screaming at the shifting sky and heaping insults on the umpire.
But Kuerten, a lesser man once, stayed calm. At 6-6 in the
tiebreaker, he fired a first serve at Norman's body that the Swede
could not quite handle to earn his 11th match point.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the crowd was shellshocked: worn out, like the players,
from anticipation and lack of resolution. There was not much buzz
as Norman prepared to serve, little emotion from Kuerten as he
stood 12 feet behind the baseline. But when the next rally ended
with Norman hitting a forehand wide, this 3-hour-44-minute match _
as much an ordeal as it was a spectacle _ was over. Kuerten, no
longer a one-Slam wonder, was the winner, 6-2, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (6).
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you start to think, especially because the first
match point I thought the ball was out, so for me it was over,''
said Kuerten, who was seeded fifth. ``Every time I missed another
chance, I was still thinking about that. It was really strange: the
points keep passing and you don't realize if it's going to be OK or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as in 1997, it would turn out beautifully for the man the
Brazilians call Guga. Just as in 1997, he won with his
eightysomething grandmother Olga Schlosser in the stands after she
flew in from Brazil and with his nation's green and yellow flag
fluttering in the stands and a band waiting in the wings. Just as
in 1997, he won by generating remarkable pace and depth from the
baseline and demonstrating slightly surreal endurance.
</P>
<P>
   But this title, like any second Grand Slam title, was a
different psychological challenge. In 1997, Kuerten was ranked
66th, had a room in a two-star hotel and was only a household name
in his beachside Brazilian hometown of Florianopolis. A year later,
he was upset early in singles and ended up being disqualified from
the doubles after throwing his racquet in frustration and narrowly
missing the chair umpire's head. A tearful Kuerten later issued a
written apology.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, there would be no such melodrama, and he was on
the very short list of favorites from the beginning. He has
improved his serve considerably since 1997 and was undisputably the
most consistent clay-court player over the last two seasons. Last
month, he lost to Norman in the final in Rome and then beat him en
route to winning the title in Hamburg a week later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this shows that I'm really one of the top players _ a
guy who will stay around,'' Kuerten said in his pleasantly
fractured English. ``People maybe thought I'd win one time and be
finished. So I think right now with my name again here in the
history, I think I put myself as one of the players who can stay
for a long time in the tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten has also reached the quarterfinals at the United States
Open and, more surprisingly because of his grip changes and long
backswings, Wimbledon. He also reached the final in Key Biscayne
earlier this year, losing in a tight match to Pete Sampras. But
clay is where he remains the most dangeorus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Kuerten won three five-set matches on his way to the
trophy. This time, despite a suspect back that bothered him earlier
in the claycourts season, he stared down defeat against Yevgeny
Kafelnikov in the quarterfinals and Juan Carlos Ferrero in the
semifinals, rallying from two-set-to-one deficits in both
instances. Against Kafelnikov he was down 2-4, 15-40 in the fourth
set, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kafelnikov was my worst nightmare, I can say,'' Kuerten said.
``I was not feeling my game. He was controlling the match. Somehow
things changed.''
</P>
<P>
   They would change on Sunday, as well, and this time Kuerten
would be the one whose lead would start to erode. For two sets,
Norman played far less than his best and occasionally threw his
racquet, making this final between the two top players in the
yearlong points race anticlimactic. With shot after shot striking
the net, Norman kept twisting away and bellowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I wanted it so much,'' said Norman, the Swede who was
playing in his first Grand Slam final. ``I was standing on my back
foot when I played the forehand today. The other matches I've been
going through the ball. Today I was playing too defensive in the
beginning. I didn't feel good out there. I was not nervous. Things
just didn't go my way.''
</P>
<P>
   That would change in the third set and early in the fourth, when
Norman broke Kuerten in the first game and took a 2-0 lead. But
Guga would soon even the score and they would trade breaks and
groundstrokes with great intensity, if not always great efficiency,
until the end.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a great match, but the way it finished (and did
not finish) was unquestionably great theater. With Norman serving
at 4-5 in the final set, he soon fell behind by 15-40. On the
second match point, after Pareau had overruled on the first,
Kuerten knocked a forehand long, with Norman shouting ``Come on''
before it even landed.
</P>
<P>
   The Swede would save another match point that game and then
dodge four more on his next service game, which would stretch to
nine deuces and last for 21 minutes. But after making up a 3-6
deficit in the tiebreaker, Norman's great escape finally came to an
end along with his lead in the points race. Kuerten is the new
number one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the feeling I could win all the time until the last
point, until I saw the forehand go out,'' Norman said. ``I still
feel like if I could play the match again.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice trailed off and as it did, a group of Brazilian fans
kept thumping drums in the distance as they danced a victory lap
around the stadium.

SPORTS COLUMN: FINALLY, THE DEVILS `SKATE THE CUP' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Along with enthusiasm for their Stars and friendly
manners toward visitors, the hockey fans of Texas show a
sophistication about the sport that belies their recent arrival in
the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Devils won the Stanley Cup late Saturday night with
a 2-1 victory in the second overtime, a group of men and women in
Stars jerseys gathered near the glass as the Devils players posed
for pictures with the trophy for about a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skate the cup!'' they chanted, some of them with cameras in
their hands. ``Skate the cup!'' It is a modern tradition for teams
to take the silver prize in a long, slow procession, holding it
high, passing it from hands to hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, clinching on the road before subdued applause, had
simply forgotten. Finally, with about 2,000 people left in Reunion
arena, somebody remembered to start the parade and the Devils went
one, tired lap to the respectful applause of their gracious hosts.
</P>
<P>
   You could excuse their temporary amnesia regarding protocol.
Jason Arnott's goal, at 8 minutes 20 seconds of the second extra
session, had ended a grueling six-game series that seemed longer.
Game 5, a 1-0 Dallas victory, had ended in the third overtime on
Friday morning. So the two teams had played more than nine full
periods _ more than three full regulation games _ in a span of
about 52 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott, who beat Eddie Belfour from close range after a setup
from Patrik Elias Saturday night, had left Game 4 after being
struck by the stick-clenching gloves of Dallas defenseman Derian
Hatcher. ``I had headaches,'' Arnott said. ``I was a little hazy,
but there wasn't anything that was going to stop me. I was going to
go through a brick wall if I had to play. Nothing was going to keep
me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnott and Elias had extra motivation Saturday because their
linemate, Petr Sykora, finished the game in a local hospital bed.
He had left the ice on a stretcher in the first period after
Hatcher flattened him with a hard check to the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts went out to him,'' Arnott said of Sykora. ``To see
him get carried off like that was tough. Especially for Patty. They
are so close. Patty and I looked at each other and said, `We've got
to do this for our boy.' That goal was for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped people forget about Arnott's cross-checking
penalty, late in the first overtime, that gave Dallas a power play
that extended into the second overtime. ``I didn't want my
teammates to jump on me,'' Arnott said. ``I kind of said it was a
bad penalty and kill it off for me, boys, and we'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was the second tournament championship for the
franchise in six seasons and the end of an era. The Dallas fans,
who had celebrated the championship last season, stood near the
glass and watched the sincere and sentimental celebration of the
Devils players. Claude Lemieux, the veteran, had tears as he hugged
Scott Gomez, the rookie. Elias lay on the ice, near the spot of
Sykora's injury, with Sykora's jersey draped over his chest, as he
talked on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The four Russian players _ Vladimir Malakhov, Sergei Nemchinov,
Alexander Mogilny and Sergei Brylin _ gathered around the cup and
posed for a photographer. Scott Stevens, the captain, had two
trophies to hoist and trouble doing it. He also won the Conn Smythe
trophy as most valuable player in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heavy,'' he said of the cup, ``and I've got a bad
shoulder. So it was tough to lift it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Daneyko, the other veteran defenseman, stood in the corridor
outside the locker room for more than an hour, wearing his full
uniform, with pads and skates. He is 36 and the senior Devil,
having joined the team in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko wants to play next season but, with an expansion draft
later this month and inevitable churn of a roster, there is no
guarantee he will ever again wear the Devils uniform. He used words
like ``cherish'' and ``grateful'' and ``heart'' when telling of
what this meant to him.
</P>
<P>
   Along with players, much else might change for the Devils. John
McMullen, the owner, is selling the team to the Yankees-Nets
combine. Although General Manager Lou Lamoriello and Coach Larry
Robinson will be asked to return, it is not a sure thing that they
will be back. As hockey people often do in times like these,
Robinson spoke of family, especially of his first grandson, born
during the playoffs. Now, he finally gets a chance to see the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to other subjects, he spoke of the incredible tension of
the final two games. ``I think hockey can be really, really proud
of the last two games,'' Robinson said. ``I don't think you are
ever going to see two buildings that are more tense, with people
sitting on the edge of their seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson reflected on his coaching career, which saw him leave
Los Angeles last summer after four undistinguished seasons as a
head coach. He returned to New Jersey as an assistant to Robbie
Ftorek and replaced the fired Ftorek with eight games remaining in
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, could Robinson have imagined this scene?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dream on,'' he said. &QL;

suspension of a teacher, and the discovery of what officials
describe as substantial evidence of administrative cheating on a

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Well, one thing didn't change: the parking valets
were once more dressed in tuxedos despite the heat of the day at
Belmont Park. But in most other ways, the 132nd Belmont Stakes on
Saturday was staged in stunning contrast to the recent past for the
third leg of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Not just that the Triple Crown wasn't at stake after three
straight years when it was. But chiefly because the race actually
did fall apart after the two superstars of the 3-year-old class
dropped out _ Fusaichi Pegasus with a small cut on his right front
foot, Red Bullet because he needed more rest. So, for the first
time in 30 years, they were running the Belmont without the winners
of either the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness. It was as though a
bunch of amateur actors were thrown onto the Broadway stage, and
the marquee was at a loss for words.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the cast lacked distinction. None of the 11
horses had won a Grade I stakes. Only one of them, Impeachment, had
run in both the Derby and the Preakness. The eventual winner,
Commendable, had lost six in a row since winning his debut 10
months earlier at Del Mar, and he ran 17th in the Kentucky Derby.
He was entered almost in desperation by D. Wayne Lukas, the king of
Triple Crown racing, after High Yield finished 15th in the Derby
and seventh in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Commendable was no secret to the betting public, which wasn't
betting on him to outrun his credentials: he was an 18-1 longshot.
He also lost a shoe when it got stuck in the flooring of his
paddock stall before the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do anything,'' Lukas said about the shoe, like any
trainer reporting a totally insignificant matter just before the
most important race of the horse's career. ``He just stood there
and turned, and it held in the footing and came off real clean. The
blacksmith did a good job putting it back on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost as though Pegasus, the flying horse, had clipped a
wing. But losing a shoe turned out to be really insignificant for
Commendable, who sprang from the gate second to the pace-setting
Hugh Hefner. One mile or so later, Pat Day made his move, and
Commendable threw his challenge to Hugh Hefner, who was getting
tired anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As they crossed the finish line, Commendable had a length and a
half on Aptitude, who also ran second in the Kentucky Derby, and
Aptitude had a length on Unshaded, who had to be treated with ice
and cold water on the track because of heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   They ran an exceedingly slow race, too: the mile and a half in
2:31, which was seven seconds slower than Secretariat's record time
in 1973. Five years ago, Thunder Gulch won the Belmont in 2:32. But
you have to go back to 1970 to find a slower going than that: 2:34
by High Echelon. The longtime trainer Jimmy Jones, who should know,
has often said that time isn't important in a horse race; getting
there first is what counts. Maybe he had the Belmont in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after his latest coup, Lukas beamed and said:
``He's perfect. He didn't show a lot of stress from yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Commendable also didn't show a lot of speed or promise. But
then, as Lukas often says, you can only beat the other horses they
put on the track. And they did not include Fusaichi Pegasus or Red
Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all the snickering at the colts on stage, the 132nd
Belmont drew a crowd of 67,810, a record for a day that did not
feature a Triple Crown going on the line. Last year, the third
straight year when it did go on the line (and the third straight
time it missed), they counted a record crowd of 85,818.
</P>
<P>
   The record figured to be broken until Red Bullet and Fusaichi
Pegasus were withdrawn in the last three weeks. But few people
would hazard a guess: without the superstars, the crowd might be as
low as 40,000 or as high as 70,000, depending on the weather, the
Yankees-Mets game in the Bronx, or the loss of interest with the
Triple Crown factor gone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, on a sultry day with the Yankees-Mets game sold out,
Belmont Park hit the jackpot, the 67,810 spectators helping to set
an all-sources betting handle of $54 million.
</P>
<P>
   How come?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were coming off a three-year run when Triple Crown
opportunities provided significant appeal,'' said Terry Meyocks,
president of the New York Racing Association. ``That momentum,
coupled with an outstanding lineup of quality racing, helped to
provide a successful day for NYRA and the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum, no doubt. Quality racing, no way, at least not in the
Belmont. Now, they had better keep the momentum going until the
quality racing returns. &QL;

GENETICALLY ALTERED FOOD CAN'T COMPETE WITH GENETICALLY ALTERED
TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't worry a lot about genetically altered foods and I'll
tell you why.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're talking about radishes or rainbow trout, I don't
eat anything that is still alive. And if the genes have already
expired by the time you serve them for dinner, it's a dead issue.
</P>
<P>
   It's the live genes you have to be concerned about. And that
provokes another question.
</P>
<P>
   Who robbed the human gene bank of common sense? Well, ``human''
may be the wrong word because I'm really referring to teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody or some thing has drastically altered teenage genes
since I used up my quota.
</P>
<P>
   In those days we were genetically engineered to keep our pants
on in public. If the pants were too long, our mothers shortened
them. If our Levi's had holes in the knees, our mothers patched
them.
</P>
<P>
   These days, teenage boys shove their trousers down below their
hip pads. Their pants cuffs scrape along the sidewalk, their bony
knees project from designer holes in the legs and as a consequence
young Americans are at a distinct disadvantage if they are trying
to run in the Olympics or flee from muggers.
</P>
<P>
   Human genes did not equip us with Foster Grants in place of
eyeballs. So if we were playing in a sandlot baseball game we wore
baseball caps, and we pulled the bills down low so we wouldn't be
blinded by the sun.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence of the aforementioned gene alteration,
teenagers today think they've got eyes in their rear ends. They
wear their baseball caps reversed. When the sun is glaring they
can't see where they're going. In fact they are walking backward
through life. And they shouldn't be surprised if fate drills them
with a fastball in the middle of the back.
</P>
<P>
   Sagging pants are a humiliation. Backward baseball caps are an
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a far greater menace to the future of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Although their numbers are still low, more and more teenagers
are choosing to have their lips and tongues pierced with sharp
metal objects.
</P>
<P>
   How are you going to put away a meal of spare ribs and
corn-on-the-cob with a pin in your tongue or a hoop through the
lips?
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, these genetically damaged teens are only able to gum
down Gerbers pureed vegetables and must eat beef steak through a
straw.
</P>
<P>
   Their muscles will atrophy, their pants will fall off but they
won't even notice because the sun will be shining in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that just means there will be more enchiladas or
cheeseburger pie for the rest of us to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Cheeseburger Pie
</P>
<P>
   1 9-inch deep dish frozen pie shell
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lean ground beef
</P>
<P>
   \ cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   { cup sliced fresh mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 small (5-ounce) can evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced jalapeno peppers (optional)
</P>
<P>
   You can make your own pie crust if you wish. That's what our
mothers did. But if your genes have been altered you probably
won't, in which case you should let that frozen crust sit at room
temperature for 10 minutes. Then prick the bottom and sides with a
fork, and bake in a preheated, 400-degree oven for five minutes.
Remove crust and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   In a skillet brown the meat and onion. Pour off any fat. Add to
the pan the salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder and if you
want to make things more interesting toss in two teaspoons of
jalapeno peppers, or more if your internal thermometer can handle
it.
</P>
<P>
   When the meat mixture has cooled, spoon it into the crust.
Distribute the mushroom slices over the top. Scatter with the
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Beat together the eggs and milk and pour this sludge over the
pie.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the pie in a 400-degree oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to
350 degrees and cook another 20 to 25 minutes. The last 10 minutes
you may want to cover the crust with strips of foil.
</P>
<P>
   Let the pie stand 10 minutes before carving. This will serve
four.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical Enchiladas
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 can (three ounces) diced green chilies
</P>
<P>
   1 cup white sauce (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   2{ cups cooked chicken, diced
</P>
<P>
   6 large flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups grated jack cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 avocados, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Most enchiladas ooze gloop from every corner. These are
genetically engineered to produce a non-gloopy version.
</P>
<P>
   In a skillet saute the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the
onion softens. Stir in the chopped chilies, the white sauce and the
chicken. Stir once or twice.
</P>
<P>
   Lay out the tortillas and divide the chicken filling down the
center of each. Top each tortilla with 2 tablespoons of jack
cheese. Roll the tortillas up and place in a lightly oiled oven
dish, seam side down.
</P>
<P>
   Shove the dish into a 350-degree oven for 25 minutes. Remove,
serve and let each diner top the tortillas as they choose with
avocado slices and sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   White Sauce: Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan.
Stir in 2 tablespoons of flour. Cook for a minute then add a cup of
milk in a slow dribble, stirring. Keep stirring over medium heat
until the sauce thickens. Add a pinch of salt and a sprinkle of
nutmeg.

DEADLINE BEARING DOWN ON PROSECUTORS IN AUCTION HOUSE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing an important deadline next month, Justice
Department prosecutors are redoubling their efforts to prove that
Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's most powerful auction houses,
hatched a scheme to fix the prices they charged buyers and sellers
and that the collusion began as early as 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors are racing to beat a July 18 deadline, set by
the court hearing civil suits in the case, that could expose the
best kept secrets of their long antitrust investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the prosecutors have made calls to more than a
dozen present and former auction house employees, said potential
witnesses and lawyers, asking them for voluntary interviews and
testimony before a grand jury. They have been striving to back up
claims of collusion as far back as 1991 made late last year by
Christie's former chief executive, Christopher M. Davidge, in
particular over commissions charged to buyers.
</P>
<P>
   While the prosecutors are said to feel they have a good case
that the two houses conspired to fix sellers' commissions in 1995,
evidence of earlier collusion directed at buyers' fees is largely
confined to Davidge's allegations, backed up by documents he has
provided that in some instances are not dated.
</P>
<P>
   What prosecutors are most eager to keep secret, lawyers said, is
what exactly is spelled out in a dozen documents that Davidge, who
abruptly resigned on Christmas Eve, turned over to Christie's
lawyers. The lawyers then gave them to the government in exchange
for a conditional amnesty from prosecution for Christie's, a
tradeoff that sent the lagging federal investigation into high
gear.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12 the government's chief antitrust prosecutor in New
York, John J. Greene, argued in favor of keeping the documents out
of the hands of lawyers suing Sotheby's and Christie's to maintain
the secrecy of its grand jury investigation _ now almost three
years old _ through at least August. But Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of
U.S. District Court in Manhattan, who is hearing a civil class
action lawsuit by auction house customers who claim they were
cheated by collusive practices, voiced impatience with the
government's pace. The following week, he ordered Davidge's
documents to be made available starting on July 18 to the lawyers,
who are suing on behalf of dozens if not hundreds of complainants.
The judge could, however, still modify his order and delay the
document turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the 60 or more law firms handling the plaintiffs' suits
is the firm of David Boies, who is fresh from his victory as the
government's special counsel in the lawsuit to break up Microsoft.
The firm, Boies, Schiller &AMP; Flexner, of Armonk, N.Y., was named
lead counsel by Judge Kaplan on May 26 through an unusual bidding
process he devised. The process was intended to determine which
lawyers would offer plaintiffs the greatest share of a settlement
by holding down legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the criminal penalties, if the Justice Department is
successful in establishing that the price-fixing dates back nine
years, civil awards could cripple both companies, lawyers
representing various parties in the tangled case agreed. One lawyer
suing the auction houses said that the damages could run well into
the hundreds of millions of dollars, which, when tripled under
provisions in such cases, could mean combined losses to Sotheby's
and Christie's of close to $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Several people close to the case, who spoke on condition of
anonymity citing the continuing investigation, said that
prosecutors seem specifically focused on gathering facts regarding
1991 and 1992. Those were the years both companies made the
decision to change the fees they charge buyers from a flat rate of
10 percent of the purchase price to 15 percent of the first $50,000
and 10 percent of the rest. Sotheby's announced the change in
November 1992, and Christie's followed with an identical fee
structure a little over a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they did not collude on setting the fees originally,
they could be in violation of federal antitrust statutes if in
subsequent years they simply discussed maintaining the fee
structure, said an experienced antitrust lawyer. Lawyers and others
close to the case have said that the government has evidence that
Sotheby's and Christie's exchanged lists of important collectors
who were to be exempt from sellers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation say the Justice Department has
also asked witnesses about whether other topics came up in
conversations between Davidge and Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief
executive, who resigned on Feb. 21. These include whether they
worked out a policy not to poach each other's staffs and whether
they had spoken about how to negotiate with the French government
about opening the Paris auction business to non-French companies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for queries about these matters are unclear,
although experienced antitrust lawyers said that in some
circumstances ``no poaching'' agreements may have antitrust
implications and that in other antitrust cases conversations about
benign topics, akin to negotiating with the French over auction
laws, have turned to questionable issues that figured heavily in
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to examining Rolodexes, diaries and telephone logs,
prosecutors have asked auction house employees _ including present
and former art and antiques experts and a former in-house lawyer _
about what they may know of any discussions between the two houses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether the government is trying to run down additional leads in
an already strong case or buttress a weak one is not clear, said
lawyers representing parties in the civil and antitrust actions.
The government already believes it has substantial proof that the
people who were then chief executives and chairmen of the two
companies _ Brooks and A. Alfred Taubman at Sotheby's, and Davidge
and Anthony Tennant at Christie's _ conspired to raise sellers'
fees in 1995, people close to the investigation say.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers involved in the case believe the prosecution has not
been able to establish a case that four years earlier Sotheby's and
Christie's executives also agreed to fix the prices they charged
buyers. The allegations of early collusion are potentially far more
costly to both companies because, if substantiated, they would open
a new class of plaintiffs that is far larger than the number of
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents from Davidge that Christie's law firm,
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, provided to federal
prosecutors in December are memorandums Davidge wrote to Tennant,
lawyers involved in the case said. They said the memorandums
detailed the progress of meetings he had with Brooks to set the new
commission fees.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the documents but who spoke only on
condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation,
said that the documents contain references to collusion over the
buyers' fees in the 1991-92 period. But some of the documents are
not dated, people familiar with them said. As a result, the
government has been seeking confirming testimony from other

   Davidge said that it was Tennant, chairman of Christie's from
1993 to '96, who asked him to meet with Brooks, his counterpart at
Sotheby's, to agree on fixing its buyers' and sellers' charges,
people familiar with his allegations say. A person close to Brooks
said she has let prosecutors know that under certain conditions of
immunity from prosecution, she would be prepared to testify that
Sotheby's chairman, Taubman (who resigned as chairman the same day
she did as chief executive), had asked her to meet with Davidge
over sellers' fees. But the person close to Brooks was unable to
confirm any talks involving buyers' fees starting in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks kept no records of the secret meetings she had with
Davidge, people familiar with the case say.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Brooks said that prosecutors were pressing her
for admissions that carried grave penalties, including possible
prison time.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the investigation lawyers close to
Sotheby's have said while Taubman did meet with Tennant in the
early to mid-1990's, the conversations were innocent and had
nothing to do with a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the chief prosecutor in the case, said he would not
comment on the investigation in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew J. Levander, a Manhattan lawyer who has been hired by
Sotheby's to represent some of its employees who are being
contacted by the government, declined to comment on whether he was
involved in the case.

LEMON DROP KID RALLIES TO WIN BROOKLYN HANDICAP 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ After 38 starts at 20 tracks in six countries and
three races in the last three weeks, Running Stag probably had to
stop running sometime. And he did stop Sunday when Lemon Drop Kid
rallied to win the 112th Brooklyn Handicap by seven and a quarter
lengths in the heat of Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, who won the Belmont Stakes and the Travers last
year and ran third last month in the Pimlico Special, changed his
pattern by contesting the lead from the start. After three-quarters
of a mile, he was second to Running Stag, the favorite, and then
took the lead in the homestretch and extended it while Running Stag
faded to sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   It took a crowded photo to separate the next five horses: Lager
by a head for second place, Down the Aisle by a head for third,
Almutawakel by a neck for fourth and Ghost Story by a head for
fifth over Running Stag.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, owned by Jeanne Vance and trained by Scotty
Schulhofer, ran the mile and an eighth under Edgar Prado in 1:49
4/5, returned $6.20 for a $2 bet to win and earned $150,000,
boosting his career winnings past $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around the track for a long time,'' Schulhofer said,
``and this is the first time in my life that tears came to my eyes
when he crossed the finish line because he means so much to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Mitchell, who trains Running Stag, said: ``The heat and
not a fast enough early pace both worked against him. He's had
three races close together, but that's the route we were given.'' &QL;

MICROSOFT SPENDING MILLIONS ON BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOBBYING EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
 (With MICROSOFT-COMPETE) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft is mobilizing a pervasive lobbying and
public relations campaign in an effort to temper the impact of a
potentially devastating federal court ruling and generate positive
public and political opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The company is spending millions of dollars to retain former
lawmakers and top political figures, fill the coffers of both major
political parties and mold public opinion in its favor through
sympathetic research organizations and ostensibly independent trade
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has contributed to established research groups with
free-market orientations, including the National Taxpayers Union,
Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute, which have
produced studies and newspaper opinion pieces supportive of the
company's legal position. But Microsoft has also created new trade
groups, the Association for Competitive Technology and Americans
for Technology Leadership, to generate support for the company
through Web sites and a sophisticated and largely hidden
grass-roots lobbying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As the company's legal woes have mounted, Microsoft has
responded not just with a lobbying blitz in Washington, but in a
nationwide, seven-day-a-week program of mass-media advertising,
letter writing, petition drives and seemingly random
``interceptions'' of elected officials at public events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everywhere, and it's huge,'' said Ed Black, president of
the Computer and Communication Industry Association, a group
financed largely by Microsoft's critics.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's legal and commercial opponents have an aggressive
and well-financed lobbying effort as well. They have hired
prominent advocates like Robert H. Bork, the former federal judge,
and top Washington lobbyists and public relations firms to advance
the case against Microsoft. These Microsoft critics, led by Sun
Microsystems, Oracle, IBM, America Online and Novell, also are
major financial sponsors of several computer industry trade groups
that produce a steady stream of anti-Microsoft propaganda. Their
reported lobbying expenses last year were more than $11 million,
compared with $4.6 million in spending by Microsoft, according to
Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Goliath vs. Goliath,'' said Rick Miller, a Microsoft
spokesman. ``It's mutual assured destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order last
week that Microsoft be sundered into two companies, the stakes are
vastly higher for Microsoft than for its competitors, who got
everything they asked for from the court.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the company is mounting an all-out campaign to
generate public and political sympathy while denying that it is
seeking a solution to its legal woes in Congress or in the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Microsoft had been slow to realize that it needed to
engage in Washington lobbying and other public relations efforts,
but that it had changed course after realizing commercial rivals
were successfully portraying the company as a bully. He added that
Microsoft now encouraged politicians to support its legal position
through campaign contributions, trips to Microsoft headquarters in
Redmond, Wash., briefings and other means. But he was quick to say
that the company had little hope that Congress would act on its
behalf or that the next president would quickly reverse the
government's course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is fully intent on mobilizing our assets and our
friends to tell our story,'' Miller said. ``But do we see a
legislative or political remedy to the current situation? We really
don't. We feel we have a good case on appeal and we're very much
focused on fighting the battle in the courts and not in the
political arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the company is pouring millions of dollars into
both political parties, giving more to parties and candidates in
the last 17 months ($2.2 million) than it did in the previous five
years ($1.8 million). The company has donated $500,000 to each
party's summer convention and is expected to provide a similar
amount in free software and computer services. In a sign that the
company might be more concerned with the next administration than
with the current one, Microsoft officials attended a huge
fund-raiser for Gov. George W. Bush in Washington in April and paid
$30,000 for a table at a GOP congressional fund-raising dinner in
May, but the company was not represented at the $26 million tribute
to President Clinton last month.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which made virtually no political donations six years
ago, is now the nation's third-biggest corporate contributor,
behind only AT&AMP;T and Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   A former Microsoft public relations consultant said that the
company was slow to recognize the value of making friends in
Washington and mistakenly believed that it would be judged solely
on its products, not its conduct. The company also underestimated
the resolve and the wealth of its competitors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was there, they thought all they had to do was
entertain people in Washington, not engage them,'' this consultant
said, speaking anonymously because he is now in a senior government
post. ``They resented people from Sun and Netscape who lobbied
Congress and complained to the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   As it has pursued an unrepentant line in the courtroom,
Microsoft has mounted a broad but largely invisible national
campaign to produce public sympathy and political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   An internal report of Microsoft's grass-roots activities for a
single week in March revealed that company generated letters to
newspapers complaining about the antitrust case, lobbied a member
of the Ohio legislature, contacted a researcher about producing a
sympathetic study on the effects of the federal case and met with
an engineer from Intel about recruiting people to advocate
Microsoft's position. In addition, unnamed advocates of Microsoft's
legal position engineered seemingly chance meetings with Bush and
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., at a Republican fund-raiser in DuPage
County, Ill. These interceptions took place on March 18 and were
duly reported to top officials in Microsoft's legal affairs office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's grass-roots efforts are directed by a Republican
consulting firm, Feather, Hodges, Larson &AMP; Synhorst. The firm
counts among its other clients the Bush presidential campaign,
which has paid it $2.2 million for polling and telemarketing since
last October. Tony Feather is Bush's political director; Tom
Synhorst, who handles the Microsoft account for the firm, did not
return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has hired a flotilla of lobbyists of both parties,
including Haley Barbour, former chairman of the Republican party
and a senior adviser to Bush, and former Democratic Rep. Tom Downey
of New York, a close friend and adviser of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft has retained several influential Democrats,
including Craig Smith, the former White House political director
and onetime manager of the Gore campaign, the company seems to be
betting heavily on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer, is a top
fund-raiser for the Texas governor and an adviser on technology
policy. Two former Republican members of Congress, Vin Weber and
Bill Paxson, are both Microsoft lobbyists and Bush advisers.
Microsoft earlier this year hired Ralph Reed, a top Bush adviser,
to lobby Bush on behalf of the company. Reed quickly ended the
relationship with Microsoft when it became public.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed sympathy for the company's legal plight during a
campaign appearance in Washington state last February, saying he
was ``worried'' about the consequences of a breakup of the company.
Echoing a refrain from the company, Bush said he stood on the side
of ``innovation, not litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, Bush has declined comment on the case
because it remains before the courts. Scott McClellan, a Bush
spokesman, said, ``As president, he will enforce our antitrust laws
to protect consumers and foster competition and innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, has expressed support for the government's
position in the lawsuit. In a visit to Microsoft headquarters last
November, Gore warned against ``the unfair use of market dominance
in one sector to stifle innovation in another sector.''
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft is reviled in some precincts in Washington and
among its Silicon Valley competitors, it remains quite well
regarded by the public. A Gallup poll taken in early May showed
that 65 percent of the public had a favorable view of the company.
The figure among computer users was even higher, 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Microsoft wins in the court of public opinion, helps
elect a sympathetic president and persuades a majority of Congress
of the virtue of its market dominance, it still faces two critical
obstacles: the federal judiciary and 19 hard-nosed state attorneys
general.
</P>
<P>
   No one can predict the company's destiny before the courts. But
the attorneys general are not likely to abandon their pursuit of
the software colossus.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' said Tom Miller, the Iowa attorney general, who
has been the most outspoken of Microsoft's critics. ``If for some
reason a new administration would want to produce a remedy that
Microsoft can work around and continue to do what they have been
doing, the 19 states would be resolute and say no. We would be even
more determined than we are today, if that is possible.''

PURSUING MICROSOFT: U.S. ACTIVELY CONSULTED COMPANY'S RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING for all needing)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, has no doubts about who
is responsible for his company's antitrust woes. During a news
conference last Wednesday, hours after a federal judge ordered that
Microsoft be split in two, Gates spoke pointedly of the
``competitors that have been behind this lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   What part did Microsoft's rivals play? The competitors, to be
sure, played a crucial role throughout the investigation,
litigation and sanctions phase of the suit by the Justice
Department and 19 states. It was, in fact, a 222-page white paper
written in the summer of 1996 by lawyers for Netscape
Communications, Microsoft's main rival in the market for Internet
browsing software, that caught the attention of Joel I. Klein, head
of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and prompted him to
order an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, a procession of competitors _ representing
Netscape, Sun Microsystems, America Online and others _ testified
against Microsoft. And in the months and weeks before the
government presented its proposal in April to break up Microsoft,
industry executives _ some rivals of Microsoft and some not _ were
shown or read individual sentences and paragraphs in drafts of the
remedies plan by government lawyers, who then asked if the
provisions seemed sensible.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the antitrust case, including the extent of
consultation with industry rivals, was extraordinary, government
officials acknowledge. But the methods employed were not: Despite
all the information and interpretation given to the government from
other companies, industry executives and government lawyers say the
Justice Department kept its own counsel as it sifted evidence and
built its case.
</P>
<P>
   The government charged, and the court found, that Microsoft is a
monopoly that has thwarted competition and innovation. Some of the
evidence came from competitors, but much of it came from
Microsoft's e-mail and internal documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry's role in a case like this is as a resource _ a
source of ideas, comments, facts and analysis,'' said David Boies,
the Justice Department's chief trial lawyer. ``But the government
brought the Microsoft case because the evidence was there. And the
most powerful documents were ones created by Microsoft itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to bring and win the Microsoft suit, the government had to
build a relationship of cooperation and trust with the industry.
When the investigation started in 1996, there was skepticism in
Silicon Valley _ home to many of Microsoft's rivals _ about the
wisdom of working with the government.
</P>
<P>
   A consent decree with Microsoft that the Justice Department
signed in 1994, and that a court approved a year later, had mainly
focused on a modest change in Microsoft's licensing practices. In
Silicon Valley, the consent decree was regarded as a slap on the
wrist that did nothing to loosen Microsoft's control of computing.
So, many companies were reluctant to cooperate with the government
and risk angering Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   To meet with the Justice Department, some industry executives
insisted on strict conditions to ensure anonymity. Late in 1997,
the chief executive of a Silicon Valley company agreed to meet only
at a hotel suite in Washington _ not at the Justice Department's
offices _ and only with a promise that any notes of the meeting
could not mention him or his company, recalled Daniel Rubinfeld,
former chief economist in the department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive did eventually agree to send a senior member
of his management team to testify in the Microsoft trial, which
began in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that kind of visible industry support _ sending
witnesses to testify in a high-profile, high-pressure trial _ was
needed to present a convincing case in court. And Justice
Department officials stressed that point in meetings with industry
executives. ``They did say repeatedly that if you don't stand up
and take this on, neither will we,'' recalled William J. Raduchel,
a former senior executive at Sun Microsystems who is now chief
technology officer of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Yet throughout the case, the government and Microsoft's
competitors had a delicate, often wary relationship, according to
both prosecutors and industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. The Justice Department's antitrust division
receives a steady stream of complaints from companies about their
rivals. Much of this proves untrue or exaggerated upon
investigation, prosecutors note. And the government's policy is not
to inform anyone in advance about whether it will take action.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry executives who cooperated in the prosecution
described dealing with the Justice Department as ``speaking through
a one-way mirror.'' The government officials asked questions, and
they answered. That approach, apparently, remained consistent _
from the initial investigation, right through to consulting on the
proposed remedies.
</P>
<P>
   One executive recalled being asked to comment on the
government's sanctions plan. ``It was, `Does this sentence make
sense to you?' or `If the following rule were in place, do you
think PC makers would choose operating systems other than
Microsoft's Windows?''' the executive said. ``But you never quite
know what they're up to. I had no idea they were going to propose
breaking Microsoft in two.''
</P>
<P>
   Raduchel, who spoke with Justice Department officials several
times in the last few years, remarked: ``I really believe that you
can't lobby them. But what you can do is educate them. They
gradually came to realize that seemingly arcane details of software
really do matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The education process did take time. It took the government
investigators a while to appreciate the legal significance of a
meeting in June 1995 between Microsoft and Netscape executives, for
example, even though the Justice Department received a detailed
account of the meeting two days after it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The account came in a letter to the department from Gary L.
Reback, a lawyer representing Netscape, who described how Microsoft
had used access to its industry-standard Windows operating-system
technology to threaten Netscape. He also attached notes of the
meeting taken by Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, which
strongly suggested that Microsoft had made an offer to Netscape to
divide the market for Internet browsing software _ an offer that,
if proved, was a violation of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That June 1995 episode eventually became an accusation in the
government's suit against Microsoft, one that Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson accepted as a fact and ruled to be illegal. Yet at the
time, word of the meeting did not set off alarm bells in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that back then, the Internet was just
starting to take off,'' said Roberta Katz, the former general
counsel of Netscape, ``and people other than techies did not
understand the Internet or software. The troops at Justice,
understandably, had a lot of learning to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Netscape certainly helped. ``My whole approach,'' Katz said,
``was to get to the point where they really understood what was
going on. After that, if the government did anything or not was
obviously up to them. And they totally held their cards closely.
There was never a time when the Justice Department let us know what
they were going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape white paper in August 1996 helped get things
started. Despite its dull title, ``White Paper Regarding the Recent
Anticompetitive Conduct of the Microsoft Corp.,'' the paper often
reads more like a book than a legal document. Indeed, its 222 pages
are formatted and laid out like a book, with attractive typefaces
and chapters with headlines like ``A Fork in the Road'' and
``Microsoft's Fear: The Threat to Its Desktop Monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape white paper was never made public, but it was
passed to some industry executives and state attorneys general, in
addition to the Justice Department. An industry executive allowed a
reporter for The New York Times to read parts of the document. It
was written mainly by Reback and Susan Creighton, then both lawyers
at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif., with
contributions from Garth Saloner, an economist at the Stanford
University business school.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape document includes a litany of accusations against
Microsoft. These were backed up with e-mail messages that Netscape
had received, from personal computer makers and others, about
Microsoft's actions.
</P>
<P>
   But the one assertion that really interested Klein, the Justice
Department's antitrust chief, was that in June 1996 Microsoft had
threatened to cancel Compaq Computer's license to use Windows
unless Compaq stopped featuring Netscape's browser over
Microsoft's. To Klein, this seemed to be evidence of Microsoft's
selling its Windows operating system to PC makers on the condition
that the manufacturers also take Microsoft's browser. To him, the
threat violated the 1994 consent decree and raised broader
antitrust issues about Microsoft's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has argued that its browsing software should be
considered part of Windows _ one product, not two, and thus not an
antitrust violation. In June 1998, a federal appeals court agreed
with Microsoft in a related case. But after reviewing the evidence,
Jackson ruled that Microsoft had illegally tied two products.
</P>
<P>
   The government pursued some accusations in the Netscape white
paper and set others aside. Over all, though, the legal and
economic theory in the Netscape document is remarkably similar to
the themes laid out in the government's suit two years later. The
core of the case the Justice Department lawyers presented at trial
was that Microsoft had illegally maintained its monopoly by
engaging in a broad pattern of practices intended to stifle the
competition posed by Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, at bottom, a very simple case,'' the Netscape white
paper stated. ``It is about a monopolist (Microsoft) that has
maintained its monopoly for more than 10 years. That monopoly is
threatened by the introduction of a new technology (Web software)
that is a partial substitute _ and, in time _ could become a
complete substitute for the monopoly product.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape white paper also pointed toward a broader
public-policy issue surrounding Microsoft. Personal computers were
the way people get onto the Internet and thus, the paper asserted,
Microsoft's industry-dominant Windows operating system could give
the company a gatekeeper's control of the flow of information and
electronic commerce in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to believe,'' the Netscape document warned,
``that Microsoft's monopoly power will be confined to a single
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   That broader message resonated beyond the software industry, and
eventually led executives in other industries to raise concerns
about Microsoft with the government. Andrew Steinberg, who was then
general counsel of Sabre, the computerized airline reservations
system, recalled traveling through Silicon Valley early in 1997.
Sabre had recently begun a travel Web site, Travelocity, and
Microsoft had a competing site, Expedia. Steinberg was told of the
Netscape white paper, and he obtained a copy from Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the document had a ``profound effect'' on him, recalled
Steinberg, who is now an executive vice president of Travelocity.
``It struck me that this was a serious threat to competition over
the Internet and the future prospects of our company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry executives had similar worries about Microsoft's
power and its potential use of that power. Executives from many
companies expressed those concerns in meetings with the Justice
Department _ including those from Time Warner, Disney, Sabre,
General Motors and Palm, according to people who attended or knew
of those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Further white papers were produced. Netscape updated its
original document, and then provided still another with a more
detailed focus on e-commerce and media over the Internet, ``Access
Denied: Microsoft's Strategy for Overriding Consumer Choice.'' The
other companies that sent white papers to the government included
Apple Computer, Sabre and the makers of speech-recognition
software, according to people familiar with those documents.
</P>
<P>
   The suit the government brought against Microsoft was based on
accusations about what Microsoft had done, rather than what it
might do. But the government has said it took action partly to
protect innovation in the future and to keep the Internet open to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the browser as the gateway to the Internet was
significant to bringing this case,'' said Boies, who presented the
case against Microsoft in court for the Justice Department. ``It's
what made this case important.''

BEST 3-YEAR-OLD WILL NOT BE DECIDED UNTIL LATE SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week D. Wayne Lukas sat down with a legal pad,
made columns for his competition in the Belmont Stakes and listed
the pros and cons of each horse winning the third leg of the Triple
Crown. The upside of Hugh Hefner, for example, was that the colt
was the lone speed in the race. The downside: He could not carry it
a mile and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite Aptitude? He would be too far back and have too
much to do. When the columns were toted, Lukas believed his colt
Commendable had a shot of winning for a sole reason. ``He could run
his natural race with his tactical speed and have a say in the
outcome,'' Lukas said Sunday. ``Everyone else had to change their
running styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Both scouting reports turned out to be true. Commendable tracked
the front-running Hugh Hefner to the mile mark, scooted past him on
the final turn. Aptitude, meanwhile, was in 10th place and indeed
too far back to run down Pat Day and Commendable in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Triple Crown is completed with three different
horses owning a piece of it, Lukas, as well as horse racing
enthusiasts, might as well get out that legal pad again. About the
only thing the spring classics proved this time around was that the
3-year-old champion would not be decided until late summer or next
season.
</P>
<P>
   As spectacular as Fusaichi Pegasus looked in the Kentucky Derby,
he looked just as ordinary losing to Red Bullet in the Preakness.
As professional as Red Bullet looked in the Preakness, he looked
merely competent finishing second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood.
Only because both horses were withheld from the Derby was
Commendable _ a horse that had sandwiched a fifth-place, four
fourth places and a 17th place between his maiden victory and the
Belmont score _ can have a claim (at least on paper) to being the
best in his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Now what? The trainer of Red Bullet, Joe Orseno, tossed off a
challenge to his competitors Sunday. He said his colt, a victor in
four of five starts, was headed to the Grade II Dwyer at Belmont on
July 9, the Grade I Haskell at Monmouth on Aug. 6 and on to the
summer showcase for 3-year-olds, the Grade I Travers, on Aug. 26 at
Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we're going to be if they want to come,'' Orseno
said.
</P>
<P>
   One horse that Orseno and Red Bullet will hook amid that
campaign is More Than Ready _ the Blue Grass runner-up whose
fourth-place Kentucky Derby finish was remarkable in light of the
blistering pace he helped press. The trainer Todd Pletcher says he
will use the mile-and-a-sixteenth Dwyer as a prep for the
mile-and-an-eighth Haskell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his speed is suited to that distance,'' said Pletcher,
who will wait and see how More Than Ready performs before deciding
on the mile-and-a-quarter Travers.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas says Commendable also is a likely starter in the Haskell.
Somewhere in that trio of races Red Bullet could also see the Peter
Pan winner Postponed and the Belmont's third-place finisher
Unshaded. Unshaded's trainer, Carl Nafzger, believes his late
blooming gelding is suited for the Travers and will decide between
the Haskell and the Jim Dandy, which is run on the same weekend at
Saratoga. His owner, James Tafel, anted up $100,000 supplemental
fee to get in the Belmont only to watch Unshaded's big move in the
final turn to be sapped by mild heat exhaustion. The gelding
wobbled past the finish line and was immediately treated with water
and ice. He was fine Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Travers is the race I've wanted since before the Kentucky
Derby,'' Nafzger said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is just as muddled out west, where Fusaichi
Pegasus, the Santa Anita Derby winner The Deputy, and Lukas' top
horse and the Blue Grass winner High Yield are based.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas says High Yield is likely to start in the Swaps on July 23
at Hollywood Park. The Deputy and War Chant _ trained by Neil
Drysdale _ are also probable starters in the Swaps. The trainer
Bobby Frankel says Aptitude, the Derby and Belmont runner up, will
stay in New York until he decides where to run him.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Drysdale has not decided where his big horse,
Fusaichi Pegasus, will run next. The Derby winner was scratched
from the Belmont last week after sustaining a minor cut in an
accident in his stall.
</P>
<P>
   The colt's trainer and owner, Fusao Sekiguchi, will meet this
week in Los Angeles and map out a campaign aimed at winning the $4
million Breeders' Cup Classic on the first weekend in November at
Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale will not say for certain, but he may skip the
3-year-old skirmishes of the summer and wait until the fall to prep
against older horses _ perhaps in the Woodward, a $500,000 race on
Sept. 16 and the $1 million The Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 14.
Both are Grade I races at Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature, but if Sekiguchi is thinking about the Dubai
World Cup next spring,'' Drysdale, by phone from California, said
Sunday of the $5 million race, ``we'll probably not race in the
summer. It would be too much on the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, the Lukas-trained Charismatic had
captured the Derby, the Preakness and finished third at the Belmont
despite injuring a foreleg in the far turn. The colt was surgically
repaired, retired and eventually named 3-year-old champion. The
Hall of Fame trainer whose third-string colt gave him his 13th
Triple Crown victory concedes this year that the spring classics
are a wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is decided,'' he said. ``In the second season or
summer season, we're all going to have to face each other and sort
it out.'' &QL;

DEPUTY SECURITY ADVISER EXCHANGES WHITE HOUSE FOR BIG APPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He works out of a cubicle not much bigger than a
prison cell, but his ambit is the world.
</P>
<P>
   James Steinberg, the White House's deputy national security
adviser, is less visible than his boss, Sandy Berger, who works in
a sunlit corner office a few steps away in the West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg seldom appears on television, gives few on-the-record
briefings and tends to remain in the background at public
appearances of the president.
</P>
<P>
   But his influence has been widely felt in the administration
through his role as chairman of the committee of deputies of the
government's national security agencies. And Steinberg has often
colored press coverage of administration foreign policy by offering
burnished versions of events to a few favored reporters. Some dare
call it spin.
</P>
<P>
   In Steinberg's eyes, President Clinton's meetings with foreign
leaders are never tense, they are ``businesslike.'' Interagency
discussions are never argumentative, they are ``lively.'' One of
his standing orders to staff members is that they never put
anything sensitive on paper; paper trails lead to subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, Steinberg gives the impression of being a
friendly, relaxed sort, but associates know, and occasionally fear,
his intensity. His temper has scared away potential colleagues from
other agencies and shortened the tenures of several assistants.
</P>
<P>
   He is so single-minded that when a reporter once phoned his
office seeking comment on Bosnia, he called back _ from his
honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday was as close to a typical day as there is for
someone at the vortex of U.S. foreign policy. At 7 a.m., Steinberg
met with the heads of the State Department, Department of Defense,
Department of Justice, the FBI and the CIA. The subject was a
sensitive international law enforcement matter about which
Steinberg would say no more.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m., Steinberg briefed the president for a telephone call
that Clinton was to make to Vladimir Putin, the Russian president,
a few minutes later. At 8:30 a.m., Steinberg attended the senior
staff meeting chaired by Steve Ricchetti, the deputy White House
chief of staff, to discuss financing for antidrug efforts in
Colombia and the Pentagon budget, among other matters. That was
followed by a conference call with officials at the State
Department to talk about a British peacekeeping mission to Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg then briefed Clinton for his meeting with President
Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico in the Oval Office at 12:45 p.m. After
that, the Middle East, reparations for Holocaust survivors, the
Northern Ireland peace process, the war between Ethiopia and
Eritrea, the Congo, preparations for the Group of 8 industrialized
nations.
</P>
<P>
   It is a heady life for someone who started in the Clinton
administration in 1993 as a deputy assistant secretary of state in
the relatively obscure Bureau of Intelligence and Research. But
Steinberg had a mentor in Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
for whom he had worked in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher elevated him to the chief of policy planning, the
State Department's internal research center, a position Steinberg
described as ``the best foreign policy job anywhere.'' When the
national security adviser, Anthony Lake, left after Clinton's
re-election, Berger moved up and Steinberg moved into Berger's
deputy slot, a position held in the past by the likes of Colin
Powell, Alexander Haig, David Aaron and Robert McFarlane.
</P>
<P>
   But Steinberg, 47, is leaving all that behind. Later this
summer, he will join the Markle Foundation in New York to work on a
$100 million project to study the impact of the digital revolution
on international relations and economic development. Steinberg has
known the foundation's director, Zoe Baird, since the Carter
administration, in which they served as lawyers, she at the White
House, he at the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Baird was Clinton's first choice for attorney general, but
withdrew from consideration after it was disclosed that she had not
paid taxes for a baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Markle project addresses many of the issues that have
preoccupied Steinberg over the past seven years: the march of
technology, the globalization of markets, the ubiquity of the
Internet and the social and security concerns they raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you create a governance structure for what is basically
a private sector function?'' Steinberg asked. ``Government can't do
this. But how can private entities bring the benefits of the
networked society to developing countries?''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg cut his teeth in local politics in his native Boston
where he grew up as the son of a jeweler. He worked for Mayor Kevin
White of Boston in the 1970s and on the congressional campaigns of
the Rev. Robert Drinan. Steinberg has a law degree from Yale. He
worked on the staff of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., for the
1988 presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis, and for the Rand
Corp. Steinberg identified the Balkans and the evolution of
relations between the United States and China as the two areas that
have engaged him most deeply in the past seven years. He was one of
the architects of Clinton's decision in 1994 to sever the link
between human rights and trade with China. That policy remains a
sore point between Clinton and many Democrats in Congress, as well
as unions and human rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg defends the administration's record on Bosnia and on
Kosovo, but said that the unfinished business of the Balkans
remains his biggest regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have a stable southeastern Europe,'' he said, ``until
the problem of Serbia is resolved.''

AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN CITIES PROMPTS $30 BILLION AID
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's expanding economy has produced an unintended
downside, rapidly increasing housing costs that are denying many
working-class wage earners an affordable place to live, especially
in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   The growing gap is a major finding of the Clinton
administration's fourth annual State of the Cities report, an
assessment of the nation's economic health that otherwise reflects
favorably on cities and suburbs that are now enjoying overall low
unemployment and high rates of home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But economic growth that administration officials say has led to
22 million new jobs in the last seven years has helped push up
housing costs beyond the reach of many workers. The report found
that the shortage of affordable houses and rental units is
particularly acute in cities like Denver and San Francisco, where
high-tech companies have led the boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become a victim of our own success,'' Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in an interview. ``We have a great
economy, and I hope it keeps going. But we also have to manage the
downside of good economic times.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo is scheduled to present the report Monday in Seattle at a
meeting of the National Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggests that the federal government can help close
the housing gap by providing more financial assistance in the form
of vouchers that could be applied toward rent and, for the first
time, mortgage costs.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the report more than points out a problem: It
also supports the administration's housing budget request for
fiscal year 2001, a $32.1 billion proposal that represents a 23
percent increase over last year and would be the largest housing
budget in two decades. Last week, the House Appropriations
Committee approved all but $2.5 billion of the administration's
request.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that the economic health of cities, in
general, has continued to improve in recent years, spurred by job
creation in high-tech industries that is three times the growth
rate for jobs in other industries. The combination has resulted in
a 4.7 percent population increase in the nation's 331 largest
metropolitan areas between 1990 and 1998, compared with an overall
decline of 3.1 percent from 1970 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   While that swing has infused cities with a new vitality through
ethnic and racial diversity, as the report states, it has helped
drive up housing costs at a rate far beyond inflation. In cities
like New York, Denver and San Francisco, competition for even small
apartment units has led to monthly rental costs of $2,000 and more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, job growth in cities and a growing disdain for long
commutes from the suburbs have led many people to seek housing
closer to their city jobs, only to find that prices in many
neighborhoods are increasing at annual rates of 20 percent and
more.
</P>
<P>
   The result, the report says, is a record number of ``worst case
needs,'' which represents families who pay more than half of their
income for housing or families who live in inadequate housing. In
1997, the last year for which statistics are available, the number
of these families reached 5.4 million, a 12 percent increase over
the same group of people in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make matters worse,'' the report states, ``the number of
affordable housing units is shrinking just when it needs to
expand.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that the challenge for the Clinton administration in
its final months would be to help moderate wage-earners gain access
to better housing while doing nothing that interrupts overall
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   What could make the efforts easier, he said, was what he
perceives as a new willingness by Republicans to seek answers to
the same problems. He recalled that four years ago Sen. Bob Dole,
the Republican challenger to President Clinton, favored eliminating
the Housing Department.
</P>
<P>
   But after Cuomo's address Monday to the mayors, a majority of
whom are Democrats, the Republican presidential candidate, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, plans to lay out his plans for housing and
economic development in a speech to the same group, addressing the
conference by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way in four years,'' Cuomo said. ``Four
years after Republicans wanted to get rid of us, Gov. Bush has a
competing plan. I'd say that was progress.''

SPORTS COLUMN: HACK-A-SHAQ'S FREE-THROW SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Forget Hack-a-Shaq. The Pacers' Jalen Rose may
have stumbled upon a real ratings gimmick when he suggested that
equally difficult to beat would be Shaq and four hacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the same team with you four guys standing out there,''
Rose told a small gathering of reporters the other day. ``As long
as they've got Shaq in the paint.''
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the hobbled Kobe Bryant, that would be
an excellent vantage point from which to cover the National
Basketball Association finals _ from the left wing, making the
entry pass to Shaquille O'Neal, before flipping open the laptop to
record his latest adventure at the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what they mean when they talk about the interactive
newspaper?
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years ago, on the eve of the finals, Moses Malone
claimed that he and four buddies from the playgrounds of
Petersburg, Va., could handle the Boston Celtics. Given the
opportunity with a supporting cast that wasn't much of an upgrade,
Malone and his Houston Rockets surrendered in six games. Larry
Bird, of course, was playing in that series, as opposed to coaching
the victory-starved Indiana Pacers in Game 3 Sunday night at
Conseco Fieldhouse, reduced to sending Rik Smits and other
unequipped and outclassed big men who are closing in on retirement
to cower in the presence of O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Before we go any further, I know what most Knicks fans were
thinking after watching Shaq win the first two games of the series
in Los Angeles, and my advice is, forget it. If you think the
Knicks' front line would have been a better match, consider that it
was physically obscured in the Eastern Conference finals by one
Dale Davis, who in Los Angeles looked like a kid riding Shaq
piggy-back.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Jeff Van Gundy's lovable louts would not have
been content to play Hack-a-Shaq either. It would have been more
whack, smack and thwack. Kurt Thomas in his face, Charlie Ward at
his knees. That's all the league would have needed in this playoff
season of the viewers' discontent, more tasteless posturing and a
few more technical fouls and more free throws for these teams to
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for the maturing Shaq, who used to get frustrated by
the hacking and would occasionally threaten retaliatory mayhem.
Throughout these playoffs, he has taken the tactical taunting for
what it is, the last desperate act before concession, and just
marched professionally to the line to do his best. He missed 21
free throws in Game 2 and but got better as the night wore on and
still scored 40. The game dragged like five sets in Paris but, as
Bird later drawled: ``Well, I don't worry about ratings. I'm trying
to win a ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not classic basketball, or television, but then, the
All-Star Game is a freewheeling dunkathon every year and it is
stultifying to the point of being unwatchable. These games are at
least the result of honest competition. If the Devils and the
Dallas Stars resort to conservative hockey to avoid making that one
killer mistake and take the final Stanley Cup games into the wee
hours, well, that's sport, in nonscripted splendor. If the NBA is
so concerned about stoppages of play and length of the game, maybe
it can pressure the network to take fewer commercial breaks, and
allow for some sense of continuity to be established in the game.
Or go the other way completely, and start awarding Shaq prize money
for every free throw he hits, adding to the pot as the game moves
along and the shots mean more.
</P>
<P>
   There's been talk that the league might tinker again with the
rules to further discourage the Hack-a-Shaq, but the sport begins
to look fake when it modifies its game to accommodate a particular
player. Make your free throws. End of story. For my money, there
are serious concessions being made by any coach who puts O'Neal at
the line, consistently hoping to trade one point for two. For one
thing, he is guaranteeing even more possessions for the Lakers. For
another, he is conceding even the possibility of a turnover, a
basket in transition, and allowing O'Neal and the Lakers to set up
their defense.
</P>
<P>
   As dominating a force as O'Neal was in Los Angeles on offense,
he also had a profound effect in the Lakers' success on defense.
Out of respect for _ and fear of _ O'Neal, the Pacers have
established almost no low-post offense, putting too much pressure
on their jump shooters. A perimeter shooting team that can't force
a double-team in the paint and make the defense rotate is a team
that can generally be counted on to shoot 40 percent (the Pacers
were at 39.5 after the first two games).
</P>
<P>
   Well, as someone once said _ Pat Riley or James Naismith _ no
playoff statement is really made until someone wins on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we have five men on the floor, we're OK,'' Ron
Harper said, presumably counting Shaq among them. &QL;

THE UNLIKELIST OF VEHICLES TAKES TO THE RACETRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: cq Dacotah in 3d graf)  
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANDAN, N.D. _ Perhaps it is the tedium of watching the grass
grow just to cut it down and watch it grow some more. Perhaps it's
just something about men and their motors. No one seems to know why
it is happening now. But all across America, men have discovered
new thrills at the throttle of the snail of gasoline-powered
locomotion, the riding lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   From Bergholz and Kiskatom, N.Y., to Lubbock and Buda, Texas,
from Troy, Ohio, and Stillwater, Okla., to Cut Bank, Mont.,
Damascus, Ore., and this brawny town across the Missouri River from
Bismarck, men and the rare woman are off to the races on souped-up,
decal-coated John Deeres, Snappers, Dynamarks and Murrays. Some as
stocky as their machines themselves, they whip around dirt tracks
at speeds routinely exceeding 30 miles an hour and sometimes 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to go over big time if somebody don't get
killed,'' said Larry Freisz, 61, a fan at the races around a
480-foot dirt track at the Dacotah Speedway here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two mowers over there?'' Freisz said. ``They're just
like mosquitoes. They're here and they're gone.'' The racing
inspires puns. ``The mow the merrier,'' the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing
Association advertises, in the ``mowdowns'' of the ``mowlennium.''
A group in Ohio calls itself the Dewberry Mudboggers, and one in
Alabama, the Dixie Outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mowers' blades are removed, somebody might indeed
get killed. Through their trade association, the Outdoor Power
Equipment Institute, in Alexandria, Va., the companies that produce
1.6 million riding lawn mowers a year will have nothing to do with
racing and have even adopted a resolution opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   Here, 40-year-old Richard Bohlman, operations director of a
medical center 200 miles away in Tioga, won the biggest event, with
eight men starting and four finishing the 20 laps. The instant
Bohlman crossed the line, his mower threw a rear wheel. The machine
flipped, pitching Bohlman, who weighs about 250 pounds, 15 feet in
the air. He seemed to hover there spread-eagled, then landed on his
side in the dirt. Ashen and aching, he walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Like stock car racing, a decades-old institution in many
suburban and rural communities, lawn mower racing is becoming a
regular sport. Local newspapers report the results. Local
businesses sponsor many of the racers. Races in Stillwater draw
thousands of fans; the one here drew 200. Evidently starting in the
late 1980s as a Fourth of July event on wide subdivision streets,
contenders are now organizing circuits, scheduling weekend races
town to town.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gienger, a machinist at an Ingersoll-Rand factory in
Bismarck, formed the North Dakota Lawn Mower Racing Association
only last year. He drew six drivers to its first race, in Mandan.
On Saturday 12 showed up for the first of six events scheduled
across the state so far this year. Thirty racers have signed up for
one on July 4 in Wildrose, N.D., population 193. Other circuits
have formed in Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington state
and upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn mower racing's biggest boost has come from Gold Eagle Co.
in Chicago, which makes a gasoline additive called Sta-bil. Eight
years ago, Gold Eagle executives formed the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing
Association to promote Sta-bil. The association now claims 500
member racers for whom it has organized more than 20 regional
events this year, the most ever, and a national championship in
Mendota, Ill., on Labor Day. Hundreds, perhaps thousands more
racers belong to groups, just a year or two old, unaffiliated with
the association.
</P>
<P>
   One secret of the racing's growth is its economics. To enter,
contestants pay a small fee, $15 or $25. There are no purses and
typically no betting. Bruce Kaufman, a public relations man and
president of the national association said, ``We race for trophies,
bragging rights and glory.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, the mowers are cheap, opening a vast new horizon
for the adrenalin-enriched and mechanically inclined. Racing mowers
cost a fraction of the $10,000 or $20,000 spent to buy and prepare
a stock car racer.
</P>
<P>
   Most are long-retired machines that racers rebuild to meet four
or five levels of classification, from stock racers that still cut
grass to ``factory experimental'' machines on which the platform
intended to cover a blade is strictly decorative.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Storick, a 35-year-old contract laborer, bought his mower
for $100. ``I cut my grass with it and then tore it apart,'' he
said. ``I put a centrifugal clutch in it'' so he doesn't have to
shift gears.`` I made my own intake manifold and cam shaft.'' He
installed an external oil pump and brakes from a snowmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Any inherent silliness in the notion of racing a riding lawn
mower evaporates as a race approaches. In Mandan this weekend,
grim-faced men donned the required safety apparel _ long-sleeved
shirts, long pants, gloves, over-the-ankle boots and full-face
helmets. On their machines, each had a switch, to be tethered to
their belts, to stop the motor if they fell or were thrown. Racers
cannot drug their machines with speed-inducing additives.
</P>
<P>
   On the announcer's command, ``On your mark, get set, get ready,
mow!'' they dashed to their machines and roared off. Round and
round they went, hunching over their steering wheels. Thundering
into turns, they hiked out, their bodies barely touching their
seats, from one side, then the other. Lean, lanky younger men had
the edge in maneuvering and dodging, the bigger men in keeping
their wheels down.
</P>
<P>
   In all four races, machines spun into the center, or died with
dropped chains and burst engines. ``The big men won,'' said
Gienger, who with Bohlman was one of them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The most far-reaching study of the death penalty in the United
States has found that two out of three convictions were overturned
on appeal, mostly because of serious errors by incompetent defense
lawyers or overzealous police and prosecutors who withheld
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The study, an examination of appeals in all capital cases from
1973, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, to 1995,
also found that 75 percent of the people whose death sentences were
set aside were later given lesser sentences after retrials, in plea
bargains or by order of a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Another 7 percent were found not guilty on retrial. Eighteen
percent were given the death penalty on retrial but many of these
had their convictions overturned again in the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   The study, to be released Monday, is based on a search of state
and federal court records. It was conducted by a team of lawyers
and criminologists at Columbia University led by James S. Liebman,
a professor of law who has served as a defense lawyer in a number
of death-penalty trials and appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The report is likely to intensify an already gathering debate
about the death penalty, which has been provoked by the release of
some death-row inmates after new DNA technology helped exonerate
them. Concerns about the death penalty were heightened by the
decision in March by Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, to
declare a moratorium on executions in his state after 13 men on
death row there were exonerated by new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   While some death-penalty supporters have argued that Illinois is
an aberration and produces less reliable death sentences than other
states, the Columbia study found that the rate of serious error
detected by court reviews in Illinois capital cases was 66 percent,
slightly below the national average of 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the death penalty is overwhelming, but recent Gallup
polls have shown it slipping, to 66 percent, its lowest point since
1978, when it was 62 percent. Even many death-penalty supporters
have expressed serious concerns about its fairness. Last month the
historically conservative New Hampshire Legislature voted to
abolish the death penalty, though the bill was subsequently vetoed
by the state's Democratic governor, Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has even made a surprise entrance into the
presidential race, where Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
presumptive Republican presidential candidate who has been an
outspoken supporter of the penalty, postponed the execution of a
convicted killer earlier this month to allow DNA testing. It was
the first stay Bush had granted, after presiding over 131
executions, the most of any governor since the death penalty was
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, Ari Fleischer, said, ``Some people will
use this study to call for the abolition of the death penalty.''
But, Fleischer said, the finding of so many errors during the
appeals process ``shows that there is an extra level of vigilance
and caution in death-penalty cases, appropriately so.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the study's finding that of the death-row inmates whose
sentences were set aside on appeal, 75 percent were later given
lesser sentences and 7 percent were found not guilty, Fleischer
said, ``This shows that 93 percent are still found guilty'' of some
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an error about their innocence. It's just a question
of the appropriate punishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study had its origin in a request in 1991 by Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Md., then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to
Liebman to calculate the frequency with which federal judges found
errors in appeals of death-penalty cases and then set aside the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The high national rate of serious errors leading to verdicts
being set aside in the cases stands in sharp contrast to the error
rate found in appeals in other criminal cases, which is estimated
to be below 10 percent, several legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of errors found in appeals in death-penalty cases
ranged from 100 percent in three states _ Kentucky, Maryland and
Tennessee, and 91 percent in Mississippi, down to 18 percent in
Virginia, by far the lowest of any of the 34 states that have the
death penalty, raising questions about whether Virginia's court
system is unusually fair or works to make it hard to detect errors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 24 of the 26 states with the death penalty where there
have been fully completed appeals had an error rate of 52 percent
or higher, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also shows that there is little, if any, relationship
between the number of death sentences or executions in a state and
its homicide rate or population.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, said Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren
Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, ``This
study tells us that the enormous inconsistencies, the justice by
geography and the sheer-luck nature of the death-penalty system''
that the Supreme Court criticized when it invalidated death-penalty
laws in 1972 remain true today.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, Justice Potter Stewart suggested that the
administration of the death penalty was so capricious that the
chances of receiving it were like being hit by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 the court began to uphold rewritten death-penalty laws
that addressed its concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Wilkinson, a former assistant U.S. attorney who won a
death-penalty conviction against Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma
City bombing, said the report provided important data to help sort
out the issues in the debate over the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, the debate has been heavily ideological; this gives
us some data,'' said Wilkinson, who is a member of the National
Committee to Prevent Wrongful Executions and is a lawyer with
Latham &AMP; Watkins in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She said it had long been known that there was a high error rate
in death-penalty cases. ``But what was really shocking to me,'' she
said, ``was that 82 percent of the cases that are sent back after
review receive some lesser penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebman, the main author of the study, acknowledged that some
death-penalty advocates might seize on the 68 percent rate of
serious errors as proof that the system works, that mistakes are
caught and innocent people are not put to death. But he said the
fact that ``there are so many mistakes,'' and that it takes an
average of nine years to complete the review process, ``raises
grave doubts whether we do catch all the mistakes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the 13 cases that led Ryan to suspend executions
in Illinois, that of Anthony Porter, went through the entire review
process without any error being detected, said Lawrence C.
Marshall, a professor of law at Northwestern University and
director of its Center on Wrongful Convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Porter came within 48 hours of execution, only to win a stay
from a state court because of a psychologist's test showing he had
an IQ of only 50, raising doubts about whether he was mentally
competent. After the stay, journalism students at Northwestern,
under the direction of a journalism professor, David Protess, found
evidence that exonerated Porter and led to the conviction of
another man.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is compelling evidence that the appeals process
still does not screen out all the innocent people,'' Marshall said,
``and that the number of people who ought to be taken out of the
death-penalty pool is far higher than the 68 percent in the
study.'' For example, if a defense lawyer was truly incompetent, he
said, the lawyer might never do the work necessary so that legal
and factual issues could be raised later on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The number of errors, and the number that go undetected, may
have risen since the study was completed, Liebman said, because
since the mid-1990s several states and Congress have curbed appeals
by death-row inmates and sped the execution process.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 federal law, signed by President Clinton, put a one-year
limit on the time death-row inmates have to appeal to federal
courts after exhausting their appeals in state courts. And a number
of states have shut down special public-defender units that
formerly helped death-row inmates with their appeals.
</P>
<P>
   From the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1973 to the end
of 1995, there was a total of 5,760 death-penalty convictions, of
which 4,578 were appealed. The study looked at all three possible
stages of appeal _ direct appeal to a state's highest court; what
is known as post-conviction review, usually by the original trial
judge; and habeas corpus review, under which convictions in state
courts are reviewed for error in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Although state court judges, many of whom are elected, are
usually thought to be less likely to find in favor of a convicted
killer on appeal than federal judges are, the report found that 46
percent of all death-penalty cases where error was found were in
state courts. Federal judges reversed 40 percent of the capital
cases that survived and were appealed to them.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where no error was found, it took an average of nine
years from the time of sentencing to execution, the report found.
As a result, the study reported, only 5 percent of all people who
had been given the death penalty since 1973 had been executed.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the report said their findings confirmed a
complaint of supporters of the death penalty who say the appeals
process takes a long time. But, the authors said, ``Judicial review
takes so long precisely because American capital sentences are so
persistently and systematically fraught with error.'' It takes
years of review to catch the mistakes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cause of so many errors in death-penalty cases, the
study found that 37 percent were the result of incompetent defense
attorneys, who are often poorly paid or inexperienced in capital
trials. Another 19 percent of the errors were caused by misconduct
by police or prosecutors in suppressing evidence that would have
helped the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 5 percent of the errors were the result of bias by
the judge or jury, such as a judge telling the news media what he
thought about the defendant during the trial. A further 20 percent
were errors caused by faulty instructions given to juries by the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 19 percent were in a miscellaneous category that
included coerced confessions, prosecutors keeping blacks off the
jury when a black defendant was on trial, or the police planting
informers in jails to listen to conversations between defendants
and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the kind of technicalities people complain about
helping a defendant,'' Liebman said. Indeed, some of them amount to
overzealous law enforcement railroading suspects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A major factor, Liebman and other lawyers, judges and
prosecutors said, is that in capital cases there is no plea
bargaining. In other felony indictments, 90 percent of the
defendants end up pleading guilty, often in exchange for a reduced
sentence, a process that leads to conversations between the
prosecutor and the defense attorney, and to a less adversarial
situation.
</P>
<P>
   But in murder cases, particularly those that have received a lot
of publicity and in which the prosecutor decides to seek a death
sentence, there is intense public interest, creating enormous
pressure to win and leaving little room for the kind of plea
bargaining that is used in other criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``In death-penalty cases, the prosecutor feels pressure,'' said
William Broadhus, a former attorney general of Virginia who tried
death-penalty cases and is now in private practice. ``So maybe you
press harder than the situation warrants.''
</P>
<P>
   And juries in death-penalty cases often feel a rush to convict,
Broadhus said, as they sit in the courtroom looking at pictures of
the dead person and see the victim's family in court.
</P>
<P>
   The report also finds that there is no apparent reduction in
homicide in states with the death penalty. For the nation as a
whole, in the period from 1973 to 1995, the murder rate was nine
per 100,000. But in the states with the death penalty, it was 9.3
per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report found that there are huge variations
among the states with the death penalty in the rates of both
death-penalty convictions and executions. The variations seemed to
have no relation to the states' population or number of slayings.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, for example, almost 6 percent of all homicides
result in a death sentence, more than four times the national
average among states with the death penalty, while in Maryland less
than 0.6 percent of homicides result in a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Three states that have a high number of executions _ Texas,
Virginia and Louisiana _ rank fourth, second and seventh in
executions per homicide. But Texas is only 18th in death sentences
per homicide, Virginia is 22nd and Louisiana is 25th. In other
words, the report concluded, these states execute a
disproportionately large number of the people who have been
sentenced to death.

   With the deferential surreptitiousness that some Americans now
associate with their northern neighbor, Canada in the last decade
nearly doubled its oil exports and nearly tripled its natural gas
exports to the United States. Now Canada is definitively emerging
as the No. 1 energy supplier to the United States, the world's
largest energy importer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is the largest total energy supplier to the United
States, greater than Saudi Arabia, Venezuela or Mexico,'' Gordon
Giffin, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, said here recently in a
speech to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, an
industry group. The ambassador diplomatically did not note that oil
and gas imports this year account for a big part of the rising U.S.
trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   With oil and natural gas prices doubling over the last year,
there are no apologies for $30 barrels of oil here in Alberta,
Canada's largest oil and gas producing province.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, this city, Canada's energy capital, is now
welcoming the World Petroleum Congress, a 54-nation association of
oil producing and consuming countries that is a forum for industry
leaders and energy technology experts. The five-day affair is
drawing 3,000 delegates and journalists, as well as protesters
against global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically our turn; commodity prices have been down for a
long time now,'' said J.C. Anderson, chief executive of Anderson
Exploration Ltd., a major gas producer. His voice carries not a
hint of apology, and his rural Nebraska twang reflects the new,
almost seamless North American energy market. ``This business has
become a continental game. That border is kaput,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, low prices depressed the profitability and
value of investments in Canada's oil patch. But in a radical
turnaround in the first quarter of this year, profits for Canada's
six largest oil and gas producers leaped 130-fold, hitting nearly
$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the oil and gas prices that are posted daily on front pages
here expected to remain strong through the winter, North America's
energy industry is slowly moving out of the shadow of the dot-com
high-technology economy. As investors rediscover that the Western
world still moves on oil and gas, takeover frenzy has swept this
city of corporate headquarters. In one week alone in April, there
were three takeover bids for energy companies here. With the United
States' capital markets about 40 times the size of Canada's, the
United States is pumping billions of new dollars into Canada's
energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   In Alberta, the highest natural gas prices in memory are helping
gas dethrone oil as the top fuel for exploration, production and
provincial royalty revenue.
</P>
<P>
   While oil is shuttled around the world in ships, natural gas
remains a ``terrestrial commodity,'' economically transported by
pipeline. A clean-burning fuel that produces less carbon dioxide
than coal or oil, natural gas is making Americans look north with
new respect.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly the fuel of choice for heating American homes,
natural gas is also the preferred fuel for electricity generation
instead of coal and nuclear power. Long bottled up here, Alberta
natural gas now flows through four new pipelines into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to the end of that pipe, and it's the Brooklyn Navy
Yard,'' said Ralph Klein, Alberta's premier, whose government now
earns three times as much from natural gas royalties as from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a Con Edison gas-fueled electricity generating
plant, he added: ``Unbeknownst to most New Yorkers, New York is lit
up with Alberta natural gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Over this decade, American consumption of natural gas is
expected to increase by about 50 percent, to 33 trillion cubic feet
a year. For electricity generation alone, it is expected to double.
The hitch is that American natural gas production has declined by
about 5 percent since 1998. To the south, Mexico's state oil
company, Pemex, barely satisfies growing local use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be so tight on natural gas this summer that
people are going to say, `What are we going to do?''' said Thomas
A. Petrie, a Denver-based investment banker in the energy field.
``It's going to create a scramble for gas projects. We are going to
look all over the lower 48, but the big projects are going to be in
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Anderson put it from his corner office in a
steel-and-glass tower here: ``We are going to have to drill the
pants off this basin. Then, we are going to have to go north.''
</P>
<P>
   American demand is growing so steadily that even if Canada's gas
exports increase 50 percent this decade, as forecast, Canada will
only be pacing American growth. And, even though the number of
exploration rigs in Alberta is jumping 50 percent this year,
geologists say that, after half a century of pumping from the Rocky
Mountain foothills, there is no more low-hanging fruit. The future
of North American gas production now lies in Canada's geographic
and climactic extremes.

 CALGARY, Alberta: climactic extremes . 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the East Coast, North Atlantic developments off Nova Scotia
and Newfoundland are turning the Maritime provinces into a major
oil and gas producing area. The United States is the sole export
market.
</P>
<P>
   The region's first major oil project, Newfoundland's Hibernia,
started production in November 1997. This May, Exxon Mobil
announced plans to increase production by 30 percent this year, to
65 million barrels a day. The province's second large project,
Terra Nova, is to begin production early next year. With four other
oil projects in the planning stage, a recent government study
increased Newfoundland's offshore oil reserves by almost a third,
to 2.1 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Off the coast of Nova Scotia, Sable Offshore Energy Inc., which
was started in January to pump natural gas to New England, is
bringing the first piped gas to Maine in a pipeline that goes to
Boston. In addition, gas companies are spending $400 million more
to explore offshore tracts around the Sable development.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Canada's West, the energy action is moving north.
</P>
<P>
   While Alberta's oil production dropped 6 percent last year, it
is expected to rebound in coming years as $25 billion worth of
investments in northern Alberta's oil sands starts to pay off.
These reserves of thick oil, estimated in size to rival those of
Saudi Arabia, were largely untouched. But new technologies,
including some that use steam and hot water, now render about 15
percent of the deposits _ 5 billion barrels _ recoverable at a cost
of $10 or less a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Over this decade, the oil sands portion of Canada's oil
production is expected to double, hitting 50 percent by 2005. In
Fort McMurray, the northern Alberta epicenter of oil sands mining,
there is such a labor shortage that doughnut shops and fast-food
shops have had to cut back service until new workers can be brought
up from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Oil sands and North Atlantic production will allow Canada to
increase its oil exports to the United States by about 50 percent
over this decade. With this increase, Canada will probably surpass
Venezuela to become the United States' most important source of
imported oil. This expansion takes place in an international
economy where low oil prices have allowed world oil consumption to
double since 1970, approaching 80 million barrels a day by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, I saw a stretched-out Humvee in New York; the week
before I saw a Range Rover without a speck of mud driving around
London,'' said Martin P. Molyneaux, managing director for research
at First Energy Capital, an oil and gas brokerage firm based in
Calgary. ``Consumption per vehicle is high. World consumption keeps
going northward.''
</P>
<P>
   On the natural gas front, growing American demand and higher
prices are pushing Canada's production frontier north of the Arctic
Circle. For years, bad economics, local American Indian reluctance,
and environmental opposition blocked development of massive
reserves in the Mackenzie River delta and Beaufort Sea area. The
deposits, some of the largest in the world, were only viable for
development when natural gas prices surpassed $2.50 per million
British thermal units. But now with North American gas prices
hovering around $4, everyone here is looking north.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, nobody was talking about the far north,'' said
Pierre R. Alvarez, president of the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers. ``But now the price has moved substantially,
and people are working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gas developers are drawing maps for multibillion-dollar
pipelines, negotiating with local Indians for participation and
discussing environmental safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are the largest known natural gas reserves in North
America below the Beaufort Sea. The Mackenzie Delta area is
believed to hold 9 trillion cubic feet of gas, roughly equal to the
gas reserves off the coast of Nova Scotia. To the west of the
Mackenzie, Alaska's Prudhoe Bay is believed to hold 25 trillion to
30 trillion cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   One proposed 5,000-mile pipeline would run from Prudhoe Bay,
potentially underwater to minimize environmental impacts, then
south along the Mackenzie River into Northern Alberta to connect
with pipelines to the United States. Unlike oil, natural gas is
easier to pump cold.
</P>
<P>
   This line could carry 3.5 billion cubic feet of American and
Canadian gas, a 40 percent jump over Canada's current export level
to the United States. This October, when the $3 billion Alliance
pipeline opens from here to Chicago, Western Canada will have
excess pipeline capacity into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Energy experts believe consumer pressure will prevail over any
environmentalist opposition, and that Canada's Arctic will be
opened to gas production by the end of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. and Canadian utilities are running scared now, almost
everybody has overestimated supply and underestimated demand,''
Molyneaux, the energy analyst, said. He noted that in the last five
years 75 percent of new electricity generation in the United States
went to natural gas. ``If your energy bills go up by 30 percent,
you are not going to be happy about it,'' he added.

CONSERVATIVE WRITERS PROVIDED FOUNDATION FOR BUSH'S PLATFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Ohio, Pa.)  (With BUSH-INFLUENCES-EXCERPTS) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ask Gov. George W. Bush of Texas about the
intellectual origins of his campaign's mantra and he says,
``Compassionate conservatism is first and foremost springing from
the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet well before the Bush began building his presidential
campaign around the words ``compassionate conservative'' _
reshaping the image of his party to follow suit _ a cadre of
thinkers on the right had been trying for years to fashion a form
of conservatism that rejected the welfare state but did not turn
its back on the poor. And with his campaign strategist, Karl Rove,
acting as his guide, Bush began reading their books and meeting
them, even before his first race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rove gave him ``The Dream and the Nightmare,'' a book by Myron
Magnet of the Manhattan Institute that Bush says helped crystalize
his thinking about culture. The book is an indictment of the
attitudes of the 1960s counterculture and its legacy to the poor.
Rove also introduced Bush to Marvin Olasky _ a proponent of 19th
century charity over the entitlements of the welfare state _ whom
the governor now calls ``compassionate conservatism's leading
thinker'' in a forward to Olasky's newest book.
</P>
<P>
   Those moments amounted to the first building blocks toward the
``compassionate conservative'' platform Bush is running on today:
tax incentives that he predicts will lead to an explosion of
charitable giving; an emphasis on using religious institutions to
deal with poverty, drug abuse and other social problems and a
pledge to ``usher in the responsibility era,'' to replace the
notion that ``if it feels good do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The core concept of this platform is that while government has a
responsibility to provide services for the needy it does not have
to provide them itself. This philosophy can be seen in everything
from Bush's proposals for a tax credit to help people purchase
health insurance to his call for some Social Security payroll taxes
to be diverted into individual investment plans.
</P>
<P>
   As Stephen Goldsmith, Bush's chief domestic policy adviser,
describes it, ``compassionate conservatism means providing help in
such a way as to stimulate and reinforce self-governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughts have been germinating for years, and the Bush
campaign drew from several different schools of conservative and
neo-conservative thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Magnet, start with a scathing critique of the
attitudes of the 1960s and essentially blame liberalism for
creating an entrenched underclass. Others base their views on Roman
Catholic teachings that social problems are best dealt with by the
institution closest to those who are suffering.
</P>
<P>
   And still others are Republican politicians, like Rep. John
Kasich of Ohio and former Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana, who have
argued that the Republicans who put time limits on welfare benefits
in 1996 could not just wash their hands of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we match our skepticism about government with a bold new
definition of public compassion?'' Coats asked four years ago.
``Can we dismantle a destructive welfare culture, and still fulfill
our responsibilities to the disadvantaged?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself describes ``compassionate conservatism'' as more
rooted in values than an intellectual movement. ``It is the
understanding that lives can be changed and that cultures can
change,'' he said in a recent interview. ``The origins are not just
logical thought and inspirations from writings.''
</P>
<P>
   And he does not seem as steeped as his aides in the lineage of
the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``News to me,'' Bush said when told that former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich had been captivated by many of the same writers he
had. And while Gingrich not only read Olasky's ``The Tragedy of
American Compassion'' but handed it out to freshmen legislators in
1995, Bush said he had primarily learned about Olasky's concepts
from talking with him, rather than from reading his books.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is clearly devoted to the new conservatism. As governor
he has promoted hostels for welfare mothers and legislation that
encouraged religion-based drug treatment centers and prison
ministries. And when the time came to assemble his campaign staff,
he tapped two apostles of compassionate conservatism: Michael
Gerson, his chief speechwriter, had been a senior aide to Coats,
and Goldsmith, his chief domestic policy adviser, had tried to
create a laboratory for compassionate conservatism as the mayor of
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back to 1996,'' Goldsmith said, ``the Republicans'
message was that government had been harmful. Therefore, eliminate
government, and people in tough circumstances will suddenly be
better off. Both the public and many Republican mayors said that's
naive. Merely the absence of bad action is not going to be
sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bush made the overhaul of welfare, one of the main planks
of his first campaign for governor and later wrestled with it after
his election, Rove arranged for Bush to meet conservative academics
like James Q. Wilson, who has long studied character and social
policy, and urban problems and crime, as well as Olasky and Magnet,
who were looking for the reasons for entrenched urban poverty. As
Magnet, who had been a scholar of Dickens, put it, ``Weren't
dizzying contrasts of wealth and poverty supposed to have gone out
with Dickensian London?''
</P>
<P>
   Magnet, whose book is subtitled, ``The Sixties' Legacy to the
Underclass,'' charged that the youth of the '60s, with their sexual
revolution, disdain for bourgeois culture and praise for
alternative lifestyles ``permitted, even celebrated, behavior that
when poor people practice it will imprison them inextricably in
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   And in ``The Tragedy of American Compassion'' Olasky, whose
personal pilgrimage led him to become first a Marxist and then an
evangelical Christian, concluded that 19th-century America's
religious-based charity was preferable to the welfare state. He
thought that the social revolution of the 1960s was ``disastrous''
because it emphasized public assistance as an entitlement, asking
nothing in return. The ``key contribution'' of the War on Poverty,
he wrote, was ``the deliberate attempt to uncouple welfare from
shame.'' Religious charities of the last century, he argued, were
more effective because they made demands in exchange for their aid
and because they required the donors to give time as well as money.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the counterculture struck a chord with Bush. ``It
really helped crystalize some of my thinking about cultures,
changing cultures,'' he said in the interview, ``and of part of the
legacy of my generation.'' Bush quickly acknowledged, though, that
``positive things'' also came out of the activism of the baby-boom
generation, like environmentalism and the women's movement.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush also met David Horowitz, once a voice of the
New Left, who later turned conservative. In his book ``Destructive
Generation: Second Thoughts About the '60s,'' written with Peter
Collier, Horowitz branded the 1960s as a time when ``the System _
that collection of values that provide guidelines for societies as
well as individuals _ was assaulted and mauled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also owes an intellectual debt to Catholic
neo-conservatives who have based their advocacy of empowering
grass-roots groups on concepts articulated by several papal
encyclicals. As described by John J. DiIulio, Jr., a University of
Pennsylvania professor who has become a leading researcher into
faith-based social services, the idea is that ``charity begins at
home. You always try to solve serious social problems as close to
the people as possible.'' In other words, the federal government
steps in only when problems become too big for other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of compassionate conservatism argue that it erodes the
wall between church and state and may force religion on the poor in
exchange for aid. They also ask whether the concept really offers a
way to eliminate government's responsibility to the poor. Arianna
Huffington, once an acolyte of the Gingrich revolution who ran an
organization with Olasky to promote such ideas, now counts herself
a skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you take what works and make sure it reaches enough
people?'' Huffington asks. ``Can that really be done without the
raw power of government appropriations, given that the private
sector has not been forthcoming?'' She said she once thought that
if government were scaled back the private sector would step
forward. Instead, she realized ``how much easier it was raising
money for the opera or a fashionable museum.''
</P>
<P>
   And even inside the compassionate-conservatism movement there is
debate about how far to go. DiIulio, a self-professed New Democrat
who has also advised some of Vice President Al Gore's aides, said
he does not believe the civic sector can replace government as a
means to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Olasky, though he proposes a step-by-step testing
of faith-based programs and tax credits for charity, seems eager to
use them to eventually replace the federal safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must place in the hands of state officials all decisions
about welfare and the financing of it, and then press them to put
welfare entirely in the hands of church and community-based
organizations,'' Olasky has written.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these differences of opinion were hashed out for Bush in
early 1999 when a group assembled by Goldsmith met with Bush and
his top aides in the governor's mansion to prepare for the coming
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   DiIulio and Olasky were there. So, among others, were Wilson and
Robert L. Woodson Sr., the founder of the National Center for
Neighborhood Enterprise, a nonprofit organization that assists
neighborhood groups battling drugs, youth gangs and teen pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, too, had gone on an intellectual journey, parting ways
with former activists in the civil rights movement to become a
leading black conservative in favor of social programs built around
class, not race.
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps four hours that day, as the group discussed policies
directed at the poor, Bush asked what would work and what would
not.
</P>
<P>
   They did not all agree. ``True to my New Democrat profile I made
very clear, for me at least, it's not about ministry vs.
Medicaid,'' said DiIulio. ``You're not going to solve these
problems with just faith-based approaches. There's not enough money
in civic society.''
</P>
<P>
   Olasky recalled that Bush was less interested when the
conversation touched on tax policy and tax credits and more engaged
by the discussion of particular faith-based institutions.
</P>
<P>
   He attributes Bush's interest in faith-based charitable
institutions to Bush's personal conversions in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to me to feel a real connection with these inner-city
faith-based groups,'' Olasky said. ``He went through religious
change at the same time he gave up drinking, so he understands even
though he is from a very different economic background.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later when he spoke in Indianapolis about using churches
and neighborhood groups to help the needy, Bush straddled the views
that had been aired that day.
</P>
<P>
   Like Olasky, Bush said charity should make demands of its
recipients. ``At Teen Challenge _ a national drug treatment program
_ one official says we have a rule: If you don't work, you don't
eat,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is demanding love,'' he said, ``a severe mercy. These
institutions, at their best, treat people as moral individuals,
with responsibilities and duties, not as wards or clients or
dependents or numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also reflected the ideas of DiIulio, saying, ``We will
recognize there are some things that government should be doing _
like Medicaid for poor children. Government cannot be replaced by
charities _ but it can welcome them as partners, not resent them as
rivals.''

HIDDEN WITHIN MONTENEGRO ELECTION, A REFERENDUM ON MILOSEVIC  
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro _ Montenegrins voted in two local
elections on Sunday that were being closely watched as a barometer
of relations between this small Western-leaning republic and
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, voters in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, and in
the seaside town of Herceg Novi were simply electing new mayors and
local assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the vote was effectively a poll on who wants to stay
with Milosevic and Yugoslavia _ which now consists only of Serbia
and Montenegro _ and who prefers the more independent course of
Montenegro's leader, Milo Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   Western ministers and diplomats have leaned heavily on
Djukanovic in recent months to avoid a complete break with Belgrade
and to postpone any referendum on independence. It is also not
clear that the president and his ruling coalition would win
sufficient support; opinion polls indicate a fairly even split
among Montenegro's 600,000 people between staying with the Serbs
and breaking ties.
</P>
<P>
   Both outsiders and residents of this small republic fear any
outright rupture with Belgrade would cause another in the series of
Balkan wars that have erupted since the old communist Yugoslavia
began splitting apart a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's coalition _ called ``For a Better Life'' _ was
expected to win in the capital, Podgorica, with a much closer
ballot predicted in Herceg Novi.
</P>
<P>
   A slip at the polls for the government coalition here, coupled
with a strengthening of Milosevic's allies, could tempt Belgrade to
challenge Djukanovic's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has already begun to color the politics of Montenegro,
where the atmosphere remains uneasy 10 days after a close aide of
Djukanovic was killed in what appears to have been a political
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army presence remains a persistent cause for
concern for Montenegro, as do political supporters of Belgrade, who
have threatened to take to the streets if they lose in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   There were few local issues raised during the boisterous
flag-waving rallies this past week.
</P>
<P>
   The government coalition kept to its familiar slogan and the
name of the president, offering a program of democratic reform and
openness to Europe and the West and a hint towards independence.
``We have never sold our authority, and will never sell our
country. That's what we want for Montenegro and our future,''
Djukanovic said at a rally in the capital last week.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Belgrade opposition, led by Yugoslav Prime Minister
Momir Bulatovic and local leader Predrag Bulatovic (who is no
relation to Momir), ran with the simple message ``Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Bulatovic has emphasized that Montenegro and Serbia are
equal partners in the union, yet he has been forced into a
coalition with both the most radical Serbian nationalist party and
its leader Vojislav Seselj, and the leftist party run by
Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. Both that alliance and televised
footage of his meeting with Milosevic in May to discuss these
elections undermined Predrag Bulatovic's claim to equal
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The small Liberal Alliance, which caused these elections by
withdrawing from the government coalitions in both cities, has
slipped from view behind the larger parties. The most vocal
supporter for independence, and a critic of the Djukanovic
government, it hoped to win a larger part of the vote in new
elections, but has been drowned out by the greater confrontation
with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the capital were clear about their choice. Supporters
of the government said they voted for democracy, for modernity,
openness to the West and a future inside Europe. ``It is the only
choice with perspective,'' said one student who gave his name only
as Aco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted `For a better life.' No one wants to live worse,''
said Milisav Miuskovic, a school janitor, quoting the government
coalition slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the pro-Belgrade coalition were often reluctant to
talk to a Western journalist or declined to give their names. When
they did, their arguments were direct.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for Momir,'' said Rada, a saleswoman who declined to
give her full name. ``I am for Yugoslavia, I do not want to
separate from Serbia. The people will not let it happen.''

HOUSE GOP TO PUSH ITS MEDICARE DRUG PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans will flesh out their proposal for
Medicare drug benefits this week and try to push it through two
House committees in three days, despite fierce objections from many
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Sunday that they would combine their drug plan
with a proposal to give more money to health-maintenance
organizations _ perhaps $4 billion over five years _ in hopes of
halting the exodus of HMOs from Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, HMOs pulling out of Medicare have
disrupted insurance arrangements for more than 700,000 elderly
people, and many more health plans are expected to withdraw this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Documents prepared by senior House Republicans show that they
would increase Medicare payments to HMOs, especially those in rural
areas, which now receive the lowest payments.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said such increases were needed to keep HMOs in
Medicare and to attract them to markets they have avoided. But some
Democrats, like Rep. Pete Stark of California, said the increases
were unjustified because many health plans were overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican proposal, the government would subsidize
private insurance to cover pharmaceutical costs for Medicare
beneficiaries. Such insurance, covering only drug costs, is now
unavailable, and insurance companies say they do not intend to sell
it, but the Republicans have set aside up to $40 billion over the
next five years to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the House Republican plan says the government would
guarantee access to drug coverage if private insurers did not offer
it. ``All beneficiaries, regardless of where they live, would have
the choice of at least two plans, one of which must be a
prescription-drug plan'' for people in Medicare's original
fee-for-service program, the document says.
</P>
<P>
   Trent D. Duffy, a spokesman for Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who
is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: ``Whether you
live in rural Kansas or downtown New York, you will have the option
to buy drug coverage. The government would be the insurer of last
resort in the unlikely event that private plans are not
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy said the premiums would probably average $30 to $40 a
month. But, Republicans said, premiums, deductibles, co-payments
and details of the benefit packages would vary among plans.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said they expected to win approval for their
proposal at meetings of the Ways and Means Committee and the
Commerce Committee on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. They want the
full House to pass it this month, before the Fourth of July recess,
to counter Democratic charges that Congress has done nothing on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   One feature of the House Republican plan is sure to infuriate
Clinton administration officials: It would create an agency in the
Department of Health and Human Services to administer drug benefits
and the HMO program for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency would be known as the Medicare Oversight and
Management Administration. Republicans said it was needed because
Medicare officials had been biased against HMOs and had imposed too
much regulation on health-care providers. The new agency, as
envisioned by House Republicans, would have more of a free-market
orientation and would encourage private health plans to compete for
Medicare business.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans acknowledge that drug companies often charge
higher prices in the United States than in other countries. But
rather than limiting prices here, they would direct the U.S. trade
representative to negotiate with other countries to ``eliminate
price controls'' on drugs in Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Bolger, a pollster who advises House Republicans on the
politics of the prescription-drug issue, said: ``It's very
important that Republicans stick together and pass a bill. If they
don't pass a bill, they'll pay a price at the ballot box.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For political purposes, some Republicans said, the fact that
they have a plan and are trying to pass it is more important than
the content of the plan or whether it actually becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   Here are details of the House Republican plan, as described in
documents obtained from Republican leaders:
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare beneficiaries would be encouraged to enroll in a
drug-insurance plan before they became sick. They would initially
have six months to enroll. They could change plans once a year, but
``must maintain continuous drug coverage'' through HMOs,
prescription-drug plans or a former employer's health plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prescription-drug plans would aggressively negotiate with drug
companies to secure discounts for Medicare beneficiaries. Insurers
would have to cover ``all major therapeutic classes of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The government would pay premiums and all other costs except
modest co-payments _ say, $5 a prescription _ for people with
incomes up to 35 percent above the poverty level. The government
would provide smaller subsidies for people with incomes from 35
percent to 50 percent above the poverty level. (A couple is
classified as poor if they have income of less than $11,250 this
year.)
</P>
<P>
   _ The government would help insurance companies by paying most
of the drug costs incurred by Medicare beneficiaries with the
highest costs. An insurance plan with a typical mix of patients
would receive a subsidy for 25 percent to 30 percent of all its
pharmaceutical costs, ``making insurance more affordable for all
beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican bill would increase the basic payments that
HMOs receive for providing services to Medicare beneficiaries. It
would also, for the first time, allow HMOs to negotiate with the
government to obtain even more money, if they could prove that
their costs justified such payments. The new Medicare agency could
grant increases up to a maximum matching the growth of premiums in
the private insurance market.
</P>
<P>
   Private insurance costs have been rising more than twice as fast
as Medicare payments to many HMOs: 4.8 percent a year, as against 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans will also try to ``recoup government
investments in the research and development of prescription
drugs,'' their documents say.

HIDDEN WITHIN MONTENEGRO ELECTION, A REFERENDUM ON MILOSEVIC  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro _ Montenegrins voted in two local
elections on Sunday that were being closely watched as a barometer
of relations between this small Western-leaning republic and
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, voters in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, and in
the seaside town of Herceg Novi were simply electing new mayors and
local assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the vote was effectively a poll on who wants to stay
with Milosevic and Yugoslavia _ which now consists only of Serbia
and Montenegro _ and who prefers the more independent course of
Montenegro's leader, Milo Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   Western ministers and diplomats have leaned heavily on
Djukanovic in recent months to avoid a complete break with Belgrade
and to postpone any referendum on independence. It is also not
clear that the president and his ruling coalition would win; polls
indicate a fairly even split among Montenegro's 600,000 people
between staying with the Serbs and breaking ties.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that an outright rupture with Belgrade would cause
another of the Balkan wars that have erupted since communist
Yugoslavia began splitting apart a decade ago. Violence has already
begun to color the politics of Montenegro, where the atmosphere
remains uneasy 10 days after a close aide of Djukanovic was killed
in what appears to have been a political assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's coalition _ called ``For a Better Life'' _ was
expected to win in the capital, Podgorica, with a much closer
ballot predicted in Herceg Novi. The government coalition kept to
its slogan and the name of the president, offering a program of
democratic reform and openness to the West and a hint towards
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Belgrade opposition, led by Yugoslav Prime Minister
Momir Bulatovic and local leader Predrag Bulatovic (who is no
relation to Momir), ran with the simple message ``Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The small Liberal Alliance, which caused these elections by
withdrawing from the government coalitions in both cities, has
slipped from view behind the larger parties.

STARS' MOODS SWING ON ONE PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ ``They call it sudden death,'' a weary Mike Modano said
early Sunday morning. ``And it feels like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a mood swing. Two days earlier, Modano, the Dallas
Stars' center, had scored in the third overtime in New Jersey to
extend the Stanley Cup finals to a sixth game. Sunday morning,
Modano and the rest of the Stars knew exactly how the Devils had
felt.
</P>
<P>
   The tension mounting with each successive rush up and down the
ice late Saturday night, the Devils' Jason Arnott finally finished
off the defending champion Stars with the cup-clinching goal at 8
minutes 20 seconds of the second overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott's overtime goal was the 15th in history to clinch a
Stanley Cup. The Devils won their second cup in franchise history,
and first since 1995, while preventing the Stars from repeating as
champions of the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1993 had consecutive games in the finals gone to
overtime. Then, Montreal defeated Los Angeles in extra time in
Games 2, 3 and 4, while taking the series in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1951, when Toronto defeated Montreal, four games to
one, with all five games going to overtime, had the last two games
of a finals series gone past regulation.
</P>
<P>
   And not since Games 2 and 3 of the 1931 Finals, then played
under a three-of-five-game format had there been consecutive
multiple overtimes in the finals. Montreal shook off losses to
Chicago in both those games and took the Cup, three games to two.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Stars and the Devils played a combined 83 minutes
11 seconds of overtime _ nearly an hour and a half _ over parts of
five periods since Thursday night. It was no wonder they were
physically beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in overtime, it only takes one play and the series is
over,'' Derian Hatcher, the Dallas captain, said. ``That's what
happened tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher had ended the series for Petr Sykora much earlier _
12:08 into the game _ with an vicious elbow that necessitated a
stretcher to take Sykora off the ice. Sykora spent the night in a
hospital, cheering the Devils on.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, who could barely walk after Game 6, displayed no
remorse for the hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared when he didn't get up for a while,'' Hatcher
said. ``But someone said he was moving and talking. Those were the
real important things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykora made the trip back to New Jersey, and the Devils, who won
all three games on Dallas ice, were able to avoid a Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both goaltenders were really good,'' said Dallas' 40-year-old
center Guy Carbonneau, who may have played the final game of his
career. Carbonneau was referring to his teammate Ed Belfour, who
stopped 91 of 93 shots over Games 5 and 6, including 43 of 45 on
Saturday night, and the Devils' Martin Brodeur, who turned aside 70
of the 72 shots fired his way the final two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can always look at we had three games at home and we
lost three games,'' Carbonneau said. ``That hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were able to make the series memorable, however, after
falling behind three games to one, and that seemed to take some of
the sting out of the loss. The Stars were plagued by serious
injuries all season. Few had predicted they would make it as far as
they did as they tried to defend the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is upset that we lost,'' Carbonneau said. ``But if
you look back on our season, we did some unbelievable things to
come two games within winning the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars saved some of their most unbelievable things for Games
5 and 6 of the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were just two unbelievable games,'' Coach Ken Hitchcock
said. &QL;

WITH AN ASSIST FROM THE DENTIST, AMERICANS WIN U.S. CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ A few days earlier, Earnie Stewart's
face had swelled like a balloon, his diet had been reduced to
bananas and his noted fear of flying had been matched by the
universal nightmare of repeat visits to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost sent him home,'' said Bruce Arena, coach of the
United States men's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the fleet winger who had a solid season in Holland this
year, had taken an elbow to the face on June 3 against South Africa
in the opening round of the U.S. Cup. Nerve damage to a tooth
required three visits to the dentist for a root canal, a new
filling and drainage of fluid that had left the right side of his
face as puffy as pastry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a lot of pain,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   The pain and swelling subsided, which was good news for the
American men, who defeated a severely weakened Mexico team, 3-0,
Sunday to win the U.S. Cup. Stewart showed cool professionalism in
the wilting heat at Giants Stadium, setting up the first goal for
Brian McBride, nearly scoring twice himself and demonstrating the
possibility of creative, intricate combinations with the blistering
Cobi Jones as the United States begins qualifying next month for
the 2002 World Cup that will be in Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans expect to open the semifinal round of qualifying
in the North American, Central American and Caribbean region on
July 16 at Guatemala or Antigua. For the Americans, erasure of the
debacle that was the 1998 World Cup in France cannot begin quickly
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The United States finished 32nd out of 32 teams in France,
collapsing from deficient play on the field, indecisive coaching by
Steve Sampson and internal finger-pointing by the players. There is
a new coach and a seemingly new attitude among the Americans, who
appear joined by a common purpose instead of being divided by
malignant cliques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say much about it, but it's a lot better now,''
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   There are many questions still to be answered during World Cup
qualifying. Four players missing Sunday because of injury _ forward
Joe-Max Moore, midfielder Eddie Lewis and defenders Robin Fraser
and Eddie Pope _ could make the starting lineup. And Tony Sanneh
still has to learn that he is now playing right back, not
cornerback, on defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Arena has repaired the tattered communication lines between
coaches and players, who appear to have a clear sense of what is
expected of them, when they must conform, when they have freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Stewart appeared to waste much of his time on the
wing with aimless running. But there is a new purpose to his game,
which could be troublesome to opponents as he continues his
interchangeable shifting with Jones from midfield to forward and
back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any problem substituting back and forth,'' Jones
said. ``He can go up front a while, and I'll go wide, then he can
go wide and I'll go up front. We've played together through two or
three coaches, we're roommates on the road, pretty good friends.
There's a natural knowledge of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 33rd minute Sunday, a magnificent three-pass combination
put the Americans up, 1-0. Stewart played a ball from 30 yards out
toward Jones in the middle of the field. Jones tapped it back to
Stewart, who charged the penalty area, dribbled to the end line and
crossed a pass to McBride for a wide-open shot from six yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce has given them to freedom to roam the field,'' the
playmaker Claudio Reyna said of Stewart and Jones. ``When you have
players who are allowed to roam with that kind of speed, it makes
it difficult for defenders. Bruce gives them the chance to do what
they do best. He doesn't stick them in one position. That creates a
lot of danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's opponent was essentially the Mexican club team, Pumas,
not the Mexican national team. From the beginning, the Mexicans
were overmatched. In the 70th minute, defender Christian Ramirez
received his second yellow card for dragging Jones down on a
breakaway and was ejected. Playing a man up the final 20 minutes,
the Americans scored twice more as Frankie Hejduk tipped in a Jones
shot that deflected off the post and Ante Razov stole a sloppy back
pass and slipped a left-footed shot into the net.
</P>
<P>
   A tired Stewart was replaced by Hejduk in the 76th minute, but
he had played impressively with his quiet leadership and clamorous
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you always stay in the same position, it's a lot easier for
defenses to zone,'' Stewart said. ``If you're switching, it
confuses defenses and you get guys open.'' &QL;

   MANDAN, N.D. _ Perhaps it is the tedium of watching the grass
grow just to cut it down and watch it grow some more. Perhaps it's
just something about men and their motors. No one seems to know why
it is happening now. But all across America, men have discovered
new thrills at the throttle of the snail of gasoline-powered
locomotion, the riding lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   From Bergholz and Kiskatom, N.Y., to Lubbock and Buda, Texas,
from Troy, Ohio, and Stillwater, Okla., to Cut Bank, Mont.,
Damascus, Ore., and this brawny town across the Missouri River from
Bismarck, men and the rare woman are off to the races on souped-up,
decal-coated John Deeres, Snappers, Dynamarks and Murrays. Some as
stocky as their machines themselves, they whip around dirt tracks
at speeds routinely exceeding 30 miles an hour and sometimes 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to go over big time if somebody don't get
killed,'' said Larry Freisz, 61, a fan at the races around a
480-foot dirt track at the Dacotah Speedway here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently starting in the late 1980s as a Fourth of July event
on wide subdivision streets, lawn mower racing, a relatively
affordable sport, now boasts organized circuits, with weekend races
in town after town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mow the merrier,'' the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing Association
advertises, in the ``mowdowns'' of the ``mowlennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the mowers' blades are removed, somebody might indeed
get killed. Through their trade association, the Outdoor Power
Equipment Institute, in Alexandria, Va., the companies that produce
1.6 million riding lawn mowers a year will have nothing to do with
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Any silliness to the notion of racing a riding lawn mower
evaporates as a race approaches. In Mandan this weekend, grim-faced
men roared round and round the track, thundering into turns. In all
four races, machines spun into the center, or died with dropped
chains and burst engines.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bohlman, 40, the operations director of a medical
center, won the biggest event, with eight men starting and four
finishing 20 laps. The instant he crossed the line, his mower threw
a rear wheel. The machine flipped, pitching Bohlman, who weighs
about 250 pounds, 15 feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to hover there spread-eagled, then landed on his side
in the dirt. Ashen and aching, he walked away.

ABORTION ISSUES LOOM IN BUSH CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his fellow
Republicans are beginning seven weeks of difficult politics around
the issue of abortion. It is a potentially divisive element in his
decision on a running mate, his handling of the party's platform
and the moderate, upbeat image he seeks to project at the party's
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts give Bush high marks, so far, for sending
conciliatory signals to both sides on the issue _ such as openly
considering potential running mates who support abortion rights,
while embracing his party's strict anti-abortion stand.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's opponents assert that his overtures to the middle are
mere symbolic gestures. The next seven weeks, they argue, will show
Bush siding, ultimately and firmly, with his party's social
conservatives on abortion. ``We think this flirting with moderation
is very cynical and we hope American women will see it for what it
is,'' said Alice Germond, executive vice president of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, which has endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. ``And we'll be doing everything we can to
highlight what the real positions are.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the Bush campaign, said, ``The
governor's record and his inclusive tone speaks for itself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Already, Bush and Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, the party's
platform chairman, have served notice that they want to preserve
the current platform position on abortion _ which calls for a ban
on the practice, without exception, and the appointment of judges
who respect ``the sanctity of innocent human life.''
</P>
<P>
   The political risk for Bush is that his effort to satisfy his
conservative base could undermine his appeal to the center. The
latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted May 10-13, showed
that 15 percent of the independents said that abortion should not
be permitted; 22 percent of the suburban voters felt that way.
Among Republicans, 32 percent supported a total ban.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk for Bush: If Republican abortion rights supporters
decide to fight on the platform, it would inject a rough
ideological struggle into the upbeat convention he seeks. Just
because Bush has signaled his intentions on the platform, ``it
doesn't mean everything is in his control,'' said Ann Stone, head
of Republicans for Choice. ``Ask Bob Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   She was alluding to the Republican nominee's efforts four years
ago to add a ``tolerance'' provision expressing room for other
views on abortion, an effort that was quashed by social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are trying their best to mute the issue this
time around. Abortion will not be on the agenda of either of the
two public hearings scheduled this month in connection with the
platform. Party strategists grumble that the news media will,
nevertheless, declare what one called ``abortion month'' __ a focus
that will be intensified when the Supreme Court soon hands down an
important ruling on the constitutionality of Nebraska's ``partial
birth'' abortion law.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the abortion issue has become a major subplot in
Bush's selection of a running mate. ``They've got a situation where
if they pick a pro-choice candidate they've got enormous worries
about the convention,'' one Republican strategist said of the Bush
campaign, speaking on the condition that he not be identified.
``And if they don't pick one,'' the strategist added, the criticism
will be ``you guys didn't have the guts to pick a pro-choice vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said: ``If Bush doesn't pick
a pro-choice running mate, it gives the pro-choice movement
credibility to say he also won't pick pro-choice judges for the
Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, both sides of the issue argue that Bush could pay a
price this fall if he rebuffs their constituents. Anti-abortion
leaders have long argued that their rank and file has greater
intensity on the issue than supporters of abortion rights _ and is
far more likely to cast a vote on the basis of it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the New York Times/CBS News Poll in February found that
70 percent of those supporting a ban on abortion said it was ``very
important'' that their presidential candidate shared their views;
only 26 percent of those who supported abortion being available to
all said it was ``very important'' that their candidate agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very beneficial for the Republican Party to be a
pro-life party,'' said Darla St. Martin, associate executive
director of the National Right to Life Committee. ``And I think
they will continue to be a pro-life party.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who support abortion rights, though, argue that the
party's position hurts its candidates and its image in subtle and
complicated ways. ``It's representative of a number of issues
beyond abortion,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. ``We have to
demonstrate that we're not reflexively ideological. Clearly,
Governor Bush is not.'' She added, ``I would think the logical step
would be to have platform reflect an inclusive tone.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stone said that she told Thompson, in a meeting last week, that
the party needs to ease the fears of Republican abortion rights
supporters who worry about the impact of a Republican Congress and
White House on Supreme Court nominees. While Bush has declined to
embrace an abortion litmus test for judicial appointees, his
support for a platform that includes one is sure to be used against
him this fall, many strategists agree. (Bush has indicated that he
also supports exceptions to a ban on abortion for cases of rape,
incest and when the life of the mother is at stake, although the
platform includes none.)
</P>
<P>
   Stone said that efforts are already under way to influence the
makeup of the platform committee; down the road, abortion rights
supporters also have the option of trying to gather a majority of
six state delegations necessary to suspend the rules and allow a
debate on abortion on the floor of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   For all of that, after eight years out of power, with a nominee
ahead in the polls, no wing of the party may be in the mood for a
messy internal fight. And one Republican strategist, also speaking
on the condition that he not be identified, said that the surest
way to avoid a fight was to leave the abortion language alone.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts, a veteran of the
abortion rights struggle in the Republican Party, said, ``It's a
lose-lose proposition in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, pro-choice Republicans don't really want to
do anything to help the chances of the Democrats in presidential
elections,'' Weld said, ``and to the extent there's a huge buzz on
the issue, it calls attention to the pro-life plank, which is a
distinct negative in the election as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Weld, now practicing law in New York, said
that not changing the platform made it easier for Democrats to
portray the Republicans as ``a monolithic bloc'' on abortion, and
hurt them in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's no clear way out of that box,'' Weld added. &QL;

MARYLAND SCHOOL CHEATING INCIDENT RENEWS CONCERNS ABOUT TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTOMAC, Md. _ Six students here at the highly regarded Potomac
Elementary School, suspicious about the way their fifth-grade state
achievement tests were administered last month, bothered to
complain at home about some odd things they noticed.
</P>
<P>
   They thereby precipitated the resignation of the school
principal, the suspension of a teacher, and the discovery of what
officials describe as substantial evidence of administrative
cheating on a test that lends ranking and, inevitably, cachet to
the best schools across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The test incident catapulted Potomac Elementary, one of the
highest rated schools in the affluent, competitive suburbs of the
Washington Beltway, into the national debate about whether high
intensity standardization tests _ driven by politicians' and
parents' demands for firmer evidence of school improvement _ risks
skewing education as much as helping it. The Potomac setting
differs from most other cheating scandals because the school
already was in the upper echelon of achievement, even as
supervisors pressed for it to do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tests were never designed for setting real estate values
or for politicians to use as a way to lever their campaigns,''
cautioned Jerry D. Weast, the Montgomery County school system
superintendent that is investigating Potomac Elementary. Weast
called for a better understanding that the new tests of school
standards being increasingly employed across the country present a
needed, but limited, tool for curriculum and quality control, one
which can be abused by the simplistic ``public display'' of
relative rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, school ratings remain as feverishly consulted as
tax tables by home buyers looking for strong schools that put their
children on firm university and career tracks. The current
presidential hustings resonates daily with fresh promises of
tougher education standards for voters' children.
</P>
<P>
   Other cheating problems lately include New York City, where 32
schools and dozens of teachers are under investigation, and Houston
and 10 other Texas school districts where evidence surfaced of
patterns of extraordinary test erasures and corrective editing.
Officials at the highly regarded schools in Fairfax County, Va.,
another Washington suburb, are looking into charges of improper
coaching at a middle school by a teacher who allegedly helped his
students compete by availing himself of advance notice of test
questions. Another school, Eastgate Elementary in Columbus, Ohio,
was hit with a scandal about cheating in the fourth grade a few
weeks after President Clinton paid a visit to showcase its progress
in meeting standards.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of achievement testing contend that Potomac and similar
scandals around the nation suggest basic education is being
subsumed by a process of relentless testing and ranking of schools
based on values that veer far from scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are turning into test coaching centers, caught up in
this frenzy of trying to look their best,'' said Monty Neill,
director of FairTest, a private education group in Boston opposed
to SATs and other standardized exams. Neill maintains that these
exams undermine, not bolster, the quality of education in a process
that invites cheating. ``There's no way to tell how much cheating
there actually is, but I get the sense nobody is looking too hard
for abuses,'' he said of the school districts' push to demonstrate
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland education officials said that the Potomac incident is
an aberration in such an affluent district and that the tests, one
of the early drives for credible statewide school standards, have
been well policed. Since the tests introduction in 1991, there have
been perhaps five or six minor complaints a year in the state's
1,400 schools, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel we have politicized education too much,'' said the
education superintendent of Maryland, Nancy S. Grasmick, while
defending the testing as a responsible means for educators to
target problems and tailor remedies. ``The political part of
education today does not offer stability,'' she warned, finding too
many candidates offering voters ``silver bullet'' panaceas for
difficult classroom problems.
</P>
<P>
   Weast concedes Potomac Elementary, ranked first in the prized
Montgomery County system and third in the state, ``has become a
poster child for the testing debate.'' But he said that the
incident, while alarming and deserving thorough investigation,
involves only one or two professionals at a single school in a
system of 9,500 classroom teachers and 189 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the incident is confronting parents and professionals
here with the question of how to best govern the competitive
pressures that modern education puts on teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of balance,'' said Janyce Speier, co-chair of the
Potomac Parent Teachers Association. ``I find teachers are
frustrated with the amount of time they spend on testing and would
rather be with their kids doing other things. I salute
accountability, but maybe you can push that envelope too far.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has sparked concern that ``the battle for performance
dollars between schools finally may have taken their toll,'' as one
resident wrote to the Montgomery Journal. Another complained that
as schools compete head to head through the state's testing of
their students ``the value of their parents' property is tied to
the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   After parents alerted state officials about their children's
testing suspicions, the Potomac principal, Karen Karch, resigned in
the face of allegations that she improperly allowed students extra
time and coached them to change incorrect answers on the state
School Assessment Performance Program. The program is a rigorous
examination series in which third- and fifth-graders are tested
across parts of five school days to produce a composite
understanding of where a school stands in meeting state standards.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   For all its proven record of excellence, Potomac Elementary had
been criticized earlier by district supervisors as failing to
produce its full potential in some areas. The critique is resented
in retrospect by some parents who feel it needlessly compounded the
competitive pressures. But district officials say it was fair
comment within the community's high expectations and the school's
outstanding reputation in pioneering such programs as a Mandarin
Chinese immersion course.
</P>
<P>
   ``My resignation is not an admission of guilt,'' Karch, a
professional of 30 years experience, declared in a parting
statement. ``I exercised poor judgment in some of my decisions,''
she said while declining to answer news media questions in ``a
situation that is already out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   A great deal more than prestige can be riding on the results of
the test competition among schools, from salary rewards to school
favoritism, said Bob Chase, president of the National Education
Association, the 2.5-million member teachers union that is the
largest in the nation. ``If a school doesn't get to a certain point
in the tests the financial rewards might not be there,'' he said,
describing the resultant pressures on teachers and administrators
as unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potomac is not alone in this,'' Chase said. ``The cheating
allegations point to a bigger issue _ to make sure the use and
overuse of testing does not negatively impact something positive
like the standards movement.''
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting the results of the inquiry, the community here
has rallied round its premier school. Parents organized a vote of
confidence for the school staff by having all 634 students bring
bouquets to class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at least it's encouraging that character building is
working at Potomac,'' said a beleaguered parent in praise of the
students who decided they had to speak up.

Legacy to the Underclass.'' (William Morrow and Company. New York):

<P>
   ``In the name of benevolence, the culture of the Haves holds out
a quite separate standard to the worst-off. For itself, some key
bourgeois values _ especially work, career, ambition, striving,
competence and foresight _ remain alive, notwithstanding the Have's
continued fascination with certain yearnings of the counterculture.
What remains of the bourgeois ethic protects the Haves when they
experiment with the self-liberation aspect of the cultural
revolution, but the Have-Nots enjoy no such protection when they
come under the spell of that part of our remade culture. The Haves
may pay a price for experimenting with sexual liberation or drugs
or dropping out (almost always temporarily), but it is usually not
a catastrophic price, nothing like the price the Have-Nots pay in
ruined lives.''

   ``But in the 1960s, attitudes changed. Suddenly it became better
to accept welfare than to take in laundry. Michael Harrington,
author of the popular book ``The Other America,'' complained that
some who were out of work a long time ``would take low-paying
jobs'' and ``accept humiliation rather than go out on the public
dole.'' Until the 1960s, the public dole was humiliation, but
thereafter young men were told that shining shoes was demeaning,
and that accepting government subsidy meant a person ``could at
least keep his dignity.'' This then was the key change of the 1960s
_ not so much new benefit programs as a change in consciousness
concerning established ones, with government officials approving
and even advocating not only larger payouts but a war on shame.''

POLITICAL SIGNS JOIN CULTURAL PRIDE AT PUERTO RICAN DAY PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Politicians and protesters vied for attention at
Sunday's National Puerto Rican Day Parade. But there was no
mistaking what drew the hundreds of thousands who jammed the
sidewalks for a 40-block stretch of Fifth Avenue: a chance for yet
another high-spirited celebration of Puerto Rican culture, music
and ethnic pride.
</P>
<P>
   The parade, traditionally one of the city's largest and most
boisterous, turned the Upper East Side into a undulating sea of
red, white and blue Puerto Rican flags displayed on everything from
T-shirts, to bandannas, to nail polish, necklaces and even
dog-covering capes.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio, New York's candidates for
the U.S. Senate, were there with a long list of other state and
local politicians. Hundreds of marchers and spectators held signs
urging the United States Navy to stop using the Puerto Rican island
of Vieques as a bombing range. Still others rallied in memory of
Pedro Albizu Campos, a figure in Puerto Rico's separatist movement
who called for islanders to start an armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the dancers, the competing salsa and merengue bands
and the floats sponsored by towns and villages from the Caribbean
island that drew the biggest roars from the crowds. So too did the
various tributes to Tito Puente, the Puerto Rican-American jazz
musician who died May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about Puerto Rican people being together, proud of being
Puerto Rican and celebrating our day,'' said Violet Colon, 49, from
the Bronx. ``I am just happy to be here, proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani marched alongside Lazio, who replaced him
last month as the Republican candidate for the Senate. Clinton was
escorted by Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, with whom
she broke into dance at one point, as the two passed a 12-man salsa
band.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Clinton was intensely jeered and booed as she
marched up Fifth Avenue in the Salute to Israel Day Parade, in part
because of her previous support for an independent Palestinian
state. But Sunday, it was Giuliani who drew the heckles and
occasional rude gestures, evidence of his decline in popularity
among the city's Latino population since first being elected mayor
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani seemed impervious to the often bitter response, rushing
back and forth to the sidewalks to greet spectators even when he
was being booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a better reception than I usually get,'' said Giuliani,
a reference to the heckling he had received at recent Puerto Rican
Day parades. ``I think it is wonderful. I think more people
applauded for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton clearly relished the turnaround that a week had brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is democracy in action,'' she said, of the reversal from
last Sunday. ``We are so blessed to live in a country where
everyone is free to express their opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade _ which at times seemed to extend throughout much of
Manhattan, with the streams of cars and motorcycles festooned with
Puerto Rican flags _ illustrated the growing economic force of
Latinos in the United States economy.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, floats sponsored by traditional
Latino-oriented products, like Cafe Bustelo coffee and Corona, the
Mexican beer. But Showtime cable network was also there, promoting
its new television series ``Resurrection Blvd.,'' which features a
Latino family in East Los Angeles. There were also floats sponsored
by several Latino-oriented Internet sites, such as Latino.com and
LaMusica.com, as well as major retailers and consumer product
companies such as Sears and Palmolive.
</P>
<P>
   What most of these and other promotions had in common, though,
was music, pulsating, rhythmic and loud, loud, loud, such as the
Mazola Corn Oil float, which feverishly rocked back and forth to
the tunes of Los Barrio Boyzz, a performance that had the young
girls in the crowd swooning. Actors Jimmy Smits and Rosie Perez
also drew intense cheers, as did boxer Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   The dedication of the parade to Pedro Albizu Campos, the
Harvard-educated lawyer and leader of the Puerto Rican Nationalist
who was imprisoned in the 1950s for trying to overthrow the U.S.
government, drew much less attention than the effort to convince
the government to stopping bombing Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being invade,'' said Brinitte Gonazalez, 30, of the
Bronx, one of many who held a ``Peace for Vieques'' sign. ``It is
our island. I just want them to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even some of the demonstrators acknowledged that the
expression of ethnic pride and celebration of Puerto Rican cultural
that most drew them to the parade Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't come here to start a revolution,'' said Juan
Santiago, 38, of Queens, who carried a flag of Puerto Rico with the
words ``U.S. Navy out of Vieques,'' written on its white band.
``They came here to have a good time.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BOYS OF MIDNIGHT BRING HOME THE CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ They are moving toward Islanders
territory, having roared right through Ranger domain.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Devils were not necessarily going to get their
due merely for winning a second Stanley Cup in six seasons, gained
in the wee small hours of Sunday morning, with millions of
captivated fans and strangers paying rapt attention.
</P>
<P>
   Then at the end, the Devils hoisted above their shaggy, sweaty
heads the grandest sporting trophy in North America, the Stanley
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, the way the Devils did it, struggling in two straight
epic games, one a loss in the third overtime Thursday night and
then the victory on the road, beating the Dallas Stars, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils never wanted to cut it this fine, but what they lost
in suffering they will gain in fame. In two straight gripping
games, they gave viewers compelling overtimes with no commercial
timeouts, gripping back-and-forth hockey that anybody could
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils are now in their own category. If the old Dodgers of
urban Brooklyn were the Boys of Summer (courtesy of the writer
Roger Kahn) and the Islanders of the suburbs were the Boys of
Winter, then the Devils are now the Boys of Midnight.
</P>
<P>
   They flew home Sunday afternoon and deposited the Stanley Cup in
the foyer of their arena, looking surprisingly refreshed for men
who had played a long and terrifying game the night before. They
had come somewhat farther than the distance between Dallas and New
Jersey. They had now traveled into dynasty country.
</P>
<P>
   It is not exactly true that the Devils operate in a vacuum.
Hockey people have known, even before that 1995 Stanley Cup, that
Lou Lamoriello runs a good ship _ a little secretive, a little
frugal, a little tense, but a sound ship nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello was not afraid to ship out players who did not want
to play at his prices, but he knew enough to recognize keepers _
Ken Daneyko, Martin Brodeur, Scott Stevens, the backbone.
</P>
<P>
   The real insult for the Devils, just as it was for the
Islanders, has been the anonymity conferred on them by playing in
the suburbs. The Islanders won four straight Stanley Cups from 1980
through 1983, one of the best New York teams ever for character and
skill, but they never knew the thrill of riding through the Wall
Street canyons and hearing the roars. When they won, it was
Hempstead Turnpike and a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won one stinking Stanley Cup in 1994 and the
celebration was so great you would have thought somebody had
finally fixed all the broken parking meters.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had the mystique and the Islanders had their Stanley
Cups, but all the Devils had was the Mickey Mouse label hung on
them by that raging motormouth of controversy, Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   They can hang up the mouse ears permanently. What with free
agency and international scouting, it is harder than ever to put up
a hockey dynasty. All of us of a certain age lament when the
Montreal Canadiens were automatic finalists, but it's not going to
happen anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says the first cup is the most difficult _ and it is,
until you do it,'' Lamoriello said. ``But I say the second one is
more difficult because you are expected to win every year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night the Devils wanted to clinch at home for their
loyal fans with red-and-black draped and slathered all over them,
but the Devils frittered away a third-period power play and
ultimately lost at 46 minutes 21 seconds of overtime. They were not
the resourceful Islanders, not that night.
</P>
<P>
   However, on Saturday night, fighting to avoid a seventh game,
the Devils came up with their own heroes, their own images. There
was Jason Arnott, playing the role of Bob Nystrom (the Islanders'
overtime hero of the first cup), scoring the winning goal at 8:21
of the fifth period. And there was Larry Robinson, the stalwart
Hall of Fame defender, now the coach, pulling on the No. 17 jersey
of his wounded forward, Petr Sykora, during the celebration on the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   These images, flickering in dens and bedrooms and bars wherever
hockey is shown, propelled these Devils into a higher league. Even
the dour Lamoriello had a sense that his competent franchise had
touched some nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it's been done,'' he said Sunday, back home. ``The
interest of the people. It's been tremendous for hockey, and great
for our area.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to go on the road and take the Stanley Cup away from
the defending champions is just great,'' said Lamoriello, who is
not prone to gush. ``It was a great battle, and it could have gone
either way.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised Robinson, who replaced the high-strung Robbie Ftorek
with eight games left in the regular season, and he praised his
young players, but mostly he praised the nine players who remain
from that 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very seldom do you see so many players stay around that
long,'' Lamoriello said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the public has put a face next to the name. Daneyko's
battered mug. Stevens' gunfighter eyes. Brodeur's smile. Bobby
Holik's intensity. And the nastiness of Claude Lemieux, digging in
his skates, sending a shower of ice chips into the opposing
goalie's mask just for the meanness of it.
</P>
<P>
   These guys were slow to captivate the area, almost never selling
out a game, but they have gotten everybody's attention with those
extra periods, those bonus hours, those Peril-of-Pauline stands in
the goalmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Now the team is being sold by John McMullen to a chap named
Steinbrenner, who is known for rebuilding the Yankees. The new
owner may want to remember that the Devils are Stanley Cup
champions, with a whole new cadre of fans who can only hope he does
not mess up what has been handed to him, a contemporary dynasty of
sorts, the Boys of Midnight. &QL;

BRITISH POLICY DERAILS DIAMOND MINING STOCK LISTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A diamond-mining company with close ties to the
governments of Congo and Zimbabwe may be thwarted in an effort to
trade on the London Stock Exchange after reports of British
government opposition to its plans, executives close to the company
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Oryx Diamonds Ltd., registered in the Cayman Islands, had
planned to seek a listing on the Alternative Investment Market,
which is part of the London exchange, on Tuesday. The company is
the result of a $75 million merger between Oryx Natural Resources
and Petra Diamonds Ltd., a South African company that already
trades on the same market.
</P>
<P>
   The planned listing on the London exchange has generated
increasing public debate since the company said it intended to
exploit a $1 billion diamond concession granted to it by a Congo
government decree at a time when the British government is
campaigning to halt the trade in so-called conflict diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey White, Oryx's deputy managing director, said that,
despite the debate surrounding the company's plans, he and other
executives thought their attempt to list shares on the London
exchange was proceeding on track until soon after markets closed on
Friday. At that time, trading in Petra Diamonds was formally
suspended in accordance with merger rules and its new listing as
Oryx Diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, however, White said in a telephone interview,
Oryx's advisers, the British accounting company Grant Thornton,
informed the company that it had unspecified concerns about the
deal and would resign if shareholders approved it at a meeting
scheduled on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White said that, without a nominated adviser, the company would
not be permitted under stock market rules to list under its new
name and resume trading.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know what was behind the company's change of
plan and declined to comment on British newspaper reports Sunday
that the British Foreign Office _ which is leading the government's
campaign against ``blood diamonds'' used to prolong African wars _
had put pressure on the advisers. Grant Thornton executives were
not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   White said Oryx planned to proceed with its shareholders'
meeting on Monday and would press Grant Thornton to explain its
apparent shift at that gathering.
</P>
<P>
   While Oryx denies that its concession is in a war zone, it has
acknowledged that the diamond field, south of the diamond-mining
center of Mbuji-Mayi, is guarded by some of the 11,000 Zimbabwean
troops who have been in the Congo since 1998 supporting President
Laurent Kabila against rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has forced one nonexecutive director, Moses Anafu, to
quit a high-ranking job with the 54-nation Commonwealth after his
involvement with Oryx was publicized. At the time, Anafu was
leading a Commonwealth delegation to Zimbabwe, where senior
government and military officials are linked to Oryx through at
least two Zimbabwe-registered companies, according to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Another nonexecutive director of Oryx, Frances Cook, is a former
United States ambassador to Oman, where many of Oryx's managers,
including its chief executive, are based. She has said repeatedly
that she regards Oryx as a commercial venture that will benefit
Africans in the concession area. Oryx says she will be entitled to
a $100,000 annual fee plus stock options.

   GHAJAR, Golan Heights _ Carrying black flags and a
flower-wreathed portrait of Hafez Assad, the people of this border
village held a memorial ceremony Sunday for the leader of the
country they call their own.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers, members of Assad's minority Alawite sect, chanted
and wept in a demonstration of loyalty to Syria that was repeated
Sunday in the neighboring Druse villages of the Golan Heights,
which was captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war.
</P>
<P>
   In Majdal Shams, the largest village of Druse, a separate sect,
hundreds gathered in the main square under Syrian flags to hear
eulogies and poems of tribute, marching to a border fence to send
condolences into Syria over a sound truck.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ceremony here in Ghajar had a peculiar twist, befitting
a village in limbo at the junction of Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   After Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon last month, United
Nations teams surveying the border determined that according to the
line drawn in the 1920s, part of Ghajar actually lies in Lebanon,
not the Israeli-held Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that a border fence could soon divide families and
separate people from their farmlands, village residents have
barricaded entrances to Ghajar with burning tires and are standing
guard armed with clubs to repel any United Nations teams that might
come to mark the border.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts have been posted to summon the 1,700 residents to the
streets if United Nations vehicles are spotted nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The village will be divided over our dead bodies,'' said Imad
Khatib, 35, a teacher. ``Without our lands we will be refugees.
This is inhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said they were simply marking the border and will
not build a fence. They stopped short of entering Ghajar, surveying
the village by helicopter, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   The village's residents insist that for generations they have
been considered Syrian, not Lebanese, with Syrian identification
papers and property deeds _ a message that was hammered home Sunday
by the memorial ceremony for Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Ghajar are Syrian, and this is Syrian soil,'' said
Salman Khatib, the leader of the local council. He stood in the
village square, near an outlook over the Hasbani River that was
decorated Sunday with a likeness of Assad and a Syrian flag.
</P>
<P>
   Village residents said that in June 1967, when Israel captured
the Golan Heights, its troops stopped short of Ghajar, considering
it Lebanese territory. But the Lebanese authorities, reluctant to
absorb an Alawite community into a land already divided by
religious strife, told a delegation from Ghajar that their village
was part of Syria and warned the group that if villagers crossed
the Hasbani River into Lebanon, they would be shot or jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Residents then invited Israeli forces to take the village with
the rest of the Golan, and the villagers were granted Israeli
citizenship in the 1980s. Many now work in neighboring Israeli
communities and speak fluent Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   Matan Vilnai, an Israeli cabinet minister, visited Ghajar last
week to calm residents' fears, telling them that his government was
in contact with the United Nations and would work to ensure that
the village remained undivided under Israeli control. An Israeli
army vehicle patrolled the village Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Israeli assurance, worried village residents said
Sunday that they wanted to avoid partition at all costs, even if
that meant coming entirely under Lebanese control. A fence, they
said, is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we stay together or we will all die,'' said Mahmud
Khatib, 40, a factory worker who stood guard with a club Sunday at
the village entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Kamal Asad, 36, who also held a club, said: ``We didn't choose
this situation. We've simply stuck to our land. The Berlin wall
came down after 30 years, and it can't be that in the year 2000 we
will be divided by a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a herd of cows that can be split up. We're talking
about human beings. The United Nations is supposed to unite people,
not cut us in two. It should make peace, not pain. This is not
political. We only want to live in dignity.''

BRODEUR ALSO CELEBRATES A STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ An hour earlier, Commissioner Gary Bettman had handed
the Stanley Cup to the Devils, winners over the Dallas Stars in two
overtime periods.
</P>
<P>
   Now Martin Brodeur had plunged into a chair in front of his
locker in the visitor's dressing room and had taken a deep breath.
He had a victory cigar in his left hand and his right arm wrapped
around his wife, Melanie.
</P>
<P>
   The goaltender whom some call the franchise had won his second
Stanley Cup in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some bumps along the way, but I'm so happy it's
over and I'm glad we're on the good side of it,'' Brodeur said.
``It was a great feeling that it took us five years to get back to
where we were supposed to be. Winning the cup every five years is
not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few uninspiring moments, Brodeur was simply
brilliant in the playoffs, especially in the finals against Dallas.
Some thought that Brodeur, along with Jason Arnott, was as
deserving the Conn Smythe trophy, which goes to the most valuable
player in the tournament, as much Scott Stevens, the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur was so brilliant in the last four games _ the last two
in overtime _ against Dallas that he allowed only four goals while
facing 112 shots. His goaltending duel with Ed Belfour in Game 5,
which went into triple overtime, will go down as one of the best in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   With his 16 victories in the Stanley Cup playoffs, Brodeur tied
the record Philadelphia's Bernie Parent set in 1973-74 for most
victories in a season with 59.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost as happy about that accomplishment as winning the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a statistic I will treasure,'' Brodeur said. ``You've
to to play a lot of games. It took me a lot of games to get to that
and number and I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur played 72 games in the regular season, winning 43. He
played every minute in 23 playoff games and got his 16th victory
with a brilliant performance in Game 6. He also erased the stigma
of having previously lost all of his overtime playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing I didn't see it,'' Brodeur said of his 0-7
record, which was often flashed on television screens. ``I knew
about it, though, and I wanted to get it over with,'' he said.
``This is a great way to end it, by winning the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur also played well in the sweep of Florida in the first
round and the elimination of Toronto in the second round, but he
struggled in the Eastern Conference finals against Philadelphia,
when the Devils rallied from being down by three games to one.
</P>
<P>
   SYKORA RETURNS WITH TEAM
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora came home with the team Sunday, after spending the
night in the hospital and recovering from a harrowing hit by Derian
Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, Hatcher checked Sykora with so much
ferocity that the Czech forward lay on the ice motionless for
several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart went out for him,'' said Jason Arnott, who scored the
game-winner in overtime. The players later brought the cup to
Sykora's room at Baylor University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora underwent a CAT scan that proved normal Saturday night,
but he was kept overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   After another CAT scan Sunday morning, Sykora was released and
allowed to travel to New Jersey with the team.
</P>
<P>
   After a charter flight to Teterboro Airport, the Devils went to
their Continental Arena offices Sunday afternoon to show the
Stanley Cup to family, friends and front-office personnel who did
not make the trip to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   LAMORIELLO QUIET ON FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' president and general manager,
refused to answer specific questions about his future with the
team, which has been sold by John McMullen to YankeeNets for $175
million _ plus a $1 million bonus for winning the cup _ but he made
it clear he would stay with the team through the entry draft later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The YankeeNets will officially take over the team on July 12 and
that group has expressed willingness to keep Lamoriello.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not decided whose names would appear on the
Stanley Cup. He did say that Robbie Ftorek, who was replaced as
coach with eight games left in the regular season, was part of the
team and he deserved some praise. &QL;

which Bush said he read before he first ran for governor, is an
indictment of the attitudes of the 1960s counterculture and its
legacy to the poor. In fact, well before Bush burst on the national
political scene, a loose-knit cadre of thinkers on the right were
trying to come up with a less libertarian form of conservatism that

suspension of a teacher, and the discovery of what officials
describe as substantial evidence of administrative cheating on a
test that lends ranking and, inevitably, cachet to the best schools
across the state. The test incident has made Potomac Elementary a
new focus in the national debate about whether high intensity
standardization tests risk skewing education as much as helping it.

AMERICANS LOOK NORTH AS ENERGY PRICES SOAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Alberta, Mass., Maine, N.Y.)   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ As this summer's driving and air-conditioning
season unfolds, Americans may watch gasoline meters spin and
utility bills soar and be tempted to think bad thoughts about
energy princes in faraway Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the ditty dictates, why not blame Canada? Or, more
precisely, blame Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   With the deferential surreptitiousness that some Americans now
associate with their northern neighbor, Canada in the last decade
nearly doubled its oil exports and nearly tripled its natural gas
exports to the United States. Now Canada is definitively emerging
as the No. 1 energy supplier to the United States, the world's
largest energy importer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is the largest total energy supplier to the United
States, greater than Saudi Arabia, Venezuela or Mexico,'' Gordon
Giffin, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, said here recently in a
speech to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, an
industry group. The ambassador diplomatically did not note that oil
and gas imports this year account for a big part of the rising U.S.
trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   With oil and natural gas prices doubling over the last year,
there are no apologies for $30 barrels of oil here in Alberta,
Canada's largest oil and gas producing province.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, this city, Canada's energy capital, is now
welcoming the World Petroleum Congress, a 54-nation association of
oil producing and consuming countries that is a forum for industry
leaders and energy technology experts. The five-day affair is
drawing 3,000 delegates and journalists, as well as protesters
against global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically our turn; commodity prices have been down for a
long time now,'' said J.C. Anderson, chief executive of Anderson
Exploration Ltd., a major gas producer. His voice carries not a
hint of apology, and his rural Nebraska twang reflects the new,
almost seamless North American energy market. ``This business has
become a continental game. That border is kaput,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, low prices depressed the profitability and
value of investments in Canada's oil patch. But in a radical
turnaround in the first quarter of this year, profits for Canada's
six largest oil and gas producers leaped 130-fold, hitting nearly
$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the oil and gas prices that are posted daily on front pages
here expected to remain strong through the winter, North America's
energy industry is slowly moving out of the shadow of the dot-com
high-technology economy. As investors rediscover that the Western
world still moves on oil and gas, takeover frenzy has swept this
city of corporate headquarters. In one week alone in April, there
were three takeover bids for energy companies here. With the United
States' capital markets about 40 times the size of Canada's, the
United States is pumping billions of new dollars into Canada's
energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   In Alberta, the highest natural gas prices in memory are helping
gas dethrone oil as the top fuel for exploration, production and
provincial royalty revenue.
</P>
<P>
   While oil is shuttled around the world in ships, natural gas
remains a ``terrestrial commodity,'' economically transported by
pipeline. A clean-burning fuel that produces less carbon dioxide
than coal or oil, natural gas is making Americans look north with
new respect.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly the fuel of choice for heating American homes,
natural gas is also the preferred fuel for electricity generation
instead of coal and nuclear power. Long bottled up here, Alberta
natural gas now flows through four new pipelines into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to the end of that pipe, and it's the Brooklyn Navy
Yard,'' said Ralph Klein, Alberta's premier, whose government now
earns three times as much from natural gas royalties as from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a Con Edison gas-fueled electricity generating
plant, he added: ``Unbeknownst to most New Yorkers, New York is lit
up with Alberta natural gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Over this decade, American consumption of natural gas is
expected to increase by about 50 percent, to 33 trillion cubic feet
a year. For electricity generation alone, it is expected to double.
The hitch is that American natural gas production has declined by
about 5 percent since 1998. To the south, Mexico's state oil
company, Pemex, barely satisfies growing local use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be so tight on natural gas this summer that
people are going to say, `What are we going to do?''' said Thomas
A. Petrie, a Denver-based investment banker in the energy field.
``It's going to create a scramble for gas projects. We are going to
look all over the lower 48, but the big projects are going to be in
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Anderson put it from his corner office in a
steel-and-glass tower here: ``We are going to have to drill the
pants off this basin. Then, we are going to have to go north.''
</P>
<P>
   American demand is growing so steadily that even if Canada's gas
exports increase 50 percent this decade, as forecast, Canada will
only be pacing American growth. And, even though the number of
exploration rigs in Alberta is jumping 50 percent this year,
geologists say that, after half a century of pumping from the Rocky
Mountain foothills, there is no more low-hanging fruit. The future
of North American gas production now lies in Canada's geographic
and climactic extremes.

 CALGARY, Alberta: climactic extremes.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the East Coast, North Atlantic developments off Nova Scotia
and Newfoundland are turning the Maritime provinces into a major
oil and gas producing area. The United States is the sole export
market.
</P>
<P>
   The region's first major oil project, Newfoundland's Hibernia,
started production in November 1997. This May, Exxon Mobil
announced plans to increase production by 30 percent this year, to
65 million barrels a day. The province's second large project,
Terra Nova, is to begin production early next year. With four other
oil projects in the planning stage, a recent government study
increased Newfoundland's offshore oil reserves by almost a third,
to 2.1 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Off the coast of Nova Scotia, Sable Offshore Energy Inc., which
was started in January to pump natural gas to New England, is
bringing the first piped gas to Maine in a pipeline that goes to
Boston. In addition, gas companies are spending $400 million more
to explore offshore tracts around the Sable development.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Canada's West, the energy action is moving north.
</P>
<P>
   While Alberta's oil production dropped 6 percent last year, it
is expected to rebound in coming years as $25 billion worth of
investments in northern Alberta's oil sands starts to pay off.
These reserves of thick oil, estimated in size to rival those of
Saudi Arabia, were largely untouched. But new technologies,
including some that use steam and hot water, now render about 15
percent of the deposits _ 5 billion barrels _ recoverable at a cost
of $10 or less a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Over this decade, the oil sands portion of Canada's oil
production is expected to double, hitting 50 percent by 2005. In
Fort McMurray, the northern Alberta epicenter of oil sands mining,
there is such a labor shortage that doughnut shops and fast-food
shops have had to cut back service until new workers can be brought
up from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Oil sands and North Atlantic production will allow Canada to
increase its oil exports to the United States by about 50 percent
over this decade. With this increase, Canada will probably surpass
Venezuela to become the United States' most important source of
imported oil. This expansion takes place in an international
economy where low oil prices have allowed world oil consumption to
double since 1970, approaching 80 million barrels a day by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, I saw a stretched-out Humvee in New York; the week
before I saw a Range Rover without a speck of mud driving around
London,'' said Martin P. Molyneaux, managing director for research
at First Energy Capital, an oil and gas brokerage firm based in
Calgary. ``Consumption per vehicle is high. World consumption keeps
going northward.''
</P>
<P>
   On the natural gas front, growing American demand and higher
prices are pushing Canada's production frontier north of the Arctic
Circle. For years, bad economics, local American Indian reluctance,
and environmental opposition blocked development of massive
reserves in the Mackenzie River delta and Beaufort Sea area. The
deposits, some of the largest in the world, were only viable for
development when natural gas prices surpassed $2.50 per million
British thermal units. But now with North American gas prices
hovering around $4, everyone here is looking north.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, nobody was talking about the far north,'' said
Pierre R. Alvarez, president of the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers. ``But now the price has moved substantially,
and people are working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gas developers are drawing maps for multibillion-dollar
pipelines, negotiating with local Indians for participation and
discussing environmental safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are the largest known natural gas reserves in North
America below the Beaufort Sea. The Mackenzie Delta area is
believed to hold 9 trillion cubic feet of gas, roughly equal to the
gas reserves off the coast of Nova Scotia. To the west of the
Mackenzie, Alaska's Prudhoe Bay is believed to hold 25 trillion to
30 trillion cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   One proposed 5,000-mile pipeline would run from Prudhoe Bay,
potentially underwater to minimize environmental impacts, then
south along the Mackenzie River into Northern Alberta to connect
with pipelines to the United States. Unlike oil, natural gas is
easier to pump cold.
</P>
<P>
   This line could carry 3.5 billion cubic feet of American and
Canadian gas, a 40 percent jump over Canada's current export level
to the United States. This October, when the $3 billion Alliance
pipeline opens from here to Chicago, Western Canada will have
excess pipeline capacity into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Energy experts believe consumer pressure will prevail over any
environmentalist opposition, and that Canada's Arctic will be
opened to gas production by the end of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. and Canadian utilities are running scared now, almost
everybody has overestimated supply and underestimated demand,''
Molyneaux, the energy analyst, said. He noted that in the last five
years 75 percent of new electricity generation in the United States
went to natural gas. ``If your energy bills go up by 30 percent,
you are not going to be happy about it,'' he added.

U.S. LAYS OUT LIKELY EFFECTS OF RISING TEMPERATURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Texas., Calif., Ga., Ark., N.C.)   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A warming of the global climate is likely to have substantial
consequences _ for better and worse _ around the United States in
coming decades, including bumper crops in the heartland and chronic
erosion of coasts, summer water shortages and winter floods in the
West, and a future New York City that steams in summer like
present-day Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   These are a few of the predictions made in the first thorough
federal assessment of the possible effects on the country, region
by region, of a warming trend that many scientists expect will
characterize coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, mainstream scientists are concluding that a
buildup in the atmosphere of heat-trapping gases like carbon
dioxide has contributed to a warming seen in the last 100 years,
and they say the trend is likely to carry well into the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the growth in these so-called greenhouse gases,
scientists say, is caused by the burning of fossil fuels,
destruction of forests, and other human activities.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures nationwide rose about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the
20th century, and the report estimated the potential effects of
further warming by using a ``business as usual'' assumption, in
which carbon dioxide levels continue to grow at the rate seen in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   At this pace, the average temperature in the country would rise
5 to 10 degrees in the next century, although the authors stressed
that this was only one possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which is to be released Monday by the Clinton
administration for 60 days of public review, was ordered by
Congress in 1990 to help lawmakers identify vulnerabilities and
potential benefits of the warming trend. But it only kicked into
high gear three years ago, when computer models grew sophisticated
enough to analyze links between the atmosphere and oceans and local
systems like crops and forests.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment consists of dense technical analyses of the
effect of a warmer world on forestry, fresh water, farming, coasts,
and human health and a 145-page summary. The report is to be made
available on the Web at www.nacc.usgcrp.gov/.
</P>
<P>
   It forecasts some profound changes and suggests that many
regions of will see conditions shift to those of their present-day
neighbors to the South.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, rising stream
temperatures are very likely to harm migrating salmon, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, less snow in winter will very likely lead to less
runoff from melting snow in the late spring, reducing water
supplies during the summer growing season. The Southwest would see
rising precipitation that could cause shrubby forests to overtake
desert landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The study says one of the most likely of all consequences from a
continued warming will be coastal erosion and destructive storm
surges as sea level steadily rises.
</P>
<P>
   In eastern cities, the summer heat index, combining humidity and
temperature, is likely to rise, so that as New York City takes on
Southern steaminess, Atlanta will see hot spells more typical of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest benefits are likely to come from the positive effect
of rising carbon dioxide concentrations on plants, which rely on
the gas for photosynthesis. Using linked computer models of
climate, crops, and forest health, the study found that the country
as a whole could see rising yields and falling prices for food and
timber.
</P>
<P>
   The falling prices would be good for consumers but could hurt
some timber companies and farmers as already-tenuous profit margins
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists who conducted the study cautioned that the
benefits would not be uniform. For example, while farmers in the
northern plains could see gains, those in southern states could see
losses because of increased risk of droughts and damaging floods as
more rain fell in drenching downpours.
</P>
<P>
   The good news should be tempered, too, because the study did not
calculate possible agricultural losses because of flourishing weeds
or migrating insect pests, its authors said.
</P>
<P>
   And the composition of wild forests is likely to change, with
some species that are considered hallmarks of particular regions
disappearing. For example, the sugar maple, the official tree of
New York State and an important species for tourists and maple
sugar harvesters, is likely to vanish from all but the most
northern parts of the state as its preferred colder climatic zone
moves north.
</P>
<P>
   The warming is likely to keep shipping lanes in Alaska and the
Great Lakes free of ice for longer periods, easing the movement of
oil and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   But other effects could negate any savings, the study concluded.
Water levels in the Great Lakes are expected to drop, increasing
the need for costly dredging of channels.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, the effects of the warming are already being felt and
are requiring costly adjustments, with roads and air strips
requiring constant repair as underlying permafrost thaws and
buckles, scientists said. Native Alaskans, who rely on ice-dwelling
seals for food, are finding it harder and harder to hunt, said
Gunter Weller, a climatologist at the University of Alaska,
Fairbanks, who is participating in the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the native community or the oil industry or the fishing
industry, this is no longer some nebulous global thing coming in
100 years,'' Dr. Weller said. ``These are real things in real time
that are really occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from dozens of government agencies, universities,
private groups, and industries conducted the studies and more than
300 independent reviewers offered comments, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   As the overview moved from early to final drafts in the last few
months, the politics of climate intruded, with intense tugs of war
being felt by some scientists involved in the work over how to word
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in recent weeks the emphasis changed, participants said,
with the focus shifting somewhat toward the positive consequences
for agriculture, for example.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also, the 145-page overview was released even though not all the
underlying regional studies are not yet complete _ a decision that
drew criticism from scientists from both ends of the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been pressure all along that the synthesis had to come
out first because of the election,'' said a scientist who shares
the Clinton administration position that global warming is a
serious problem, but who is still involved in the report and thus
spoke only on condition of anonymity. ``It's unfortunate, because
the whole process would have been stronger if you did it the right
way. Then the critics wouldn't have anything to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, officials at the White House said the summary
was being released ahead of time only because the final work on
some of the underlying studies had been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the issue of timing, a variety of experts involved in
preparing the document _ including people from industry and
advocacy groups _ say it represents a real consensus, and that its
findings are significant.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. Cecich, vice president for environmental safety at the
drug company Glaxo Wellcome and a member of the team that wrote the
national overview, called the report a first look at a dizzyingly
complicated system. He said that everyone involved tried to filter
out politics and preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a fair and open and scientifically valid
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, many scientists said, the effort _ if continued
and refined - could offer the first opportunity for the country to
incorporate long-term climate projections into its planning for
everything from bridge building to crop planting.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that society, for the most part, will most
likely be able to adapt to many of the coming shifts, but that some
natural systems _ alpine meadows, coral reefs, mangrove swamps and
the like _ will be damaged or disappear because they are either
hemmed in by man-made structures or geography or simply cannot keep
pace with the rate of temperature change.
</P>
<P>
   The authors stressed that the future described in the study _
like the visions of Scrooge's future in ``A Christmas Carol'' -
mainly represent developments that may be, not things that must be.
</P>
<P>
   And there will always be surprises, said Dr. Thomas R. Karl, one
of the three principal authors of the overview and the director of
the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. ``There are a
lot of uncertainties with respect to interactions between natural
systems, human systems, and climate,'' Karl said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the surprises are good news, he said, that does not mean
humans will be able to exploit them. ``Usually, if something is not
anticipated, you can't take advantage of it,'' he said.

RAPID ELEVATION OF LATE SYRIAN LEADER'S SON POINTS TO SMOOTH
TRANSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ The party and nation that Hafez Assad ruled for 30
years until his death this weekend moved swiftly to anoint his son,
Bashar, as Syria's new president on Sunday, raising hopes that at
least the nominal trappings of power in the highly militarized
state may pass peacefully to a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of weeping Syrians took to the streets of Damascus,
shouting their grief over the death of Assad and their devotion to
his son, a reserved 34-year-old eye doctor who inherits an insular
nation still at war with Israel, in control of the government and
militant groups in Lebanon, and struggling to find its place in a
region that has passed it by economically.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, Syria and Bashar only,'' people chanted as they marched
through the capital, which was patrolled by squadrons of uniformed
security officers. Public gatherings are usually not permitted in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Cementing his claim to his father's job, Bashar Assad secured a
number of new titles and positions Sunday. Abdel-Halim Khaddam, one
of Syria's two vice presidents, who are nominally running the
country now, named him the country's armed forces commander, at the
same time promoting him from colonel to lieutenant-general.
</P>
<P>
   And the governing body of the ruling Ba'ath Party nominated him
for the presidency. The nomination must be endorsed by Parliament,
which must also set a date for a referendum to confirm the choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament has already amended the country's constitution to
reduce the minimum age for a president to 34 from 40, briskly
eliminating a legal obstacle to his ascension.
</P>
<P>
   A relative neophyte who held no official position in the
government or the party while his father was alive, Bashar Assad is
unlikely to command anything close to the absolute authority of the
deceased ruler. The uncertainty caused by the death of his father
has rippled beneath statements of support issued by Mideast
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the new titles and positions give the younger Assad a strong
measure of public legitimacy by propelling him to the top of
Syria's tight and secretive military and political hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, since the death of his older brother
Basil, he had been assiduously but quietly groomed for succession.
He has steadily advanced in military rank and acted as his father's
liaison to Lebanon, the client state that Syria runs politically
and militarily.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the state-controlled press credited him with
helping choose a younger and supposedly more progressive set of
ministers and with managing a major anti-corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
   The purge targeted some of the old guard in the government and
in the security services who might have been expected to resist
automatically transferring their loyalty from the father to the
son. The most recent victim was Hikmat Shehabi, the former chief of
the Syrian army and one-time member of Syria's negotiating team
with Israel. Shehabi was reported to have fled Syria last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been difficult for him to ascend among the
generation of his father's age,'' said Joseph Samaha, a political
analyst with the pan-Arab daily newspaper Al-Hayat. ``The old
guard, many of whom retired due to age or for other reasons, would
have had a hard time communicating with and taking orders from
Bashar.''
</P>
<P>
   The loyalty of a group of middle-aged officers and party
officials who have coalesced around him remains to be tested. But
the endorsements he has amassed less than 48 hours after his
father's death virtually assure him at least of the presidency,
barring any attempt by disgruntled army officers or displaced party
officials to seize power in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Syrian authorities, meanwhile, were completing plans for a
funeral on Tuesday for the former president, who ruled Syria
through two major Arab-Israeli wars. He died at the age of 69 on
Saturday, apparently of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for a procession of the body through Damascus and a
formal ceremony in the capital. The body will then be transported
to the small hilltop village of Qardaha, Assad's once impoverished
hometown, for burial near the tombs of his mother and his eldest
son, Basil.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have indicated they will attend are the heads of
state of most Arab countries; Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami;
the vice-president of Iraq, which was considered an enemy of Syria
during Hafez Assad's reign; and the French president, Jacques
Chirac, the only Western head of state who plans to be present.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will represent the United
States, which has had an ambiguous relationship to Syria in the
past few decades. While under Assad, Syria joined the anti-Iraq
coalition in the Gulf War. But it has for over two decades also
been considered by the State Department to be a sponsor of world
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The younger Assad inherits the foreign policy issues that
occupied his father, but may not have the same freedom to strike a
deal with Israel. He has also been left an unsettled situation in
Lebanon, where the recent abrupt Israeli withdrawal put pressure on
Syria to rein in the militias that it had supported in the formerly
occupied zone in the south.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to political sources in Lebanon, he will probably rely
for advice on the peace process and internal security on some of
his father's confidantes, like Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara, as
well as a group of about six army and intelligence officers whose
power has increased with the recent purge and forced retirement of
many of the more senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advisers to Assad are his brother-in-law Asef Shoukat,
Hassan Khalil, Hashem Bakhtiar, Iyad Mahmoud and Asef el-Hakim _
all brigadier-generals or generals.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the lack of open opposition to Bashar
Assad's ascension was seen as a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the initial signs that we have seen
suggest that there is a very smooth transition process underway,''
said Dennis Ross, President Clinton's special envoy for the Middle
East, in an interview on ABC. ``I would expect that we will see
that go forward. We'll be able to make a judgment, but on the
whole, it seems to me that the structure that is being put in place
is a structure that suggests that the transition will be smooth.''

CORA MAY BE SPARED TRIP TO MINORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers may have a way to solve their roster
crunch problems, at least for the short-term, without sending
promising young shortstop Alex Cora back to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   It centers around the improving health of Todd Hollandsworth.
Before the weekend, it appeared bleak Hollandsworth would return
for the Arizona series, but after a pair of very good recovery days
the outfielder believes he can return from his pulled right
hamstring Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Hollandsworth can return in the next few days, it changes the
Dodgers' thinking, a club official said. They're operating with
four healthy outfielders, and Hollandsworth's return would afford
the Dodgers the opportunity to send Shawn Gilbert back to Triple-A
Albuquerque when third baseman Adrian Beltre is activated, allowing
the Dodgers to remain with four outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre said his healing curve is leveling off, and he's hoping
for a mid-week activation from the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frustrated, but it's not like I feel better than
(Saturday), or the day before,'' said Beltre, who pulled his right
hamstring. ``It'staking a little longer.''The Dodgers want to keep
Cora around because he's playing so well. He had one hit against
the A's, is batting .309 and playing very well defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more prepared,'' Cora said. ``When I got sent down (May
20), Ifeel I gained the respect of my peers and teammates and the
repsect of the organization. I'm going to keep that. I'm not here
to be a band-aid.I'm here to do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are also expected to recall right-hander Orel
Hershiser from the minors during the Arizona series and place him
in the bullpen. Forgotten lefty Onan Masaoka, who threw two innings
in his first outing since June 3 Sunday against Oakland, could be
headed for Triple-A Albuquerque for the third time this season to
make room for Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the rumblings surrounding Hershiser and his future
with the Dodgers, club officials are deadset with keeping him
around because of the impending suspensions. The cases will be
heard June 20-22 in Houston. Though appeals are in for everyone,
Chan Ho Park, Darren Dreifort and Eric Gagne are each slated to
serve three-game suspensions and Carlos Perez has a five-game
suspension hovering above him.
</P>
<P>
   Looking left: When the Dodgers were swept three games in Arizona
in May, the lack of a left-hander in the bullpen was an enormous
issue since the Diamondbacks lineup is filled with left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   In a 15-7 loss, manager Davey Johnson didn't have a lefty to
pitch in long relief and keep the score close. In the next two
games, the Dodgers were either tied or leading late only to watch
the right-handed bullpen eventually lose it. The bullpen was 0-2
with an 18.00 ERA in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Dodgers, Arizona left-handers feasted. Steve Finley
(5 for 13), Luis Gonzalez (7 for 13), Travis Lee (5 for 9) and Tony
Womack (5 for 17) hit a combined .423 with three homers, 16 RBI and
15 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dodgers didn't have right-hander Mike Fetters, who
is veryeffective against lefties, in that series. His availability
this time around, along with little-used lefty Onan Masaoka, could
help the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason I went on the disabled list, because
watching that series , we were undermanned,'' said Fetters, who's
allowed one hit in 22 at-bats against lefties. ``Because I can get
lefties out, Davey was probably pulling his hair out because he
couldn't use me.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Right-hander Gregg Olson will throw another
bullpen session today and is hoping to go on a rehab assignment
later this week. ...The Dodgers will pass the one million mark in
attendance today. After 38,733 attended Sunday's series finale with
Oakland, the season's attendance mark was 997,439.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ Some time when Sebatu Gebre Yesus was
young _ he cannot remember when _ he began collecting things. This
is unusual for at least two reasons. First, not many Ethiopians are
collectors. At 79, he claims to be the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he is a collector who makes no distinction between the
priceless and the trashy. A pair of Baccarat chandeliers from the
palace of Emperor Haile Selassie sit not far from a souvenir
thermometer larded with a fat Napoleon. Bronzes from Benin, worth a
small fortune, are near a bongo with a split drumhead. He owns a
Monet, along with bizarre portraits of unknown children. He will
take orphaned runt or purebred, and love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Favorites?'' asks Gebre Yesus, a trim man with a white goatee
and a neat gray suit that has three buttons. ``No difference to me.
I respect them all as good friends. But no preferences, like with
my children.''
</P>
<P>
   This makes a tour though Gebre Yesus' new museum _ opened to the
public in May after a lifetime in the making _ an eclectic
experience.
</P>
<P>
   It is apparently the only private collection in Ethiopia open to
the public, and if it were only a collection of Gebre Yesus'
fancies it would still be an interesting, certainly idiosyncratic,
addition to Ethiopia's heritage. (The steps leading to the museum,
for instance, are decorated with six bombs _ dressed up as planters
_ from the struggle with the Italians.)
</P>
<P>
   But the place has an emotional center: Gebre Yesus' troubled
relationship with the emperor, who was deposed in 1974, feeble and,
some say, senile, but who was considered a deity in parts of the
Caribbean. Gebre Yesus obtained the bed the emperor had _ it is
made of iron and gilt and is maybe 9 feet tall _ before he took the
crown in 1930. He has the emperor's lawn furniture, his bamboo
rocking chair, the heraldic regalia worn by his horse.
</P>
<P>
   And in the first room of the museum is a painting, which Gebre
Yesus recently commissioned, of himself standing in a courtroom
before the emperor. The room also has a series of works on
Ethiopia's defeat of the Italian army on the battlefield in 1896,
but this painting is definitely not about victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never on my side _ never,'' Gebre Yesus said, standing in
front of the painting. ``But still he used my services all the
time. It was a terrible time for me. Financially I was crushed. He
did it deliberately.''
</P>
<P>
   He had known the emperor since boyhood, because his sister was
married to the emperor's chauffeur. So the emperor made sure all
the children in the family were educated, and Gebre Yesus as a boy
had what he calls an ``active mind.'' He loved languages, and
learned English, French and Italian. He said the emperor begged him
to join the government but he refused. Still, he translated several
books _ one on English common law _ for the emperor.
</P>
<P>
   What he loved most was plants, and he became a landscaper (his
work is on display at the new and truly sumptuous Sheraton hotel in
Addis Ababa). He had a garden, where he bred the best-quality
plants and where the emperor went to relax, as documented in Gebre
Yesus' collection of photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Gebre Yesus, with eight children to feed, also dabbled in real
estate _ and that led to the problem with the emperor. The people
around Haile Selassie wanted Gebre Yesus' land and slowly, though
the machinery of the emperor's autocratic and centralized state, he
lost his holdings. The painting documents one of the legal
disputes, presided over by the emperor. Gebre Yesus lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me education, of course, and we had good family
relations,'' he said. ``But at the later stage he was a danger for
me. He was very unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gebre Yesus lived much longer, bought some of the emperor's
possessions _ including his baroque living-room furniture _ and now
is charging a token admission price for people to see it. Most of
the emperor's belongings, bought at auction here, are in the
Ethiopian heritage section _ one of 10 different parts of the
museum. The others include porcelain, household ornaments,
paintings, African art and Western art.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nearly every section is a tribute to the high and the low. There
are four dozen or so clocks, some ornately carved antiques, some
bland plastic. There are Ethiopian manuscripts and fine paintings
by modern Ethiopian artists, as well as a shelf with two stuffed
crocodiles, a lizard and a dusty hyena. He likes hats, coins,
miniatures, silverware, musical instruments, old Ethiopian crosses,
busts, books, maps, photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Gebre Yesus has an aversion to debt, so the museum was built
slowly over the last four and a half years. The house, built the
same slow way, is distinctive: a fortress with passageways, a
replica of an Ethiopian obelisk and a sculpture of Gebre Yesus
perched on a second story.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do it yourself, you can play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His collection came together over decades and followed no
particular course. He bought whatever he fancied, from the
Ethiopian countryside, from merchants, from markets in England or
France or West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always very much interested in anything that attracted
my mind,'' he said. ``I never cared if it was precious or not, as
long as I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is baffled that he has never met another Ethiopian with his
passion for collecting things. Around Africa, where most people are
poor, collecting is a rare pastime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered why other people didn't follow me in this
matter,'' he said. ``Not even my friends, my closest friends. They
don't care how much pleasure I feel in this. It is really
unbelievable, but they don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a habit,'' he said on a tour of the museum. ``I can't
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   He can pause, however, and did so at an old phonograph with a
wooden crank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me show you,'' he said. He wound the crank. He had to
replace the needle, and his hands had trouble putting it into the
arm. After some work, the turntable began to move, the new needle
dropped and the voice of Nat King Cole, singing ``Too Young,'' spun
out of the phonograph horn at 78 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Gebre Yesus smiled. The music was old and crackly, but lovely.

SOUTH KOREA STILL EXPECTS SUMMIT MEETING WITH NORTH TO PROCEED 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ South Korean officials remained confident
on Monday that the first-ever summit meeting with North Korea would
proceed normally on Tuesday after an unexpected 24-hour delay by
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean officials surprised their southern counterparts on
Sunday with a request for the delay of the three-day meeting for
unspecified ``minor technical reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The postponement set off rife speculation over the cause, with
analysts here focusing on security arrangements, the death of
President Hafez Assad in Syria, a longtime ally, or matters as
mundane as the erratic electricity supply and telecommunications
networks in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, where the meeting
is to be held.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a half-century of military hostilities and fierce
ideological competition between the two countries, not to mention
the north's renowned unpredictability, officials here said they had
few doubts that the delay would prove to be only a momentary
setback.
</P>
<P>
   Among other reasons for this confidence, they cited the presence
of a 30-member advance team already in North Korea. ``We will
definitely go on Tuesday,'' said Moon Chung-in, an academic who is
part of the official southern delegation. ``There is no major
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's first leader, Kim Il Sung, died in July 1994, just
days before the only other previously scheduled summit meeting
between the two countries, and the gulf between the two countries
widened dramatically in the ensuing years. Just last year, the two
countries engaged in a fierce naval skirmish in the Yellow Sea
raising anew the prospect of war across the world's most heavily
armed border.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said, though, that the uncharacteristically intense
recent diplomatic activity by North Korea was the best gauge of its
seriousness about engaging the south, and lifting the country's
reclusive veil.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the North Korean president, Kim Jong Il paid
a surprise visit to China, his first trip to another country since
he succeeded his father. Since then, Kim has invited the Russian
leader, Vladimir Putin, for a visit to Pyongyang that is expected
to take place in July.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang has also been busy recently establishing diplomatic
relations with a wide-range of non-traditional partners, ranging
from Italy to Australia. Talks aimed at restoring or establishing
ties with other countries are proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the summit, Washington announced that it could
soon lift most of the economic sanctions that remain in place
against North Korea, most of which are tied to the country's
status, according the State Department, as a supporter of terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that something important is going on here, and the
North-South meeting is obviously the centerpiece,'' said one senior
Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to say just how far or how fast this will all
proceed, but to not have spoken to someone for 50 years, and then
be seated at the same table is itself historic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a major concern of the South Korean government in
recent days has been controlling high public expectations over the
first meeting between leaders of the divided country.
</P>
<P>
   In briefing after briefing, South Korean officials have stressed
that the summit meeting should be seen as only the beginning of
what they hope will be regular, high-level contacts between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents, Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il, are expected
to meet at least twice during the three-day summit, and there have
been persistent but unconfirmed reports of a reciprocal visit by
the North Korean leader to Seoul in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the huge differences that separate the
countries, the agenda for the talks has been left deliberately
vague. The South Korean leadership would like to achieve something
that lowers military tensions on the peninsula, ultimately
including a pledge by Pyongyang to foreswear nuclear weapons
development.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Seoul's main allies, the United States and Japan,
have pressed for emphasis on reducing the threat from North Korea's
ballistic missile program.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in this regard rose sharply in 1998, when Pyongyang
made a surprise test launch of a long-range Taepodong II missile
that overflew the main Japanese island of Honshu.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, North Korea can be expected to make renewed
demands for the withdrawal of the approximately 37,000 American
troops based in the south.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering years of disastrous shrinking of its economy
following the loss of its Soviet-bloc allies, Pyongyang is also
eager to receive a large increase in economic assistance and
investment from the far richer south.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul has already promised large amounts of development
assistance to Pyongyang in exchange for a real detente. And
southern companies, many of whose leaders are flying to Pyongyang
in the 130-member presidential delegation, are eager to expand
their presence in the north.
</P>
<P>
   To do so dramatically, however, will require new agreements on
everything from technology transfer and legal protections from

THOUSANDS OF SYRIANS FLOOD DAMASCUS TO MOURN ASSAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SYRIA, SYRIA-ISRAEL) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Tens of thousands of Syrians streamed into
Damascus on Sunday to mourn their president, Hafez Assad. By
sunset, the crowd had flooded the Umayyad Square near the Chami
Hospital where they believed his body still lay, awaiting Tuesday's
burial, in his hometown of Qurdaha.
</P>
<P>
   In normal times, public gatherings are not permitted in Syria.
But Sunday, under the watchful eyes of security guards, the crowds
of mourners expressed their grief through chants of love and
support for Assad and his son, Bashar, the heir apparent. Some
mourners wept. A group of young men beat their bare chests so hard
they left welts.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting over and over, ``Hafez, the beloved of God,'' in
Arabic, the mourners carried poster-sized photographs of both
father and son. ``Our blood, our soul, we redeem you, Bashar,''
they called.
</P>
<P>
   One young man, seated atop the shoulders of his friends, with a
portrait of Assad stenciled in black on his bare chest, thrust his
fists in the air and implored the crowds to respond with ever
greater adoration for the only leader many of them have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved Assad too much,'' said Rifaat, a taxi driver, who
would not disclose his last name. ``He brought stability to our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the noise and tumult of the streets, Syrian
television played Koranic verses and besides images of mourners,
showed scenes of Bashar Assad meeting with Lebanese officials _
President Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Selim Hoff, and the Speaker
of Parliament Nabih Berri _ at his home. The Lebanese delegation
also went to the hospital where Assad's body is presumed to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the streets where the mourners gathered, the rest of
Damascus was shuttered with the somber quiet broken only by small
bands of marchers. Soldiers blocked the streets near the
president's home, turning away cars and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning continued into the evening as torch-bearing youth
groups marched to the sounds of drums in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Basam Salameh, 17, a secondary student in the crowd, said he
reacted to Assad's death with disbelief. He described the president
as a father for the people, but to many Syrians, he said, the
34-year-old Bashar represents the hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people want Bashar Assad to be president of Syria.
Maybe he can do what the people want for our country and our
population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be the same as his father,'' he said. ``He will do
great things.''

BRODEUR ALSO CELEBRATES A STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct slug; no other changes.)   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ An hour earlier, Commissioner Gary Bettman had handed
the Stanley Cup to the Devils, winners over the Dallas Stars in two
overtime periods.
</P>
<P>
   Now Martin Brodeur had plunged into a chair in front of his
locker in the visitor's dressing room and had taken a deep breath.
He had a victory cigar in his left hand and his right arm wrapped
around his wife, Melanie.
</P>
<P>
   The goaltender whom some call the franchise had won his second
Stanley Cup in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some bumps along the way, but I'm so happy it's
over and I'm glad we're on the good side of it,'' Brodeur said.
``It was a great feeling that it took us five years to get back to
where we were supposed to be. Winning the cup every five years is
not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few uninspiring moments, Brodeur was simply
brilliant in the playoffs, especially in the finals against Dallas.
Some thought that Brodeur, along with Jason Arnott, was as
deserving the Conn Smythe trophy, which goes to the most valuable
player in the tournament, as much Scott Stevens, the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur was so brilliant in the last four games _ the last two
in overtime _ against Dallas that he allowed only four goals while
facing 112 shots. His goaltending duel with Ed Belfour in Game 5,
which went into triple overtime, will go down as one of the best in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   With his 16 victories in the Stanley Cup playoffs, Brodeur tied
the record Philadelphia's Bernie Parent set in 1973-74 for most
victories in a season with 59.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost as happy about that accomplishment as winning the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a statistic I will treasure,'' Brodeur said. ``You've
to to play a lot of games. It took me a lot of games to get to that
and number and I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur played 72 games in the regular season, winning 43. He
played every minute in 23 playoff games and got his 16th victory
with a brilliant performance in Game 6. He also erased the stigma
of having previously lost all of his overtime playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing I didn't see it,'' Brodeur said of his 0-7
record, which was often flashed on television screens. ``I knew
about it, though, and I wanted to get it over with,'' he said.
``This is a great way to end it, by winning the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur also played well in the sweep of Florida in the first
round and the elimination of Toronto in the second round, but he
struggled in the Eastern Conference finals against Philadelphia,
when the Devils rallied from being down by three games to one.
</P>
<P>
   SYKORA RETURNS WITH TEAM
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora came home with the team Sunday, after spending the
night in the hospital and recovering from a harrowing hit by Derian
Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, Hatcher checked Sykora with so much
ferocity that the Czech forward lay on the ice motionless for
several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart went out for him,'' said Jason Arnott, who scored the
game-winner in overtime. The players later brought the cup to
Sykora's room at Baylor University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora underwent a CAT scan that proved normal Saturday night,
but he was kept overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   After another CAT scan Sunday morning, Sykora was released and
allowed to travel to New Jersey with the team.
</P>
<P>
   After a charter flight to Teterboro Airport, the Devils went to
their Continental Arena offices Sunday afternoon to show the
Stanley Cup to family, friends and front-office personnel who did
not make the trip to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   LAMORIELLO QUIET ON FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' president and general manager,
refused to answer specific questions about his future with the
team, which has been sold by John McMullen to YankeeNets for $175
million _ plus a $1 million bonus for winning the cup _ but he made
it clear he would stay with the team through the entry draft later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The YankeeNets will officially take over the team on July 12 and
that group has expressed willingness to keep Lamoriello.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not decided whose names would appear on the
Stanley Cup. He did say that Robbie Ftorek, who was replaced as
coach with eight games left in the regular season, was part of the
team and he deserved some praise. &QL;

SYKORA'S ALARMING SCREAM IN HOSPITAL IS ONE OF JOY  

</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Devils Coach Larry Robinson made his way
off the bus and through the crowd at the Meadowlands, carrying the
Stanley Cup in front of him like a battering ram as pushed through
the doors to the Devils offices. He was also dragging a Neiman
Marcus bag, the spoils of an enjoyable trip to Dallas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robinson propped the cup on the reception desk, where it
immediately became the gathering spot for pictures as members of
the Devils' organization posed next to the prize. But no players
stepped inside, instead descending from the bus, exhausted, most
rushing to the their cars and the exit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few lingered, like Scott Stevens, who stood in the middle of
the traffic, holding his Conn Smythe Trophy while the small crowd
of fans, friends and family congratulated him and posed for
pictures, too. But most of the players just seemed to want to get
home after an exhausting finish to the Stanley Cup Finals in the
early morning hours with a 2-1 double-overtime victory over the
Dallas Stars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had gotten little sleep, reveling in the joy of their
second Stanley Cup in five years as they celebrated. Jason Arnott,
who scored the game-winning goal, hoisted the cup one more time
when the team plane landed at Teterboro Airport. As cars rushed by,
he was the last to leave Sunday. Asked how exhausting the last
stretch of the season had been, with a triple-overtime game on
Thursday, a flight to Dallas, and then the double-overtime victory,
he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't even want to know,'' Arnott said. ``Now it's time to
kick our feet up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arnott was one of a few players who took the celebration to a
Dallas hospital hours after the game was over, carrying the Cup to
teammate Petr Sykora, who had been injured in the first period on
Saturday night and was kept overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora's seemed fine as a CAT scan conducted when he arrived at
the hospital, as well as another one he received Sunday morning,
showed no problems other than the headache he still had as he got
into his black Corvette and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fine,'' said Devils General Manager Lou Lamoriello.
``Larry and I went right after the game to see him. A little story
which I think is great; when we got there, they had him monitored
and he was left quiet, but he had a television watching the game.
When we scored in overtime, he screamed and they all went running
to the room. They thought something was the matter and he woke up
everyone around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent some time with him, then we left and a half-dozen
players took the cup to the hospital.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The small, but enthusiastic crowd gathered outside the Devils
offices Sunday, lining the walkway to the door and spreading into
the parking lot as the players made their getaway. Some, mostly the
veterans who knew just how special this moment was, stayed to enjoy
it as long as they could. It was most likely no coincidence that
two of the last players to leave were Stevens and Ken Daneyko, who
had been among the nine players who were also part of the Devils
other Stanley Cup Champion team in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good core of fans that really support our team,''
Stevens said. ``They're always there for us, which is nice.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko added: ``I think this one is a little bit sweeter. The
first one a whirlwind. You don't know how to react. It's just very
tiring. Besides playing into overtime, there was a lot of
celebrating. The guys had a great time, a lot of fun together. It
was something special, something I'll treasure the rest of my life.
I really appreciate it the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty fortunate, along with eight other guys on this club
who've won it twice in two tries. And to win it in grueling fashion
after losing in three overtimes is special. We have a lot of heart
and soul guys.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the players will likely reconvene with a similar group for
the start of camp next year, with only one player _ Claude Lemieux
_ an unrestricted free agent, just who will be guiding them is
uncertain. The team has already been sold by owner John McMullen to
the YankeeNets group, a transaction that will be final next month.
McMullen, who will get an additional $1 million on the sale price
of the Devils for winning the Stanley Cup, was unable to accompany
the team to Dallas because of a back problem, but greeted them on
the tarmac at Teterboro. And Lamoriello has not stated yet whether
he will remain with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, what I'd like to do is enjoy what we've
accomplished right now,'' Lamoriello said. ``And then we'll look at
this team at the appropriate time. Everybody is a part of what's
transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes decisions and focuses are in one individual area,
but this is an organization that belongs to the players and
everyone involved. There's not one MVP.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: PITCHING SHORTAGE BENEFITS GOODEN  

</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ And for their next magic act, the Yankees will
resurrect Dwight Gooden and turn him into a major league pitcher
again.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, George Steinbrenner's latest reclamation project, has
signed a minor league contract to continue playing baseball after
the Houston Astros sent him to Tampa Bay this season and the Devil
Rays released him.
</P>
<P>
   Some players would take the hint and find another means of
employment or recreation. Gooden, however, is convinced he can
still pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Doc feels he can still do it, especially the way
pitching is now in baseball,'' John Franco, the Mets' relief
pitcher and a former teammate, said Sunday. ``It's so scarce and
not so good. Can't be any worse than what's out there already.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco spoke before the Mets and the Yankees concluded the Bronx
half of their interleague and intracity competition. Gooden played
for both teams, starring for the Mets, pitching creditably at times
for the Yankees. The Mets did not see any reason to prolong his
career. The Yankees' owner is always ready to give a guy another
chance, a last chance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As deftly as he locates his pitches on a good day, Franco put
his finger precisely on why the Dwight Goodens are dragged off
baseball's scrap heap and tossed back into the arena like so many
ancient gladiators. Baseball is suffering from so serious a
pitching shortage that teams will try anything and anyone. It used
to be that left-handed pitchers were the ones who seemed to have a
lifetime guarantee of a job in the major leagues. Now right-handers
are getting their share of jobs because of the desperate need that
teams have for pitching.
</P>
<P>
   By signing Gooden to a minor league contract, the Yankees don't
really risk anything. He can take classes at their Tampa complex,
then undergo tests in minor league games. There they can experiment
with him pitching out of the bullpen, an experience that he
basically has avoided in his 16-year career, relieving only seven
times in his 412-game career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a question that maybe we'll answer, either in Tampa or
Columbus,'' Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, said.
``I'm not sure. Just looking at it from my standpoint, I think it
would be worthwhile finding out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what Gooden can do at all that is in serious question. Both
the Astros and the Devil Rays are managed by former pitchers, one
who also served as pitching coach for the 1997 World Series
champion Florida Marlins. If Larry Dierker and Larry Rothschild
thought Gooden could still pitch effectively in the major leagues,
he would not be taking remedial courses in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was average stuff,'' Dierker said Sunday by
telephone from San Diego, ``the kind of stuff if you're going to
pitch at the major league level, you have to have good control. You
see guys like Bob Tewksbury not throwing real hard and not having
great sinking action but placing the ball where they want it and
having good off-speed stuff. If he gets to the point where he has
that kind of command, he can be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Devil Rays, said a member of their organization, Gooden
was not the ``same pitcher that everyone remembers.'' But then, he
hasn't been since early in the 90s with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good breaking ball; his slider had really improved,''
the Tampa Bay employee said. ``But he lost power off his hard
curveball and that made his fastball less effective. He just
couldn't get away with any mistakes. The home runs were pretty
pronounced.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden gave up 15 home runs in 40 2/3 innings innings with the
two teams, including 9 in his last 15 2/3 for the Devil Rays. The
Yankees clubbed three home runs against him in 4 1/3 innings last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made mistakes and we got him for a couple three-run
homers,'' Stottlemyre said. ``But it looks like he still has
something in his arm.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gooden allowed 17.5 base runners per nine innings in nine starts
with the Astros and the Devil Rays and emerged with a career-high
6.86 earned run average. Opposing teams battered him for a .319
batting average and a .645 slugging percentage. If the 35-year-old
right-hander doesn't make it back to the majors with the benevolent
Yankees or any other team grasping onto the nearest experienced
arm, those will be the final figures on his year-by-year record.
</P>
<P>
   Are players embarrassed by such performances, or can they shrug
them off as simply having a few bad games that a little more work
would overcome?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time and a place for a player at a certain age to
step back and say, `Hey, I've had enough and that's it,''' Franco
said. ``But it's hard to walk away when you're so used to doing
something for 12, 15 years. Sometimes it might take an
embarrassment to say, `I've had enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't passing judgment on Gooden or commenting on his desire
to continue pitching, just explaining the way a player in Gooden's
circumstance thinks and acts. What Franco didn't say was that often
the player is the last one to know he is finished. These days, on
the other hand, teams don't always know it either.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the possibility of sending Gooden to the minors
when he was with the Astros, Dierker said: ``I don't think we could
have gotten him to the minor leagues. With the pitching shortage
that exists, we probably would have put him on release waivers and
somebody would have claimed him.'' &QL;

RAPID ELEVATION OF LATE SYRIAN LEADER'S SON POINTS TO SMOOTH
TRANSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ The party and nation that Hafez Assad ruled
for 30 years until his death this weekend moved swiftly to anoint
his son, Bashar, as Syria's new president on Sunday, raising hopes
that at least the nominal trappings of power in the highly
militarized state may pass peacefully to a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of weeping Syrians took to the streets of Damascus,
shouting their grief over the death of Assad and their devotion to
his son, a reserved 34-year-old eye doctor who inherits an insular
nation still at war with Israel, in control of the government and
militant groups in Lebanon, and struggling to find its place in a
region that has passed it by economically.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, Syria and Bashar only,'' people chanted as they marched
through the capital, which was patrolled by squadrons of uniformed
security officers. Public gatherings are usually not permitted in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Cementing his claim to his father's job, Bashar Assad secured a
number of new titles and positions on Sunday. Abdel-Halim Khaddam,
one of Syria's two vice presidents, who are nominally running the
country now, named him the country's armed forces commander, at the
same time promoting him from colonel to lieutenant-general.
</P>
<P>
   And the governing body of the ruling Ba'ath Party nominated him
for the presidency. The nomination must be endorsed by Parliament,
which must also set a date for a referendum to confirm the choice.
</P>
<P>
   A relative neophyte who held no official position in the
government or the party while his father was alive, Bashar Assad is
unlikely to command anything close to the absolute authority of the
deceased ruler.
</P>
<P>
   But the new titles and positions give the younger Assad a strong
measure of public legitimacy by propelling him to the top of
Syria's tight and secretive military and political hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, since the death of his older brother
Basil, he had been assiduously but quietly groomed for succession.
He has steadily advanced in military rank and acted as his father's
liaison to Lebanon, the client state that Syria runs politically
and militarily.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the state-controlled press credited him with
helping choose a younger and supposedly more progressive set of
ministers and with managing a major anti-corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
   The purge targeted some of the old guard in the government and
in the security services who might have been expected to resist
automatically transferring their loyalty from the father to the
son.

PREP SCHOOLS `BACK EAST' ACCEPTING GAY FACULTY AS FAMILY ROLE
MODELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXETER, N.H. _ Phillips Exeter Academy, the nation's oldest
preparatory school, is the picture of tradition, from its stately
Georgian architecture to the white dresses and blue blazers seniors
will don for Sunday's commencement.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that tradition is the family-like ethos, with faculty
members required to live alongside students in dormitories,
offering homework help, consoling teen-age heartbreak, serving as
role models.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the stewards of this 219-year-old campus are challenging
tradition, altering the definition of family and of role model.
</P>
<P>
   On May 20, the school's trustees voted to allow gay and lesbian
couples to serve as dormitory parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the simplest terms, the decision reflects the increasing
acceptance of gays by mainstream culture. But it also reflects how
much schools like this, once almost exclusively for affluent white
boys, have sought to embrace diversity, often with growing pains.
School officials have taught tolerance, they say, and now they must
live it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to teach our students to be respectful and
supportive of others, including those who are gay,'' said Tyler C.
Tingley, the principal. Barring gay couples from the dormitories
``was an enormous disconnect,'' he said. ``In the minds of our
students, it undercut what we were trying to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Exeter joins its sibling rival, Phillips Academy in Andover,
Mass., which in October voted to allow gay couples in its
dormitories. Concord Academy, in Concord, Mass., approved a similar
policy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At Exeter, faculty members must live in the dormitories for a
minimum of 10 years. So, officials said, the decision was a matter
of equity. But it is also a matter of education.
</P>
<P>
   When a Harvard graduate named John Phillips chartered the school
in 1781, he declared that it should be open to ``students from
every quarter.'' But for about two centuries, those quarters
extended only from Boston's Back Bay to Philadelphia's Main Line,
with a thick swath down Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Like many elite East Coast institutions, boarding schools
embraced progressive causes, but often kept them at arms-length.
The earliest histories of Exeter report that the school banned
expensive silk clothing, but in the late 1800s five students left
the school because there was a ``coloured'' boy in their class.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the campus is awash in diverse ethnic backgrounds, even
if the quadrangles look like a fashion shoot for J. Crew. Since the
1970s girls have been part of the student body. But faculty members
say relations between blacks and whites are still ``tentative,''
and boarding schools have their share of teen intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In teen argot, the word `gay' has a negative context,''
Tingley said. ``That's saying to a young man or a young woman who
is confronting his or her sexuality that society does not support
them, and in fact condemns them. It's as powerful as racism, but we
have not confronted this issue as much as we have confronted
racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Several surveys show that gay teens are several times more
likely than their straight peers to be harassed at school or
attempt suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``For gay students, it's going to help to have institutionally
accepted models of stable gay relationships,'' said David R. Weber,
an English teacher. ``For heterosexual students, that model is
going to give the lie to the demeaning stereotypes they're likely
to come here with.''
</P>
<P>
   Exeter trustees began considering the policy change in October
just as Andover trustees approved it. Andover's decision, Exeter
officials said, made theirs easier; the two compete for applicants
as well as on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   As at Concord and Andover, the trustees consulted doctors and
examined research that said gay parents were no more or less likely
to raise gay children. They wanted to be ready to answer questions
from any parents worried that gay couples in dormitories might lead
students to become homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice vote, the faculty supported the initiative almost
unanimously. The trustee vote was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as worried about me having some special benefits or
special right,'' said Cary Einhaus, a college adviser who is gay
and lives alone in a boys dorm. ``It's more remembering that as a
teen-ager, how much it would have helped if I had someone I could
identify with, or have as a role model, to say, `Wow, this could be
my life _ it's normal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the schools vaguely talked about such a policy,
but decided, as Thomas E. Wilcox, headmaster of Concord, said,
``The world was not ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy has produced almost no reaction from students, who,
faculty members point out, have been raised in a world where
television shows and movies are regularly peopled with gay
characters. One student speaking anonymously to The Exonian, the
Exeter student newspaper, said that homosexuality is ``unnatural,''
but others said gays should have equal rights. The faculty vote to
allow same-sex couples in the dorms merited only an inside story in
The Exonian, while the front page featured a story about the
unprecedented racial and socioeconomic diversity among the fall's
incoming class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like so many situations in which gay folks are the topic, the
reality is always so much different than the fear,'' said Brian
Racine, a science teacher at Concord, who is gay and lives on
campus with his partner. ``The reality has been that it's a
nonissue.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy will take effect at Andover in the fall and at Exeter
in the fall of 2001. Trustees said they wanted to give parents
whose children had accepted admission before the policy was
announced a chance to consider other schools if they had
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Though some Exeter parents had not yet received the letter about
the policy, only one parent has called Exeter with concerns, school
officials said. Andover officials said they had 34 letters or
e-mails about the policy, four negative, three ``concerned'' and
the remainder positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that it's a committed relationship, but I think
it's fine,'' said Barbara Plimpton, a New York parent whose
daughter will graduate on Sunday. ``I'm much more concerned that
they be good, psychologically sensitive people.''

FIRST LADY, CARPETBAG IN HAND, GETS LAST WORD AT PRESS DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After months of being skewered for moving to New
York to run for the U.S. Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton _ carpetbag
in hand _ joined in on the joke on Saturday during an evening of
satirical skits and songs.
</P>
<P>
   The night of political spoofing, held by the Albany press corps,
included a sketch that, sung to the tune of ``The Lady Is a
Tramp,'' satirized Clinton's decision to run for office in New
York: ``She changes viewpoints like three times an hour. Her only
interest is grabbing some power.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton had the last word at the annual Legislative
Correspondents Association dinner, a black-tie affair during which
some of the state's prominent politicians take some brutal ribbing
from the news reporters who cover them daily.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took the stage at the end, carrying a carpetbag. ``I'm
just like every other New Yorker with Secret Service protection,''
the first lady told an audience of more than 500 people who
frequently broke out in laughter during her 20-minute rebuttal
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who moved into the Westchester community of Chappaqua a
few months ago, then presented a slide show of her life titled
``The Woman From Chappaqua.'' In each frame _ whether as an infant
or as an adult meeting Pope John Paul II _ Clinton was pictured
wearing a New York Yankees cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislative Correspondents Association, composed of scores
of the state capital's current and former reporters, has put on the
show every year since 1900. The event is usually off the record,
but this year, the organization's members voted to put it on the
record because of the intense interest in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is looking to fill the seat that is being vacated this
year by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who is retiring. Her
Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island, attended the
show as well, but did not speak.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said his late entry into the race _ which came after
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York dropped out of the campaign last
month to undergo treatment for prostate cancer _ had left them with
insufficient time to prepare remarks for the appearance.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most far-reaching study of the death penalty in the United
States has found that two out of three convictions were overturned
on appeal, mostly because of serious errors by incompetent defense
lawyers or overzealous police and prosecutors who withheld
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The study, an examination of appeals in all capital cases from
1973, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, to 1995,
also found that 75 percent of the people whose death sentences were
set aside were later given lesser sentences after retrials, in plea
bargains or by order of a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Another 7 percent were found not guilty on retrial. Eighteen
percent were given the death penalty on retrial but many of these
had their convictions overturned again in the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   The study, to be released Monday, is based on a search of state
and federal court records. It was conducted by a team of lawyers
and criminologists at Columbia University led by James S. Liebman,
a professor of law who has served as a defense lawyer in a number
of death-penalty trials and appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The report is likely to intensify an already gathering debate
about the death penalty, which has been provoked by the release of
some death-row inmates after new DNA technology helped exonerate
them. Concerns about the death penalty were heightened by the
decision in March by Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, to
declare a moratorium on executions in his state after 13 men on
death row there were exonerated by new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   While some death-penalty supporters have argued that Illinois is
an aberration and produces less reliable death sentences than other
states, the Columbia study found that the rate of serious error
detected by court reviews in Illinois capital cases was 66 percent,
slightly below the national average of 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the death penalty is overwhelming, but recent Gallup
polls have shown it slipping, to 66 percent, its lowest point since
1978, when it was 62 percent. Even many death-penalty supporters
have expressed serious concerns about its fairness. Last month the
historically conservative New Hampshire Legislature voted to
abolish the death penalty, though the bill was subsequently vetoed
by the state's Democratic governor, Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has even made a surprise entrance into the
presidential race, where Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
presumptive Republican presidential candidate who has been an
outspoken supporter of the penalty, postponed the execution of a
convicted killer earlier this month to allow DNA testing. It was
the first stay Bush had granted, after presiding over 131
executions, the most of any governor since the death penalty was
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, Ari Fleischer, said, ``Some people will
use this study to call for the abolition of the death penalty.''
But, Fleischer said, the finding of so many errors during the
appeals process ``shows that there is an extra level of vigilance
and caution in death-penalty cases, appropriately so.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the study's finding that of the death-row inmates whose
sentences were set aside on appeal, 75 percent were later given
lesser sentences and 7 percent were found not guilty, Fleischer
said, ``This shows that 93 percent are still found guilty'' of some
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an error about their innocence. It's just a question
of the appropriate punishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study had its origin in a request in 1991 by Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Del., then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to
Liebman to calculate the frequency with which federal judges found
errors in appeals of death-penalty cases and then set aside the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The high national rate of serious errors leading to verdicts
being set aside in the cases stands in sharp contrast to the error
rate found in appeals in other criminal cases, which is estimated
to be below 10 percent, several legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of errors found in appeals in death-penalty cases
ranged from 100 percent in three states _ Kentucky, Maryland and
Tennessee, and 91 percent in Mississippi, down to 18 percent in
Virginia, by far the lowest of any of the 34 states that have the
death penalty, raising questions about whether Virginia's court
system is unusually fair or works to make it hard to detect errors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 24 of the 26 states with the death penalty where there
have been fully completed appeals had an error rate of 52 percent
or higher, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also shows that there is little, if any, relationship
between the number of death sentences or executions in a state and
its homicide rate or population.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, said Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren
Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, ``This
study tells us that the enormous inconsistencies, the justice by
geography and the sheer-luck nature of the death-penalty system''
that the Supreme Court criticized when it invalidated death-penalty
laws in 1972 remain true today.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, Justice Potter Stewart suggested that the
administration of the death penalty was so capricious that the
chances of receiving it were like being hit by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 the court began to uphold rewritten death-penalty laws
that addressed its concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Wilkinson, a former assistant U.S. attorney who won a
death-penalty conviction against Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma
City bombing, said the report provided important data to help sort
out the issues in the debate over the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, the debate has been heavily ideological; this gives
us some data,'' said Wilkinson, who is a member of the National
Committee to Prevent Wrongful Executions and is a lawyer with
Latham &AMP; Watkins in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She said it had long been known that there was a high error rate
in death-penalty cases. ``But what was really shocking to me,'' she
said, ``was that 82 percent of the cases that are sent back after
review receive some lesser penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebman, the main author of the study, acknowledged that some
death-penalty advocates might seize on the 68 percent rate of
serious errors as proof that the system works, that mistakes are
caught and innocent people are not put to death. But he said the
fact that ``there are so many mistakes,'' and that it takes an
average of nine years to complete the review process, ``raises
grave doubts whether we do catch all the mistakes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the 13 cases that led Ryan to suspend executions
in Illinois, that of Anthony Porter, went through the entire review
process without any error being detected, said Lawrence C.
Marshall, a professor of law at Northwestern University and
director of its Center on Wrongful Convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Porter came within 48 hours of execution, only to win a stay
from a state court because of a psychologist's test showing he had
an IQ of only 50, raising doubts about whether he was mentally
competent. After the stay, journalism students at Northwestern,
under the direction of a journalism professor, David Protess, found
evidence that exonerated Porter and led to the conviction of
another man.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is compelling evidence that the appeals process
still does not screen out all the innocent people,'' Marshall said,
``and that the number of people who ought to be taken out of the
death-penalty pool is far higher than the 68 percent in the
study.'' For example, if a defense lawyer was truly incompetent, he
said, the lawyer might never do the work necessary so that legal
and factual issues could be raised later on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The number of errors, and the number that go undetected, may
have risen since the study was completed, Liebman said, because
since the mid-1990s several states and Congress have curbed appeals
by death-row inmates and sped the execution process.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 federal law, signed by President Clinton, put a one-year
limit on the time death-row inmates have to appeal to federal
courts after exhausting their appeals in state courts. And a number
of states have shut down special public-defender units that
formerly helped death-row inmates with their appeals.
</P>
<P>
   From the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1973 to the end
of 1995, there was a total of 5,760 death-penalty convictions, of
which 4,578 were appealed. The study looked at all three possible
stages of appeal _ direct appeal to a state's highest court; what
is known as post-conviction review, usually by the original trial
judge; and habeas corpus review, under which convictions in state
courts are reviewed for error in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Although state court judges, many of whom are elected, are
usually thought to be less likely to find in favor of a convicted
killer on appeal than federal judges are, the report found that 46
percent of all death-penalty cases where error was found were in
state courts. Federal judges reversed 40 percent of the capital
cases that survived and were appealed to them.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where no error was found, it took an average of nine
years from the time of sentencing to execution, the report found.
As a result, the study reported, only 5 percent of all people who
had been given the death penalty since 1973 had been executed.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the report said their findings confirmed a
complaint of supporters of the death penalty who say the appeals
process takes a long time. But, the authors said, ``Judicial review
takes so long precisely because American capital sentences are so
persistently and systematically fraught with error.'' It takes
years of review to catch the mistakes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cause of so many errors in death-penalty cases, the
study found that 37 percent were the result of incompetent defense
attorneys, who are often poorly paid or inexperienced in capital
trials. Another 19 percent of the errors were caused by misconduct
by police or prosecutors in suppressing evidence that would have
helped the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 5 percent of the errors were the result of bias by
the judge or jury, such as a judge telling the news media what he
thought about the defendant during the trial. A further 20 percent
were errors caused by faulty instructions given to juries by the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 19 percent were in a miscellaneous category that
included coerced confessions, prosecutors keeping blacks off the
jury when a black defendant was on trial, or the police planting
informers in jails to listen to conversations between defendants
and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the kind of technicalities people complain about
helping a defendant,'' Liebman said. Indeed, some of them amount to
overzealous law enforcement railroading suspects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A major factor, Liebman and other lawyers, judges and
prosecutors said, is that in capital cases there is no plea
bargaining. In other felony indictments, 90 percent of the
defendants end up pleading guilty, often in exchange for a reduced
sentence, a process that leads to conversations between the
prosecutor and the defense attorney, and to a less adversarial
situation.
</P>
<P>
   But in murder cases, particularly those that have received a lot
of publicity and in which the prosecutor decides to seek a death
sentence, there is intense public interest, creating enormous
pressure to win and leaving little room for the kind of plea
bargaining that is used in other criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``In death-penalty cases, the prosecutor feels pressure,'' said
William Broadhus, a former attorney general of Virginia who tried
death-penalty cases and is now in private practice. ``So maybe you
press harder than the situation warrants.''
</P>
<P>
   And juries in death-penalty cases often feel a rush to convict,
Broadhus said, as they sit in the courtroom looking at pictures of
the dead person and see the victim's family in court.
</P>
<P>
   The report also finds that there is no apparent reduction in
homicide in states with the death penalty. For the nation as a
whole, in the period from 1973 to 1995, the murder rate was nine
per 100,000. But in the states with the death penalty, it was 9.3
per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report found that there are huge variations
among the states with the death penalty in the rates of both
death-penalty convictions and executions. The variations seemed to
have no relation to the states' population or number of slayings.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, for example, almost 6 percent of all homicides
result in a death sentence, more than four times the national
average among states with the death penalty, while in Maryland less
than 0.6 percent of homicides result in a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Three states that have a high number of executions _ Texas,
Virginia and Louisiana _ rank fourth, second and seventh in
executions per homicide. But Texas is only 18th in death sentences
per homicide, Virginia is 22nd and Louisiana is 25th. In other
words, the report concluded, these states manage to convert death
sentences into executions more swiftly and in larger numbers than
other states.

FEELING VULNERABLE, REPUBLICANS NUDGE N.Y. SENATE TO LEFT  

</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader,
struggled to explain why the State Senate was about to pass a
hate-crimes bill, which he and his colleagues had blocked since the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno dismissed the bill as symbolism, a measure that would do
nothing to fight crime, though he acknowledged its popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're in a business where times change,'' he said.
``We're contemplating doing something with gun safety, and you
know, three months ago, or a year ago, or three years ago, that's
not anything we would contemplate. Times change, and I think we
have to stay flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   No faction in New York politics has changed more of late than
the State Senate. The Senate Republicans, a bulwark of the state
machinery that has had a vise grip for decades, look on this year's
election with greater fear than they have felt since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   They see a presidential election in which most polls show Al
Gore swamping George W. Bush in New York. They see an entire state,
and some battleground districts, that have become more heavily
Democratic. They see a voter rebellion against the Republican Party
in Nassau County. And they see the Senate Democrats, long a
punching bag who often failed to muster opponents to Republican
incumbents in swing districts, fielding the strongest team of
challengers in memory.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, the Senate Republicans, long a
redoubt of conservatism in a liberal state, have made a march
leftward, approving legislation that it would have been hard to
imagine them accepting a few years ago. Each measure appealed to
moderate and liberal voters in New York City and its suburbs, where
the most vulnerable Republican senators are, or placated crucial
interest groups like labor unions or the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for the first time, the Senate passed a bill
providing increased penalties for crimes motivated by hatred of any
of several groups, with 24 of 36 Republicans voting in favor. Among
the protected classes of victims listed in the bill are gays and
lesbians, a step that Bruno and many of his colleagues had said
they would not take.
</P>
<P>
   Since last fall, the Senate has passed a bill making it a crime
to block access to abortion clinics, a bill creating a major new
health-care entitlement program for the working poor, a
55-cents-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax, a bill requiring
that all cigarettes meet fire safety standards, and a bill
restricting companies' ability to sell air pollution ``credits''
that, in effect, give polluters the right to violate clean air
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In recent budget talks, it was the Senate Republicans who
championed state-subsidized prescription drugs for the elderly and
an important tax credit for the poor. And with just a few days left
in this year's legislative session, Senate leaders are seriously
considering passing a broad package of gun controls, approving an
increase in the state minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.75, and giving
retired government workers automatic annual pension increases for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the new left-wing Senate,'' said Sen. Martin Connor of
Brooklyn, the Democratic minority leader. ``The mood across the
aisle seems pretty grim. They're really worried about their
survival, and the legislative result is they're rushing to adopt
the Democratic agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators have privately teased each other about their
new liberal credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them acting very nervously, and I see them making a lot
of mistakes because of it,'' said Michael L. Long, chairman of the
state's Conservative Party. ``In their fear and their desire to
stay in control, they're acting like there's no difference between
Republicans and Democrats, and passing a lot of far-left
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in control of the Senate are enormous. With Democrats
firmly in control of the assembly, a Democratic majority in the
Senate could form a unified legislative front in taking on Gov.
George E. Pataki, a Republican, over budgets and other issues. They
could begin sending the governor bills, like an overhaul of the
campaign finance laws, that have been bottled up in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority controls several hundred patronage jobs, and
many of those people become campaign foot soldiers when it is time
to circulate petitions, arrange rallies and get out the vote. Those
jobs also provide a breeding ground for candidates for local and
legislative offices.
</P>
<P>
   This year's elections are particularly crucial because the next
Senate will draw the district lines for the next decade. In a state
where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 million to 3.1
million, the Republicans have maintained control of the Senate
largely through the power to carve out as many favorable districts
as possible themselves. Political analysts say nonpartisan or
pro-Democrat redistricting would give Democrats solid control of
the chamber for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a 36-to-25 edge in the Senate, and even the
Democrats acknowledge they have no better than an outside shot of
picking up the six seats needed to take control. A shift in power
is rare; the Assembly last changed hands in the Democrats'
post-Watergate sweep of 1974, and the Senate has had a Republican
majority for all but one year since 1938.
</P>
<P>
   But even knocking off three Republican senators could make it
hard for Bruno to control legislation on which there are a few
dissenters in his party. It could also persuade political
contributors who now heavily favor Republicans to start hedging
their bets and give to Democrats, too.
</P>
<P>
   The great wild card in this year's races is Nassau County, where
Republicans outnumber Democrats by a wide margin. Will voter anger
last until November, and will it spill over from local contests to
state races? At this point, no one can do more than guess.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Pataki, a fellow Republican, has helped put the Senate
Republicans on the spot, siding with legislation opposed by
conservatives, rather than giving them a powerful ally in a united
front. He was a major architect of the health-care program and the
cigarette tax, and he has called for gun control and hate-crimes
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also worried about the loss of Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani as their party's candidate for the United States Senate.
Giuliani had been expected to fare well in the city and its
suburbs, which could have helped Republicans down the ticket, and
it remains to be seen how Rep. Rick A. Lazio will do as his
replacement.

PAULSON ENDS HIS LONG WAIT WITH A VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ After four holes of a sudden-death playoff, a
47-minute weather delay and 102 starts on the PGA Tour without a
victory, Dennis Paulson finally tasted triumph Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Making a superb up-and-down on the final hole, Paulson won the
Buick Classic on the fourth playoff hole, sinking a 4-foot putt to
win after David Duval missed a 5-footer. Paulson's first career
victory came the hard way, against a star-studded leader board on a
demanding Westchester Country Club course that served as a prelude
to this week's United States Open.
</P>
<P>
   It ended on the par-4, 374-yard 17th hole, when Paulson turned
the tables on Duval. Duval reached the front of the green in two
shots, as Paulson's second shot went long, into the deep rough
behind the green. But after Duval lagged his first putt 5 feet from
the hole, Paulson hit a magnificent chip to 4 feet, and Duval then
missed his putt. That opened the door for Paulson, who made his par
put to win the first-place check worth $540,000.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson (65-68-75-68), who started the day two strokes off the
lead, and Duval (70-67-70-69) were eight under for the tournament
(276), one stroke ahead of Sergio Garcia of Spain, who finished
third after losing a three-shot lead on the back nine. Greg Norman
was fourth at six under, his best finish since last year's British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   But for Paulson, who lost last year's Buick Classic in a playoff
with Duffy Waldorf, the feeling of victory was almost
indescribable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hasn't hit me yet,'' said Paulson, a 37-year-old
Californian who spent years playing on the Asian and Nike tours.
``It's going to be fun going to Pebble Beach and to be a bigger
part of the story, instead of just another guy teeing up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult loss for Duval, the world's No. 2-ranked
player, who has not won since April 1999. He said he was not sure
what happened on his final putt, the missed 5-footer. ``I don't
know if I pulled it, or just hit a bad putt, or if it just broke
more than I thought,'' he said. ``I just missed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the third playoff hole, Duval made a terrific putt, a
40-footer uphill for birdie on the par-5, 526-yard No. 18 that
nearly won the tournament. But Paulson answered with a pressure
putt, a 6-footer for birdie that forced play to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson's putter was good to him all day. He earned his way into
the playoff by making a sensational 35-foot putt for birdie during
regulation at No. 18, which put him in the clubhouse at eight under
par before the 47-minute delay. Duval was two groups behind
Paulson, still on the course at eight under. But he missed birdie
opportunities on the final two holes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Duval missed a 10-foot putt for birdie at No. 17. Then, after
his tee shot at No. 18 landed in the fairway, the horn blew to
suspend play because of lightning. After resuming play, Duval hit
his second shot at No. 18, a 3-iron that hit the rock-hard green
and bounced into the deep rough. Duval failed to get up-and-down
from there, settled for par and headed into the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The day started with Waldorf leading at seven under par, a
stroke ahead of seven players: Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els, Chris
Perry, John Cook, Joey Sindelar, Skip Kendall and Duval. But most
of those contenders faltered on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Garcia was in excellent position, storming to a
three-stroke lead after 10 holes by making five birdies. He drove
the green on two par-4 holes _ the 326-yard No. 7 and the 314-yard
No. 10. Both of those prodigious drives led to two-putt birdies,
and Garcia left the 10th green three strokes ahead of Duval, Perry
and Sindelar.
</P>
<P>
   But at No. 10, momentum began to swing from the 20-year-old
Garcia and toward Paulson and Duval. Garcia had a 12-foot putt for
eagle at No. 10 but was distracted by a photographer's camera just
as he was about to strike the ball. He backed away and glared at
the cameraman, then missed the putt and settled for a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Things soon got worse for Garcia. He pulled his tee shot well
left at No. 11, into the rough and under a tree. Instead of playing
a safer shot and chipping back into the fairway, Garcia tried to
hit a low 5-iron under the trees toward the hole. His club clipped
a branch on his backswing, and he advanced the ball only about 40
yards, still in the deep rough. His next shot landed just short of
the green, and after chipping 8 feet right of the hole, Garcia
missed the putt and double-bogeyed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Paulson made a 22-footer for birdie at No. 11,
pulling him into a tie for the lead with Garcia. Garcia made a
costly bogey at No. 17 to fall to six under, and even a birdie at
No. 18 kept him one hole out of the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Garcia, who shot a 65 Saturday and a 68 Sunday after
barely making the cut, was pleased with his best finish of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows I'm still the same guy as last year,'' said Garcia,
the runner-up at last year's PGA Championship by one stroke to
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time in his career, Paulson won an event on
the tour. Asked what it meant, Paulson had a ready answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he said, ``that I'm going to be able to move into my
new house now, no problem.'' &QL;

FOREIGN AFFAIRS: UNFINISHED BUSINESS IN SYRIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is Hafez Assad's legacy? How should his epitaph read?
That's an easy one. His gravestone should read: ``Hafez Assad,
feared and ferocious President of Syria: He stayed too long and he
died too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Hafez Assad _ for years the Middle East leader most
incapable of change, and then, finally, when he realized that
change was mandatory if he wanted to turn over a stable Syria to
his son, Bashar, he bowed out before getting the really hard stuff
done.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look closely at Assad's ambiguous reign. What do we mean
he stayed too long? Well, in the fall of 1977, just before going to
Jerusalem, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt went to Damascus to meet
with Assad and encourage him to follow Egypt's lead with Israel.
Assad refused, and he spent the next 23 years resisting the
Egyptian approach, and then trying to prove that he could get more
from Israel and give less.
</P>
<P>
   And what does Assad have to show for those 23 years? Not much.
At best he will remembered for what he didn't do, not for any
positive accomplishments: He did not, in his eyes, ``sell out'' to
Israel. He did not meet the embarrassing end of other Soviet-era
dictators who were toppled by popular movements. With his brutal
fist, he did not let ethnically divided Syria fall into civil war
like Lebanon. He did not, like Saddam Hussein, allow himself to be
sucked into a devastating war with the world's only superpower. He
did not lose Syria's grip over Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   So many ``He did nots.'' But not a lot of ``He dids.'' By any
normal criteria, Assad would have to be judged one of the most
overrated leaders ever. Economically, Syria today is a backwater _
the last country in the Middle East to introduce fax machines and
the Internet, a country with a crumbling industrial base, a
corrupt, 19th-century banking system, an utterly backward
educational system and not a single world-class export of any
product or service. If Syria were in Asia, it would be called North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, Assad finally got the message _ that he
had to modernize and open the country. And one of the people
whispering that most often to him was his son and designated heir,
Bashar. So Assad started bulldozing the road, but he left three
huge boulders _ boulders that would have been difficult for even
him to move, but will be even harder for his son, an eye doctor,
who starts with much less legitimacy and none of his father's
godfather-like skills at destroying enemies without mercy.
</P>
<P>
   The first and biggest boulder left for Bashar is modernizing
Syria and shifting the base of Syrian unity from the war with
Israel to building a 21st-century state. President Assad had begun
that task last year with a series of internal purges, but it was
slow going. Assad was ambivalent about opening Syria's windows, and
he had created so many competing power centers, spying agencies and
military units _ all of which reported to him and all of which he
played against one another _ that when he initially tried to turn
things over to his son, some of those power centers resisted. So
father and son started purging: Former Prime Minister Mahmoud Zubi
killed himself last month after being sent for trial on corruption
charges. Former army chief Hikmat Chehabi also was targeted on
corruption charges. But this is an unfinished war, and Bashar will
not consolidate his rule, or be able to push his reform agenda,
without winning some cock fights with other Syrian roosters.
</P>
<P>
   The second bit of unfinished business is the peace with Israel.
Assad refused any compromise with Israel on the Golan, even when
only 200 yards were left in dispute. He also refused to show any
warmth to the Israeli people. Will Bashar be able to summon the
strength and legitimacy to offer compromises his father would not,
but which are essential for any deal with Israel?
</P>
<P>
   The last bit of unfinished business was Lebanon. Israel's
unilateral pullout from south Lebanon has naturally triggered
questions in Lebanon: If the Israelis are gone, why is the Syrian
army still here? Bashar will eventually have to work out a new
basis for Syria's continued presence in Lebanon. Not easy.
</P>
<P>
   It is rather fitting that Hafez Assad died in mid-conversation
on the phone with the president of Lebanon. Because in many ways he
was also in mid-conversation with the people of Syria and Israel as
well. These were conversations too late in coming. Bashar will now
have to finish the calls. I wonder what he'll say.

ESSAY: THE REJECTIONIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If you want to make a list of the Syrian dictator
Hafez Assad's good deeds, begin with this: He was an enemy of
Iraq's Saddam Hussein. That's where the list ends.
</P>
<P>
   On the debit side of his life's ledger can be included his eager
alliance with Soviet Communism; his slaughter of thousands of
dissident Syrians in Hama; his avid support of terrorists
worldwide; his military occupation of neighboring Lebanon; and most
consuming of all, his abiding hatred of Israel, which made Assad
the Arab world's most relentless rejectionist.
</P>
<P>
   At his funeral Tuesday, crocodile tears will flow from Yasser
Arafat, long the object of Assad's contempt, who must be delighted
at having outlived his tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders will proclaim respect for ``stability'' provided
by such dictators-for-life. Groping for ways not to speak ill of
the dead, they will note that once Assad grudgingly made an
agreement, he ``kept his word'' by sealing his side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, Bill Clinton decided to bypass this chance at wearing
his inimitable lip-biting mournful look, and won't dispatch Vice
President Al Gore, his normal substitute, to Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because three months ago, at a much-touted meeting in
Geneva, Clinton presented Assad with the Golan Heights on a silver
platter. The Syrian then humiliated the supplicating American by
refusing to take yes for an answer, making fresh demands for
control of Galilee that embarrassed not only Clinton but even the
most appeasement-prone doves in Jerusalem. Assad scuttled
negotiations in the most dramatic way possible.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, an unelected official, the secretary of state, will
represent the United States at the state funeral of a world figure;
That deliberate diplomatic slight will not be lost on Middle East
leaders or American voters.
</P>
<P>
   Does the dictator's demise help or harm the processing of peace?
It helps.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term, this week's attempt to transfer power to his son,
Bashar, means that the ``Syrian track'' is derailed for at least
this year. That delay is not a matter for hand-wringing. On the
contrary, the implacable Hafez was pressing the Israeli prime
minister, Ehud Barak, into a corner that might have resulted in
Israelis, in a referendum, voting to turn down a deal that would
deliver the high ground in return for treaty promises.
</P>
<P>
   Longer-term, the absence of Assad will help because the dictator
was driven by pride to recapture in negotiation every inch of land
he lost in foolish early aggressions. That intensely personal
motive for self-justification is gone. Several scenarios now
present themselves:
</P>
<P>
   1.  &UR; Worst case: anarchy in Syria. &LR;  The Assads come from a
religious minority, the Alawites; the majority Sunnis may want to
take over. The dictator also struck a balance among his military,
his spy service and his political party; his 34-year old son,
figurehead of the regime's insiders, may not have the manipulative
cunning of a father who in the end could be expected to make
neither peace nor war. Anarchy could lead to coups, riots, a
reckless lashing-out at Israel, rapprochement with Saddam. Hebrew
University president Itamar Rabinovich, expert on Syria, tells me
he's concerned that ``the days of predictability may be over.''
</P>
<P>
   2.  &UR; Less bad case: a balance of internal powers behind a
dictator who needs to make peace to survive. &LR;  If not Bashar, this
could be a militarist or politician able to establish internal
order _ ``stability'' _ without Hama-style massacres. Economic
incentives might induce him to bring home 30,000 troops from
Lebanon as Iran's Hezbollah is induced to leave.
</P>
<P>
   3.  &UR; Best case: The young man leads angry, backward Syria into
the modern world. &LR;  Bashar is an ophthalmologist, educated by London
eye doctors. He heads the computer society in a socialist land too
worried about dissent to permit Internet access to anybody beyond
the elite. With initial investment from Saudis and the emirates,
and with a little canniness and a lot of luck, he could introduce
the rudiments of market reform and prosperity to a freedom-parched
land. It's wishful thinking, but that's how a real peace could take
hold.
</P>
<P>
   As newscasters learn to pronounce ``ophthalmologist'' (first two
syllables are ``ahf'' and ``thal'') Syrians will adjust to life
after Hafez. To succeed, whoever follows him must reject a life of
rejection.

ASSAD'S DEATH LEAVES ISRAEL CALM BUT UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
    (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli leaders proclaimed on Sunday that the death
of President Hafez Assad of Syria had ushered in a new era or at
least ushered out an old one in the Middle East. But no one could
predict what that portended beyond a potentially problematic
transition period.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mourning, no celebration of the death and no
re-assessment here of an Arab leader familiar to generations of
Israelis as a sworn enemy of their state, yet one who inspired
sometimes ambivalent feelings as a cunning leader and a worthy
adversary, too.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most agreed with Nahum Barnea, the dean of newspaper
columnists, who wrote Sunday morning: ``We Israelis have no reason
to shed any tears over the death of Hafez Assad. It's a waste of
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis expressed the hope that positive change would
prove inevitable. ``Assad's successor is the times and not any one
man,'' said Shimon Peres, Israel's minister for regional affairs.
``Because if his successor doesn't adapt himself to the times,
Syria will remain a very poor and isolated country in a very
difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some worried aloud that Syria would degenerate into chaos, which
could destabilize Lebanon, and spread violence into Israel. But
more said wishfully that Assad's death could help Syria shed its
insularity, open up to the West and perhaps even lose what is
perceived here as its intransigence in pursuing peace.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted hopefully that Assad's designated successor, his
34-year-old son Bashar, was educated in England, that he heads
Syria's computer society, and that he is not bound by the same
personal entanglements in history. Bashar Assad was just two years
old in 1967, when Syria, with his father as defense minister, lost
the Golan Heights to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the widespread calm here, the Tel Aviv stock
exchange, usually a good barometer of geopolitical anxiety,
registered barely a flutter. And the Israeli military, after a
24-hour alert, reported quiet on Israel's northern borders and said
that no new forces would be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maariv newspaper on Sunday, Chemi Shalev wrote: ``Life
without Hafez, after all these years, is an unknown, and we will
all have to go through a weaning period. But along with the worry
there is also room for hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, Assad was a bitter enemy who cast a giant shadow
over the entire Middle East. This morning, now that he's gone, we
can see the sun once more, even if it is blinding at present.''

EDITORIAL: SYRIA AFTER HAFEZ ASSAD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 12:
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad has been a fixture of Syrian politics and diplomacy
for so long that it is hard to imagine the Middle East without him.
In 30 years of rule, he transformed Syria from a coup-prone pawn of
stronger Arab states into a formidable regional power.
</P>
<P>
   His Soviet-equipped forces slashed across the Golan Heights and
menaced Israel's survival in the early days of the 1973 war and
have progressively taken over Lebanon since 1976. His fixation with
reclaiming every inch of the Golan made him the last of Israel's
Arab neighbors to resist a negotiated peace. His successor should
shed this costly policy of confrontation and begin integrating
Syria's closed and backward society into the 21st-century world.
</P>
<P>
   Family loyalists have moved quickly since the dictator's death
Saturday to install his son and designated heir, Bashar, as his
successor, naming him the nation's top military commander and
ruling-party presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still to be seen whether the younger Assad, a
Western-educated ophthalmologist with limited political experience,
can master the murderous intrigues of Damascus. Israel and the
United States will need to watch closely for possible changes in
Syrian security policies and negotiating positions.
</P>
<P>
   Assad maintained his tight grip through a cold-blooded instinct
for power. He surrounded himself with loyal military commanders
from his minority Alawite religious group and assured his
domination through the competing machinations of 15 intelligence
agencies. When all else failed, he did not hesitate to use
violence, as in his 1982 massacre of 10,000 residents of the
rebellious city of Hama.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, Israeli prime ministers have tried to negotiate
peace with this ruthless leader. They reasonably imagined that a
deal swapping all or most of the Golan Heights for rigorous
security guarantees would be easier to work out than a more complex
arrangement with the Palestinians involving Jerusalem, refugees and
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   But each time, their hopes foundered on Assad's unyielding
insistence that all territory held by Syria prior to June 1967 be
returned. Israel says it is ready to concede the principle of full
withdrawal, but wants border adjustments to assure continued
control of the Sea of Galilee, its principal freshwater source.
Assad refused, most recently when he met with President Clinton in
Geneva last March.
</P>
<P>
   No negotiating breakthrough is likely soon. But if Bashar Assad
consolidates control, he might be able to make the deal his father
could not. Re-establishing the precise June 1967 border had become
a personal obsession for Hafez Assad. His son may have other
priorities, like carefully opening up safety valves in Syria's
Leninist police state and guiding its backward and isolated economy
into the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad bequeathed Syria a dictator's legacy of militarism,
repression and economic suffocation. His successor must offer
Syrians and their neighbors something better.

GORE SPREADS THE WORD VIA `VALIDATORS': HE IS OK
</HEADLINE>
  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When he was in Seattle last week, Vice President Al
Gore dropped by a fund-raising reception for Gov. Gary Locke of
Washington. The governor, in introducing the vice president to the
crowd, followed a script suggested by Gore's presidential campaign.
And here is what the campaign wanted these people to know:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only a great person, but he's very funny,'' Locke
said of the vice president. He is ``a person who is committed to
his family,'' Locke went on. ``He is always picking up the phone to
check on his mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke, like countless others who are introducing Gore around the
country these days, is what is known in the trade as a
``validator,'' or a character witness, someone who can attest to
the nature of the real Al Gore and reassure voters that he is a
decent man, a family man, a good guy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has been campaigning intensely for more than a
year now, and has been in public life for nearly a quarter century,
he is still having trouble getting across this basic message. That
is one reason the campaign is enlisting scores of validators _
Democrats like Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana and Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts _ and deploying them on talk shows and the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Their job is not just to attest to Gore's humanity, although
that is a large part of it. They must also make the case for his
policy proposals and be prepared to scold Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, Gore's Republican rival, so that Gore does not have to do it
himself and thereby contradict the positive, good-guy image that
the campaign is so desperately seeking to convey.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of validators is just one element of a new phase
of the Gore campaign, one that the vice president agreed last week
in an interview could be as dramatic a turning point as one last
fall when he moved his campaign headquarters from Washington to
Nashville and started engaging his now-vanquished Democratic
challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley, with zeal. And he and his
advisers hope the payoff is as great.
</P>
<P>
   The new phase is marked by a concerted effort to transmit more
of Gore's personal side along with a positive presentation of his
policy proposals. It includes a media blitz he plans to begin
Tuesday in New York, one so extensive that it will almost seem like
a re-launching of his campaign, as he begins a ``progress and
prosperity tour'' across the Middle Atlantic state and the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The new phase also features a multimillion-dollar advertising
campaign, a retreat from harsh assessments of Bush and a cheery
message of optimism. As Gore told a group of financial contributors
on Thursday night in Beverly Hills, Calif., ``We'll make this
decade the brightest time in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Gore, the shift in strategy plays into one of
the Republicans' chief criticisms of him _ that he lacks
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore Reinvents Himself _ Again!'' blares a news release
from the Bush campaign. It goes on to list six Gore incarnations
since last summer: the underdog, the average Joe, the alpha male,
the crusading reformer, the negative attacker and, now, the
thinking man with a heart.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy also reflects some concern that Gore needs to
inspire core Democratic constituencies with whom he should be
comfortably ahead. The tour will take him to places like Scranton,
Pa., and Cincinnati, Ohio, conveniently located in battleground
states.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said that this period was less a
shift than a reflection of ``the natural ebb and flow'' of any
campaign. ``There will be plenty of time down the road to draw the
comparisons and contrasts with the options that Governor Bush wants
to pursue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of his ``progress and prosperity tour,'' in New
York, Gore is to stand with Robert Rubin, the former treasury
secretary and Wall Street giant, at his side, and begin a national
discussion on the upbeat subject of how best to use the burgeoning
budget surplus and keep the economy roaring. The White House
projects a surplus of $746 billion over the next decade, and the
Gore tour, scheduled to span the next two weeks, is designed to
coincide with forecasts of an even greater surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on the nation's prosperity will give him a chance
to remind voters of his part in an administration that has presided
over the longest economic expansion in the nation's history. This,
his advisers believe, provides the most compelling argument for his
election as president.
</P>
<P>
   Already, President Clinton _ another validator _ is out making
this case. On Saturday in Minneapolis, Clinton told 700 donors at a
fund-raising reception: ``You need to know that there has never
been anybody in that job who had more of an impact on more issues
across a broader range of areas, and that a lot of the success we
enjoy today would not have been possible if it hadn't been for
him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore is to push proposals for helping to pay down the national
debt, protect Medicare by removing it from the budget process,
eliminate the long-term Social Security deficit, provide tax
incentives, make investments in education, health care and job
training, and create a new kind of personal retirement account, one
based on a Clinton proposal for Universal Savings Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity tour coincides with the opening of a two-month
$25-million advertising campaign financed by the Democratic
National Committee but produced by Gore consultants. The first
commercial, running in 15 states, touts his support for a Medicare
benefit to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Future commercials leading up to the Democratic convention in
August are to focus on parts of Gore's personal biography and his
life outside Washington _ as a soldier in Vietnam and a divinity
student and journalist in Tennessee, and, of course, as a family
man.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Tipper, who had been keeping her own separate campaign
schedule, has been appearing with him lately. On Monday night, at a
town meeting with women in New Jersey, he is to be accompanied by
his oldest daughter, Karenna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to have an opportunity to learn more about Al
Gore the person, where he learned his values and how he would
lead,'' said Doug Hattaway, a Gore spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also ceased attacking Bush. Although he spent much of
the spring denouncing Bush as inexperienced and proferring
``risky'' schemes, he has not mentioned Bush's name in public since
May 26, when he derided his call for an expansive missile-defense
system. Since then, Gore has only sparingly referred to him as
``the other fella'' or ``the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore is stepping up his pleas to Democrats to
work hard for him. As he said to a group of Democratic mayors last
week: ``I'm asking you to really turn it on for me.''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Recently my French-born son-in-law, Hubert Laisney, accompanied
by our daughter Julie, went to Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn for his
swearing-in ceremony for American citizenship. My wife and I were
asked to baby-sit for our grandchildren _ Luke, 4, and Cybele, 15
months _ to whom Hubert always speaks in French. We entertained
Luke by repeatedly reminding him that his father was on a very
important mission, that he was to become an American on that day.
</P>
<P>
   We prepared a celebration in the evening and even hung an
American flag in the window. When Hubert arrived and greeted his
son, Luke turned to us and said in complete astonishment, ``But he
still speaks French!''

   How to get a taxi, sometimes: Susan Crowley-Gerame, visiting
midtown Manhattan, took the advice of friends and went to Eighth
Avenue to get a taxi to the airport. After 35 minutes of vainly
searching for a cab, she gave up and proceeded to plan B. She
crossed to a side street and analyzed the passengers in cabs that
were stopping for a light.
</P>
<P>
   One cab held what she considered the perfect person, a
well-dressed woman who, Crowley-Gerame guessed _ correctly, it
turned out _ was going only a short distance. She knocked on the
window, the woman rolled it down and Crowley-Gerame put forth her
proposition. If she could jump in the cab, Crowley-Gerame would pay
the woman's fare to her destination and then proceed to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The woman agreed but, apparently unwilling to take advantage,
insisted on paying the meter's $7 as she was about to get out.
Crowley-Gerame refused to accept the money, but just before the
door closed, the original passenger thrust a $5 bill at her and
waved goodbye.

<P>
   With June and its weddings once more upon us, Lee Stokes Hilton
recalled her June wedding day almost a quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Jim, were leaving their reception when they
realized they had not arranged for a car to take them to the
airport. A cab was summoned and her suitcase was put in the trunk.
As they waved goodbye to their friends, she discovered that,
perhaps because of the flurry of wedding plans, something else had
been overlooked. The groom had forgotten to pack a case.
</P>
<P>
   The address of his bachelor apartment was given, and on arrival,
Jim Hilton dashed out of the cab to pack some things, promising to
be right back. The sequence of events wasn't lost on the cabby.
``You two just get married?'' he asked. Yes, Lee Hilton replied,
adding, ``We're going on our honeymoon, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes of silence, the driver said, ``You wait
here,'' jumped out of the cab and trotted off.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Jim Hilton reappeared. ``Where's the
driver?'' he asked, and Lee Hilton admitted that she didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   But before another minute had passed, the driver returned with a
large brown-paper bag in hand. ``I got this for you,'' he said, and
thrust the bag at Jim Hilton. Inside was a chilled bottle of
champagne.

</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   It was a chilly day and I was waiting inside the ATM vestibule
of a bank, watching for an M104 bus. An attractive young woman
entered, pushing a stroller with a toddler in it, and accompanied
by two small dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The woman stopped short and yelled at one of the dogs, named
Henry, ``Don't do that.'' In front of Henry was one of the baby's
socks, and although the baby seemed quite content with one sock,
the mother wasn't. She hollered again at Henry and pulled the sock
onto the baby's bare foot.
</P>
<P>
   Henry waited a moment and proceeded to pull the sock off the
baby's foot again. He dropped the sock on the floor and looked at
the now distraught young woman. ``Stop that,'' she yelled, and
pulled him away from the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Then the mother started to negotiate her way through one of the
inner doors leading into the bank. She accidentally brushed against
an adjacent door, which opened just enough that when it was
released, it hit her other small dog, whose name was Oscar, on the
rump.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was laughing while apologizing to him, but Oscar
looked as though apologies didn't make up for life's being so
unfair. The expression on his face seemed to ask, ``Why am I the
one being hit on the rump when it's Henry that's doing
everything?''
</P>
<P>
   I remember thinking about how the woman could handle it all _
the toddler and stroller and dogs and door slams _ and that she was
a real New Yorker. But then again, so was Henry.

(With BUSH-INFLUENCES-EXCERPTS) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ask Gov. George W. Bush of Texas about the
intellectual origins of his campaign's mantra and he says,
``Compassionate conservatism is first and foremost springing from
the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet well before the Bush began building his presidential
campaign around the words ``compassionate conservative'' _
reshaping the image of his party to follow suit _ a cadre of
thinkers on the right had been trying for years to fashion a form
of conservatism that rejected the welfare state but did not turn
its back on the poor. And with his campaign strategist, Karl Rove,
acting as his guide, Bush began reading their books and meeting
them, even before his first race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rove gave him ``The Dream and the Nightmare,'' a book by Myron
Magnet of the Manhattan Institute that Bush says helped crystalize
his thinking about culture. The book is an indictment of the
attitudes of the 1960s counterculture and its legacy to the poor.
Rove also introduced Bush to Marvin Olasky _ a proponent of 19th
century charity over the entitlements of the welfare state _ whom
the governor now calls ``compassionate conservatism's leading
thinker'' in a forward to Olasky's newest book.
</P>
<P>
   Those moments amounted to the first building blocks toward the
``compassionate conservative'' platform Bush is running on today:
tax incentives that he predicts will lead to an explosion of
charitable giving; an emphasis on using religious institutions to
deal with poverty, drug abuse and other social problems and a
pledge to ``usher in the responsibility era,'' to replace the
notion that ``if it feels good do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The core concept of this platform is that while government has a
responsibility to provide services for the needy it does not have
to provide them itself. This philosophy can be seen in everything
from Bush's proposals for a tax credit to help people purchase
health insurance to his call for some Social Security payroll taxes
to be diverted into individual investment plans.
</P>
<P>
   As Stephen Goldsmith, Bush's chief domestic policy adviser,
describes it, ``compassionate conservatism means providing help in
such a way as to stimulate and reinforce self-governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughts have been germinating for years, and the Bush
campaign drew from several different schools of conservative and
neo-conservative thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Magnet, start with a scathing critique of the
attitudes of the 1960s and essentially blame liberalism for
creating an entrenched underclass. Others base their views on Roman
Catholic teachings that social problems are best dealt with by the
institution closest to those who are suffering.
</P>
<P>
   And still others are Republican politicians, like Rep. John
Kasich of Ohio and former Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana, who have
argued that the Republicans who put time limits on welfare benefits
in 1996 could not just wash their hands of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we match our skepticism about government with a bold new
definition of public compassion?'' Coats asked four years ago.
``Can we dismantle a destructive welfare culture, and still fulfill
our responsibilities to the disadvantaged?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself describes ``compassionate conservatism'' as more
rooted in values than an intellectual movement. ``It is the
understanding that lives can be changed and that cultures can
change,'' he said in a recent interview. ``The origins are not just
logical thought and inspirations from writings.''
</P>
<P>
   And he does not seem as steeped as his aides in the lineage of
the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``News to me,'' Bush said when told that former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich had been captivated by many of the same writers he
had. And while Gingrich not only read Olasky's ``The Tragedy of
American Compassion'' but handed it out to freshmen legislators in
1995, Bush said he had primarily learned about Olasky's concepts
from talking with him, rather than from reading his books.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is clearly devoted to the new conservatism. As governor
he has promoted hostels for welfare mothers and legislation that
encouraged religion-based drug treatment centers and prison
ministries. And when the time came to assemble his campaign staff,
he tapped two apostles of compassionate conservatism: Michael
Gerson, his chief speechwriter, had been a senior aide to Coats,
and Goldsmith, his chief domestic policy adviser, had tried to
create a laboratory for compassionate conservatism as the mayor of
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back to 1996,'' Goldsmith said, ``the Republicans'
message was that government had been harmful. Therefore, eliminate
government, and people in tough circumstances will suddenly be
better off. Both the public and many Republican mayors said that's
naive. Merely the absence of bad action is not going to be
sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bush made the overhaul of welfare, one of the main planks
of his first campaign for governor and later wrestled with it after
his election, Rove arranged for Bush to meet conservative academics
like James Q. Wilson, who has long studied character and social
policy, and urban problems and crime, as well as Olasky and Magnet,
who were looking for the reasons for entrenched urban poverty. As
Magnet, who had been a scholar of Dickens, put it, ``Weren't
dizzying contrasts of wealth and poverty supposed to have gone out
with Dickensian London?''
</P>
<P>
   Magnet, whose book is subtitled, ``The Sixties' Legacy to the
Underclass,'' charged that the youth of the '60s, with their sexual
revolution, disdain for bourgeois culture and praise for
alternative lifestyles ``permitted, even celebrated, behavior that
when poor people practice it will imprison them inextricably in
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   And in ``The Tragedy of American Compassion'' Olasky, whose
personal pilgrimage led him to become first a Marxist and then an
evangelical Christian, concluded that 19th-century America's
religious-based charity was preferable to the welfare state. He
thought that the social revolution of the 1960s was ``disastrous''
because it emphasized public assistance as an entitlement, asking
nothing in return. The ``key contribution'' of the War on Poverty,
he wrote, was ``the deliberate attempt to uncouple welfare from
shame.'' Religious charities of the last century, he argued, were
more effective because they made demands in exchange for their aid
and because they required the donors to give time as well as money.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the counterculture struck a chord with Bush. ``It
really helped crystalize some of my thinking about cultures,
changing cultures,'' he said in the interview, ``and of part of the
legacy of my generation.'' Bush quickly acknowledged, though, that
``positive things'' also came out of the activism of the baby-boom
generation, like environmentalism and the women's movement.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush also met David Horowitz, once a voice of the
New Left, who later turned conservative. In his book ``Destructive
Generation: Second Thoughts About the '60s,'' written with Peter
Collier, Horowitz branded the 1960s as a time when ``the System _
that collection of values that provide guidelines for societies as
well as individuals _ was assaulted and mauled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also owes an intellectual debt to Catholic
neo-conservatives who have based their advocacy of empowering
grass-roots groups on concepts articulated by several papal
encyclicals. As described by John J. DiIulio, Jr., a University of
Pennsylvania professor who has become a leading researcher into
faith-based social services, the idea is that ``charity begins at
home. You always try to solve serious social problems as close to
the people as possible.'' In other words, the federal government
steps in only when problems become too big for other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of compassionate conservatism argue that it erodes the
wall between church and state and may force religion on the poor in
exchange for aid. They also ask whether the concept really offers a
way to eliminate government's responsibility to the poor. Arianna
Huffington, once an acolyte of the Gingrich revolution who ran an
organization with Olasky to promote such ideas, now counts herself
a skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you take what works and make sure it reaches enough
people?'' Huffington asks. ``Can that really be done without the
raw power of government appropriations, given that the private
sector has not been forthcoming?'' She said she once thought that
if government were scaled back the private sector would step
forward. Instead, she realized ``how much easier it was raising
money for the opera or a fashionable museum.''
</P>
<P>
   And even inside the compassionate-conservatism movement there is
debate about how far to go. DiIulio, a self-professed New Democrat
who has also advised some of Vice President Al Gore's aides, said
he does not believe the civic sector can replace government as a
means to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Olasky, though he proposes a step-by-step testing
of faith-based programs and tax credits for charity, seems eager to
use them to eventually replace the federal safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must place in the hands of state officials all decisions
about welfare and the financing of it, and then press them to put
welfare entirely in the hands of church and community-based
organizations,'' Olasky has written.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these differences of opinion were hashed out for Bush in
early 1999 when a group assembled by Goldsmith met with Bush and
his top aides in the governor's mansion to prepare for the coming
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   DiIulio and Olasky were there. So, among others, were Wilson and
Robert L. Woodson Sr., the founder of the National Center for
Neighborhood Enterprise, a nonprofit organization that assists
neighborhood groups battling drugs, youth gangs and teen pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, too, had gone on an intellectual journey, parting ways
with former activists in the civil rights movement to become a
leading black conservative in favor of social programs built around
class, not race.
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps four hours that day, as the group discussed policies
directed at the poor, Bush asked what would work and what would
not.
</P>
<P>
   They did not all agree. ``True to my New Democrat profile I made
very clear, for me at least, it's not about ministry vs.
Medicaid,'' said DiIulio. ``You're not going to solve these
problems with just faith-based approaches. There's not enough money
in civic society.''
</P>
<P>
   Olasky recalled that Bush was less interested when the
conversation touched on tax policy and tax credits and more engaged
by the discussion of particular faith-based institutions.
</P>
<P>
   He attributes Bush's interest in faith-based charitable
institutions to Bush's personal conversions in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to me to feel a real connection with these inner-city
faith-based groups,'' Olasky said. ``He went through religious
change at the same time he gave up drinking, so he understands even
though he is from a very different economic background.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later when he spoke in Indianapolis about using churches
and neighborhood groups to help the needy, Bush straddled the views
that had been aired that day.
</P>
<P>
   Like Olasky, Bush said charity should make demands of its
recipients. ``At Teen Challenge _ a national drug treatment program
_ one official says we have a rule: If you don't work, you don't
eat,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is demanding love,'' he said, ``a severe mercy. These
institutions, at their best, treat people as moral individuals,
with responsibilities and duties, not as wards or clients or
dependents or numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also reflected the ideas of DiIulio, saying, ``We will
recognize there are some things that government should be doing _
like Medicaid for poor children. Government cannot be replaced by
charities _ but it can welcome them as partners, not resent them as
rivals.''

GORE SPREADS THE WORD VIA `VALIDATORS': HE IS OK
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When he was in Seattle last week, Vice President Al
Gore dropped by a fund-raising reception for Gov. Gary Locke of
Washington. The governor, in introducing the vice president to the
crowd, followed a script suggested by Gore's presidential campaign.
And here is what the campaign wanted these people to know:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only a great person, but he's very funny,'' Locke
said of the vice president. He is ``a person who is committed to
his family,'' Locke went on. ``He is always picking up the phone to
check on his mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke, like countless others who are introducing Gore around the
country these days, is what is known in the trade as a
``validator,'' or a character witness, someone who can reassure
voters that the real Al Gore is a decent man, a family man, a good
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has been campaigning intensely for more than a
year now, and has been in public life for nearly a quarter century,
he is still having trouble getting across this basic message. That
is one reason the campaign is enlisting scores of validators _
Democrats like Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana and Sen. John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts _ and deploying them on talk shows and the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of validators is just one element of a new phase
of the Gore campaign, which includes a media blitz he plans to
begin Tuesday in New York, one so extensive that it will almost
seem like a re-launch of his campaign, as he begins a ``progress
and prosperity tour'' across the mid-Atlantic and Midwest states.
The new phase also features a multimillion-dollar advertising
campaign, a retreat from harsh assessments of Bush and a cheery
message of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Gore, the shift in strategy plays into one of
the Republicans' chief criticisms of him _ that he lacks
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore Reinvents Himself _ Again!'' blares a press release
from the Bush campaign. It goes on to list six Gore incarnations
since last summer: the underdog, the average Joe, the alpha male,
the crusading reformer, the negative attacker and, now, the
thinking man with a heart.

FOR MANHATTAN'S WEALTHY PARENTS, TIPS ON BRAT CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
  By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If your 5-year-old asks how much money you make, and
you make tons, then the appropriate reply is, ``That is not a nice
question.''
</P>
<P>
   If your 22-year-old gives a big, boozy party and breaks up the
million-dollar apartment that you just bought as a graduation gift,
then that child is not yet ready to be trusted with serious
inheritance money.
</P>
<P>
   If your son insists on marrying someone who is poor, then, as
soon as is seemly, you should persuade the future daughter-in-law
to sign a prenuptial agreement. After the signature, it is prudent
to smooth ruffled feathers with a sizable cash gift that says,
``Welcome to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   These and other strategies for raising the rich in Manhattan
were served up last week in an auction room at Christie's filled
with wealthy parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Rich kids are something of a growth industry in Manhattan and
across the country, as the number of families worth $10 million or
more has jumped more than fourfold in the past decade to 275,000
from 65,000, said Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New
York University and editor of The Review of Income and Wealth.
</P>
<P>
   At least 41,000 of those families live in New York City,
constituting the largest concentration of the rich in any American
city, Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's strategy session at Christie's marshaled the
expertise of four rich-kid specialists _ a headmaster at a private
school, a lawyer specializing in trusts and estates, a child
psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. Together, they explained how to
increase the odds that children who know they will never have to
work for a living will turn out to be something other than pouty
layabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of people have made an enormous amount of money
and are scared what it is going to do to their kids,'' said Dale
Burch, who organized the box lunch and panel discussion, for which
tickets cost between $100 and $500. It was the second such panel in
two years at Christie's, with proceeds going to charity.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal rich kid that the experts talked about would grow up
to be a hard-working adult _ smart with investments, inclined to
philanthropy and comfortable in social settings with the nonrich.
</P>
<P>
   Unmentioned by the press-shy parents at the box lunch were the
flame-outs, drug overdoses and suicides that periodically burn the
names of rich families _ and their profoundly unhappy progeny _
into the public mind.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan in the past 13 months, Raphael de Rothschild, 23,
heir to one of the largest fortunes in the world, died of an
apparent heroin overdose on a sidewalk; Robert Bingham, 33, a
promising fiction writer and heir to a newspaper fortune, died of
an apparent heroin overdose in his loft; and William Woodward III,
54, scion of a society family known as much for violent deaths as
for wealth, took off his slippers and jumped to his death from his
14th-floor apartment on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Judging from last week's two-hour advice session (and a
videotape of last year's), three particularly vexing clusters of
trouble confront parents trying to raise well-adjusted children in
Park Avenue circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   First, motivation and discipline. Or, ``You can buy whatever you
want without lifting a pudgy finger,'' as Hume R. Speyer, the
trusts and estates lawyer on the panel, summed up the fundamental
risk facing rich children.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should show their children, by example, that meaning in
life comes from work, education and concern for others _ not from
buying and bragging about clothes, cars, airplanes, apartments,
summer houses and fancy foreign vacations.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, parents should insist that children do real work
around the house, even if it means ordering servants to back off
and let a child wash a dish, vacuum a rug or clean a closet.
Parents should meet regularly with other parents to compare
allowances, credit-card policies and set rules for how much money
rich children can spend on one another.
</P>
<P>
   The second difficult area is dealing with those who are not
rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have to fly coach so my son will not alienate other
kids?'' asked one parent, who said he could not control his son's
bragging about family money.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said such bragging was common among insecure rich kids
trying to establish a sense of self. To smooth a child's entry into
a world where most people are not rich, the panel agreed, parents
should talk early and often with him about family money _ and about
the obligations that go with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be honest and matter of fact with children inside the family
about the money,'' said Speyer, the lawyer, who advises starting
frank discussions about money when children are in their early
teens. He said the chats should become more detailed _ and should
be supported with paperwork from brokers and banks _ as a
teen-ager's capacity to understand increases.
</P>
<P>
   But in all these conversations, Speyer said, parents should draw
a firm line between proper discussions of money inside the family
and improper boasting about money with friends and all other
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``By not acting like an extremely rich person,'' he said, ``you
may not be treated like an extremely rich person, and that is a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The third problem was whether parents owed their children a
permanently luxurious lifestyle, a question that seemed to arouse
the most passion from panelists and parents.
</P>
<P>
   All the experts argued that parents did indeed owe their
children continuity with the lives to which they had become
accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have lived themselves a life of plenty, that is all
they will have learned in their lives,'' said George P. Davison,
head of Grace Church School, a private school in Manhattan. ``They
will have been really good at it in order to please you as their
parents. Then, after doing everything right for 21 years, you say,
`Sorry, you are out.' Of course, they are going to be angry. Of
course, they are going to be uncomprehending.''

EDITORIAL: HOW TO MOVE THE SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 12:
</P>
<P>
   With 1.1 million students spread across 1,100 buildings, New
York City's public schools have historically contained some of the
best and worst schools in the country. The problem is finding a way
to extend teacher talent and enthusiasm for learning beyond those
schools that have traditionally flourished to schools at the low
end of the performance scale.
</P>
<P>
   The system has a long way to go to reach this goal. But as the
school year draws to a close, New York City's schools are showing
indisputable signs of improvement as measured by state and local
reading tests.
</P>
<P>
   To solidify and build upon these gains, the city and the state
will need to commit more energy and money to two vital objectives.
The first is attracting the most talented teachers into the
lowest-performing schools. The second is to build more schools as
quickly as possible, to alleviate poor conditions and overcrowding
that typically make the best teachers go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The school system will also need to assure that funds are
directed to teacher training and other instructional needs instead
of to administrative activities that have less to do with improving
academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   This school year got off to a chaotic start, with the system
roiled by uncertainty over whether then-Schools Chancellor Rudy
Crew would stay or go. The Board of Education finally voted to buy
out his contract and seek a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Then the search for a successor turned into a political
slugfest, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani worked to undermine the prime
candidate, Harold Levy, on the grounds that Levy was too close to
the teachers union. The board's willingness to appoint him over
Giuliani's objections came as a relief to New Yorkers who had grown
tired of political brinkmanship at the expense of the city's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Levy got the permanent job after impressing the board during his
stint in the interim post. He pushed the state Legislature for a
bigger share of state aid, started a review of the system's huge
bureaucracy and began to streamline the disciplinary procedures
through which incompetent teachers are removed.
</P>
<P>
   As for student performance, Levy is reaping the results of four
years of intensive work by Crew, who devoted himself to high
standards and championed the belief that all the system's children
can learn. This gospel of high achievement allowed the system to
boost reading scores slightly for three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   But the system posted the largest gains yet just recently, when
both state and local reading scores showed significant improvements
all over the city, even in some of the most troubled districts. To
a large extent, these improvements are attributed to Project Read,
an intensive program that provides children with small-group
instruction after school or during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Though encouraging, the most recent test scores show a clear
division between middle-class neighborhoods, which are improving
quickly, and poor neighborhoods, which are improving at a slower
rate. It is no secret that schools in the poorest neighborhoods
suffer the worst overcrowding and are staffed by the least
experienced teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, recent surveys show that the most talented teachers
are the first to leave for the suburbs, citing not just higher pay,
but also the need for relief from huge and unwieldy classes.
Stopgap solutions are imposing an educational cost. In Queens, for
example, the city has eased overcrowding by running two split
sessions that cheat students of one or two class periods per day.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature has wisely committed itself to provide
incentives that could lure more experienced teachers to
low-performing schools and keep them there. But the class-size
problem will remain insoluble until more money is found to build
some badly needed schools.

STEPS TAKEN TO TRANSFER POWER IN DAMASCUS TO ASSAD'S SON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS _ President Hafez Assad's son Bashar was named
commander of Syria's armed forces Sunday, virtually guaranteeing he
will lead a country that knows little about him beyond a reputation
for honesty, a penchant for surfing the Internet, and a passion for
the music of Phil Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old former eye doctor was appointed to the top
military post by Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam, a government
spokesman said, the day after his father, whose health had been
declining for years, died at the age of 69.
</P>
<P>
   The state television also said that the leadership of the ruling
Baath Party had voted unanimously to nominate Bashar Assad for the
presidency. The rubber-stamp parliament will reconvene on June 25
and is expected to approve the nomination and then carry out an
election in which Bashar would be the only candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad survived nearly 30 years of wars, coup attempts,
assassination plots, diplomatic isolation and a struggling economy,
and Syrians have feared that a power vacuum and instability could
consume the country and the region when he died.
</P>
<P>
   But it appeared Sunday that Assad's careful grooming of Bashar
over the last six years has paved the way for a smooth transition
of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be pretty well orchestrated,'' said a Western
diplomat in Damascus. ``Dissent, one way or another, is going to be
kicked in the back row of the theater. The sense is that they are
going to orchestrate this right through, and then people will sit
by and watch for four, six, or eight months down the road and
assess how it's going.''
</P>
<P>
   That Bashar Assad will inherit power seems inevitable, but
whether he can hold on to them remains an open question. There are
many vying military and business interests in a regime that was
famously insular, secretive, and ruled by fear. It is too early to
tell if Bashar Assad may have enemies lurking in the corners
plotting to derail his consolidation of power.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the streets of Damascus are clogged with an outpouring
of grief at the loss of Hafez Assad and well-organized marches in
support of his son. Posters with Bashar's boyish face and
well-groomed mustache are cropping up on corners and lightposts and
walls all over the city.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians thronged the capital throughout the scorching heat of
midday and into the cooler winds that come at night. In the
downtown Omayad Square, young teenagers dressed in black headbands
chanted, ``God, Syria, Bashar.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands wept and waved placards of Assad's smiling face in
front of the hospital where his body lay before a state funeral
scheduled for Monday that is expected to be an extraordinary
gathering of world leaders and dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Youths beating drums conducted solemn funeral marches, some of
which seemed less than spontaneous. Observers suggested they had
been organized along the lines of the different government
ministries, political youth organizations, and Baath Party
districts. A fleet of old buses was used to bring Syrians from
every corner of the country to take part in the capital's
street-level expression of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at our eyes. We cannot express our sadness,'' said Ahalam
Alia, 25, a government employee who, like Assad's family, hails
from the northern coastal region near Latakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take comfort that Bashar will be like his father,
God willing. All the people are with him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Assad's often brutal rule, there was not a bad word to
be heard about him or his regime on the streets. It seemed to be
more than just fear of speaking out, but a sincere appreciation
that Assad had held the country together through a tumultuous three
decades in the Middle East. And there was optimism about Bashar and
his apparent interest in opening up Syria's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our dream for the future,'' said Jamal Saleh, 17, dressed
in black and carrying a poster of Bashar. ``And he will be like his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Saleh said he dreamed of working in computers, and that Bashar
was a leader who could make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet and computers are very important for us, he knows
this very well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad has struck a chord with young Syrians by arguing
that Syria, where the Internet is strictly controlled and satellite
dishes are outlawed, must adapt itself to the age of technology and
the openness it engenders. Introducing technology, he maintains, is
the best way for Syria to move beyond the centrally controlled
economy that has bogged down Syria with 30 percent unemployment,
strict restrictions on trade, and an unstable currency.
</P>
<P>
   The daunting challenge of learning to lead Syria fell upon
Bashar after his brother, Basil, was killed in a car crash while
rushing to catch a plane in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Basil was regarded as more charismatic and outgoing. Bashar, who
is fluent in Arabic, English and French, is more modest, even
awkward. Until his brother died, he was quietly studying
ophthalmology in London. Now, at times, he is caught on television
or in newspaper photographs with his sunken eyes appearing consumed
with worry about the responsibility he has inherited.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bashar Assad's most difficult tasks will be to preserve
his father's base of power among Syria's Alawite minority,
historically an underprivileged and oppressed rural group that
numbers 12 percent of Syria's 17 million people. Many Alawites,
incuding the senior Assad, joined the military as a means of social
mobility. Today they form the military elite that has clung to
power through Assad's authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   But for Bashar Assad to be successful in bringing Syria out of
its economic troubles and diplomatic isolation, he may have to
challenge this very elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Alawite circle that surrounded his father had tight bonds
with an often corrupt merchant class which some academics here
dubbed the ``merchant-military complex.'' A significant part of
Bashar Assad's popularity is that he has already taken on a public
campaign to root out this corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The Alawites' dominance relies on their control of the military.
Some analysts said the Alawites are hesitant to sign an accord with
Israel because, as Glenn Richardson of the University of California
at Berkley put it, peace would diminish their importance and ``put
the perpetuation of Alawi rule at risk.''

PETAR MLADENOV, BULGARIAN COMMUNIST LEADER, 63
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Eds: cq Petar)  By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Petar T. Mladenov, who served for 18 years as foreign minister
of Bulgaria under the communist strongman Todor Zhivkov, then
helped to oust him and became the country's president, died on May
31 in Sofia, the state news agency BTA reported. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Mladenov underwent bypass surgery in Houston in 1986 and was
believed to have been in frail health since then.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line communist rule in Bulgaria did not collapse because of
street demonstrations, as it had in Romania, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany. Rather, it fell in a coup when reform-minded
communist leaders, including Mladenov, seized control of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Mladenov became president in November 1989, and startled the
nation when he declared a month later that the communist monopoly
on power should be abandoned and that free parliamentary elections
should be held that year.
</P>
<P>
   But change did not take place rapidly enough to satisfy many,
and Mladenov was forced to resign in July 1990 in a dispute over
whether he had suggested that tanks be used to disperse
antigovernment demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Mladenov was born to a family of peasants in the village of
Toshevtsi. His father was killed in 1944 while serving with the
antifascist partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a parent in the fight against fascism established
Mladenov after World War II as a patriot, and aided his rise
through the ranks of the communist government.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from a military school, he entered Sofia
University, and in 1963 graduated from the Moscow State Institute
for International Relations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, at 35, he was elected to the central committee of the
Bulgarian Communist Party and appointed minister for foreign
affairs. Six years later, he became a full member of the politburo.
</P>
<P>
   In his role as minister of foreign affairs, Mladenov had to cope
with such embarrassments as the notorious ``umbrella murder'' of
1978, in which an exiled Bulgarian writer who criticized the
Zhivkov government in broadcasts for Radio Free Europe was killed
in London by an assailant who fired a poison pellet from a weapon
disguised as an umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   There were also charges in 1981 that Bulgarian agents were
involved in the attempted assassination of the pope, but they were
acquitted in an Italian trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mladenov is survived by his wife, Ganka, and a daughter.

EDITORIAL: HEALTH TASKS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 12:
</P>
<P>
   Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the largest health insurer in
New York state, cannot earn enough money to survive if it remains a
nonprofit company. But state authorities have dawdled over its
application to convert to for-profit status for nearly four years,
and the Legislature is threatening to exit Albany without approving
Empire's request.
</P>
<P>
   Empire used to be the only insurer to extend coverage to all
individual applicants _ those not covered through employers _ at
rates that did not depend on the applicant's medical condition. But
since 1996, the state has required every managed care plan to
enroll individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Empire's special role ceased. The only way to preserve Empire's
contribution to the uninsured is to approve the conversion. Empire
would turn over all of its stock, worth perhaps $600 million, to an
independent foundation. The foundation would later sell the stock,
using the proceeds to help extend coverage to the uninsured. Empire
would then issue new stock to pay for the information systems and
other hugely expensive investments that are needed to match those
of for-profit plans.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit plans are struggling across the country. The simple
fact is that Empire cannot provide enrollees high-quality service
unless it can raise capital. The insurance commissioner supports
conversion. So does Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general. Four years
is long enough to wait for something that benefits Empire's 4
million enrollees and has widespread approval among the state
authorities in charge of protecting the public interest.

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 12:
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly is expected to vote Monday on a bill that
would require health insurers to pay hospitals and health care
providers more promptly for approved medical services. This is a
sound bill that deserves to be approved by both houses of the
Legislature. Hospitals frequently have to wrangle with health plans
over payment for services provided, and often wait months to be
paid. Unjustified delays can create a financial crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, would
accelerate the time frames for payment of undisputed claims, and
create a dispute resolution system for claims in excess of $500.
The losers would bear the costs of the proceedings. Another
provision would prohibit insurers from denying payment for
medically necessary emergency services because the claim was not
reported immediately. The bill would also create a new fund,
financed by insurers, to protect providers and consumers with
unpaid claims if an insurer goes bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy fund proposal may be controversial as
negotiations proceed between the Assembly and the Senate on this
package. But prompt payment of medical claims has been a tough
problem, and some tightening of the rules is needed.

 LORD MacLEHOSE, 82, GOVERNOR OF HONG KONG AND CHINA SCHOLAR  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lord MacLehose, a British diplomat and China scholar who was
London's longest-serving governor of Hong Kong, from 1971 to 1982,
died May 27 in Ayrshire, Scotland. He was 82 and had run a sheep
farm at Beoch outside Maybole since his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   His term as governor of Hong Kong spanned its transition from a
backwater trading post to a fledgling economic powerhouse. The
colony reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, an event he had
anticipated by working to clarify the ambiguous and often testy
relationship between Britain and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   His pragmatic, hands-on approach drew a tribute from Tung
Chee-hwa, now the former colony's Beijing-sponsored chief
executive, who said he was saddened by the death of a good friend
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Tung said his colonial predecessor had helped root out police
corruption, build a mass transit system and provide public housing
for those who lived in squalid shantytowns. He also was credited
with improving social conditions for the poor and with curbing
illegal immigration from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Lord MacLehose, a tall aristocratic Scotsman known as Big Mac,
was remembered as well for instating free basic education and
opening  &QC; the territory's countryside for recreational use, although
he was faulted by some for not moving Hong Kong toward a degree of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford Murray MacLehose graduated from Oxford University and
served in the navy in World War II before joining the foreign
service.
</P>
<P>
   He was a Chinese linguist and in 1949 was posted to China where
he witnessed the Communist Chinese victory from a consular post in
Hankou.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 he became a political adviser in Hong Kong, and was the
Foreign Office's liaison to the territory's governor.
</P>
<P>
   He was ambassador to Vietnam from 1967 to 1969, and was
ambassador to Denmark when he was given the governorship of Hong
Kong, the first person chosen for that post from outside the
Colonial Office.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement in 1982 he was made a life peer, taking the
title Baron MacLehose of Beoch.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Margaret Noel
Dunlop, and two daughters.

 JOSEPH DiGIORGIO, 69, LANDSCAPE PAINTER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph DiGiorgio, a painter best known for monumental
images of edenic American landscapes, died May 26 at his home in
Manhattan. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Walls, an art dealer and friend, said DiGiorgio died in
his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   DiGiorgio was born in Brooklyn in 1930, the son of Italian
immigrants. During the 1950s he studied art at the Cooper Union and
attended Hans Hofmann's classes in Provincetown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   His mature work was a sophisticated attempt to modernize
19th-century American landscape painting. His rich colors and small
brush strokes seemed to combine Pointillism and Fauvism with Photo
Realism, and the scale and mystical quality of his work reflected
his admiration for the Abstract Expressionists, many of whom he
knew personally.
</P>
<P>
   He tended to work in series, painting related images of subjects
like the Grand Canyon, the California coast and the Hudson River.
He also made 200 paintings of Prospect Park in Brooklyn, 50 for
each season, that were all shown at the Prichard Art Gallery at the
University Museum, in Moscow, Idaho, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   DiGiorgio had his first solo show in Manhattan at the Michael
Walls Gallery in SoHo in 1975. His most recent New York show, at
the Kouros Gallery on East 73rd Street in Manhattan in March,
featured paintings from a series titled ``New York City at Night.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Helen DiLello of Brooklyn, and a
brother, Salvatore, of Port St. Lucie, Fla.

TED GRABER, 80, DECORATOR FOR REAGANS
</HEADLINE>
  By ENID NEMY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Graber, an interior decorator popular with affluent West
Coast social figures who was chosen by Nancy Reagan to redecorate
the family quarters of the White House, died June 3 in Sonoma,
Calif. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Mathison, his longtime assistant, said the cause was
complications from Alzheimer's disease. Graber retired in 1989 and
lived in an assisted living facility in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Graber, whose career spanned more than four decades, was not
considered an innovative designer but rather one whose work was
described as Hollywood traditional, meaning traditional with a
flamboyant edge. Nevertheless, there was little flash in his work.
His rooms generally conveyed a luxurious look and often combined
modern furniture with antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Graber and his mentor and partner, the late William Haines, were
credited with putting large windows in various forms into a number
of the traditional Mediterranean-style West Coast houses, opening
them to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   His clients were a Who's Who of influential Los Angeles and
Hollywood personalities, including Alfred and Betsy Bloomingdale
and Walter and Lee Annenberg. He decorated the New York apartments
of Hollywood figures like Jack Warner and Joan Crawford and was
chosen by the Annenbergs to redo the United States Embassy
residence in London when Annenberg was the ambassador to Great
Britain. He also decorated Sunnyland, the Annenberg estate in Palm
Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The extensive redecoration of the White House family quarters in
1981 cost an estimated $1 million, of which about $822,000 was paid
for by tax-deductible donations. Almost one-third of the
tax-deductible amount came from 23 people in the oil industry.
Graber, who lived in the White House for almost a year, was quoted
as attributing the cost to the fact that almost everything required
attention, from the obsolete plumbing and wiring to the ``falling
apart'' draperies. Little had been done since the era of Jacqueline
Kennedy, about two decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The refurbished rooms included the Reagans' bedroom, which was
done with hand-painted wallpaper depicting Chinese birds. The
president's study was filled with family furniture, although Graber
and Mrs. Reagan retrieved warehoused White House antiques, which
were restored and used in other rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural Digest, the magazine that at the time was allowed
exclusive rights to photograph some of the rooms, quoted Mrs.
Reagan as saying, ``This house belongs to all Americans, and I want
it to be something of which they can be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Graber's White House activities continued until the end of the
Reagan administration. He worked on the decorations for major
holidays and consulted on a number of state dinners, advising on
everything from the menus to the table decorations.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Los Angeles, Graber spent a good part of his youth
with his father, who was a cabinetmaker and an antiquarian. Graber
studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles and served in
the Army during World War II. He then joined Haines, who was
already a well-known West Coast decorator. Haines died in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Graber is survived by Arch Case of Mendocino, Calif., his
companion of 40 years; and a brother, Raymond, of San Diego.

ARIZONA HOME RUNS BEAT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- Scott Schoeneweis got the first hit and RBI of his
major league career Sunday afternoon, but the ball probably will
wind up in the garage and not the trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels pitcher singled with two out in the seventh inning to
drive home Bengie Molina from second to give the Angels a 2-1 lead
over the Arizona Diamondbacks. But after the ball was secured for
safekeeping and Schoeneweis took the mound in the bottom of the
seventh, the ball's value sustained a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   Make that two big hits.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Colbrunn and Danny Bautista hit back-to-back homers with
one out in the seventh, turning a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2
Diamondbacks victory before 36,349 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Only one day earlier, Angels pitcher Jarrod Washburn got his
first major league hit and RBI while pitching the club to a 10-3
win. But Schoeneweis didn't get nearly the same run support, and
consequently he got a different outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care, I couldn't care less,'' Schoeneweis said
of getting his first major league hit. ``I would rather strike out
and put up another zero (in the bottom of the inning). Let the guys
who get paid to do that stuff take care of that.''
</P>
<P>
   And what will he do with the baseball?
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll go somewhere with all of the rest of the crap that's
accumulating,'' Schoeneweis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were in good shape after Schoeneweis' hit, because it
brought up the league's leading hitter Darin Erstad with runners on
first and third. Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter brought in
lefty Dan Plesac to replace Armando Reynoso (6 2/3 innings, 2 runs,
8 hits) and Plesac struck Erstad out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim entered the game for the Diamondbacks in the
eighth, and made quick work of the Angels. He struck out the side
in the eighth (Benji Gil, Mo Vaughn and Tim Salmon) and struck out
two more in a 1-2-3 ninth for his eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's submarine-style delivery obviously fooled the Angels, who
had only one batter -- Garret Anderson with a pop to short -- put
the ball in play against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interleague play you're going against guys you've never seen
before,'' Vaughn said. ``It's almost like spring training. We'll
swing the bats (Tuesday). Interleague is tough, we'll be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia said it wasn't so much the delivery
as it was Kim's ability to simply make good pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not quite a (Kent) Tekulve or a (Dan) Quisenberry,''
Scioscia said. ``He threw a couple pitches at a low three-quarter.
But he's not trying to trick everyone, he made some good pitches.
Whatever angle you're throwing from, that's the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson slugged his 16th home run of the season with one out in
the second inning to give the Angels a 1-0 lead. The lead lasted
until the bottom of the fourth, when Tony Womack singled and
eventually scored on an RBI-groundout by Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   After Schoeneweis gave the Angels a lead with his bat in the top
of the seventh, he quickly gave it right back when he left a couple
pitches up, and Colbrunn and Bautista took advantage by smacking
the back-to-back homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I throw a pitch above the knees, it seems to get hit far
every time,'' Schoeneweis said. ``They don't foul it off, they
don't swing and miss. It seems like one time they should foul it
off. That was the ballgame right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't won a game in it seems like six months (it was May
25). It's been a long time.''

DOOLEY D. SHORTY, 88, NAVAJO CODE TALKER IN WW II 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: N.M., Ariz.)  By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dooley D. Shorty, who helped to train the fabled Navajo Code
Talkers, a team of Marines who used a code based on the Navajo
language to befuddle the Japanese military in World War II, died on
June 4 in Albuquerque, N.M. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo, an Indian language that has no written form, was chosen
by the Marines as the language least likely to be understood by the
enemy. And sure enough, during the war in the Pacific, Japanese
cryptographers cracked the codes of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air
Force but never had any idea what was meant by the sounds they
intercepted on Marine radio broadcasts. Marine commanders could
issue orders and report troop movements in safety.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because the Navajo language has few words for modern
military equipment, Shorty and his colleagues added a second
meaning to some expressions. For example, tas-chizzie, the Navajo
word for swallow, was used to mean torpedo plane. Jay-sho, or
buzzard, was used for bomber. And da-he-tih-hi, or hummingbird, was
a fighter plane.
</P>
<P>
   Shorty was one of the original 29 Navajo men assigned to train
fellow Navajos in the code.
</P>
<P>
   All told, there were about 400 Navajo Code Talkers, and they
worked extremely well. In the first 48 hours of the battle of Iwo
Jima, Navajos sent or received 800 messages without an error.
</P>
<P>
   The code was considered so valuable that it was classified until
1968. Since then, the story has attracted historians, screenwriters
and politicians. The story of these men who fought with their
tongues was recounted by Simon Singh in ``The Code Book''
(Doubleday, 1999), a history of cryptography, and was recently the
subject of a television documentary on the History Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, President Reagan designated Aug. 14 as Navajo Code
Talkers Day.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the U.S. Senate adopted a proposal by Sen. Jeff
Bingaman, D-N.M., to honor the Navajo Code Talkers with medals _ a
gold medal for the first 29 Marines to join and a silver medal for
about 370 others. The proposal, now in the form of an amendment to
the Senate's Defense Authorization Bill, is expected to encounter
no opposition in the House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Most honors would be made posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   Born on June 8, 1911, on the Navajo reservation in Cornfields,
Ariz., Shorty spent most of his life in Albuquerque. For 30 years,
he taught silversmithing at the Intermountain Indian School, one of
the largest boarding schools in the Southwest at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Shorty's survivors include a brother, John Y., and two sisters,
Dorothy Paul and Dolores Miller.

HOUSHANG GOLSHIRI, 63, WRITER WHO SPOKE OUT IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houshang Golshiri, one of Iran's leading secular writers and a
prominent advocate of free speech and human rights in his homeland,
died on June 5 in Tehran. He was 63 and lived in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was meningitis, said a friend, Abbas Milani, who
teaches at the College of Notre Dame in Belmont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Golshiri wrote fiction, essays and literary criticism. Ahmad
Karimi-Hakkak, professor of Persian language and literature at the
University of Washington, said that beginning in 1982, ``when the
new Islamic republic of Iran began its campaign of terror'' against
intellectuals who departed from Islamic orthodoxy, his work could
not be published in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But Karimi-Hakkak said that Golshiri's work had been ``tolerated
there'' since the election of President Mohammad Khatami in 1997,
which ushered in a more permissive political climate.
</P>
<P>
   Golshiri was an outspoken political activist for decades,
advocating recognition of intellectual freedoms and opposing
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   He was a leader in efforts to revive the Iranian Writers'
Association. ``For his part in this effort,'' said Milani, who is
chairman of his college's history and political science department,
Golshiri ``had to face not only the overt threats of the Islamic
regime but the covert, murderous work of its death squads.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 several intellectuals were slain by what the current
government said were rogue elements in the ministry of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The killings led Golshiri's sympathizers to fear that he, too,
would be slain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers still feel the threat of murder,'' Golshiri said in an
interview last year.
</P>
<P>
   Golshiri ``was definitely the most significant sophisticated
fiction writer of his generation in Iran,'' Karimi-Hakkak said.
``His works were urbane, complicated and extremely intricate in
their narrative technique. Those of us who study Persian literature
from an academic vantage point consider him a lasting voice in
20th-century Persian fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Golshiri was particularly admired for his novel ``Prince
Ehtejab,'' which came out in Iran in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Milani said, the author ``captured, more poignantly
than any other Persian novelist, the pathos and pathologies of
Iran's traditional society.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel was made into an Iranian movie that won praise in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Milani said Golshiri was also the author of ``King of the
Benighted,'' a critical novella about Iranian prisons, which has
been published, under the pseudonym Manuchehr Irani, only in the
United States (1990) _ in a translation by Milani _ and in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Golshiri was born in southern Iran, the son of a blue-collar
worker in the oil industry, and received a bachelor's degree in
Iranian literature from the University of Isfahan.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to be, in the 1960s, one of the original founders of
the writers' association. In 1971 he was briefly imprisoned by the
government of Iran's last shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, for having
been active in the association, which voiced opposition to the
shah, and for writing short stories that the government considered
a veiled form of political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the association's members were arrested during the
shah's reign, and as a result it went out of existence for some
years in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Golshiri was one of the leaders of an attempt to revive it in
1979. In 1980, however, the new Islamic regime dismantled the
association, which had criticized it for censorship of newspapers
and for torture in prisons, and did not allow the organization to
be active again.
</P>
<P>
   After Khatami became president, the association was revived
again some months ago, with Golshiri as one of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Farzaneh Taheri, who is a
translator; a daughter, Gazal, and a son, Barbad, both of Tehran.

NY SENATE REPUBLICANS WHOSE SEATS ARE VULNERABLE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (With NY-SENATE-REPUBLICANS)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are the Republicans in the State Senate who are widely
viewed as vulnerable in this year's elections. They are listed in
order, from most vulnerable to least, as seen by a wide sampling of
politicians and political analysts.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GUY J. VELELLA _ Bronx and Westchester Counties. 1996 election:
unopposed; 1998: 58 percent district voter registration (54 percent
Democrat, 22 percent Republican).
</P>
<P>
   Of the districts in New York held by Republicans, this district,
arcing across the north and east Bronx and into southern
Westchester, is the most heavily Democratic. But the greatest
threat to Velella could be from Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan
district attorney, who recently sent investigators with search
warrants to take files from the senator's offices, as part of an
investigation whose purpose has not been revealed. Velella, a
senator since 1986, could face a serious challenger for the first
time in many years. Lorraine Coyle Koppell, wife of a former
attorney general, G. Oliver Koppell, is running for this seat, but
she must first win a Democratic primary against Michael Benedetto.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRANK A. PADAVAN _ Queens 1996 election: unopposed; 1998: 59
percent voter registration (52 percent Democrat, 23 percent
Republican). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this district in northeastern Queens, the minority and
immigrant populations have increased steadily for years, a shift
that could work in a Democrat's favor. Padavan, a senator since
1973, is generally more conservative than his district. His
opponent this year, Rory Lancman, a young lawyer and community
board member, may be the strongest Democrat he has faced in many
years.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NICHOLAS A. SPANO _ Westchester County. 1996 election: 52
percent; 1998: 59 percent voter registration (44 percent Democrat,
28 percent Republican). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spano's centrist politics are a good fit for his district, but
he has had some close calls. In 1996, he had a political near-death
experience running against Thomas Abinanti, majority leader of the
Westchester County Legislature, who is running again this year.
This time, Spano, a senator since 1987, will be taking Abinanti
more seriously, but then again, so will the Democrats, who put few
resources behind the challenger four years ago.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS A. MORAHAN _ Rockland and Orange Counties. 1999 special
election: 53 percent voter registration (42 percent Democrat, 28
percent Republican). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morahan barely won this seat in a special election last year,
and the higher turnout of a general election in a presidential year
traditionally helps Democrats. He faces the same opponent he did
last year, Kenneth P. Zebrowski, chairman of the Rockland County
Legislature. Morahan has been in poor health, a factor that some
Republicans fear will limit his ability to campaign.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROY M. GOODMAN _ Manhattan. 1996 election: 62 percent; 1998: 56
percent voter registration (52 percent Democrat, 23 percent
Republican). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, a senator since 1969, is the most liberal Republican in
the Senate, and is well liked in his Upper East Side district, but
he, too, has had some close calls. In the 1998 election, he had the
weakest showing of any incumbent senator. He could face his
strongest Democratic opponent in years: Liz Krueger, who heads the
Community Food Resource Center and has some family wealth behind
her candidacy. She faces a Democratic primary against Rob
Bellinson, a lawyer who has run against Goodman twice.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KEMP HANNON _ Nassau County.1996 election: 57 percent; 1998: 60
percent voter registration (46 percent Republican, 31 percent
Democrat). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hannon's Republican colleagues sometimes grumble that he is more
enthusiastic about legislation than about campaigning, while
Democrats say he spends more time in Albany than in his district.
His district, strung across the midsection of the county, includes
the largest concentration of minority voters on Long Island, but
this is normally a safe Republican seat. The question, as with all
the Nassau districts, is whether last year's backlash against the
Nassau Republican party carries over to this November. Hannon, a
senator since 1989, faces Anthony D. Macagnone, a member of the
Oyster Bay Town Board and a carpenters' union official, who was
also the Democratic candidate two years ago.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL A. BALBONI _ Nassau County. 1997 special election: 61
percent; 1998: 58 percent voter registration (39 percent
Republican, 34 percent Democrat). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine Long Island districts, this is the one where
Democrats come closest to parity in voter registration. It is also
the place with the freshest example of rebellion by Nassau voters
against the Republican Party. In a special election last month for
County Legislature, in a district overlapping Balboni's, the
Democrat crushed a Republican and an independent. But politicians
in both parties say Balboni, a senator since 1997, has been
tireless and effective at making himself popular in his district.

Republican, 30 percent Democrat). &QL;

<P>
   Marcellino, a senator since 1995, has the advantage that almost
half his district lies in Suffolk County (he also represents the
northeast section of Nassau), where there has been no rebellion
against Republicans. But even his colleagues say he is not much of
a campaigner, and this year he has a fairly well-known opponent.
The Democrat is Lawrence H. Silverman, president of the Long Island

IRVING GOLDSTEIN, 62; OVERSAW PRIVATIZATION OF SATELLITES
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Irving Goldstein, a communications executive who
oversaw the privatization of government-owned satellites, died on
May 26 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He
was 62 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md., and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was esophageal cancer, said his wife, Susan Wallack
Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York state, Goldstein moved to Washington after
graduating from New York University School of Law in 1963. He spent
most of his career at the Communications Satellite Corp., the
government-created company known as Comsat. Goldstein became its
chief executive in 1985, leading it through a period of steady
growth and diversifying its holdings to include overseas satellite
companies and even a professional basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein retired from Comsat in 1992 and become the director
general of the International Telecommunications Satellite
Organization. The organization, called Intelsat, is a consortium of
more than 100 countries that operates a network of satellites that
carry television signals, telephone calls and, most recently,
Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein spent much of his six and a half years at Intelsat
lobbying its members to approve a privatization plan that he
believed would allow the organization to compete against the
growing number of satellite companies, said Allison Barr, a
spokeswoman for Intelsat. The group spun off five of its satellites
into a private company in 1998, Barr said, and plans to become
fully private next year. Goldstein retired from Intelsat in October
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a homemaker and a shipping manager for a lingerie
company, Goldstein grew up in Catskill, N.Y., on the Hudson River
about 120 miles north of New York City, and attended the tiny high
school in the town, Mrs. Goldstein said. Before pursuing his law
degree, he attended Queens College and majored in political
science.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, he worked on the side to help pay family bills
and tuition. In high school, he played clarinet and saxophone and
started a band called the Quarternotes. In college, he drove a taxi
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   After law school, he and his wife, a native of Long Island,
decided they wanted to live somewhere besides New York, she said,
and Goldstein accepted a job at the Federal Communications
Commission. That led him to a job in Comsat's legal department, and
a post in Geneva as the director of the company's European office.
</P>
<P>
   Under Goldstein, Comsat bought a stake in the Denver Nuggets
basketball team, and then the entire franchise, as a way to own
some of the programming its satellites would carry, said Maury J.
Mechanick, a vice president at Comsat. And at Intelsat, Goldstein
pushed the organization to make its satellites able to carry
Internet traffic, and they became among the first to do so, Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein is survived by his wife, who is an actress; two
daughters, Elizabeth, of London, and Jill, of Coral Gables, Fla.; a
brother, Arthur, of Houston; a sister, Dale, of Cottonwood, Calif.;
and his father, Hyman, also of Houston.  &QL;

BELCHER MAY START SATURDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- Tim Belcher is ``penciled in'' to come off the
disabled list and make his first start of the season Saturday in
Baltimore, according to manager Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who had off-season elbow surgery, made a rehab start at
Sacramento for Triple-A Edmonton on Saturday, throwing 85 pitches
in six innings, giving up three runs and four hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go,'' Belcher said. ``I'm done with my
barnstorming tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher hasn't pitched in a major league game since last Sept.
14 and is eager to get back out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only adjustment will be to make sure I'm not too amped
up,'' he said. ``I'm pretty excited, but that's a good thing too. I
I didn't have that feeling of getting excited I probably shouldn't
be here. I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said he knows he's ready and his elbow is fine because
of the way he finished in Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out for the sixth inning knowing it was going to be my
last inning, so I went out and aired out every fastball,'' he said.
``I had to see what kind of velocity I had, and it was very good.
... And everything held together, so that's a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Al Levine likely would get the start if Belcher can't
go, but that isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill also made a rehab start Saturday, throwing 65 pitches
over four innings, giving up two runs (unearned) and five hits.
Hill, recovering from a strained rib-cage muscle, will make his
next rehab start for Edmonton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Dickson, recovering from a strained hip, made a rehab
start for Edmonton Sunday. He pitched 4 fr 1/3 innings and allowed
one run and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got a scare in the second inning Sunday when Troy
Glaus fell to the ground in pain while grabbing his right knee
after being picked off first base. After lying on the ground for a
few minutes and being checked by trainer Rick Smith, Glaus got up
and jogged over to his position at third base without a limp.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus had banged knees with Diamondbacks first baseman Greg
Colbrunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``None, zero,'' Glaus snapped when asked if he considered coming
out of the game. Asked if he thought for a moment the injury might
be serious, he said: ``Have you ever hurt your knee? I haven't, so
I don't know. ... If we had a game (today), I'd be in there ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing Glaus would be a major blow to the Angels offense. Glaus
is hitting .327 with 18 homers (fifth in A.L.), 42 RBI, 50 runs
(tied for third), 145 total bases (fifth), 20 doubles (tied for
second), 47 walks (second), .449 on-base percentage (fourth), .671
slugging percentage (sixth), and 38 extra-base hits (fourth).

STRETCH JOHNSON, 85, TAP DANCER AND ACTIVIST 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Texas)  By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Howard E. Johnson, who danced with the Duke Ellington
Orchestra at the Cotton Club and the Apollo, was a fiercely
committed Communist for 16 years and went on to become an educator
and a social activist, died May 28 at Calvary Hospital in the
Bronx. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Towering in height and, until his later years, pencil thin,
Johnson was known far and wide as Stretch. He had moved to Harlem
last summer from Houston _ one of many stops in his glorious tap
dance of a life.
</P>
<P>
   From the Harlem Renaissance in the '20s to fighting McCarthyism
in the '50s to teaching the history of jazz in the '90s, Johnson
did a little bit of everything, almost always with a wry smile and
not a little swagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life was like a work of fiction,'' said Jean Bach, a radio
producer who was one of his oldest friends, because ``it's so
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Eugene Johnson was born on Jan. 30, 1915, in Orange,
N.J., and was delighted as a boy to find out that his parents had
never married. ``It did not throw me,'' he said in an
almost-completed autobiography. ``In fact, it added to my romantic
notions about being a deviant, an outcast, a revolutionary,
unbounded by the prescriptions of a bourgeois, decadent and corrupt
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he once said his family was so far in the gutter that
they could only dream of climbing up to the street, much less the
curb, he took considerable pride in his father's stardom for the
black baseball teams of the Negro Leagues. He also loved to watch
his father play high-stakes pool, or deal cards with a cheat's
finesse. Johnson missed the old man on the several occasions when
his father was away in prison for various crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But he modeled himself after his uncle, James Anderson, the
founder of The Amsterdam News, which remains the city's most
influential black newspaper. Anderson condemned lynching and
characterized African-Americans as a developing nation as early as
1915. ``I was never ashamed of being black,'' Johnson said in his
autobiography. ``Frustration, anger, rage were more often the
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, the Johnson family moved to Harlem. Johnson's sister,
Winnie, quickly became one of the featured dancers at the Cotton
Club, a famed Harlem nightclub of the 1920s and '30s, where she was
touted by such columnists as Ed Sullivan and Walter Winchell as the
most beautiful woman in Harlem. When Duke Ellington decided he
wanted to add a male chorus line, she volunteered her brother,
despite his concern that he had two left feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never able to get the small-muscle dexterity that close
tapping required, so I compensated with exaggerated movement,''
Johnson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the two recruited a third sibling, Bobby, and performed an
act called the Three Johnsons; it was featured in ``New Faces of
1936'' and the ``Duke Ellington Revue of 1937'' at the Apollo
Theater. Stretch Johnson also acted in a Harlem production of the
Clifford Odets play ``Waiting for Lefty.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, after the Cotton Club got rid of the boys' chorus line,
Johnson, a member of the NAACP since he was 15, joined the Young
Communist League of Harlem; his decision was prompted in part by
the lynching of blacks in the South. He completely accepted the
league's ideology: When he entered the Harlem party headquarters,
he remembered, he thought of the picture of Stalin as ``a brilliant
gray eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   He fought many battles, including one to force Major League
Baseball to accept a black player, passing out petitions in front
of Yankee Stadium. Eventually, he started attending Communist
meetings in Mexico, Cuba and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   His life was defined by struggle, and even his decision to marry
a white woman and fellow Communist, Martha Sherman, was challenged
_ not least by other party members. He dismissed their objections,
and later wrote, ``I was not going to decide whom I would marry on
the basis of prejudices which reflected the past which we were
dedicated to the overthrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple had three daughters, all of whom survive him, as does
Sherman, from whom he was divorced. The daughters are Wini Johnson
and Lisa Johnson, both of Manhattan, and Wendy, Johnson of Paris.
He is also survived by two grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Johnson served with the Army's Buffalo
Soldiers, a segregated unit, winning two Purple Hearts. A leg
injury he received was so severe that he did not dance again for 25
years. After the war, he organized black veterans to fight for
benefits they were being denied in some Southern states. He stuck
with the Communist Party through Stalin's alliance with Hitler,
until the Soviet premier, Nikita S. Khrushchev, divulged the extent
of the evil Stalin did. Johnson said the revelation hit ``like a
ton of bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many former Communists, he had no regrets about his long
allegiance to the party. After he left it, his life took a series
of quirky turns. Central to the story was his recognition that he
was an alcoholic, a problem he first addressed episodically, and,
finally, with membership in Alcoholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to become a printer, and worked at The New York
Times, among other places. He earned a general equivalency high
school diploma, then a degree from Columbia University's College of
General Studies, and taught black studies at the Fieldston School
in the Bronx. He administered the Upward Bound program, which
provided federal money for programs to steer disadvantaged youths
to college for a participating institution, the Ethical Culture
Society. He later taught sociology at the State University of New
York at New Paltz.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as chairman of the Strand Community Organization
to Rehabilitate the Environment, which raised $3 million for
low-income housing in Ulster County, where he lived while teaching
in New Paltz.
</P>
<P>
   His companion in his later years was Ann Anthony, whom he met in
1962 in an art appreciation course at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly to be near family, the two lived in a number of places,
leaving a wake of activism wherever they went. In Hawaii, Johnson
founded an African-American newspaper and led the fight to make the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a holiday; the law
passed in 1989. In the Virgin Islands, he set up a social services
network. In Galveston, Texas, he helped set up a community center
in an impoverished neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He called his religious beliefs ``cosmist,'' which he defined as
believing in God's love permeating the whole universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people said the party wrecked their lives,'' Bach said of
other American Communists. ``Stretch said, `I had a ball.'''

   A New York Times News Service article senr on Monday, June 5
about the World Bank's consideration of an oil pipeline in Africa
referred incorrectly to a recent report by the bank on African
poverty. The study concluded that Africans were poorer than 40
years ago and that a share of the blame belonged to the bank and
the International Monetary Fund. But the contention that the two
organizations had made the continent poorer through failed lending

colossal male is better suited to the ghoulish ones I try to
portray,'' did not mean he never portrayed women. The female form
appeared in a number of his lithographs, etchings and woodcuts.

USC'S PRIOR TO FACE LSU AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. - USC pitcher Mark Prior's prior meeting with
Louisiana State sounds like something better left forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone probably would have, if not for the fact the
Trojans face LSU today in a winners' bracket game at the College
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But once today's matchup was set, Prior's career at Vanderbilt
suddenly became newsworthy, specifically his one meeting against
LSU. Prior allowed six earned runs and 11 hits in 5 innings, but
he's not worried facing the second-ranked Tigers again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little kid last year,'' Prior said. ``I don't feel
overmatched. I think I'm a lot better mentally. Win or lose,
they'll think I'm a better pitcher. It's a way to redeem myself.''
</P>
<P>
   USC certainly hopes so, because today's game is critical, even
if the loser is not eliminated from the World Series. A victory
means the Trojans would have two days off before playing again
Thursday. A loss means playing Tuesday night in an elimination
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it is kind of do-or-die,'' Prior said. ``We need a
victory. We don't have the luxury other teams do because we don't
have a lot of offense. We don't want to get in a situation where we
have to outhit the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU (49-17) is already drawing raves in Omaha, after hitting
three home runs in a 13-5 rout of Texas on Saturday night, and
Prior doesn't expect a pitchers' duel today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know things will happen. There will probably be home runs,
because of the team we're playing and the ballpark we're playing
in,'' Prior said. ``My job is to keep things close so that in the
eighth or ninth inning, maybe we have a chance to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (44-18) played LSU three times in the 1998 World
Series, losing the opener 12-10, before defeating the Tigers, 5-4
and 7-3, in elimination games that sent USC to the championship
contest.
</P>
<P>
   LSU also eliminated the Trojans twice in regional play in 1990
and 1994, although those games were in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost to them more than we've beaten them, that's for
sure,'' USC coach Mike Gillespie said. ``The thing I'm not prepared
for in this Omaha deal is that it has become the northern version
of Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have, to their credit, won over the Omaha fans. When we
played them in '98 and heard the noise, I was astounded. I naively
thought the local people would root for the underdog.''

<P>
   GHAJAR, Golan Heights _ Carrying black flags and a
flower-wreathed portrait of Hafez Assad, the people of this border
village held a memorial ceremony Sunday for the leader of the
country they call their own.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers, members of Assad's minority Alawite sect, chanted
and wept in a demonstration of loyalty to Syria that was repeated
Sunday in the neighboring Druse villages of the Golan Heights,
which was captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war.
</P>
<P>
   In Majdal Shams, the largest village of Druse, a separate sect,
hundreds gathered in the main square under Syrian flags to hear
eulogies and poems of tribute, marching to a border fence to send
condolences into Syria over a sound truck.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ceremony here in Ghajar had a peculiar twist, befitting
a village in limbo at the junction of Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   After Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon last month, United
Nations teams surveying the border determined that according to the
line drawn in the 1920s, part of Ghajar actually lies in Lebanon,
not the Israeli-held Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that a border fence could soon divide families and
separate people from their farmlands, village residents have
barricaded entrances to Ghajar with burning tires and are standing
guard armed with clubs to repel any United Nations teams that might
come to mark the border.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts have been posted to summon the 1,700 residents to the
streets if United Nations vehicles are spotted nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The village will be divided over our dead bodies,'' said Imad
Khatib, 35, a teacher. ``Without our lands we will be refugees.
This is inhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said they were simply marking the border and will
not build a fence. They stopped short of entering Ghajar, surveying
the village by helicopter, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   The village's residents insist that for generations they have
been considered Syrian, not Lebanese, with Syrian identification
papers and property deeds _ a message that was hammered home Sunday
by the memorial ceremony for Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Ghajar are Syrian, and this is Syrian soil,'' said
Salman Khatib, the leader of the local council. He stood in the
village square, near an outlook over the Hasbani River that was
decorated Sunday with a likeness of Assad and a Syrian flag.
</P>
<P>
   Village residents said that in June 1967, when Israel captured
the Golan Heights, its troops stopped short of Ghajar, considering
it Lebanese territory. But the Lebanese authorities, reluctant to
absorb an Alawite community into a land already divided by
religious strife, told a delegation from Ghajar that their village
was part of Syria and warned the group that if villagers crossed
the Hasbani River into Lebanon, they would be shot or jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Residents then invited Israeli forces to take the village with
the rest of the Golan, and the villagers were granted Israeli
citizenship in the 1980s. Many now work in neighboring Israeli
communities and speak fluent Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   Matan Vilnai, an Israeli cabinet minister, visited Ghajar last
week to calm residents' fears, telling them that his government was
in contact with the United Nations and would work to ensure that
the village remained undivided under Israeli control. An Israeli
army vehicle patrolled the village Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Israeli assurance, worried village residents said
Sunday that they wanted to avoid partition at all costs, even if
that meant coming entirely under Lebanese control. A fence, they
said, is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we stay together or we will all die,'' said Mahmud
Khatib, 40, a factory worker who stood guard with a club Sunday at
the village entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Kamal Asad, 36, who also held a club, said: ``We didn't choose
this situation. We've simply stuck to our land. The Berlin wall
came down after 30 years, and it can't be that in the year 2000 we
will be divided by a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a herd of cows that can be split up. We're talking
about human beings. The United Nations is supposed to unite people,
not cut us in two. It should make peace, not pain. This is not
political. We only want to live in dignity.''

MILLER TRIPS UP LAKERS' MARCH IN THE FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Size and position prevent Reggie Miller from ever
waging a genuine duel against Shaquille O'Neal. But for one,
raucous night on his home floor, the corn-silk thin swingman of the
Indiana Pacers pulled back his slingshot and fired. And fired. And
fired.
</P>
<P>
   And when he had finished wiping the perspiration away with his
multi-colored wristbands from another era _ and the Pacers had
survived the Los Angeles Lakers much more than they had scaled
Mount Shaquille _ Miller and 18,345 fans at the Conseco Fieldhouse
rejoiced wildly Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Small-market Pacers 100, big-city Lakers 91.
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding from a dismal showing in Los Angeles much the way his
team did, Miller erupted for 33 points on 11-of-22 shooting and 9
for 9 from the foul line as Indiana made the National Basketball
Association finals a contest instead of a coronation.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers now trail the Lakers by two games to one in the
four-of-seven-game series and can take more solace because they are
host to Games 4 and 5, on Wednesday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was held to  &UR; only  &LR;  33 points and 13 rebounds and made
only three of 13 free throws after imploding for 83 points and 43
rebounds in Games 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers played without Kobe Bryant, whose sprained left ankle
in the first quarter of Game 2 kept him on the sidelines. His
status for Game 4 is not known. After breakdowns on both ends by
the Lakers, they clearly need help on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trimmed Indiana's lead to 4 points twice in the final
three minutes to prevent an embarrassing blowout. But each time
O'Neal and his teammates were on the cusp of finishing the job,
Miller or another Pacer would hit a crucial shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper's driving scoop layup trimmed Indiana's lead to 4, at
89-85, with 2:55 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's two free throws with 2:02 left gave Indiana the
cushion it needed.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose finished with 21 points and six rebounds for the
Pacers, who shot 46.2 percent from the field and outrebounded the
Lakers, 38-33. Travis Best and Austin Croshere combined for 26
points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   With a major role reversal, Sunday night almost resembled Game
1. Like the outplayed Pacers last Wednesday, the Lakers spent so
much energy trying to recover from Indiana's first-half barrage,
they had little left to finish the comeback.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal brought the Lakers within 5 points, at 57-52, midway
through the third quarter as the Pacers fell into a rare offensive
funk. Every call against the Pacers was roundly booed, whether
questionable or not. With the lead slipping away, concern then
panic set in. But it did not last long.
</P>
<P>
   For every overpowering jump hook of O'Neal's released 12 inches
from the rim, Miller answered with a jab-step jump shot. He became
flammable near the end of the period as the Pacers first went on a
12-0 binge and then blew the game open.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's 3-pointer from the right wing with 2:13 left in the
quarter put the Pacers in front, 76-58, and turned Conseco into a
tunnel of sound. He raised his hands and motioning for the fans to
rise from their seats, skipping gleefully down court. Miller time
had finally arrived in the league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   So convincing a victory was transpiring that the Pacers would
not even have to resort to the Hack-a-Shaq defense to try to
throttle O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 10 of the Lakers' first 14 points in the second
period, and for a while it appeared as if he would need 60 to keep
Los Angeles in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting eight for 32 in the first two games and showing
little of the passion and purpose he showed in the conference
finals against the Knicks, Miller locked away the impostor in the
No. 31 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The player who suited up for Game 3 knew his and his teammates'
reputations were at stake. He understood the magnitude of a
possible 0-3 deficit, knowing no team had come back from such a
hole in any seven-game playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, he had 14 points on seven-of-14 shooting. It was
not just his long jumpers hurting the Lakers either.
</P>
<P>
   Miller hung in the air after O'Neal fouled him with 8:10 left in
the second quarter, clutched once and lofted a layup that fell
through. He pumped his fist wildly after the basket, and the free
throw gave Indiana a 30-19 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   After holding a lead of no more than three points in Games 1 and
2, it was easy to see how different a team the Pacers were on their
home floor, where they were a league-best 35-6 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they were rattled by the crowd, thrown off by Bryant's
absence or both, the Lakers had none of the cohesion that carried
them to a 2-0 series lead. They produced 10 turnovers in the first
24 minutes, some of which were unforced and outright clumsy.

A'S JUMP ON GAGNE, DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers rookie right-hander Eric Gagne has talked
to Kevin Brown and Orel Hershiser about what it's like to be a
young pitcher. He knows the learning never stops, but also realizes
the pace is highly accelerated in the first few years of pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne, with 14 big-league starts behind him, finds something new
with every inning, every batter, every pitch. And even with that
understanding, Gagne said it helps very little because he wants to
win now.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes the latest lesson again difficult for the 24-
year-old Gagne to endure. He allowed five first-inning runs and had
trouble locating anything close to home plate. Oakland right-hander
Kevin Appier took the lead and ran off with a seven-hit, 6-0 win
against the Dodgers on Sunday at Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   And losing two of three to the A's was not the way the Dodgers
wanted to head into a four-game series with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just struggled with my control, with my mechanics,'' said
Gagne, who allowed all six runs in five innings. ``My lower body
was too quick and my arm couldn't catch up. ... It's really
frustrating. Right now we're close to Arizona (three games back)
and would like to win four or five and stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   The shutout was the 11th for Appier, who often made the trek
from his Antelope Valley home to Dodger Stadium during his
childhood. In cruising to his first shutout since 1997, Appier
allowed one Dodger to reach third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cool playing there, being that I came here as a
fan,'' Appier said. ``As far as throwing a shutout, that's special
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help the Dodgers hitters that Appier was spotted a 5-0
lead before he threw a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, before Gagne (1-4) recorded an out, the A's had three
runs. Terrence Long singled to start the game, Randy Velarde and
Jason Giambi walked and Matt Stairs was hit by a pitch to force in
the first run. Miguel Tejada doubled to right to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gagne was rushing early,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``Sometimes he has a little problem getting out in front of
himself. He went to his mouth two or three times, was warned and
then (home-plate umpire) John (Shulock) had to get him. He gets all
psyched up. Five days between when he pitches is tough on him right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off his first win of the season, and just second of his
career, Gagne expected much more out of this performance. But it
got worse when Eric Chavez, batting eighth, singled in two more
runs with two outs in the first on a 3-2 pitch. It came with first
base open and Appier on deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets excited out there and is overthrowing the ball a
little bit,'' said Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca, who had two hits.
``After the first inning, he was fine. He has to get over the
little jitters. He gets too pumped up. You can't take it away from
him. I'd rather have that than someone who's scared. He wants to
throw it 100 miles per hour.''

<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Tens of thousands of Syrians streamed into
Damascus on Sunday to mourn their president, Hafez Assad. By
sunset, the crowd had flooded the Umayyad Square near the Chami
Hospital where they believed his body still lay, awaiting Tuesday's
burial, in his hometown of Qurdaha.
</P>
<P>
   In normal times, public gatherings are not permitted in Syria.
But Sunday, under the watchful eyes of security guards, the crowds
of mourners expressed their grief through chants of love and
support for Assad and his son, Bashar, the heir apparent. Some
mourners wept. A group of young men beat their bare chests so hard
they left welts.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting over and over, ``Hafez, the beloved of God,'' in
Arabic, the mourners carried poster-sized photographs of both
father and son. ``Our blood, our soul, we redeem you, Bashar,''
they called.
</P>
<P>
   One young man, seated atop the shoulders of his friends, with a
portrait of Assad stenciled in black on his bare chest, thrust his
fists in the air and implored the crowds to respond with ever
greater adoration for the only leader many of them have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved Assad too much,'' said Rifaat, a taxi driver, who
would not disclose his last name. ``He brought stability to our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the noise and tumult of the streets, Syrian
television played Koranic verses and besides images of mourners,
showed scenes of Bashar Assad meeting with Lebanese officials _
President Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Selim Hoff, and the Speaker
of Parliament Nabih Berri _ at his home. The Lebanese delegation
also went to the hospital where Assad's body is presumed to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the streets where the mourners gathered, the rest of
Damascus was shuttered with the somber quiet broken only by small
bands of marchers. Soldiers blocked the streets near the
president's home, turning away cars and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning continued into the evening as torch-bearing youth
groups marched to the sounds of drums in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Basam Salameh, 17, a secondary student in the crowd, said he
reacted to Assad's death with disbelief. He described the president
as a father for the people, but to many Syrians, he said, the
34-year-old Bashar represents the hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people want Bashar Assad to be president of Syria.
Maybe he can do what the people want for our country and our
population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be the same as his father,'' he said. ``He will do
great things.''

USC'S PERSELL COMES OUT OF NOWHERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. - Considering no colleges recruited Josh Persell
when he graduated from Montclair Prep of Van Nuys four years ago,
there was little to suggest he would be USC's starting designated
hitter at the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people would be incredibly shocked about
me,'' Persell said. ``The experience is kind of surreal. But it's
the greatest baseball experience I've ever had. Perseverance is
what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Persell originally earned a spot on the Trojans roster after his
hitting instructor, Mike Cicione of Tarzana, asked USC coach Mike
Gillespie to give him a chance to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Persell was a reserve walk-on for the Trojans his first two
years but didn't make the travel squad to Omaha when USC won the
College World Series in 1998. Last year, he appeared in 28 games
and hit .309 as a utility player.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until this season that he found a regular spot at
designated hitter and been one of the team's biggest surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Persell went 2 for 3 and scored a run in USC's 6-4 victory over
Florida State on Saturday, and is hitting .346 with nine home runs
and 40 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of fell into a role,'' Persell said. ``It's kind of
overwhelming right now and a dream come true. When we drove into
the stadium here,it was like, `You finally made it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Little ball: USC may be ranked fourth in the nation, but there
probably isn't a less physically imposing team at the College World
Series. No.1 pitcher Rik Currier is 5-foot-9. Catcher Beau Craig is
listed at 5-11, but about the same size as Currier. Second baseman
Anthony Lunetta is also listed at 5-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll win the fight after a game,'' Gillespie
said. ``But baseball is still a game where normal-size people can
still play. Because I'm with them every day, I don't really think
about it. Until you play a team that is physical like Georgia Tech,
then you say `Wow.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' size hasn't made much difference, however, because
Craig has 17 home runs and Lunetta 12. As for Currier, he has a
15-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Star power: As USC ended practice at Creighton University on
Sunday, Texas arrived for its scheduled workout. Among those
dressed in uniform and participating in the practice was actor
Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   He is friends with Texas coach Augie Garrido, the longtime coach
at Costner's alma mater, Cal State Fullerton.

   (NYT13) GHAJAR, Golan Heights -- June 11, 2000 --
SYRIA-LEBANON-VILLAGE -- After Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon
last month, United Nations teams surveying the border determined
that according to the line drawn in the 1920s, part of Ghajar
actually lies in Lebanon, not the Israeli-held Golan Heights. A day
after the death of Hafez al-Assad, Druse and other Golan Heights
villagers who consider themselves Syrian carry portraits of Hafez
al-Assad, Syrian flags and black flags of mourning in Majdal Shams.

   (NYT12) DAMASCUS, Syria -- June 11, 2000 -- SYRIA-SCENE -- In
normal times, public gatherings are not permitted in Syria. But
Sunday, under the watchful eyes of security guards, the crowds of
mourners expressed their grief through chants of love and support
for Assad and his son, Bashar, the heir apparent. Some mourners
wept. A group of young men beat their bare chests so hard they left
welts. Ousama Franza, 25, has a portrait of the man who led Syria
for three decades painted on his chest. (Courtney Kealy/The New

   (NYT11) POTPMAC, Md. -- June 11, 2000 -- SCHOOLS-CHEATING --
Reports of cheating on a state test are being investigated at
Potomac Elementary School in Potomac, Md. The test incident
catapulted Potomac Elementary into the national debate about
whether high intensity standardization tests - driven by
politicians' and parents' demands for firmer evidence of school
improvement - risks skewing education. (Paul Hosefros/The New York

   (NYT10) WASHINGTON -- June 11, 2000 -- SECURITY-ADVISOR-PROFILE
-- James B. Steinberg tends to remain in the background at public
appearances of the president, but his influence as deputy national
security advisor has been widely felt in the Clinton administration
through his role as chairman of the committee of deputies of the
government's national security agencies. Later this summer, he is
leaving his job to join the Markle Foundation in New York to work
on a $100 million project to study the impact of the digital
revolution on international relations and economic development.

   (NYT8) ELMONT, NY -- June 11, 2000 -- RAC-BELMONT-COLUMN-3 --
For the first time in 30 years, the Belmont was run without the
winners of either the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness. The Belmont
Stakes winner, Commendable, had lost six in a row since winning his
debut 10 months earlier at Del Mar, and he ran 17th in the Kentucky
Derby. He was entered almost in desperation by D. Wayne Lukas, the
king of Triple Crown racing. D. Wayne Lukas greet Pat Day and
Commendable after winning the Belmost. The race, which did not have
the top 3-year-olds, drew 67,810 fans. (Barton Silverman/The New

   (NYT7) NEW YORK -- June 11, 2000 -- BUSH-INFLUENCES -- Gov.
George W. Bush has said his political views have been shaped by the
work of Myron Magnet of the Manhattan Instiustute who wrote ``The
Dream and the Nightmare,'' which is an indictment of the attitudes
of the 1960s counterculture and its legacy to the poor. Books like
this helped the development of the ``compassionate conservative''
platform Bush is running on today. The core concept of this
platform is that while government has a responsibility to provide
services for the needy it does not have to provide them itself.

   (NYT6) ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- June 11, 2000 -- ETHIOPIA-MUSEUM
-- Sebatu Gebre Yesus, 79, is a collector from Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia who makes no distinction between the priceless and the
trash. A pair of Baccarat chandeliers from the palace of Emperor
Haile Selassie sit not far from a souvenir thermometer larded with
a fat Napoleon. He began collecting things when he was young and
now everything is on display in a new museum he has opened in Addis
Ababa. The Museum, scheduled to open in May will apparently be the
only private collection in Ethiopia open to the public. (Ian

   (NYT5) ZHONGSHAN, CHINA -- June 11, 2000 -- CHINA-TRADE -- As
China moves closer to its dream of entering the World Trade
Organization, people in the Guangdong Province are nervous. Far
from relishing the prospect of free trade and wide-open markets,
they worry that the new competition could threaten their
livelihood. To enter the WTO, China will have to throw open its
doors to foreign companies. And by reducing tariffs on imports, it
will level its commercial playing field. A worker lifts finished
diapers off an assembly line in a disposable-diaper factory in
Zhongshan, a boom town in Guangdong Province. (Mark Landler/The New

   (NYT4) UNDATED -- June 11, 2000 -- ECOMMERCE-COLUMN -- Consumers
are still abandoning their Web shopping carts at the same rate as
they did in 1998, according to a recent report by Shop.org, an
industry trade group. But now, with e-tailers under increasing
pressure to start actually making money, Web merchants are suddenly
getting serious in their efforts to squeeze whatever cash they can
from site visitors. On marethastewart.com, shoppers cannot tell if
an item is in stock or not. (The New York Times/The New York Times)

   (NYT3) NAPLES, FLA -- June 11, 2000 -- GE-SIX-SIGMA -- Six
Sigma, the quality program that big companies including Motorola,
Honeywell and now GE have credited with squeezing billions of
dollars in costs out of products and processes, without losing
quality or service. It is a statistical method of breaking a
customer's requirements into tasks or steps, and setting the
optimum specification for each part of the process, based on how
the parts interact.At a Home Depot in Naples, Fla., appliances can
be ordered, and delivery scheduled, on General Electric's Web site.

SYRIA-LEBANON-VILLAGE -- After Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon
last month, United Nations teams surveying the border determined
that according to the line drawn in the 1920s, part of Ghajar
actually lies in Lebanon, not the Israeli-held Golan Heights. A day

of the 1960s counterculture and its legacy to the poor. Books like
this helped the development of the ``compassionate conservative''

NEW WAVE OF GANG VIOLENCE FEARED IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By BETH BARRETT and LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Inner-city gang warfare _ symbolized by the
murder of LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks' granddaughter _ has erupted
in an intensifying battle over turf, money, drugs and power among
Bloods and Crips and between Latino and African-American gangs.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of 20-year-old Lori Gonzalez, victim of a gang hit
that missed its target, symbolizes what gang experts, community
activists and emergency medical personnel see as the shattering of
a fragile peace that has lowered crime rates in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department officials note that overall
gang-related crime is down as much as 15 percent citywide this year
but acknowledge that signs of rising tensions are appearing in a
wave of attacks from downtown to the harbor since the May 28
Gonzalez shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Waymon Baker, a former gang member who works in
intervention programs, said efforts are under way to try to bring
leaders of various factions together to try to preserve an uneasy
truce.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like an army. If it appears they're going to lose all
they've acquired, they go to war by any means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   He said concern is high that ``there's going to be a full-scale
war between the black and Latino gangs'' unless intervention
efforts are stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   An LAPD source close to the Gonzalez investigation said the
shooting occurred in supposedly neutral gang territory that is
normally free of turf wars. Samuel Sharad Shabazz, affiliated with
the West Boulevard Crips, was reportedly firing at Ernest Gray, a
member of the P-Stones gang who was a childhood friend of Gonzalez,
but instead struck the chief's granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been going on hot and heavy here for the past couple
months. We believe it's most likely because of territory and drug
sales,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Najee Ali, a community activist and former Crips gang member who
lives in the neighborhood where Gonzalez was killed, said local
gang members say the feud is over control of the crack cocaine
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the gangs are selling crack coke. It's the quickest way to
generate a cash load so they're able to buy more weapons and defend
their drug turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali said Latino gangs outnumber African-American gangs in the
area, fueling the risk of escalating war over control of
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's trying to carve out their own territory and
maintain it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Masterson, a school police officer at Dorsey High, said
that within the past few months, there have been about a half-dozen
shootings on the weekends and after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, it's been escalating,'' Masterson said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least nine gang-related homicides in South
Central Los Angeles in the last month, but police say there is as
yet no evidence the city's on the verge of a full-scale gang war,
nor that territorial battles between ethnic gangs are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Total gang-related crimes are down 15 percent over last year
citywide, said LAPD Lt. Robert Swanson of the Career Criminal
Apprehension Section.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southwest Division, which initially handled the Gonzalez
homicide, there were 134 gang-related crimes through April 30,
compared to 198 during the same period last year, Swanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Lt. Art Miller said he believes the last few weeks'
violence is more the result of dismantling the Community Resources
Against Street Hoodlums anti-gang units in the wake of the Rampart
Division police corruption scandal than a trend. Reconstituted
anti-gang units now are back on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gang crime was down for the last seven months, with the
exception of the last month,'' Southwest Lt. Art Miller said. ``We
expect it to go down now.''
</P>
<P>
   South Central paramedics also said they've noticed an increase
in gang violence going back about six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen an uptick,'' said Los Angeles County Fire Capt.
Brian Askari, whose paramedics are stationed across from Martin
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center and respond throughout gang
territories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've probably seen 10 gunshot cases in the last six months.
It's not at the early '90s level, but it seems like there's two or
three a month now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the San Pedro area, near the Port of Los Angeles, two people
were arrested last week on suspicion of murder and attempted
murder, and are among suspects in a series of racially motivated
shootings _ primarily between Latino and African-American gangs _
in the port area, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and others said the city and local communities should
intervene quickly. ``It's all about money and power in the dope
world, and position in that trade,'' said Baker, who also serves as
local chapter chaplain for The Black American Political Association
of California Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to escalate.''
</P>
<P>
   (more)
</P>
<P>
   Juan Delreal, a 10th-grader at George Washington High School at
108th Street and Denker Avenue, knows about living with the fear of
gangs since he has to tread carefully just going about his life in
gang-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``At nighttime, I'm afraid. When we go to a friend's house, we
walk in a group,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, 27, has lived in the Crips-dominated
neighborhoods of 120th Street and Central Avenue for years, and
says he quickly learned the rules of the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence is just an everyday thing,'' he said. ``So you learn
what might be trouble and you don't go that route.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson, working on his car Friday afternoon in a
neighborhood a few miles from where Gonzalez was killed, shared the
siege mentality of his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they start, they escalate,'' he said. ``It seems like
somebody always has some kind of weapon. Now nobody just fights and
then shakes hands. Now they shoot, or stab or run over you with a
car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have just learned to survive when they walk through
gang areas. You keep your mouth shut and you walk on through.''
</P>
<P>
   It was silence of witnesses that resulted in shooting charges
being dropped against Shabazz about three weeks before Gonzalez was
slain.
</P>
<P>
   The case was dismissed because none of the six victims in the
Dec. 10, 1998, gang-related shooting could be found, resulting in
Shabazz's release from jail, where he'd been held on a $4 million
bail, said Los Angeles District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Sandi
Gibbons. ``It's not unusual in a gang case for all the witnesses to
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   That the gangs are capable of instilling such terror in
community members is a crime, said Theresa Sharp, a parent
volunteer at George Washington High.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we're losing control of our community once
again,'' said Sharp, whose grandson is a freshman at the high
school. ``We need community support.''
</P>
<P>
   Percy Pinkney, state president of the Black American Political
Association, will hold a summit against gang violence in Los
Angeles on Sept. 8-10. ``We want to decrease the violence, decrease
the use of guns and people being able to buy guns.''
</P>
<P>
   He has called on civic and clergy members, elected officials and
community organizations to come up with a statewide plan to deal
with the gang problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's simply too many funerals caused by gang violence. ...
We intend to try to do something to cease it and decrease it,''
Pinkney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tony Pierce, pastor at 1st African Methodist Episcopal
Zion Church on Adams Boulevard, said ministers meet with Parks
regularly to talk and pray about the gang violence in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very saddened by it. I think it's terrible. It's
unfortunate the minority community is hurting itself in this way,''
Pierce said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said many young gang members are manipulated by older
operatives, or outsiders, into running drugs, fighting turf wars
and killing for financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids don't want to be involved, but they don't feel
like they have a choice. Either you're in or you're out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said drugs, poverty and a spiritual void in many gang
members' lives fuel the violence. He said the problem is so
daunting, he's begun to favor prayer in schools and
re-establishment of the draft to put some morality and discipline
back into young lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of children having children. When we were young,
our parents made sure we went to church. These kids aren't going,
and they're not sending their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Masterson, the police officer at Dorsey High, said jobs and
intervention programs for young people are essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be more things for the kids to do, other than
hang out, get drunk and shoot each other up.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said strong community support working with gang leaders
who want to maintain a truce could make a difference. ``Some want
it to fail. They don't care. Their lives are built around the
gangs. But many are really tired of the war, of it tearing the
community apart. The truce will stay on, if those with positive
minds prevail.''

MOSLEY WON'T PASS OSCAR TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shane Mosley is all people say he is. He's
skillful and powerful, fierce and hungry, calm and confident. Most
agree he's one of the best fighters in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he isn't is good enough to beat Oscar De La Hoya on
Saturday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: De La Hoya by late knockout.
</P>
<P>
   This is anything but an easy fight for the WBC welterweight
champ. Mosley is as complete as any opponent De La Hoya has faced
in his eight-year career. No one will be shocked if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mosley has two distinct disadvantages and they will
cost him the fight.
</P>
<P>
   One, he's fighting at the 147-pound weight limit for only the
third time after moving up from 135 and skipping over 140, an
unusual and potentially perilous move. De La Hoya has fought 10
times at 147.
</P>
<P>
   And, two, Mosley has relatively no big-fight experience. He's
had some credible opponents _ James Leija, John Molina and Wilfredo
Rivera, for example _ but has fought in utter obscurity compared to
one of the sport's biggest stars. De La Hoya has faced Felix
Trinidad, Ike Quartey, Pernell Whitaker and Julio Cesar Chavez in
(begin ital)huge(end ital) events.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley is hardly a weak welterweight. He was strong enough to
knock out Rivera last September and Willy Wise in January.
</P>
<P>
   He claims he's much stronger now. He said he could bench press
235 pounds at the time of the Rivera bout but can lift 315 now,
although he claims he doesn't overdo it in the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive, his knockout percentage _ 94 percent, 32
KOs in 34 fights _ is believed to be the best in the history of
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   However, the vast majority of the knockouts came at lightweight.
One must assume his power has suffered after jumping two weight
classes and, at the same time, wonder whether he has yet to grow
into the division.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is a mature welterweight, one who will move up to 154
sometime soon. Rivera, one of three fighters to face De La Hoya and
Mosley, said De La Hoya is clearly the stronger of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Mosley can handle fighters like Rivera and Wise even
as he grows into the division but to cope with the strength and
power of De La Hoya in only his third bout at 147 might be too much
to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the experience issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, as easygoing as they come outside the ring, seems to
have the makeup to handle prefight pressures. He's certainly shown
no signs of cracking as Michael Grant did in the weeks preceding
his disastrous bout with Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The fact Mosley has had an extensive and successful amateur
career and 34 pro fights probably contributes to his veneer.
</P>
<P>
   However, that doesn't compensate for the fact he's never been in
this position before. He's never seen the kind of media attention
he's receiving, he's never fought in front of 19,000-plus screaming
fans or a pay-per-view audience that could approach 1 million, he's
never been the underdog (De La Hoya is about a 2-1 favorite). It
has to take a toll. For De La Hoya, all that is no longer an issue.
He's been through it enough to know how to cope.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mosley might fool those of us who lean toward De La
Hoya in this fight. He certainly has the ability and drive to beat
anyone in the division, including De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   However, the De La Hoya people think they're catching Mosley at
a good time, a time when he's not quite ready for the likes of
their fighter.
</P>
<P>
   And, it appears, they're right.
</P>
<P>
   Word wars: De La Hoya and Mosley have been respectful to one
another leading up to the fight. Their trainers have been less
diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Alcazar, De La Hoya's trainer, said Mosley has only ``a
decent punch, a medium punch'' when asked to assess Mosley's power.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's trainer, his father, Jack Mosley, took exception when
he heard about the comments and went after Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   And he focused his attack on one area Alcazar is particularly
vulnerable: The fact three trainers had been hired to work with De
La Hoya because of limited confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar now works alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He trains Oscar, so he has to say those things or else they
will kick him out of camp,'' the elder Mosley said. ``He has been
kicked out several times before. What does that say about him?
</P>
<P>
   ``.... You gotta take that with a grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   !More Alcazar: Alcazar went further than the comments about
Mosley's power. He said it's going to be ``an easy fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it'll be an easy fight,'' he said. ``It'll be as hard as
Oscar makes it. It's up to him whether or not he sticks with the
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``....As soon as Oscar hits him, he's going to start going
backward. And he doesn't know how to fight going backward. As soon
as he starts taking steps back, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone reminded Alcazar that he also said the Trinidad fight _
in which De La Hoya lost a decision when he ran the final three
rounds of the fight _ would be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar's response? It (begin ital)was(end ital) easy.
</P>
<P>
   `He ran away and lost three rounds. I agree with you,'' he said.
``But what happened the other nine rounds?''
</P>
<P>
   Honest Oscar: De La Hoya can't stand Fernando Vargas the person
but apparently he respects Fernando Vargas the boxer.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked the other day whom he believed were the
most-skilled fighters in the world. To the shock of those who know
his distaste for his Oxnard rival, Vargas' was the first name he
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has said he will never fight Vargas because of
disparaging comments the junior middleweight champ has made
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Antonio Diaz's original opponent, Demetrio
Ceballos, has pulled out of their Friday fight in Indio for medical
reasons. He was replaced by Argentine champion Omar Gabriel Weis.
</P>
<P>
   The fight will be televised on ESPN2....
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is negotiating to fight IBF No.1 contender Ross Thompson
on April 26 on HBO's ``Boxing After Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on that card, Vernon Forrest is finally getting his world
title shot. He'll face IBF No.1 Raul Frank for the vacant
welterweight championship....
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya and Arturo Gatti are near a deal to fight on Sept. 9,
according to Main Events, Gatti's promotional firm....
</P>
<P>
   The next heavyweight in Showtime's big-man series is Andrew
Golota, who faces Orlin Norris on Friday in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Golota is trying to remain in the heavyweight championship
picture while Norris is attempting to come back from a knee injury
he suffered in his bout with Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   A tape of the fight will be televised at 11 p.m.

   What is Hafez Assad's legacy? How should his epitaph read?
That's an easy one. His gravestone should read: ``Hafez Assad,
feared and ferocious President of Syria: He stayed too long and he
died too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Hafez Assad _ for years the Middle East leader most
incapable of change, and then, finally, when he realized that
change was mandatory if he wanted to turn over a stable Syria to
his son, Bashar, he bowed out before getting the really hard stuff
done.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look closely at Assad's ambiguous reign. What do we mean
he stayed too long? Well, in the fall of 1977, just before going to
Jerusalem, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt went to Damascus to meet
with Assad and encourage him to follow Egypt's lead with Israel.
Assad refused, and he spent the next 23 years resisting the
Egyptian approach, and then trying to prove that he could get more
from Israel and give less.
</P>
<P>
   And what does Assad have to show for those 23 years? Not much.
At best he will remembered for what he didn't do, not for any
positive accomplishments: He did not, in his eyes, ``sell out'' to
Israel. He did not meet the embarrassing end of other Soviet-era
dictators who were toppled by popular movements. With his brutal
fist, he did not let ethnically divided Syria fall into civil war
like Lebanon. He did not, like Saddam Hussein, allow himself to be
sucked into a devastating war with the world's only superpower. He
did not lose Syria's grip over Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   So many ``He did nots.'' But not a lot of ``He dids.'' By any
normal criteria, Assad would have to be judged one of the most
overrated leaders ever. Economically, Syria today is a backwater _
the last country in the Middle East to introduce fax machines and
the Internet, a country with a crumbling industrial base, a
corrupt, 19th-century banking system, an utterly backward
educational system and not a single world-class export of any
product or service. If Syria were in Asia, it would be called North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, Assad finally got the message _ that he
had to modernize and open the country. And one of the people
whispering that most often to him was his son and designated heir,
Bashar. So Assad started bulldozing the road, but he left three
huge boulders _ boulders that would have been difficult for even
him to move, but will be even harder for his son, an eye doctor,
who starts with much less legitimacy and none of his father's
godfather-like skills at destroying enemies without mercy.
</P>
<P>
   The first and biggest boulder left for Bashar is modernizing
Syria and shifting the base of Syrian unity from the war with
Israel to building a 21st-century state. President Assad had begun
that task last year with a series of internal purges, but it was
slow going. Assad was ambivalent about opening Syria's windows, and
he had created so many competing power centers, spying agencies and
military units _ all of which reported to him and all of which he
played against one another _ that when he initially tried to turn
things over to his son, some of those power centers resisted. So
father and son started purging: Former Prime Minister Mahmoud Zubi
killed himself last month after being sent for trial on corruption
charges. Former army chief Hikmat Shehabi also was targeted on
corruption charges. But this is an unfinished war, and Bashar will
not consolidate his rule, or be able to push his reform agenda,
without winning some cock fights with other Syrian roosters.
</P>
<P>
   The second bit of unfinished business is the peace with Israel.
Assad refused any compromise with Israel on the Golan, even when
only 200 yards were left in dispute. He also refused to show any
warmth to the Israeli people. Will Bashar be able to summon the
strength and legitimacy to offer compromises his father would not,
but which are essential for any deal with Israel?
</P>
<P>
   The last bit of unfinished business was Lebanon. Israel's
unilateral pullout from south Lebanon has naturally triggered
questions in Lebanon: If the Israelis are gone, why is the Syrian
army still here? Bashar will eventually have to work out a new
basis for Syria's continued presence in Lebanon. Not easy.
</P>
<P>
   It is rather fitting that Hafez Assad died in mid-conversation
on the phone with the president of Lebanon. Because in many ways he
was also in mid-conversation with the people of Syria and Israel as
well. These were conversations too late in coming. Bashar will now
have to finish the calls. I wonder what he'll say.

   LOS ANGELES _ The company: Ebbets Field Flannels, based in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   What they make: Replicas, as close to the originals as possible,
of jerseys and caps from baseball teams of yesteryear. Lately,
they've added a line of football and hockey apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Why they're so special: They're not just something to wear, but
a history lesson comes with it. In fact, this is where teams go for
their special ``Turn Back The Clock'' uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   First, company president Jerry Cohen has been researching and
making these classic reproductions since 1987, obsessed with how
they were produced. He uses only the same lightweight wool blend
material that pro baseball uniforms were made of in the '50s and
'60s, but in the original ``baggy'' style. Every detail from the
buttons to zippers, collars to sleeve lengths are true.
</P>
<P>
   The lettering is hand-sewn felt, and there's even the lost art
of chain-stitched embroidering.
</P>
<P>
   What they have for sale: A 1940-era Pacific Coast League Los
Angeles Angels or Hollywood Stars jacket ($310) may be on the high
end, but it's worth every dollar. As is the 1957 Angels ballcap
($29) with the forerunner ``L.A.'' interlocked letters that the
Dodgers use today.
</P>
<P>
   Gray T-shirts with minor-league team logos are also available at
$18. There's also a group of teams in the ``Blue Route Series'' for
$22 that include the 1903 Nevada Lunatics, 1903 Des Moines
Undertakers and 1910 Santa Rose Prune Pickers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a $175 replica of the 1939 New York Knights home jersey
from ``The Natural,'' complete with the ``Wonderboy'' and Baseball
Centennial patch on the sleeves. (The ``NY'' hat goes for $29; the
jacket for $310).
</P>
<P>
   In the football collection, there's a 1937 Los Angeles Bulldogs
jersey ($59) from the American League of Professional Football. The
No. 13 is what Ed ``Crazy Legs'' Stark wore during their games at
Gilmore Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And in the hockey section, how about a gaudy
yellow-with-purple-trim 1967-68 L.A. Kings sweater ($99)?
</P>
<P>
   In a Father's Day pinch: They have gift certificates (in the
shape of an old baseball ticket stub) that come with an amazing
catalog and a gift card.
</P>
<P>
   How to order: By phone, (800) 377-9777, or through the Internet
site (www.ebbets.com).
