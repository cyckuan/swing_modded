<HEADLINE> Colleges Seek Curbs for Booze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- After too many drinks, a Cornell  
University student falls down a gorge and dies. At Michigan State 
University, a birthday celebration turns tragic after a student 
downs two dozen shots of booze. A Penn State student is found 
clinging to life on her 21st birthday, her blood-alcohol level 
nearly seven times Pennsylvania's intoxication limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Jolted by such recent alcohol-related tragedies, colleges and  
universities around the country are planning aggressive campaigns 
this fall to curb heavy drinking among students. 
</P>
<P>
	That means alcohol-free dorms and parties, agreements with local  
bars, advertising blitzes, notification of parents when their 
underage children are caught drinking -- anything to get across the 
message that drinking can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is not to do away with alcohol consumption -- that's  
not a realistic goal -- but to bring a level of social 
responsibility to alcohol,'' Penn State President Graham Spanier 
told the National Press Club last week. 
</P>
<P>
	A measure of Spanier's commitment will be seen Sept. 10, when an  
ad campaign coordinated by Penn State debuts in 20 national 
newspapers and on 113 campuses to call attention to the problem of 
heavy drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the school year, other materials will focus on  
drinking's possible consequences, including drunken driving, missed 
classes and increased risk of sexual assault and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Although statistics indicate that college drinking is down from  
a decade ago, several recent studies show that binge drinking -- 
five or more drinks in one sitting for men, four for women -- 
remains a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1998 Harvard University study found that 42.7 percent of  
students had been binge drinking in the two weeks before they were 
surveyed, down only slightly from 44.1 percent in a 1993 Harvard 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent study's author, Henry Wechsler of the Harvard School  
of Public Health, says binge drinking rates vary wildly depending 
on the campus, from 1 percent to nearly 80 percent of students. 
</P>
<P>
	But one constant, he says, is that students usually believe  
drinking rates are higher than they actually are. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the message that many schools are trying to convey to  
students: Excessive drinking isn't the norm among their classmates 
and abstinence is cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this can help reassure students that they don't have  
to drink in order to fit in at Carolina,'' says Sue Kitchen, vice 
chancellor for student affairs at the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	A UNC study released in August found that on the most popular  
nights to party -- Thursday, Friday and Saturday -- about two-thirds 
of the 1,790 students tested had no alcohol in their blood. Only 
one in 10 tested had a blood-alcohol content that was at or above 
.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Those findings are touted in stickers and posters placed in  
students' dorms; freshmen who display the posters in their room can 
get $50. 
</P>
<P>
	Students returning to Dartmouth College will see ads describing  
a campus survey that showed 58 percent of students don't think 
alcohol is important at a party. The University of Arizona is also 
spreading the word that most students have ``four or fewer drinks 
when they party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Epstein, associate director of the Higher Education Center  
for Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention, says such campaigns work but 
shouldn't be the only method that schools use. 
</P>
<P>
	Epstein says schools should also look at controlling the sources  
of alcohol in and around campuses and examine how well their 
alcohol policies are being enforced. He praises schools that 
involve parents in discussions about alcohol abuse and tell parents 
when their children violate rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smartest schools have embraced the idea that this is not  
just a problem of the students alone, it's a problem of the whole 
community,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	In Michigan, where last year two people died at Ferris State  
University and one at Michigan State, the state is training 1,600 
resident assistants in alcohol intervention. It's also granted 
$433,000 to 15 state universities for mentoring programs that pair 
older students with freshmen for non-alcoholic activities. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Delaware initiative -- also used at other schools  
-- tells parents when students violate alcohol laws. The university 
has seen a dramatic drop in the rate of repeat offenses, Vice 
President for Student Affairs John Bishop says. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the efforts, administrators and students know that  
some problems will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the two deaths at Ferris State, some students point out  
that hasn't changed some students' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain core of the students that all of the work is  
not making a difference,'' says Dan Burcham, vice president of 
student affairs at Ferris State.

	Hurricane May Miss U.S. Coast  
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- While a strengthened Hurricane Dennis  
struck the northern Bahamas today, there is hope among forecasters 
that the storm may veer away from the United States. The hurricane 
could make landfall around Tuesday, most likely somewhere in the 
Carolinas, forecasters said. But there's a ``glimmer of hope'' that 
this may not occur, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. At 5 p.m. EDT today, Dennis was centered 
180 miles east of Florida's Cape Canaveral.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- A powerful new Russian political alliance  
presented its centrist platform today for December parliamentary 
elections, saying the sweeping powers of the Russian presidency 
should be divided up. The Fatherland-All Russia alliance -- forged 
by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, former Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov and a group of regional governors -- proposed weakening the 
presidency in favor of giving more power to parliament and the 
prime minister.

	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Days of heavy rains have added to the  
misery of Turkey's earthquake survivors camped out in muddy, 
rat-infested fields, and the task of replacing soggy, makeshift 
tents with solid housing has become more urgent. Some of Turkey's 
leading contractors, meeting with government officials in Ankara 
today, said they could build 60,000 prefabricated homes in three 
months, the Anatolia news agency reported. Damage from the Aug. 17 
quake has been estimated at $10 billion, and the government says as 
many as 600,000 have been left homeless. The death toll rose to 
13,893 today.

Boeing workers accept a new contract with the aerospace company. A 
proposal offered by the company early today is ``the best contract 
in the aerospace industry,'' said Bill Johnson, president of 
Machinists District Lodge 751. The workers will vote on the pact 
Wednesday.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by the latest furor over federal law  
enforcement's conduct during the final, fateful hours in the 1993 
standoff with the Branch Davidians, Congress is scurrying to review 
years-old hearing records and organize a fresh round of inquiries. 
Congressional ire was raised with the FBI's admission Wednesday 
that incendiary tear gas grenades were lobbed near the Davidians' 
compound outside Waco, Texas. House Government Reform Committee 
Chairman Dan Burton pledged to convene hearings, calling them 
``absolutely essential.''

	GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As Kosovo Serbs across the province  
complain that they do not feel safe -- and ethnic Albanians conced 
that protecting Serbs is a problem -- the idea of ethnic segregation 
is being openly discussed at the highest levels of the U.N. and 
NATO commands. Over the past week, local Serb leaders proposed 
creating separate areas where Serbs could live apart from ethnic 
Albanians, protected by international peacekeepers and governing 
themselves. The idea runs counter to the stated goal of the United 
Nations and NATO, and ethnic Albanian leaders oppose it.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton Justice Department has joined  
Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr to appeal a judge's ruling on 
alleged grand jury leaks during the Monica Lewinsky investigation, 
legal sources say. At issue is whether the independent counsel 
improperly leaked secret grand jury information to the news media. 
The Justice Department may be worried that the court is setting an 
unreasonable precedent making it difficult for their own 
prosecutors to give reporters information.

towns, reports from the region indicated today. The fighters 
backing Gen. Mohamed Saed Hirsi, better known as Morgan, forced the

months after they lost it, Gen. Abdurahman Khalif Dhi'is told

<HEADLINE> Compromise on Ten Commandments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALTOONA, Pa. (AP) -- The local pastor says it is a victory for  
Ten Commandments crusaders. The school district calls it just 
another addition to its ``character building'' curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months after a Baptist preacher asked that the Ten  
Commandments be posted in every school, the Altoona Area School 
District announced a compromise Friday, hoping to sidestep 
controversy by putting the religious rules in educational and 
historical context. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident that what we have before you today is something  
that can withstand any challenge,'' said the district's attorney, 
David Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal does not include posting the Ten Commandments.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, which still must be approved by the school  
board, high school students will be able to take a new elective 
course in comparative religion and form an after-school Ten 
Commandments Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Ten Commandments and other religious documents will be  
available in the libraries at every school and religious groups 
could distribute literature to the students outside the schools, 
although that is already allowed on public property. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't known Friday when the board would take up the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel very good about this,'' schools Superintendent  
Dennis Murray said. ``Perhaps this program will evolve into 
something that can be packaged and modeled and we can distribute it 
to other school districts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the proposal's negotiators was Rabbi Burt Schuman of  
Altoona's Temple Beth Israel, who stridently opposed the original 
proposal set forth in May by the Rev. Gary Dull, pastor of the 
Faith Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Dull had asked the board to post the Ten Commandments in every  
school, offer an elective class on them and allow his congregants 
to give students bookmarks spelling out the religious rules. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he got everything he wanted, but the details have not  
yet been hammered out. 
</P>
<P>
	The district carefully couched the proposal in secular terms in  
an attempt to avoid legal challenges, calling it an effort to build 
the characters of students. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court barred schools from posting the Ten  
Commandments in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's to challenge?'' Murray said. ``How can you be against  
character building? I'm sure somebody will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the recent spate of school shootings that included the  
slayings at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo., members of the 
clergy, elected officials and lawmakers nationwide are pushing the 
Bible as a solution to school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky and West Virginia, school attorneys are worried  
about lawsuits after several school districts posted the Ten 
Commandments in every school this month.

<HEADLINE> Sosa, McGwire Chase 70 HRs Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Home run history might be repeating itself.  
</P>
<P>
	As their teams stagger to the finish of disappointing seasons,  
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire are staging an encore to the race that 
revived the game last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Homer No. 70, as distant as a faraway star not too long ago,  
suddenly seems possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Can they reach that unfathomable number as McGwire did last  
season, when he edged out Sosa by four? Can they top the drama? Who 
knows? It's still the best show around. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa headed into the weekend with 53 home runs, leading McGwire  
by two, with five weeks and more than 30 games left. Sosa was ahead 
of last year's pace, while McGwire was right on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys are trying to feed off each other,'' said Cubs  
hitting coach Jeff Pentland, who helped Sosa reduce his wild swings 
outside of the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe that is a part of it. I think that is an  
incentive for both guys. When you get players to elevate their 
games emotionally, I think you see special things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, here they go again.  
</P>
<P>
	The watered-down expansion pitching might be part of the reason.  
So might be the tightly wound baseballs that pop out of parks or 
the homer-friendly stadiums of a new generation. Mostly, it's two 
powerful hitters doing what no one has done before. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire and Sosa will tell you they're not watching each other,  
that they're team players upset by the dismal seasons. That's one 
major difference from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, McGwire and the Cardinals were playing out the schedule  
while Sosa and the Cubs were making the playoffs. Now both teams 
are going home when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like last year, because we were in the middle of a  
race and Mark and I were chasing a record that had stood for 37 
years,'' Sosa said, referring to Roger Maris' 61 homers in 1961. 
``The team is not playing the way it did last year. But because the 
direction the team goes is not good it doesn't mean I have to go 
there, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year McGwire and Sosa homered 21 times on the same day.  
Through Aug. 14 this year when they traded three-run shots in St. 
Louis, Big Mac and Slammin' Sammy have homered on the same day 16 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take care of myself. He takes care of himself,'' McGwire  
said of Sosa, who has become a friend. ``I have no control over 
anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire and Sosa will go head-to-head six more times, first at  
Wrigley Sept. 20-22 and then to end the season Oct. 1-3 in St. 
Louis. They both should be swinging for the fences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, they want to hit homers,'' Colorado's Dante  
Bichette said. ``You don't become that good at hitting home runs by 
flaring balls to right field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cubs and Cards met last September at Busch Stadium,  
McGwire tied Maris, then passed him with the historic No. 62 the 
next night off Chicago's Steve Trachsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa ran in from right field to congratulate his rival, and they  
exchanged their familiar greetings -- McGwire's fake punch to the 
stomach, Sosa's two-finger salute to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa took the lead briefly on Sept. 25 with his 66th, but  
McGwire answered with his 66th the same night, then hit four more 
to reach the new magic number. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how they pushed one another, making what they  
accomplished seem more human, appealing even to people who didn't 
count themselves as baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa had a 51-48 lead earlier this month before McGwire caught  
up. Sosa then broke the tie with his 52nd and at one point was 
eight games ahead of his pace from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not on my mind right now. I'm trying to survive,'' Sosa  
said after the Cubs had lost 50 out of 70 games. ``Pretty much I'm 
not thinking about the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's feel-good approach to the hype last season seemed to ease  
the pressure on both of the sluggers. Now the attention that 
enveloped them in 1998 will only increase again in the season's 
final weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say to me every day, `Are you going top hit a home run  
today?''' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like they're asking will I walk down the street today. I  
wish it was easy but it's not. Not many players hit 40-50 a year. 
People talk about how there are so many home runs hit this year. So 
what? The game has changed. The players are really, really good. 
But if you look at the end product on Oct. 3, you'll see the same 
names you've seen the last couple of years leading in home runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire doubted No. 70 would be reached this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think 60 will be gotten again. Seventy is just an extra  
10,'' he said. ``It is unfathomable when you think I hit five the 
last three days'' of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But it could happen, especially with McGwire and Sosa. Pentland  
said the advent of videotape is one thing that has helped hitters 
everywhere, allowing them to make adjustments from at-bat to at-bat 
and avoid too many slumps. 
</P>
<P>
	But mainly it comes down to sheer power for McGwire, a man many  
think can challenge Hank Aaron's all-time record of 755, and for 
Sosa, whose muscular body and rip-the-shirt-off-his-back swing has 
made him a worthy adversary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing I've always told Sammy and the same is true with  
Mark is that he has a special gift,'' Pentland said. '' He is able 
to swing and hit the ball a long way and there is no reason to try 
and hit it 900 feet. It's built into their bodies when they have 
that kind of physical talent.''

<HEADLINE> WR Tony Martin Ready To Help Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The jury's still out on how much Tony Martin will  
help the Miami Dolphins, and tonight's exhibition against the 
Detroit Lions should offer some evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin eagerly returned Friday to the drudgery of training camp,  
where freedom meant 90 minutes of practice in 90-degree sunshine. 
The workout was his first since being acquitted on federal charges 
of laundering drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in my comfort zone now,'' the veteran receiver said. ``I  
finally got some sleep last night and came out here with a positive 
attitude. It was a different feeling, knowing I had the weight 
lifted off my shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the verdict in, Martin can now focus on the more trivial  
matter of winning a Super Bowl. His participation in practice has 
been sporadic since his trial began Aug. 2, but he'll likely see a 
lot of action against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to going the whole game if I have to,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The passing attack has sputtered in the first two exhibition  
games for Miami (1-1), with three quarterbacks going 28-for-64 for 
298 yards. Dan Marino is 10-for-27 for 118 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem has been a wave of injuries at receiver and  
the limited availability of Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need that timing down, and it's not yet,'' receiver Oronde  
Gadsden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions (1-1) should provide a good test for the Dolphins'  
offense. After giving up 35 points in their exhibition opener at 
Atlanta, the Lions bounced back last week by beating Cincinnati 
16-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals had just nine first downs. First-round draft pick  
Chris Claiborne led Detroit's defense with a sack and a 
team-leading five tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all starting to learn each other more,'' Claiborne said,  
``and I know we're going to keep getting better and be a good 
defensive team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals are coming off a 3-13 season, but the Lions still  
found reason for encouragement. The preseason shutout was their 
first since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something to build on,'' linebacker Stephen Boyd said.  
``Miami's going to be a good test. That's a team that wants to run 
the ball, and then you've got a guy like Dan Marino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins anticipate that Martin will give Marino the deep  
threat he has long lacked, and with the defense stretched, Miami's 
ground game should improve. 
</P>
<P>
	But to this point, that's just a theory. Now that Martin can  
focus on football, the Dolphins will try to put the plan into 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who helped the Atlanta Falcons reach the Super Bowl last  
season, signed a four-year, $14.2 million contract with Miami in 
April that was contingent on his availability. When he was 
acquitted Thursday, he returned to the Dolphins complex and greeted 
his teammates in the locker room, shaking hands with nearly every 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great reaction to see the guys rally around me,''  
Martin said. ``I feel like I owe them something for the support 
they've given me. I'm going to do everything I can to help the team 
win games this year.''

<HEADLINE> Voices We Listened to This Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A TV talk show host starts a book club and millions read the  
novels she recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	A baby doctor offers simple advice and his words become a bible  
to parents. 
</P>
<P>
	A president sits before a microphone and his calm authority  
soothes a worried nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Three voices of three generations -- Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Benjamin  
Spock and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- have little in common, except 
this: 
</P>
<P>
	We listened to them.  
</P>
<P>
	The voices of influence in the 20th century are more a cacophony  
than a chorus: Preachers and politicians, journalists and 
humorists, crooners and crusaders, all have permeated the nation's 
consciousness. Along the way, a few have even made history. 
</P>
<P>
	We know their names: Will Rogers, Billy Graham, Walter Winchell.  
</P>
<P>
	We recognize their faces: Martin Luther King, Eleanor Roosevelt,  
Walter Cronkite. 
</P>
<P>
	But more importantly, we remember how their words entertained  
us, guided us, inspired us, forced us to think. 
</P>
<P>
	These were people, for the most part, who were not elected at  
the ballot box, but selected to enter our homes. Their words came 
to us as we read the newspaper, huddled around wooden radios, 
stared at the boob tube or clicked on our computer mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	And we listened. Especially in our most troubled times.  
</P>
<P>
	Though his name is rarely mentioned now, anyone who remembers  
the Depression remembers Father Charles Coughlin. In an era when 
people were homeless and jobless and wanted to know why, the 
priest-turned-broadcaster took to the air waves weekly, spouting 
isolationist, anti-Semitic tirades, attacking bankers and blaming 
the world's problems on capitalism and Communism. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions tuned in, thousands sent money.  
</P>
<P>
	Fast-forward a few decades to the turbulent Vietnam war years.  
Again, millions tuned in, this time to the nightly TV news 
broadcasts of Cronkite, the avuncular anchorman whose graying 
temples and resonant voice helped made him a symbol of moral 
authority. Polls consistently ranked him among the country's most 
trusted men. 
</P>
<P>
	We listened as Cronkite, returning from a reporting trip in  
Vietnam in 1968, declared the United States ``mired in a 
stalemate.'' Negotiation, he said, was the only rational course. 
</P>
<P>
	The words shook President Lyndon Johnson. ``If we have lost  
Walter, we have lost the country,'' he reportedly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first time in American history that a war had been  
declared over by a commentator,'' author David Halberstam wrote 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``What made that powerful was up to that point he had not  
committed himself,'' Garry Wills, the Pulitzer Prize-winning 
historian says of Cronkite. ``He was expending political capital he 
had accrued over the decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout this century, we listened to political leaders, whose  
words sometimes defined pivotal moments in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every crisis produces a great voice,'' says Marshall Fishwick,  
a professor who specializes in popular culture at Virginia Tech 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	FDR revolutionized politics and radio with his ``fireside  
chats,'' in which he reassured and rallied a nation through the 
bleak years of the Depression and World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to win the war and we are going to win the peace  
that follows,'' he vowed in a broadcast two days after Pearl Harbor 
was bombed. ``And in the difficult hours of this day -- through dark 
days that may be yet to come -- we will know that the vast majority 
of the members of the human race are on our side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decades later, another president, John F. Kennedy, captivated  
the nation with his wit, eloquence and Boston-starched voice as he 
spoke of new frontiers and of a ``torch ... passed to a new 
generation of Americans born in this century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1960s also brought forth voices of change, from Malcolm X,  
with his fiery black nationalist rhetoric, to King, with his 
impassioned cry for racial equality and an end to intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together  
as fools,'' King, the preacher, thundered as blood flowed in the 
streets during the civil rights battles. 
</P>
<P>
	His words still echo 31 years after his assassination, says Char  
Miller, history department chairman at Trinity University in San 
Antonio, Texas. ``What we remember are those extraordinary speeches 
that called into question the fundamental errors of American 
society and did so in a language that has an edge to it,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the way we listen has changed -- we've progressed from a  
scratchy ``wireless'' to 24-hour cable channels -- Miller says there 
has been a remarkable consistency in those we tune in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of what makes somebody famous or infamous is they speak  
directly to the needs of a large number of Americans,'' he says. 
``They pose a question that's been in our heads that we haven't 
articulated, or they provide an answer to a question that's been 
kicking around a long time and we haven't figured out a way to 
solve it. ... We use them as a mirror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes they're guides for everyday life.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Spock told us how to care for our children; Emily Post, how  
to mind our manners; Dale Carnegie, how to win friends and 
influence people; Norman Vincent Peale, how to be a positive 
thinker. And Ann Landers is still telling us how to cope with the 
in-laws, the boss, the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, Ann Landers must have a treasure trove of  
letters that would introduce us to the American psyche and changes 
in society more than anybody else I know,'' says Joe Boskin, 
director of the urban studies program at Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, voices are spiritual guides.  
</P>
<P>
	When radio was in its infancy, the airwaves crackled with Aimee  
Semple McPherson's talk of miracles, heaven and salvation. Decades 
later, when television first entered our living rooms, Archbishop 
Fulton Sheen became not just a voice, but a face, the first to 
combine the force of religion and a mesmerizing new medium. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon dozens of television ministers followed, but none had the  
longevity and legitimacy of the Rev. Billy Graham, whose crusades 
around the globe were beamed into millions of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever a president's in trouble, they trot him out,'' Miller  
says. ``He's a person who can make things all right -- just by his 
presence, he gives you a kind of benediction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes a president need offer only himself.  
</P>
<P>
	President Reagan's voice, cultivated as a broadcaster before he  
entered politics, delivered gentle humor and sunny visions of 
morning in America that helped solidify his reputation as ``the 
great communicator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Reagan often joked about himself, we liked hearing others  
poke fun at politics itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics has become so expensive that it takes a lot of money  
even to be defeated.'' The grumbling of a presidential candidate at 
century's end? Nope. The words of Will Rogers, who combined 
homespun humor with a serious populist message. 
</P>
<P>
	Populism spoke to us, too, in pen and ink, which served as  
America's voice early in the century. 
</P>
<P>
	There were muckraking journalists Ida Tarbell and Upton  
Sinclair, who took on industry, the great iconoclast H.L. Mencken 
and press lord William Randolph Hearst, whose ``penny press'' could 
ignite a war with Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio gave us a new breed of celebrity journalists, none more  
famous than Edward R. Murrow, the world-weary, chain-smoking 
foreign correspondent whose eyewitness accounts (``This -- is 
London'') from rooftops as bombs fell brought the war into our 
living rooms. Later, on television, Murrow helped bring down Sen. 
Joseph McCarthy at the height of the Red Scare. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio also gave us Lowell Thomas, our guide to news fronts  
around the world, and Paul Harvey, who brought us home again with 
the words of a cracker-barrel philosopher and cadences of America's 
heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a pattern to my broadcasts, it is mostly to report  
the things that interest me -- what people want to know and what 
people need to know in a blend that changes every day,'' says 
Harvey, 80, whose voice is still heard on more than 1,300 stations. 
``So much of what we report as news is frivolous, all color and no 
beer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But entertainment has its place, too. Millions tuned in to  
George Burns and Jack Benny for laughs, Sinatra and Elvis for 
music, Johnny Carson and his late-night successors for monologues 
with social and political commentary cloaked in one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, there was Walter Winchell, whose breathless,  
staccato tidbits about the private lives of politicians and movie 
stars pioneered the gossip industry that is a staple at century's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gossip,'' he once said, ``is the art of saying nothing in a  
way that leaves practically nothing unsaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At century's end, the range of voices we listen to has  
broadened, especially in recent decades as racial and gender 
barriers have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are whole parts of America represented or addressed that  
weren't before,'' says Wills, the historian. ``Women, minorities, 
gays -- we have political voices addressing their concerns. We 
didn't have that 50 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were trailblazers, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	Eleanor Roosevelt, both as a first lady and after, lectured and  
wrote, championing the causes of women, the poor and oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Real prosperity can only come when everybody prospers,'' she  
once wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Feminist Betty Friedan challenged us to reconsider our notions  
of a woman's role. ``Who knows what women can be when they are 
finally free to be themselves?'' she wrote in ``The Feminine 
Mystique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, who could have imagined decades ago that millions of TV  
viewers would watch a woman TV host dish about her weight, then run 
out to buy the pajamas she wears, the cookbook she endorses, the 
novels she reads? 
</P>
<P>
	``Oprah is someone who most people could identify with,'' says  
Brian Lavelle, of Loyola University in Chicago. ``She has an air of 
truthfulness and candor about her. She's a true voice for many, 
many women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With so many media outlets, the din has grown and more people  
today have a microphone -- radio shock jocks, real jocks talking 
sports, movie stars pontificating about politics, 
politician-pundits trying to drown each other out. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: Fewer voices dominate the microphone, says Paul  
Levinson, a professor of communications and media studies at 
Fordham University. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the 20th century ends,'' he says, ``rather than one person  
on stage that everyone is paying attention to, there are a lot of 
people standing in a lot of different corners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And one of those still standing -- Paul Harvey -- wonders how long  
the clamor will go on. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the multiplicity of media, we're all sitting on the edge  
of our chairs every day,'' he says. ``I think there will come a 
time, if we're not careful, that we'll all be ignored.''

	East Coast Beachgoers on Watch  
</P>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- East Coast beachgoers and coastal  
residents kept a watch on changing weather forecasts Saturday as 
Hurricane Dennis added muscle while moving slowly through the 
Bahamas. At 11 p.m. EDT, Dennis had strengthened, with its 
sustained wind accelerating to 105 mph, and was centered about 325 
miles southeast of Charleston, S.C., the hurricane center said. A 
hurricane watch was issued from north of Savannah, Ga. to Surf 
City, N.C. Various computer models suggested it could affect the 
coast of the Carolinas late Monday or Tuesday, or veer away from 
land, forecasters said.

	China To Raise Unemployment Funds  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China will raise stipends to unemployed workers  
by 30 percent as part of a series of measures intended to arrest 
the economic slide and brighten public sentiment ahead of the 
country's 50th anniversary of communist rule. Unemployment has 
soared as once centrally planned industries trim bloated payrolls 
to cope with free-market reforms. With millions of Chinese trying 
to survive on meager stipends, the communist leadership has worried 
about the potential for unrest. 

</P>
<P>
	Serbs Wary of Peacekeepers Abilities  
</P>
<P>
	GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Complaints from Kosovo Serbs who say  
they do not feel safe and can't rely on peacekeepers to protect 
them are raising questions over whether NATO and the United Nations 
can establish a multiethnic Kosovo. Even ethnic Albanians concede 
that adequately protecting Serbs is a problem. As a result, the 
idea of ethnic segregation -- once a taboo subject -- is being openly 
discussed at the highest levels of the U.N. and NATO commands. 

</P>

	Firefighters Make Progress in West  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With more than 200,000 acres burned by wildfire,  
firefighters in the Western states were making progress Saturday on 
the blazes, though hot weather and frequent lightning strikes 
continued to pose a threat. Nineteen large fires were burning in 
California, Nevada, Oregon and Texas, though nine were expected to 
be contained tomorrow. More than half of the fires were in Northern 
California, drawing more than 7,000 firefighters. 

</P>

	Clinton Endorses Charter Schools  
</P>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton Saturday used his  
weekly radio address to denounce the Republicans' $792 billion 
tax-cut package as unacceptably risky and announce $95 million in 
aid for charter schools. After leaving Martha's Vineyard, the 
Clinton family then left the island for a house-hunting trip to 
Westchester County, N.Y., near New York City, and a weekend of 
fund-raising parties in the wealthy seashore suburbs of Long 
Island.

</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators trying to  
iron out differences in order to clear the way for Israel's 
withdrawal from 11 percent of the West Bank are stuck on one 
significant issue: the release of Palestinian prisoners. 
Negotiators tried Saturday to resolve the final barriers ahead of a 
visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
Albright is expected to participate Thursday in a signing ceremony 
in Alexandria, Egypt, if the agreement is worked out in time. The 
peace deal would be the first to be signed under the rule of 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.

	Rabid Bear a Concern in Iowa  
</P>
<P>
	CLERMONT, Iowa (AP) -- As many as 100 people may have been  
exposed to a bear cub that died of rabies at a rural northeastern 
Iowa petting zoo. State health official said visitors who had come 
in contact with the bear in the past month should see a doctor 
immediately. The 5-month-old black bear, which was on display at 
the Wild Midwest Petting Zoo in Clermont, died Friday afternoon.

	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Kevin Thompson threw for two  
touchdowns, Chafie Fields ran 70 yards for a score and caught a 
37-yard pass for another Saturday and the third-ranked Nittany 
Lions overwhelmed No. 4 Arizona 41-7 in the Pigskin Classic. Penn 
State's highly touted defense exceeded even its own expectations by 
shutting down Arizona's high-powered offense on the way to a 31-0 
halftime lead.

	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Venus Williams, the 19-year-old with the  
best serve in women's tennis, beat Lindsay Davenport 6-2, 7-5 to 
win the Pilot Pen championship. Williams' No. 3 world ranking is 
the highest in her five-year career. Williams and Davenport battled 
from the baseline for most of the one hour, 24 minute match as 
their hard-hitting styles kept them well off the net. Williams had 
the speed to track down Davenport's rifle returns and the 
athleticism to turn them into points.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Union Deadline Passes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Contract talks between Boeing Co. and its largest  
union continued early Saturday as both sides let slide an informal 
Friday midnight deadline for the aerospace company to present its 
final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Company chairman Phil Condit said earlier Friday the company  
faced ``reasonably good'' odds of avoiding a strike by its 
machinists, despite pessimism expressed by union officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides had said the company's final contract proposal was  
expected to be delivered by midnight Friday to the International 
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, which 
represents 44,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're continuing to work and talk and exchange information,''  
Boeing spokesman Larry McCracken said early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still a ways apart,'' said union spokesman Tim Flynn,  
who agreed the two sides were still talking. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is seeking to preserve jobs, improve medical benefits  
and increase pensions. The company wants to cut costs through 
subcontracting, paying less for health benefits and adopting a 
flexible work week. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks come as Boeing is undertaking a massive job cut  
program. From a high of 238,000 in June 1998, Boeing plans to 
reduce its work force to between 185,000 and 195,000 by the end of 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The average machinist at Boeing earns $40,000 a year, not  
counting benefits or overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The current 44-month contract covers 31,000 workers in  
Washington state, 1,400 in Portland, Ore., and 11,600 in Wichita, 
Kan. Boeing employs about 210,000 worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Gun Show Ban Shot Down in St. Paul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- An effort to ban gun shows on city property has  
been shot down by the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo sent Friday to City Council members, Assistant City  
Attorney Philip Byrne wrote that the resolution ``does not have the 
force and effect of law'' and cannot be used to ``breach existing 
contracts or obligations that the city might have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne said the council could still ban gun shows but would have  
to pass an administrative ordinance, a process more complicated 
than adopting a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban passed 4-3 on Wednesday, less than a week after four  
people were injured when a gun discharged during a RiverCentre 
weapons show last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrance Stafford, 49, was charged Thursday with reckless  
discharge of a firearm for taking a .22-caliber pistol off a 
display table, loading a round and firing at the floor during the 
Weapons Collectors Association show. 
</P>
<P>
	Councilman Jerry Blakey, the council's most outspoken voice on  
gun control, said he would meet with gun association and 
RiverCentre representatives as well as with Police Chief William 
Finney next week to talk about ways to make gun shows safer.

<HEADLINE> New Wiretapping Rules on Cell Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New government wiretapping rules will allow  
police, with a judge's permission, to track cellular phone users by 
their location at the beginning and end of a call. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, announced Friday by the Federal Communications  
Commission, are intended to help law enforcement authorities keep 
pace with advances in phone technology. Privacy groups complained 
that the government was effectively turning cellular phones into 
tracking devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Another rule would allow investigators to listen in on phone  
conversations of all parties to a conference call, even if some are 
put on hold and are no longer talking to the target of the legal 
wiretap. Authorities with a court order also could determine when 
someone is using call-forwarding, three-way calling or other 
features. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our actions today will help ensure that law enforcement has  
the most up-to-date technology to fight crime,'' FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard said.

<P>
	The rules help implement a 1994 law that requires companies to  
make digital wiretapping technology available to law enforcement 
agencies. The commission stepped in after the Justice Department, 
FBI and the telecommunications industry failed to agree on a plan 
after years of negotiations. The Justice Department and FBI got 
much of what they sought. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have until March 2000 to set equipment standards  
that integrate the added requirements and until Sept. 30, 2001, to 
implement them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the FCC's order addressed its major  
concerns and would aid officers in fighting terrorism, organized 
crime and illegal drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuing technological changes in the nation's  
telecommunications systems present increasing challenges to law 
enforcement,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. ``This ruling will 
enable law enforcement to keep pace with these changes and ensure 
we will be able to maintain our capability to conduct 
court-authorized electronic surveillance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups said the FCC overstepped the 1994 law.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply disappointed that on all the issues that  
mattered, the commission ruled against privacy and in favor of 
expanded FBI surveillance,'' said Jim Dempsey, counsel at the 
Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry groups said communications companies will have a hard  
time meeting the deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real time crunch and resource drain,'' said Grant  
Seiffert, vice president for government relations at the 
Telecommunications Industry Association, which represents major 
equipment manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The requirements also will be costly for the nation's local  
phone companies, according to the United States Telephone 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wheeler, head of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry  
Association, said he hoped law enforcement authorities would 
``provide carriers with the flexibility necessary to implement 
these capabilities in a way that makes sense.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Puts Indonesia on Notice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton put Indonesia on notice that  
the country risks international consequences if violence 
accompanies a referendum on self-rule in East Timor, an 
administration spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect a free, fair and credible election,'' National  
Security Council spokesman David Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the former Portuguese colony will vote Monday on  
whether to become an independent nation or an autonomous region 
within Indonesia, which annexed East Timor in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member congressional delegation that returned last week  
from East Timor predicted mass violence is a strong possibility. 
The Indonesian military and police have close ties with well-armed 
anti-independence militias and have done little so far to stop 
harassment of those supporting independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Militia gangs ignoring United Nations demands for peace roamed  
unchecked through East Timor's capital Saturday, sending hundreds 
of people fleeing in terror. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sent a strongly-worded letter to Indonesian President  
B.J. Habibie early last week, but there has been no response, Leavy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is violence, there could be consequences,'' to  
Indonesia's relationships abroad, including with the United States, 
Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavy would not detail those consequences, but the letter is an  
apparent reminder to Indonesia that the United States holds 
effective veto power over international loans to the country.

<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Truluck took the lead around the final  
turn and went on to a three-length victory over favored Rock and 
Roll in the $150,000 Salvator Mile Handicap at Monmouth Park on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elliott Walden-trained colt paid $4.80, $2.40 and $2.10 and  
earned $80,000 in winning for the second time in eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock and Roll returned $2.40 and $2.10, while Siftaway was $2.10  
to show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I thought when I got on this horse was he was  
Godzilla, and he's the fastest Godzilla I've ever seen,'' jockey 
Joe Bravo said. ``I know Rock and Roll is a good horse and I knew 
once I got alongside of him I wanted to pass him quickly and that's 
how it worked out. My horse finished full of steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the $75,000 Longfellow Stakes, favored My Jeff's Mombo  
($3.60) scored his fourth straight win of the meet, beating Loaded 
Gun by a head. 
</P>
<P>
	Let ($6) rallied strongly under Stewart Elliott to take the  
$70,000 Personal Ensign Stakes by a neck over Sweet Misty. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $70,000 Omnibus Stakes on the turf, Natalie Too came on  
late to score a 1 1/4-length victory over Red Royal for her third 
stakes win of the meet. Bravo rode the D. Wayne Lukas-trained mare, 
who paid $5.20.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Spain's Abel Anton delighted a home crowd  
at Olympic Stadium Saturday, using his finishing kick over the last 
12 minutes to win his second straight World Championships marathon 
and Spain's second gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Anton, 36, finished in 2 hours, 13 minutes, 36 seconds, with  
Italy's Vincenzo Modica (2:14:03) finishing second and Nobuyuki 
Sato of Japan (2:14:07) earning the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Spain's third straight gold in the World Championships  
marathon, with Martin Fiz winning in 1995 and taking second to 
Anton in '97. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the race, the temperature was 97 degrees,  
creating some of the toughest conditions ever for a major marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	At the finish, as Anton entered the stadium greeted by thousands  
of fluttering yellow and red Spanish flags, the temperature had 
dropped to 86 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Anton caught Sato with about 12 minutes left, paced him for  
about 90 seconds, and then pulled away relentlessly.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Wins Alabama Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The few who came, prospered, in  
Alabama's first ever Republican straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk show host Alan Keyes won the non-binding ballot with Sen.  
Orrin Hatch of Utah finishing second and Texas Gov. George Bush, 
front-runner in the national race for the presidential nomination, 
third. Keyes, Hatch and Florida education advocate Angel Rocker 
were the only candidates who came. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only people showing up are the candidates with no chance  
of being elected,'' said Merle Black, a political scientist at 
Emory University in Atlanta. ``That diminishes the straw poll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer was fourth, Elizabeth Dole fifth and Steve Forbes  
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes pulled 29 percent, Hatch 27 percent, and Bush 25 percent.  
The other seven candidates were in single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes' victory came after a stirring speech in which he  
encouraged delegates to vote their true feelings and not go with 
Bush just because he's popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you keep voting for people who are vague on the issues  
important to this country, you will be defeated and you deserve to 
be defeated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, one of Bush's Alabama chairmen, played  
down the outcome, saying, ``I don't think it has any significance 
outside this room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Hatch said Bush may be unbeatable. ``George Bush has it  
wrapped up because the party hierarchy is with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Party Chairman Winton Blount warned that candidates were  
risking ``snubbing a significant group of Republican votes'' by not 
participating. But Carl Grafton, a political scientist at Auburn 
University at Montgomery, said it wouldn't hurt Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``After eight years of Bill Clinton, these people want to win  
the presidency,'' Grafton said. ``Just because Bush doesn't show 
up, they are not going to punish him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pay-to-vote contest followed Saturday morning frivolities  
including live-elephant rides and a ball-throw at a Bill Clinton 
look-a-like in a dunking booth. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Iowa straw poll, which Bush won two weeks ago, the  
Alabama straw poll did not allow candidates to pay for unlimited 
delegates. They could only sign up 100 delegates each for the $35 
seats, but most didn't bother. That caused many to discount the 
poll's importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd really have to be a political junkie to know about  
this,'' Black said.

<HEADLINE> C R Renegade Wins Yonkers Trot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- C R Renegade, who finished a disappointing  
ninth in the Hambletonian, rebounded in the second leg of the 
trotting triple crown with a length victory over San Pellegrino in 
the $273,891 Yonkers Trot at Yonkers Raceway on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-old colt extended his winning streak to three races  
and earned $136,845 to boost his career earnings to $552,129, all 
this year. The son of Royal Troubador ran only once as a 2-year-old 
and didn't earn a dollar. He is 8-3-1 in 15 starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
	San Pellegrino edged Pearsall Hanover in a photo for second.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth Yonkers Trot victory for owner-trainer Carl  
Allen and the second for his son and driver, Rod Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the one race we shoot for every year,'' Carl Allen said  
of the Yonkers Trot. ``Renegade is a real handy horse and Rod 
should get all the credit. He does a super job driving him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Allen drove Mo Bandy to victory in 1981 and Royal Troubador  
in 1990. Rod Allen won in 1995 with C R Kay Suzie, a full sister to 
C R Renegade. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me a great effort,'' Rod Allen said. ``I had to work  
to get him in front and once we got there I didn't have to stop 
driving him at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	C R Renegade was clocked in 1:58 and paid $3.30, 2.60 and 2.20.  
San Pellegrino returned $17.60 and $8.20, while Pearsall Hanover 
was $4.30 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	C R Renegade will run in the World Trotting Derby next Saturday  
at DuQuoin, Ill., and also will race in third leg of the triple 
crown, the Kentucky Futurity on Oct. 8 at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed, who set a world record of 1:51 3-5 in winning  
the Hambletonian, skipped the Yonkers Trot.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys, Broncos Get Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The Denver Broncos and Dallas Cowboys  
should have powerful offensives this season. They just haven't 
shown them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team's first unit had nine drives over three exhibition  
games and each scored one touchdown. It's not much cause for panic, 
but it is a slump both teams would like to shake out of Sunday 
night when the starters get their last extended look of the 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver and Dallas will both stick with their first teams  
throughout the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody talks about how good or bad a team looks in  
preseason and it really doesn't matter,'' Cowboys quarterback Troy 
Aikman said. ``We're evaluating players, seeing which guys are 
doing what and how aggressive they're playing and whether they know 
their assignments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An offensive fade was behind Dallas' 2-4 skid to end last season  
and many of the problems were addressed in the offseason. So far, 
there's been little improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman ended three drives by fumbling a snap and throwing two  
interceptions. Fellow starters haven't helped, committing five 
penalties for 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking at results so much,'' Aikman said. ``We're  
working on a lot of different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who is 0-8 in exhibition games over  
two summers, is looking for improvement more than a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it goes great, we don't need to pat ourselves on the back  
and say we're a lock for the Super Bowl,'' Gailey said. ``We know 
we have work to do no matter what.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver is 2-1 this preseason but its only score from the first  
team was a 3-yard touchdown run by Derek Loville in the second 
game. Despite the drought, the two-time Super Bowl champions aren't 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``So what?'' receiver Rod Smith said. ``It's not like we're not  
going to score any touchdowns. Just right now, it's a feeling-out 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Elway could brush off his August critics the way Aikman is,  
but it's not as easy for Elway's successor, Bubby Brister. He's 
made himself an easy target by throwing interceptions on the first 
play of Denver's first and third games. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister fully understands the pressure he's facing and hopes  
that more playing time Sunday will give him a better chance to get 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We moved the ball pretty well in every game, but we just shot  
ourselves in the foot,'' Brister said. ``We need to get in there 
and score and finish off drives and gain some confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One way of doing that would be by giving the ball to Terrell  
Davis as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to that, seeing where I am as far as my  
stamina and whether I can go a half down there in the hot Dallas 
weather,'' he said. ``It should be a good test for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister will be relieved by Brian Griese. Chris Miller will miss  
a third straight game with tendinitis in his throwing elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury report is improving for the Cowboys as receiver  
Raghib Ismail, offensive linemen Everett McIver and Tony Hutson and 
cornerback Charlie Williams are expected to get into their first 
games of the summer. Running back Chris Warren should be back after 
missing the New England game. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas also will be keeping a close watch on how veteran Alonzo  
Spellman handles his first full-time gig at defensive tackle. The 
lifelong end moved inside this week as an experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys still won't have linebacker Quentin Coryatt  
(Achilles' tendon) or cornerback Kevin Smith (bulging disk). 
</P>
<P>
	While both teams will use the first two quarters to evaluate  
their overall progress, the second half will be final auditions for 
reserves fighting to stick around past Tuesday, when rosters are 
cut to 65 players.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Fires Back at Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALCON HEIGHTS, Minn. (AP) -- Pro-wrestler-turned-Gov. Jesse  
Ventura is flexing his vocal chords in a beef with a Minnesota 
newspaper that criticized him for returning to the ring as a 
referee, claiming he was setting a bad example for kids by 
promoting sex and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said the Saint Paul Pioneer Press' criticism of pro  
wrestling's staged mayhem and scantily clad women was hypocritical 
because the paper runs advertisements for X-rated movies and strip 
clubs in its sports section, which children read. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknaming the paper the ``Saint Paul Pioneer Porn,'' Ventura  
said he was canceling his subscription and would deny any future 
interview requests from its reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Saint Paul Pioneer Press is triple-X,'' Ventura said  
Friday on his weekly radio show. ``They are lining their pockets 
with pornography. They are working together with the X-rated 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue here really is that the governor doesn't like to be  
criticized,'' editor Walker Lundy said, adding that the paper can't 
legally deny advertising space to sexually-oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura retired from wrestling in 1986  
because of an injury. He took part in a recent pay-per-view 
wrestling event as a referee.

<HEADLINE> Rookie of the Year Knows Her Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw knows she wasn't an average  
WNBA rookie this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Touted as the ``female Michael Jordan'' after establishing  
herself at Tennessee among the greatest college basketball players 
ever, Holdsclaw said she felt constant pressure to perform. But she 
didn't wilt, averaging 16.9 points and 7.9 rebounds for the 
Washington Mystics, ranking sixth and third, respectively, in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers, plus her role in lifting the Mystics from a 3-27  
record in 1998 to 12-20 this season, earned her the WNBA Rookie of 
the Year award Saturday. She finished with 48 of 51 votes, with one 
each going to Detroit's Dominique Canty, Orlando's Nykesha Sales 
and New York's Tamika Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 Holdsclaw, a two-time WNBA player of the week and  
East team starter in the all-star game in July, kept the pressure 
from overwhelming her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a pretty level-minded person, and I knew what my focus  
was,'' she said. ``I just knew I had to come out every night and 
perform because everyone was going to see what I was made of and 
test me on a daily basis. I just had to be tough mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, a native of New York, was the No. 1 pick in the WNBA  
draft in May after becoming Tennessee's career leader in points 
(3,025) and rebounds (1,295). She led the Lady Vols to national 
titles in 1996, 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw combined with second-year guard Nikki McCray to give  
Washington an effective inside-outside duo. McCray, who averaged a 
team-high 17.5 points, also started in the all-star game. 
Washington won six consecutive games late in the season to inch 
toward the final Eastern Conference playoff spot but fell out of 
contention with a loss to Orlando Aug. 15.

<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Whipping up gale-force winds that doubled  
over coconut palms and storm surges that crashed onto roadways, 
Hurricane Dennis closed in on the northern Bahamas today and 
threatened to strike near Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said Dennis could strengthen and hit the United  
States as a major storm today, clawing up the Florida coast and 
heading into North Carolina by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	From hundreds of miles away, Dennis kicked up 8-foot-high waves  
off Florida and North Carolina, delighting surfers but prompting 
officials to put state troopers and the National Guard on alert. 
Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were issued along 
hundreds of miles of the eastern seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT, the 90-mph hurricane was 25 miles northeast of  
Abaco -- a sliver of an island no more than 10 miles wide with a 
population of several thousand -- and some 240 miles southeast of 
Cape Canaveral in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's dangerous because some of the homes in Abaco are not well  
structured, and the hurricane is mighty close,'' said Jeffrey 
Simmons, a forecaster at the Bahamas Meteorological Office. 
``They're getting the worst of it at this time, but we won't have 
an assessment of any damage until later in the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the island of Grand Bahama further west ``was also  
getting gusts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis' hurricane force winds broadened overnight to 40 miles  
from its center. Basil Dean, acting chief of meteorological 
services in the Bahamas, said the hurricane, which was in a 
near-stall Friday night, had resumed a slow west-northwest track 
near 6 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Weather Service reported that Dennis formed a  
fully formed eye Friday night, indicating it was getting stronger, 
and projected it would become a Category 3 hurricane packing winds 
of at least 111 mph within 48 hours. After that, it said, ``things 
become a bit more uncertain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane watch remained effect for the east coast of Florida  
from Sebastian Inlet northward to Fernandina Beach, 
</P>
<P>
	At the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami, director Jerry  
Jarrell said Dennis could hit the United States as a major storm, 
around South Carolina. The center warned Bahamian islands in its 
path could suffer ``large and dangerous battering waves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're afraid might happen is that it'll just go a little  
bit inland and then go up the coast and that would really be a bad 
situation,'' Jarrell said. ``That would give you probably the 
maximum storm surge, the maximum heavy rain and probably the most 
damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Abaco, hotel owner Rudy Malone boarded up in his house Friday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's here! It's here right now!'' he said. The howling wind  
``is very strong, it sounds like a train ... I can hear branches 
breaking off trees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People began preparing for the storm, banging wood over windows,  
battening down roofs and stocking up on supplies from the Bahamas 
to the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, but no decision 
has been made on whether to evacuate people from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, 150,000 coastal residents were put on alert,  
as were state troopers and emergency management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrimp boats returned early to Port Canaveral, and the South  
Florida Water Management District lowered water levels in canals to 
lessen the risk of flooding in heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to strengthen over the next 24 hours and  
bring up to 10 inches of rain and tides up to 8 feet above normal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Abaco, as clouds blackened by sheets of rain gathered and  
wind gusts reached 55 mph, islanders huddled behind battened down 
windows or rushed to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeland Russell, assistant superintendent of police at Marsh  
Harbour on Abaco, said the storm was expected to pass over or near 
Crossing Rock, a settlement of mainly elderly people, who were in 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamasair, the national airline, canceled service to the Abaco  
islands and most of Eleuthera and telephone operators said some 
lines were down and other circuits overloaded by traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	On Eleuthera island, ``the winds have been fierce ... the oceans  
have been very raging,'' said hotel owner Sharon Rolle. ``It's 
difficult for cars to pass by because there are waves coming over -- 
straight over -- the main road so it would cover your cars.''

<HEADLINE> Lemon Drop Kid Wins $1M Travers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Lemon Drop Kid proved to be the  
Big Horse in a big race for the second time in three months when he 
won Saturday's $1 million Travers at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont Stakes winner won by three-quarters of a length over  
Vision and Verse. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1 1/2-mile Belmont on June 5, Lemon Drop Kid beat Vision and  
Verse by a head. 
</P>
<P>
	Third in the Travers on a sunny Saturday was 8-5 favorite  
Menifee, who was 1 3/4 lengths behind Vision and Verse and 1 3/4 in front 
of stablemate Ecton Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was a step toward a possible 3-year-old championship  
for Lemon Drop Kid. His trainer, Scotty Schulhofer, had said before 
the race that his colt would need to win a couple races to take the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	The division leader continues to be Charismatic, the Kentucky  
Derby and Preakness winner who was retired after breaking an ankle 
while finishing third in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, ridden by Jose Santos, carried level weight of  
126 pounds over 1 1/4 miles on a fast track in 2:02. He paid $9.30, 
$5.80 and $3.20 for his third victory in seven starts this year and 
earned $600,000 to boost his career earnings to $1,541,470. 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse, ridden by Shane Sellers, paid $11.80 and $4.90  
and Menifee, ridden by Pat Day, was $2.50 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, owned by Jeanne Vance, was fourth entering the  
backstretch and had moved to third behind Cat Thief and Vision and 
Verse with a half-mile to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse had taken the lead with Lemon Drop Kid second  
at the quarter pole. Those two then battled through the stretch 
before Lemon Drop Kid took the lead just inside the sixteenth pole 
and held on to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was blocked on the inside on the run down the  
backstretch but the Haskell Invitational winner made a late but 
futile run in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish were Best of Luck, Badger Gold,  
Cat Thief and Unbridled Jet. 
</P>
<P>
	In another stakes for 3-year-olds, Forestry ($5.50) won the  
$200,000 King's Bishop by 1 1/2 lengths over Five Star Day in 1:21 for 
seven furlongs, just 2-5 of a second off the track record. It was 
the sixth victory in the last seven races for Forestry, ridden by 
Chris Antley and trained by Bob Baffert. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $150,000 Fourstardave Handicap, Comic Strip ($14), ridden  
by Day, beat Divide and Conquer by 2 1/2 lengths in 1:41 3-5 for 1 
1-16 miles on a soft turf course.

<HEADLINE> Gun Show a Target of L.A. Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Emboldened by a shooting rampage in its own  
backyard, Los Angeles County is trying to shut down weapons sales 
at the nation's largest gun show, igniting a volatile battle 
between California firearms sellers and anti-gun forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote last week by the small but politically powerful Board  
of Supervisors to ban gun sales on county property is part of a 
groundswell in California, where Gov. Gray Davis signed three 
weapons-related laws on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the right thing to do,'' said Supervisor Zev  
Yaroslavsky, whose ordinance won initial approval on a 3-2 vote and 
is headed to a second vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Real people, the people in supermarkets and in the corridors  
of the county buildings, are stunned that the county is profiting 
from guns,'' he said in an interview. ``Why are we facilitating the 
sale and distribution of weapons?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinance would hit hard at the Great Western Gun Show,  
which boasts as many as 5,300 vendor tables and draws up to 35,000 
people to each of its four annual events at the Los Angeles County 
fairgrounds in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came just two weeks after a gunman shot up a Jewish  
community center in the San Fernando Valley, wounding three little 
boys, a teen-age girl and a woman, and then gunned down a postal 
worker delivering mail nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault also revived memories of the notorious 1997 North  
Hollywood bank robbery shootout between police and two gunmen in 
body armor firing automatic rifles. More than a dozen people were 
wounded before the robbers went down. 
</P>
<P>
	But those who defend the right to gun ownership remain adamant  
in their views. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Los Angeles Board of Supervisors has behaved immorally,''  
raged Wallace Beinfeld, head of the National Association of Arms 
Shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of recent revelations that some guns possessed by the  
North Hollywood gunmen came from the Great Western Gun Show, 
Beinfeld insisted, ``Bad guys stay away from gun shows. They're 
better off buying guns at kitchen tables.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show has had only four arrests in 20 years, he claimed,  
adding, ``That's safer than Disneyland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beinfeld downplayed a recent sting operation by California  
Attorney General Bill Lockyer's undercover agents that found 
illegal weapons so readily available at the Great Western Gun Show 
that agents ran out money. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer said his agents were able to buy modified assault  
weapons, flame thrower kits, a rocket launcher and kits to convert 
guns into illegal automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents also said they witnessed the selling of handguns to  
people who were not asked to wait 10 days for a background check, 
as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one asked for any background checks, waiting periods, no  
paperwork,'' Lockyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	County Supervisor Mike Antonovich voted against the gun show ban  
and denounced it as political grandstanding that penalizes the 
law-abiding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solution to gun violence is a zero-tolerance policy  
against criminals who use guns, and enforcing the law to confiscate 
guns from convicted felons,'' Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonovich also predicted the ordinance would lead to costly  
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, lawsuits are being threatened, and worse. Yaroslavsky is  
being inundated with anti-Semitic e-mail and hate letters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most intense set of anti-Semitic letters I've ever  
received,'' he said. ``I've received hate mail for years but none 
of it could add up to what I've gotten in the last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The intensity may lie in numbers that make the vote more  
significant than the usual local government action. With 9.8 
million in Los Angeles County, each board member has a constituency 
of nearly 2 million people, making the supervisors some of the most 
powerful elected officials in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The action is part of a gun-control groundswell.  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and Los Angeles Police Chief  
Bernard Parks have taken strong positions for gun control since the 
Jewish center shooting. The three weapons-related laws signed by 
Gov. Davis on Friday impose tougher manufacturing standards on 
handguns, require the sale of trigger locks with guns, and increase 
regulations at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Seger, manager of the Great Western show, fired off a news  
release accusing Yaroslavsky of ``attempting to destroy the 
livelihood of not only the Great Western Show but of 2,000 
exhibitors from all over the world to buy sell and trade all types 
of items.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He maintained that only 10 percent of tables at the exhibition  
contain modern firearms and the rest sell such things as military 
memorabilia, fishing gear, clothing for outdoorsmen, jewelry and 
Indian artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Yaroslavsky said all those items could be sold under the new  
ordinance, but on-site sales of firearms and ammunition would be 
banned. Weapons may be displayed but a buyer would have to go to a 
seller's place of business to make the purchase.

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Batters Northern Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- A strengthened Hurricane Dennis battered  
the northern Bahamas on Saturday, tearing up trees and utility 
poles, ripping down buildings under construction and threatening to 
grow even more powerful as it approaches the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters projected that by Monday Dennis would become a  
Category 3 storm with winds up to 130 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane could make landfall around Tuesday, most likely  
somewhere in the Carolinas, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it also could veer away from land.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's some glimmer of hope,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director  
of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Some of the (computer) 
models are beginning to show that it may miss the coast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrel said current forecasts show the hurricane's core passing  
about 100 miles off the shore of Florida -- within the radius for 50 
or 60 mph winds. ``That suggests that they're going to get strong 
winds (in Florida) and they're really going to get some strong surf 
out of this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still hundreds of miles away on Saturday, Dennis kicked up  
8-foot-high waves off Florida and North Carolina, delighting 
surfers but prompting officials to put state troopers and the 
National Guard on alert. Hurricane watches and tropical storm 
warnings were issued along hundreds of miles of the eastern 
seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 p.m. EDT, Dennis was centered 180 miles east of Florida's  
Cape Canaveral, near latitude 28.0 north and longitude 77.6 west. 
Hurricane warnings in the Bahamas were discontinued as it moved 
away from islands. 
</P>
<P>
	It packed sustained winds of 105 mph with higher gusts, up from  
80 mph the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm broadened during the day, with hurricane winds that  
had extended 40 miles from its center stretching to 60 miles. It 
was crawling on a west-northwest track at close to 6 mph. Its 
tropical storm winds extended another 160 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell said he was worried because three projections showed  
Dennis stalling again somewhere between Georgia and the Outer Banks 
with winds of 115 to 130 mph. The storm had hovered for hours 
overnight as it crept alongside the Abaco islands in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm had passed the Bahamas by Saturday afternoon. In Grand  
Abaco, a sliver of land no more than 10 miles wide with a 
population of several thousand, residents told tales of destruction 
and debris it left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Just back from a drive around Grand Abaco's Marsh Harbour, the  
Rev. Carlton Dorsette said about 70 percent of the walls were down 
on a commercial building under construction and his own house under 
construction was ``totally down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't much rain but lots of wind. I think we probably  
got a direct hit last night,'' he said. ``Lots of trees have 
fallen, power lines are down, a lot of phone lines are damaged, 
cable lines are damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of boats had gone under in the harbor, but the airport  
looked unscathed, Dorsette said. The Bahamas Air Sea Rescue 
Association said it had heard reports of several boats breaking 
their moorings and smashing onto rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Tate, a fisherman at Sweeting's Cay in the Abacos, said  
the storm damaged banana and other fruit trees, smashing some to 
the ground. It ripped the shingles off some roofs and tore down 
shacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to dump up to 10 inches of rain and create  
battering waves up to 8 feet above normal that could damage fragile 
coral reefs and beaches of sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Weather Service said projections for Dennis  
``become a bit more uncertain'' after Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane watch remained in effect for the east coast of  
Florida from Sebastian Inlet northward to Fernandina Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	People began preparing for the storm, stocking up on supplies  
and lumber. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was 
stocking up on water and other necessities at regional centers. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, but no decision 
has been made on whether to evacuate people from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, 150,000 coastal residents were put on alert,  
as were state troopers and emergency management personnel. 
</P>

in canals to lessen the risk of flooding in heavy rains.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Prince Was Winning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- With his week of golf and socializing on  
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., behind him, President Clinton offered an 
update Saturday on his friendly wager with the duke of York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to pay him four dollars,'' Clinton said of Britain's  
Prince Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
	The prince was winning when their party was rained off the  
course on the 15th hole Friday, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was catching up,'' the president told reporters aboard Air  
Force One on Saturday, after he left the resort island for a 
weekend of fund raising for Democrats on New York's Long Island. 
The Clintons also squeezed in a little house-hunting in nearby 
Westchester County, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The $4 was cheap by comparison to the wager Clinton described at  
the start of the round Friday. He jokingly told reporters then that 
if he lost he had promised to return Martha's Vineyard to the duchy 
of York, which controlled the island in the 17th century.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Strengthens, Could Hit US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- East Coast beachgoers and coastal  
residents kept a watch on changing weather forecasts Saturday as 
Hurricane Dennis added muscle while moving slowly through the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm's course was uncertain. Various computer models  
suggested it could affect the coast of the Carolinas late Monday or 
Tuesday, or veer away from land, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some glimmer of hope,'' National Hurricane Center  
director Jerry Jarrell said Saturday afternoon. ``Some of the 
models are beginning to show that it may miss the coast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would take another day or two before forecasters could feel  
more confident in their forecast for the Carolinas, he said, but 
``it is a glimmer of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters also had warned that Dennis might stall somewhere  
along the coast, giving it more time to pile up a storm surge and 
to batter the beach with erosive waves. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane center cautioned that storms can deviate widely  
from projections. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time to let down our guard nor is there any  
reason to panic,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Smith wasn't letting his guard down, as he stocked up with  
20 gallons of bottled water on South Carolina's Isle of Palms. 
</P>
<P>
	``My gut feeling is it's not going to hit, but I like to be  
prepared just in case,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis battered the northern Bahamas early Saturday, tearing up  
trees and utility poles, ripping small boats from their moorings 
and breaking down buildings under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	At North Carolina's Kill Devil Hills, on the Outer Banks chain  
of islands, Howard and Jean Wamsley of Colonial Heights, Va., 
boarded up the windows and 8-foot glass sliding doors at their 
vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my dream house and we've got to protect it,'' Mrs.  
Wamsley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Wilmington, N.C., Wrightsville Beach lifeguards posted red  
flags along the beach Saturday, warning people not to enter the 
water because of the possibility that the surf could generate 
dangerous rip currents. A 10-year-old swimmer drowned in a rip 
current before Hurricane Bonnie last year at Atlantic Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 p.m. EDT, Dennis had strengthened, with its sustained wind  
accelerating to 105 mph, and was centered about 180 miles east of 
Cape Canaveral, Fla., the hurricane center said. It was moving 
toward the northwest at about 6 mph, and was expected to gradually 
turn toward the north on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane was expected to strengthen, and could become a  
Category 3 storm, with wind of 111 mph to 130 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical storm warnings and a hurricane watch were in effect  
Saturday for the Florida coast north to the Georgia state line, and 
the hurricane center said the watches and warnings would be 
extended northward as the storm moved. 
</P>
<P>
	A heavy surf advisory was posted for the coast of Georgia. Some  
people called resorts to cancel their reservations while others 
went to the beach to surf in the high waves. 
</P>
<P>
	Five-foot seas also attracted dozens of surfers Saturday off  
Cocoa Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in Hawaii so the only real challenge left is to say  
I've surfed hurricane waves,'' Bill Boggs, 45, said as he watched 
fellow surfers off the Cocoa Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheryl Woods-Flowers, the mayor of Mount Pleasant, S.C., just  
east of Charleston, said people should at least get ready for 
protective measures such as covering windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably not going to start putting my husband on a ladder  
until tomorrow,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 South Carolina National Guardsmen were on alert  
upstate and some 600 law enforcement officers were on the coast in 
case they are needed to direct traffic in the event of an 
evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hodges met with emergency officials early Saturday to  
be briefed on the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we are still not talking about any evacuation,  
we are simply taking the normal precautions that should be taken,'' 
Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Isle of Palms, landscaper David Schwartz stocked up on  
water but said he would likely leave if Dennis threatens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the last ones have been, I have no gut feeling,'' he  
said. ``They are so unpredictable.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Vacation Turns to House Hunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton interrupted his  
fun-in-the-sun and fund-raising responsibilities Saturday to walk 
through a potential future home in Westchester County with his wife 
and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons squeezed in a visit to a four-story colonial north  
of New York City before heading to the Hamptons on Long Island for 
a weekend of fund-raising parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton brushed aside a question about what he wanted in a home.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some place nice and airy that will make Hillary happy -- that's  
what I want,'' the president said. His wife, standing a few yards 
behind him on Air Force One, laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton is scouting real estate just north of New  
York City. Presuming she decides to run for the U.S. Senate next 
year, she'll need to establish residency by Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons spent nearly two hours inspecting a white Georgian  
colonial in Chappaqua that a listing agent said costs nearly $1.7 
million. It boasts a swimming pool out back and an exercise room on 
the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The house sits screened by evergreens at the end of a cul-de-sac  
called Old House Lane, in a community described by neighbors as a 
quiet area with good schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very nice house, but we don't have any announcement to  
make,'' Clinton said after the visit. It was the only house the 
Clintons saw Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised to see this as a post-presidential  
neighborhood,'' said Todd Neufeld, 33, who moved in two months ago 
with his wife Michelle and infant daughter. ``People keep to 
themselves. It's a quiet neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the house tour, Clinton left his unusually small motorcade  
to shake hands with neighbors gathered at the bottom of the street. 
</P>
<P>
	One potential neighbor, Osman Osmani, wished the first lady well  
as she contemplates the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic 
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you become our next senator,'' Osmani said.  
</P>
<P>
	The president jumped in with a reply: ``She becomes the senator,  
I'd be the first neighbor?'' Clinton said. ``I'm looking for a new 
role in life, you know? I like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another neighbor said the home's current owner is a doctor who  
founded a chain of health clinics. Many other neighbors are 
doctors, bankers and other professionals, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the family spent a Sunday visiting  
properties in the area, and Mrs. Clinton slipped off the 
Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard unnoticed last Saturday 
for additional house hunting, said administration officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	After the house hunt, a money hunt was planned.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons were the star attractions at a string of political  
fund-raising parties this weekend in the wealthy Hamptons suburbs 
on the shores of New York's Long Island. The Clintons were spending 
a couple nights at the home of Hollywood filmmaker Steven 
Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the money will go toward Mrs. Clinton's all-but-declared  
Senate race, and some to Democratic candidates generally. 
</P>
<P>
	Three events were scheduled for Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	In East Hampton, the Clintons are hosts for a buffet reception  
of the young Democrats' ``Saxophone Club.'' The relatively low $250 
ticket price was expected to draw about 800 people and raise some 
$200,000 for the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, proceeds from a $1,000-per-plate barbecue dinner for 300  
will be divided between Mrs. Clinton's campaign, the DNC and the 
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A $5,000-per-person lunch for 80 in Southampton on Sunday also  
was planned. The first $1,000 from every ticket, a party official 
said, will go to Mrs. Clinton's race, with the remainder shared by 
the Democratic committees. 
</P>
<P>
	In the priciest of the galas, rocker Jon Bon Jovi provides the  
music at a Bridgehampton dinner Sunday night for the DNC. At 
$25,000 per couple, Democrats hope the event will raise $900,000.

<HEADLINE> Source: Starr Appeals Leaks Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Usually antagonists, Whitewater prosecutor  
Kenneth Starr and the Clinton Justice Department have joined forces 
to appeal a judge's ruling on alleged grand jury leaks during the 
Monica Lewinsky investigation, legal sources say. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr asked an appeals panel in mid-July to intervene quickly  
and overturn the findings of U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway 
Johnson, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has had its own inquiries into leaks that  
may have come from Starr's office. But it has joined the 
independent counsel in his appeal, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether the independent counsel improperly leaked  
secret grand jury information to the news media. Federal rules 
prohibit prosecutors and court officials from disclosing evidence 
brought before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is not accused of leaking in this case,  
but the department may be worried that the court is setting an 
unreasonable precedent. Justice officials have explained in the 
past that if they got involved in the case it would be to ensure 
that their own prosecutors are not hamstrung in giving reporters 
information in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the impeachment investigation is long over, the judge's  
investigation into alleged leaks remains a concern for the 
embattled independent counsel's office. The prosecutors want to 
clear their names and avoid possible penalties, including fines or 
action against their law licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In his appeal, which remains under seal, Starr argues that  
Johnson was wrong in ruling that investigative matters not yet 
brought before a grand jury should be covered by secrecy rules that 
apply to the grand jury itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also challenged the standard Johnson used to determine  
there was preliminary evidence to believe that news articles in 
question likely came from Starr's office, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources include lawyers or employees inside the federal  
courthouse in Washington. They are not members of Starr's office or 
President Clinton's legal team, which filed the original complaint 
in spring 1998 accusing Starr's office of illegal leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr asked the appeals court to intervene on an expedited basis  
after Johnson ruled in the leaks case, the sources said. They 
weren't more specific except to say the ruling involved a Feb. 1 
complaint filed by presidential lawyer David Kendall that alleged 
additional grand jury leaks by Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The leak accusations were used by Clinton's defenders to  
undermine the credibility of Starr's investigation, especially 
during the sensitive months surrounding the president's impeachment 
and acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the leaks investigation has been played out in secret,  
although documents unsealed by courts give the public a taste of 
how vigorously both sides have waged battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall touched off the court fight during the early days of the  
Lewinsky investigation, when he accused Starr's office of illegally 
leaking damaging information about the president, including the 
testimony of Oval Office secretary Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall cited numerous newspaper and TV reports quoting  
anonymous sources as describing evidence that prosecutors were 
bringing before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who as the chief judge of the federal court in  
Washington oversees grand jury investigation, ruled last summer 
that there was preliminary evidence suggesting Starr's office made 
``serious and repetitive'' violations of grand jury secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge cited 24 news stories she said likely came from  
Starr's office. They included general accounts of Starr's ``next 
moves'' and specific reports that the prosecutor had rejected a 
proposed immunity deal for Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered a court official, called a special master, to  
investigate further. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also concluded that, at least in the court district  
covering Washington, it has been clear that ``government attorneys 
may not reveal documentary evidence that is likely to be presented 
to the grand jury'' -- even if it was not yet presented. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before his appeal, Starr has made clear he disagreed that  
information not yet presented is covered by secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely not grand jury information, if you are talking  
about what witnesses tell FBI agents or us before they testify,'' 
he said last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also has argued that White House and defense lawyers -- not  
the prosecutor's office -- were the prime suspects for the leaks. 
Kendall has countered that the White House had no interest in 
leaking information damaging to the president.

<HEADLINE> Facts About Top Seeds at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A quick look at the seeded players in the U.S.  
Open tennis championships being played Aug. 30-Sept. 12 at the USTA 
National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows: 
</P>
<P>
                              *Women    	
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 1 Martina Hingis    	
</P>
<P>
	Although she won the Australian Open in January and has regained  
the No. 1 ranking, Martina Hingis is trying to put her winning game 
back together after losing the French Open final to Steffi Graf, 
then being shocked by Jelena Dokic in the first round at Wimbledon. 
While she is still a marvelous all-court player with great 
anticipation and every shot in the book, other players are finding 
ways to beat Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 2 Lindsay Davenport    	
</P>
<P>
	The defending U.S. Open champion, the 6-foot-2, 175-pound  
right-hander won her second Grand Slam tournament title in 
impressive fashion, beating Steffi Graf in the Wimbledon final. 
While she hasn't dominated the hard court circuit this year, 
Davenport comes into the U.S. Open full of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 3 Venus Williams    	
</P>
<P>
	Venus has the game to win it all: huge serve, big forehand,  
penetrating backhand, quick feet, great range. And neither Venus 
nor her sister, seventh-seeded Serena, lack confidence. She has 
wins over all the top players, but not in the biggest tournaments 
of all, the majors. Perhaps this is the year. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 4. Monica Seles    	
</P>
<P>
	Once the dominating force in women's tennis, Seles has shown  
that she can again be a factor in the big tournaments. But she now 
stands on or behind the baseline instead of inside, her angles 
aren't quite as sharp, nor does she seem to hit the ball as hard. 
That, however, could be because everyone else is hitting the ball 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 5. Mary Pierce    	
</P>
<P>
	One of the hardest hitters in women's tennis, Pierce has always  
been hampered by her lack of mobility. The French woman, who has 
had a series of nagging injuries, has yet to win a title in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 6 Amanda Coetzer    	
</P>
<P>
	It's sometimes hard to figure out how this little South African  
-- she stands only 5-foot-2 -- can be ranked so high. And while she 
has yet to win a Grand Slam tournament, Coetzer's consistency, hard 
work and doggedness means she always around when the quarterfinals 
are played. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 7 Serena Williams    	
</P>
<P>
	Father Richard Williams said Serena will eventually be the  
better of the two Williams sisters. She has won three tournaments 
this year, posting victories over the top players. It's lack of 
experience that could keep her out of the winner's circle at 
Flushing Meadow until the next century. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 8 Jana Novotna    	
</P>
<P>
	Winning Wimbledon in 1998 was the apex of her career, and she  
has since played that way. One of the few serve-and-volleyers in 
the women's game, at age 30 Novotna is a half-step slower and more 
error-prone with her forehand. 
</P>
<P>
                     *No. 9 Julie Halard-Decugis    	
</P>
<P>
	Has been consistent this year. And her experience gives her an  
edge over players with more weapons. 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 10 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario    	
</P>
<P>
	Like Coetzer, the 5-6 1/2 Sanchez-Vicario's forte has been her  
running down every shot and making her opponent hit yet another. 
But she seems to have lost a half-step and doesn't have a weapon to 
really hurt her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 11 Nathalie Tauziat    	
</P>
<P>
	Late in her career -- she's 31 -- the French woman has found  
success. But her game won't stand up to the power or the craftiness 
of the top teen-agers in the field. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 12 Barbara Schett    	
</P>
<P>
	An Austrian right-hander, Schett is capable of upsetting some of  
the top players, but not enough of them to win the U.S. 0pen. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 13 Dominique Van Roost    	
</P>
<P>
	Van Roost last year became the first Belgian to be ranked in the  
world's Top 10. This year the right-hander reached the 
quarterfinals at the Australian Open and the fourth round at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 14 Sandrine Testud    	
</P>
<P>
	While dangerous, this French woman is not considered a contender  
in the year's final major. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 15 Amelie Mauresmo    	
</P>
<P>
	A French left-hander with heavy ground strokes, Mauresmo was a  
surprising finalist at the Australian Open in January. She won't 
get that far at Flushing Meadow. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 16 Conchita Martinez    	
</P>
<P>
	This Spaniard's big topspin shots took her to the Wimbledon  
title five years ago, and she has twice reached the semifinals of 
the U.S. Open. Her chances of doing it again, however, are growing 
slim. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Men    	
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 1 Pete Sampras    	
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras is going after history. He tied Roy Emerson by  
winning his 12th Grand Slam tournament men's singles title when he 
captured Wimbledon for the sixth time in July. Sampras has the 
game, the temperament and the confidence to win his fifth U.S. Open 
crown, although he is coming into the tournament after suffering a 
strained hip flexor. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 2 Andre Agassi    	
</P>
<P>
	When he won the French Open in June, Agassi became only the  
fifth man to win all four Grand Slam tournaments in a career, and 
the first American since Don Budge won all four in 1938. Agassi 
then reached the final at Wimbledon before falling to Sampras, yet 
took over the No. 1 ranking for three weeks, the first time Agassi 
had led the rankings since 1996. His return of serve makes him a 
strong candidate to win his second U.S. Open. His serve, however, 
is a liability. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 3 Yevgeny Kafelnikov    	
</P>
<P>
	He could cap an up-and-down year with his first U.S. Open crown.  
The Russian right-hander began the year by winning the Australian 
Open. Then, after suffering six straight opening-round defeats, 
Kafelnikov took over the No. 1 ranking before promptly losing 
again. If he is confident, Kafelnikov could be a factor. If he's 
not, he might not get through the first round. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 4 Patrick Rafter    	
</P>
<P>
	Rafter's serve-and-volley game fits perfectly on the hard courts  
of Arthur Ashe Stadium, where he has won the last two U.S. Opens. 
He seemed ready to do it again before he had to pull out of his 
last two tournaments with tendinitis in his right shoulder. The key 
is whether the shoulder will hold up through the entire two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 5 Gustavo Kuerten    	
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian right-hander has become much more consistent since  
he was a surprising winner at the French Open in 1997. He has a 
powerful baseline game, yet is not afraid to come to the net when 
he gets a short ball. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 6 Tim Henman    	
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long time since a British player has been one of the  
favorites to win a Grand Slam men's singles title, but Tim Henman 
fits that bill with a strong serve and crisp net play. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 7 Todd Martin    	
</P>
<P>
	Missed most of 1997 with injuries, but has come back strongly  
behind his big serve. The right-hander's biggest problem has been 
his court coverage. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 8 Carlos Moya    	
</P>
<P>
	One of the best clay court players in the game, Moya last year  
showed that he could play on hard court, reaching the semifinals at 
the National Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 9 Greg Rusedski    	
</P>
<P>
	A British Davis Cup teammate of Tim Henman, Rusedski has a big  
left-handed serve that took him to the U.S. Open final in 1997. He 
is coming off his latest injury and has not played much this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 10 Marcelo Rios    	
</P>
<P>
	American Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson said of Rios: ``Always  
talented, always dangerous, always moody.'' Enough said of the 
talented left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 11 Mark Philippoussis    	
</P>
<P>
	Was a U.S. Open finalist last year, but has missed his last two  
tournaments with tendinitis in his right shoulder, an injury that 
also sidelined him earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 12 Richard Krajicek    	
</P>
<P>
	Another big server, this Dutchman won Wimbledon in 1996. He has  
reached the fourth round at Flushing Meadow, but not since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 13 Alex Corretja    	
</P>
<P>
	A baseliner, the Spanish right-hander has shown he can win on  
most surfaces, capturing the year-ending ATP Tour World 
Championship on carpet last year after reaching the fourth round at 
the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 14 Tommy Haas    	
</P>
<P>
	Haas and Kiefer have carried German hopes into the top 20 in the  
world. The 21-year-old right-hander has victories over Agassi, 
Kafelnikov and Henman. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 15 Nicolas Kiefer    	
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer, a right-hander, has a perfect record against Rafter,  
beating the Australian three times. He also has victories over 
Kafelnikov, Kuerten and Henman. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 16 Nicolas Lapentti    	
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti has zoomed up the rankings, becoming No. 16 when he won  
the Indianapolis tournament a week ago, his first title in almost 
four years. He's reached the quarterfinals or better in five of his 
last six tournaments.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane A Distant Threat in S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- As Hurricane Dennis inched closer to  
the lower East Coast, surfers took advantage of high waves and 
tourists bathed in the sun on the beach, taking reports about the 
approaching storm system in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just watch the weather periodically,'' said Shara  
Lindsey-Waters, as she husband Frank Walters and their two 
daughters sat in the sand Friday afternoon at Myrtle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We trust Myrtle Beach will give us plenty of warning,'' said  
Walters, from Stauton, Va.. ``Myrtle Beach is ready for that kind 
of stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said Dennis could strengthen and hit the United  
States as a major storm today, sliding along the Florida coast and 
heading up to North Carolina by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hurricane threat, Thomas Edwards, manager of the  
Holiday Sands Motel that overlooks the beach, said Friday the motel 
was booked solid with about 400 people and no one had called to 
cancel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the governor calls a mandatory evacuation of the area,  
it's business as usual,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From hundreds of miles away, Dennis kicked up 8-foot-high waves  
off Florida and North Carolina, delighting surfers but prompting 
officials to put state troopers and the National Guard on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane watches were issued, as were tropical storm warnings  
along hundreds of miles of the eastern seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. EDT, the 80-mph hurricane was near the Bahamas, about  
280 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	But forecasters warned residents not to take the threat lightly.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to take it seriously, (and) hope the hurricane doesn't  
hit,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane 
Center in Miami. ``But it's coming too close for you to take a 
chance on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While surfers took advantage of the waves, county officials  
removed traffic signs, lifeguard towers and barricades from the 
beach so they wouldn't be blown away by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrimp boats returned early to Port Canaveral, and the South  
Florida Water Management District lowered water levels in canals to 
lessen the risk of flooding in heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, the governor ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, while in North 
Carolina, 150,000 coastal residents were put on alert, as were 
state troopers and emergency management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	People in Myrtle Beach kept an eye on the weather reports.  
However, with predictions that the storm -- if it hits -- wouldn't 
land until at least Monday, most people in this city that thrives 
on tourism enjoyed the sun and surf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not really a huge issue right now,'' lifeguard Mike Miehm  
said, who said he was in for a lot of work ``because people try to 
get in as much surfing before the hurricane. It's really 
dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Breakers Hotel, manager Kay Harris said most of 400 rooms  
were filled for Friday night with golfers, tourists and some 
reporters. She said reports of the storm chased away a lot of 
walk-in business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally we have a trail of traffic up (U.S.) Highway 501 and  
tonight there's nothing,'' Ms. Harris said. With the weather 
channels and the Internet, she said, ``it seems we start earlier 
with the worry and warnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Charleston, S.C., one of the only signs of an approaching  
storm was a collection of television satellite trucks parked along 
the city's historic battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, John Pharr, a senior at the College of Charleston, was  
surfing the 5-foot waves at Folly Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's happened before,'' the Virginia Beach, Va., resident  
said. ``I'm not too worried.''

<HEADLINE> Smith's Sprinters Steal World Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Maybe they should create a new entry on  
the medals table at the World Championships: HSI. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the name of the team of runners who train in Los Angeles  
under the tutelage of sprint guru John Smith and manager Emmanuel 
Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, HSI (which stands both for Hudson Smith International  
and Handling Speed Intelligently) sprinters have won three gold 
medals and one silver at the championships, with the chance for 
more in the relays this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	HSI won two more gold medals Friday night, with Maurice Greene  
and Inger Miller streaking to victories in the 200-meter dashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning is contagious among the club,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller went first, winning her race in a sparkling 21.77  
seconds, her best time ever and fastest in the world this year. It 
was her first major championship victory, topping the silver medal 
she won in the 100 last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene dominated a modest field for his first major 200 title in  
19.90 seconds, his fastest time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, who won the 100 title in 9.80 seconds, became the first  
man to complete the double at a major global meet since Carl Lewis 
swept both short sprints at the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I saw Inger win, I knew I had to go out there and do it  
for the team,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrations that followed resembled a family reunion, with  
Greene, Smith, Hudson and Miller sharing hugs all around. 
</P>
<P>
	The most emotional moment came when Greene and Miller broke into  
tears as they held each other in a long, tight embrace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inger and me got very close this week,'' Greene said. ``We  
came here to do a job. She stood by me when I won the 100. We 
achieved what we came here to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene also shed tears on the medal stand, just as he did in  
1997 when he won his first world 100 title in Athens, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I've worked all year for,'' said Greene, who can  
win a third gold in the 400-meter relay this weekend. ``Those were 
tears of joy. I'm still crying inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said he was just as happy for Miller, who joined the  
Smith camp last year after being coached her entire career by her 
father, Lennox, the 1968 Olympic silver medalist and 1972 bronze 
medalist in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little more proud for Inger than for myself,'' Greene  
said. ``I've seen what she's been through and all the changes she's 
had to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's group also includes Trinidad's Ato Boldon, the 1997  
world 200 champion who missed the championships with an injury, and 
U.S. sprinter Jon Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union of Maurice and Inger helped both of them,'' Hudson  
said. ``The difference between this year and last year for Inger is 
that she has training partners. Maurice is like her coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Miller lauded the camaraderie of the HSI camp,  
where the sprinters train, eat and go out together, and tease and 
playfully trash-talk each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``To run as part of John Smith's group is like having an  
extended family,'' Miller said. ``We are all brothers and sisters 
together and that gives you so much confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Boldon: ``It's definitely a question of us against them.  
You can never underestimate the importance of that. It's an 
individual sport, but we're a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has emerged from the shadow of non-HSI member Marion  
Jones, the world's top female star. Jones was going for four gold 
medals here, but after her 100 victory, settled for bronze in the 
long jump, then pulled up with back spasms and cramps in the 200 
semis and withdrew from the meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just a one-woman show,'' Miller said. ``We'll have a  
pretty good rivalry going next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's other finals, Italy's Fabrizio Mori, who was at  
first disqualified in the semifinals of the men's 400 hurdles and 
then reinstated, won in 47.72, the world's fastest time this year; 
Romania's Gabriela Szabo retained the women's 5,000 title at 
14:41.82, a championship record, and Hongyu Liu led a 1-2 Chinese 
finish in the women's 20-kilometer walk at 1:30:50. 
</P>
<P>
	Mori's victory was protested by the French team, which claimed  
the Italian ran out of his lane and should have been disqualified. 
The protest was rejected. Had it been accepted, France's Stephane 
Diagana, the second-place finisher and Olympic champion, would have 
been the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	There was another protest affecting the third-place finish in  
the women's 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica's Beverly McDonald was originally awarded the bronze  
ahead of Germany's Andrea Philipp, though both were timed in 22.22. 
After the German's protest, officials decided to give bronze medals 
to both runners. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Ludmila Engquist, the inspirational story of the  
championships, continued her remarkable run toward a second 
straight title in the women's 100 hurdles. Engquist, who had 
undergone four chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer and has 
two more remaining, won her semifinal heat at 12.50, the 
second-fastest in the world this year.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Batters Northern Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- A strengthened Hurricane Dennis battered  
the northern Bahamas on Saturday, tearing up trees and utility 
poles, ripping down buildings under construction and threatening to 
grow even more powerful as it approaches the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, which had left the Bahamas heading northwest by the  
afternoon, should become a Category 3 storm with winds up to 130 
mph by Monday, forecasters projected. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dennis' path was still not clear. It could make landfall  
around Tuesday, most likely somewhere in the Carolinas, forecasters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it also could veer away from land.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's some glimmer of hope,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director  
of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Some of the (computer) 
models are beginning to show that it may miss the coast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell said current forecasts show the hurricane's core passing  
about 100 miles off the shore of Florida -- within the radius for 50 
or 60 mph winds. ``That suggests that they're going to get strong 
winds (in Florida) and they're really going to get some strong surf 
out of this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still hundreds of miles away on Saturday, Dennis kicked up  
8-foot-high waves along the coast from Florida to North Carolina, 
delighting surfers but prompting officials to put state troopers on 
alert. Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were issued 
along hundreds of miles of the eastern seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, Dennis was centered 325 miles south-southeast of  
Charleston, S.C., and 390 miles south of Wilmington, N.C. It packed 
maximum sustained winds of 125 mph with higher gusts, up from 80 
mph the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm broadened during the day, with hurricane winds that  
had extended up to 60 miles. It was crawling on a west-northwest 
track at close to 7 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell said he was worried because three projections showed  
Dennis stalling again somewhere between Georgia and North 
Carolina's Outer Banks with winds of 115 to 130 mph. The storm had 
hovered for hours overnight as it crept alongside the Abaco islands 
in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	After the storm had moved on and hurricane warnings were lifted,  
the residents of Grand Abaco, a sliver of land no more than 10 
miles wide with a population of several thousand, assessed the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Just back from a drive around Grand Abaco's Marsh Harbour, the  
Rev. Carlton Dorsette said about 70 percent of the walls were down 
on a commercial building under construction and his own house under 
construction was ``totally down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't much rain but lots of wind. I think we probably  
got a direct hit last night,'' he said. ``Lots of trees have 
fallen, power lines are down, a lot of phone lines are damaged, 
cable lines are damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of boats had gone under in the harbor, but the airport  
looked unscathed, Dorsette said. The Bahamas Air Sea Rescue 
Association said it had heard reports of several boats breaking 
their moorings and smashing onto rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Tate, a fisherman at Sweeting's Cay in the Abacos, said  
the storm damaged banana and other fruit trees, smashing some to 
the ground. It ripped the shingles off some roofs and tore down 
shacks. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane watch remained in effect for the east coast of  
Florida from Sebastian Inlet northward to Fernandina Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	People began preparing for the storm, stocking up on supplies  
and lumber. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was 
stocking up on water and other necessities at regional centers. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, about 1,000 National Guardsmen moved toward  
the coast on Saturday. Several hundred law enforcement officers 
were already there in case they are needed to direct traffic in the 
event of an evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, 150,000 coastal residents were put on alert,  
as were state troopers and emergency management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Florida Water Management District lowered water levels  
in canals to lessen the risk of flooding in heavy rains.

<HEADLINE> Family Condemns Deadly Calif. Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMPTON, Calif. (AP) -- The family of a 65-year-old man killed by  
El Monte police during a search for drugs plans to file a lawsuit, 
the family's lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Paz was shot twice in the back in front of his wife in  
their bedroom after SWAT officers raided the house in the Los 
Angeles suburb. No drugs were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in this house was a homicide,'' attorney Brian  
Dunn said Thursday during a news conference at the home where the 
Aug. 9 raid took place. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said Paz, a father of six and grandfather of 14, was  
shot because he appeared to be trying to reach for a gun, but Dunn 
said he posed ``no threat of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family planned to file a lawsuit alleging wrongful death and  
civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating the  
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 20 officers shot the locks off the doors and entered the  
home as the family was sleeping at about 11 p.m., the family and 
police indicated. Although no drugs were found, officers said they 
seized three pistols, a .22-caliber rifle and $10,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members said the guns were for protection and the money  
was Paz' life savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody at the home was arrested.  
</P>
<P>
	El Monte Assistant Police Chief Bill Ankeny said officers were  
seeking evidence against a drug suspect who had been released on 
bail the morning of the raid. The Compton home was targeted in a 
search warrant because mail with its address was found in other 
raids, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Rescued in Lake Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A pilot whose plane dove into Lake Michigan after  
the engine stalled Saturday was rescued by a passing sailboat crew 
who threw him a buoy and motor boat passengers who pulled him 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Edling, 57, made a distress call to Chicago's Meigs  
Field about 9 a.m., saying his single-engine Piper Cherokee had 
stalled and he couldn't restart it, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 
Howard McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had taken off from Chicago's Midway Airport for a tour of the  
lakeshore. 
</P>
<P>
	Edling tried to land the plane on the water, then jumped out,  
McCarthy said. Authorities said no one else was aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is safe. He's shaken up. He's tired and declined medical  
assistance,'' McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edling declined to speak to reporters after he was brought  
ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's more worried about getting his plane back,'' said  
Commander Will Knight, a spokesman for the Chicago Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane sank in 25 feet of water.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation  
Administration were called to investigate.

<HEADLINE> Judge Reverses Himself on Vouchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A federal judge who blocked a state-funded  
school voucher program this week, sparking turmoil among worried 
parents on the eve of the new school year, has reversed his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. ruled Friday that  
elementary school students who participated in the program last 
year may receive vouchers again this year to attend private 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	However, children new to the program will not be allowed to get  
the tuition grants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very unfair to do to children,'' said Dawne Bivins,  
31, who has two daughters signed up for the voucher program. 
</P>
<P>
	Bivins' 10-year-old has received voucher money for three years,  
but her 5-year-old is a first-year participant. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you give it to one and not the other? How can you do  
that?'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried parents of voucher students flooded schools with phone  
calls after Oliver's first ruling, wondering if their children 
could still attend private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver said the new arrangement, which rolls back a ruling he  
made Tuesday, will last only one semester or until a final judgment 
is reached in a lawsuit claiming the program violates the 
constitutional separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	He set a Dec. 13 trial date for the lawsuit brought by civil  
liberty and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 students from kindergarten through sixth grade were  
to receive up to $2,500 in tuition vouchers for private schools in 
Cleveland. Court records show that 587 students were expected to 
join the program this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, Oliver suspended the program until trial, saying the  
program appears to have the ``primary effect of advancing 
religion.'' Most of the 56 private schools that participate are 
religious institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling Friday, Oliver said that because the state  
approved funding for this year's voucher program in late July, it 
was inevitable that a court challenge would come in August as 
schools were set to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's new ruling didn't satisfy some voucher proponents.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stunned,'' said David Zanotti, chairman of a pro-voucher  
group called The School Choice Committee. ``There's absolutely no 
logic to this decision. Either the program is right or wrong. Why 
do you hang the kids out to dry? 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still jerking around the lives of several hundred  
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voucher opponents said they still expect to prevail.  
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is that there's nothing that changes  
what he said before -- that he is likely to hold the voucher program 
unconstitutional,'' said Judith Schaeffer, spokeswoman for People 
for the American Way Foundation, a Washington D.C.-based 
anti-voucher group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just inevitable that those children are going to have to  
leave at some point because they're going to lose this case,'' 
Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office, which has appealed the  
suspension of the program to federal court, said it was still 
deciding whether to file another appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	One pro-voucher group, the Institute for Justice, said it filed  
an immediate appeal of Oliver's latest decision to the 6th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, asking that all the voucher 
students be allowed to receive the grants. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old pilot program, which provides tuition money for  
children of poor families, is the only one of its kind in Ohio. It 
has an $11.2 million budget for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The voucher schools responded to the first ruling by letting the  
students into class until an appeal was heard or Oliver decided 
whether to let his first decision stand.

<HEADLINE> Parents Push To End Binge Drinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- At midnight on the dawn of his 21st  
birthday, Bradley McCue and his buddies headed to a downtown bar 
for a collegiate celebration ritual: drinking the number of shots 
equal to his age. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley knew the record among his friends was 23 shots. So he  
drank for 90 minutes until he reached 24. 
</P>
<P>
	His friends took him home and put him to bed. As he passed out,  
they scribbled ``24 shots'' on his forehead, thinking he just 
needed to sleep it off. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, Bradley was dead. The alcohol had depressed  
his system so much that he stopped breathing, his blood-alcohol 
level at 0.44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Devastated by their son's death, John and Cindy McCue set out to  
keep it from happening to others -- and to make binge drinking and 
its dangers more widely known. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we started reading and investigating, we found out this  
happens a lot,'' Mrs. McCue said. ``People hide it because they're 
embarrassed, but hiding it means that nobody understands it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after Bradley's Nov. 5 death, the McCues formed  
B.R.A.D., for Be Responsible About Drinking, to educate people 
about celebration drinking and alcohol poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	With their own money and contributions, they send birthday cards  
to every Michigan State student turning 21 -- about 5,000 a year. 
Each card is signed by the couple and features Bradley's story and 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're turning 21 ... celebrate! We want you to turn 22 ...  
celebrate responsibly!'' says the card, which includes a 
wallet-size insert on alcohol poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	The McCues also started a B.R.A.D. Web site that gives alcohol  
information and memorializes Bradley, a junior who was majoring in 
parks and recreation management and was looking forward to a study 
program in the Netherlands when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	They have produced the wallet-sized cards for distribution at  
colleges and high schools, made videos about alcohol abuse, talked 
to college and high school groups, and given Michigan State $7,000 
for alcohol education projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're probably the most powerful spokespeople the university  
could have,'' Michigan State spokeswoman Kristan Tetens says. 
``They bring a real-life perspective. We can talk about it, but 
they know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, students who get the birthday cards write back.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am writing you to just let you know that you are affecting  
others and are helping them to make the right decisions,'' a 
Michigan State senior wrote in an e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McCue doesn't fault Bradley's friends, pointing out that  
they had appointed a designated driver and propped him up when they 
put him to bed so he wouldn't choke if he vomited. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took us a long time to come to grips with the fact that if  
he had come home that night, we would have done the same thing his 
friends did,'' she says. ``They thought that when you passed out, 
you were just sleeping it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she hopes Bradley's death and her family's efforts can save  
others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was on the back burner and this brought it forward,'' she  
says. ``Drunk driving 20 years ago didn't have the attention it 
does now. If it takes 20 years to make this a socially acceptable 
issue, then it will take that long.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Said Assessing Abortion Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A 14-year-old foster girl who says she was raped  
is reportedly expected to travel to Kansas for a late-term abortion 
unless Arizona officials succeed in winning a court ruling to stop 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	There has bee no direct word from the girl herself because of  
foster care confidentiality requirements and a court seal on the 
case. She's said to be about 24 weeks into the pregnancy now, past 
the stage at which abortions are performed in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republic quoted sources Saturday as saying Gov. Jane  
Hull had changed direction on Thursday about an appeal and had 
decided to have the girl's competency re-evaluated. But a judge on 
Friday reaffirmed his decision to allow the abortion, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's office was working feverishly late Friday on a  
second appeal, the Republic said. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for 
the governor refused to discuss whether a second appeal would be 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, a ward of the state since she was 5 and now a ward of  
Maricopa County Superior Court, told the state she was raped. She 
requested an abortion 14 weeks into the pregnancy but then ran 
away, showing up again only recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Judge William Sargeant authorized the abortion and  
having the girl taken elsewhere for it.

<HEADLINE> Owners Warn Umps on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball owners have told umpires they will be  
fired if they strike next week. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig and NL president Len Coleman sent the  
warning in an Aug. 25 memo that many umpires received before they 
worked Friday night's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the umpires backing union head Richie Phillips have  
talked about striking over baseball's refusal to allow 22 umpires 
to withdraw their resignations, which are effective Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been several press reports suggesting that the  
Major League Umpires Association and certain major league umpires 
may engage in a strike on or before Sept. 2,'' said the memo, a 
copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, the collective bargaining agreement between the  
leagues and the Umpire's Association contains a very broad 
no-strike pledge. ... While we are confident that most, if not all, 
major league umpires intend to honor this no-strike commitment, we 
feel it is important that all major league umpires understand our 
position with respect to conduct in violation of that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any major league umpire who participates in a strike or any  
other conduct in violation of the no-strike commitment will have 
his employment terminated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips did not immediately return a telephone call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because they sent us a letter doesn't necessarily mean  
that what's in the letter is gospel,'' said union president Jerry 
Crawford, an NL umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford said that if some umpires do strike, they would have a  
harsh opinion of colleagues who continued to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way you view people is if you go on strike and  
somebody crosses the line, then they're considered a scab. 
Absolutely,'' Crawford said. ``I'm not saying we're going on 
strike. I'm not making that commitment because we've discussed a 
lot of things. All I'm saying is a scab is a person who crosses a 
picket line when he is out on strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some other umps didn't think the memo was significant.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just more reading material,'' said NL umpire Ed Montague,  
a Phillips supporter who is keeping his job. ``We're not real happy 
with what's been going on. We've got a lot of bitter guys. Other 
than that, we're dealing with people that I don't think care about 
the state of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't care about our jobs, obviously. They want to bring  
in a bunch of inexperienced people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL umpire Joe Brinkman, one of the leaders of the anti-Phillips  
faction among umpires, said he didn't take the memo as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a reminder, I would say, of what our contract  
says,'' said Brinkman, among the umpires keeping his job. ``The 
thing is, we knew a strike is illegal per our work contract, or any 
concerted work stoppage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most umpires submitted their resignations last month, saying at  
the time they wanted to force an early start of bargaining on a new 
labor deal to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. The strategy 
backfired when 27 umpires failed to resign or quickly withdrew 
their resignations. The leagues then accepted the resignations of 
22 umps and hired 25 replacements from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to keep the 22 umps working, the union filed unfair  
labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners expect the NLRB Board to defer action on the charges and  
say the matter is subject to the clause in the labor contract 
requiring arbitration for disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	If that happens, Crawford said the union may file suit in  
federal court in Philadelphia in an effort to obtain an injunction 
that would prevent baseball from letting go of the 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every moment you're out there, you're thinking about this,''  
Montague said. ``They put us in this position, and I think our 
tempers have been a little short on the field, with players and 
managers and such. It's tough on the family life at home. I will 
never forget this.''

<HEADLINE> Suspected Bird Murderer at Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's parks commissioner has urged New  
Yorkers to be on the lookout for a ``depraved'' suspect who has 
been killing pigeons, sparrows and ducks by lacing bird food or 
bread crumbs with a toxic chemical. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said that more than 80 birds have died at the hands of  
the culprit in recent weeks -- most of them in Central Park. State 
wildlife experts confirmed the birds ingested Carbofuran, a 
pesticide that has no legitimate use in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks Commissioner Henry Stern called the poisonings an outrage  
and ``surely the work of a depraved mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, Carbofuran was blamed for the deaths of about 60  
birds in the city. No one was caught.

<HEADLINE> Miami, Ohio To Meet in Kickoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Miami guard Richard Mercier wore a  
black T-shirt to an interview session Friday. Printed in bold white 
letters on the front was, ``NCO.'' Under that it said, ``New 'Canes 
Order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are high in Sunday's Kickoff Classic, with  
12th-ranked Miami out to prove it has indeed reestablished its old 
winning ``order'' after a bout with NCAA probation and No. 9 Ohio 
State seeking to remain one of the country's elite programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was 5-6 in 1997, the school's first losing record since  
Howard Schnellenberger's first season in 1979. The Hurricanes were 
unranked and a humdrum 7-3 heading into December last year -- and 
coming off a humiliating 66-13 rout at the hands of Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	But then they ended third-ranked UCLA's unbeaten season and  
hopes for a national title with a 49-45 upset, then followed that 
with a convincing 46-23 win over North Carolina State in a bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Were those just the highlights of an otherwise ordinary season?  
Or are the 'Canes, the dominant college team of the 1980s and early 
'90s, really back? 
</P>
<P>
	``The expectation in previous years was you didn't rebuild, you  
just reloaded,'' said coach Butch Davis, five years into salvaging 
the troubled program he was left by Dennis Erickson. ``The success 
of 12 consecutive Jan. 1 bowl games and four national championships 
really made everybody feel like it was just a matter of showing up 
and playing the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fans got their eyes opened in '97 when we had the  
first losing season in 20 years. They really started to appreciate 
what these sanctions and probation were all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scholarships were down, interest was down and so were the  
players' attitudes. Now the Hurricanes are eager to take the next 
step, up to respectability and more national recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``A win for us Sunday would mean opening eyes, I guess -- opening  
the eyes of the public,'' running back James Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State coach John Cooper recognizes that Miami feels it has  
a point to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``You knew that Miami wasn't going to be down very long,''  
Cooper said. ``There's no question because of the high school 
talent and the kind of program they have down there and the 
coaching staff they had. It was a matter of time until they got 
back to where they should be in college football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, on the other hand, has finished No. 2 in the country  
two of the last three years. It has churned out NFL products -- four 
in the first round this past year -- and is flush with talent, 
albeit young and inexperienced talent, this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third time Cooper has taken his team to a  
``preseason bowl'' game, twice to the Kickoff and once the Pigskin 
Classic. He's not shooting for respect or rankings necessarily, but 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like these early ballgames myself,'' Cooper said. ``I like  
the extra practice time. It may not show up in the first ballgame 
but I think it will definitely help us by the time we get into the 
conference season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper also said he took the game because of the national  
exposure, which widens Ohio State's already wide recruiting base, 
and because each team gets at least $650,000 for playing -- no small 
consideration at Ohio State when you're providing most of the 
revenue for 35 varsity sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes feel they risk a lot. A win helps them maintain the  
respect they already have, but a loss would all but eliminate them 
from the race for the prize they've chased since 1968 -- a national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1986, they had a veteran team led by a first-year  
quarterback and lost 16-10 to Alabama in the Kickoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would hurt but I don't think it would be devastating,''  
Cooper said. ``We're not planning to lose, but if we would happen 
to lose, we're not going to fold our tent and act like the season's 
over. I can assure you that's not going to happen. But we're not 
planning on losing.''

<HEADLINE> 1939 Boys of Summer Reunite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- The only home they aim to reach these  
days is their own and they are more likely to catch a cold than a 
fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, 18 of the 30 boys who played in Little League's  
first season in 1939, had vivid and fond memories of their days on 
the baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a real camaraderie,'' Peter Smith recalled Friday as  
the men gathered for a reunion on the eve of the Little League 
World Series championship game. ``We couldn't wait for our games. 
</P>
<P>
	Little League was founded in this town with three teams and 30  
players. The Little League World Series for 11- and 12-year-olds 
started in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a retired businessman from Dayton, Ohio, played for a  
team in nearby Lycoming. Before Little League his games were played 
on sandlots without the benefit of uniforms and standard fields. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Charles, recalled helping league founder Carl Stoz  
measure the basepaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember running the bases to see they were right,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Smith, who lives in York, also thinks he and his  
teammates were more driven than their modern counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had more desire to win. We only had 10 players so it was  
the only the best who played,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said it was ``very competitive,'' even more so than today.  
</P>
<P>
	Though for many of the players Little League was the pinnacle of  
their ball playing, Al Yearick went on. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Boston Braves and spent five years in the  
minor leagues. But he recalls his Little League experience as a 
turning point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my first opportunity to play with official bats and  
uniforms as opposed to the stuff we played with on the sandlots,'' 
he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks today's players have it easier.  
</P>
<P>
	``The equipment is so much better than what we had. The  
biological makeup of the kids is different. They are bigger and 
stronger,'' Yearick said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Frazier, a former outfielder who organized the reunion  
with Yearick, said money has changed baseball for the worse, even 
among kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to play every day for fun and that was all. Now they  
want something more,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Potts Tired of 'Designing Women' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Enjoying the critical success of her latest TV  
show ``Any Day Now,'' Annie Potts is tired of talking about her one 
network ratings hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people ask me about `Designing Women' now,'' she says in  
the Sept. 3 issue of Entertainment Weekly. ``I feel how I think 
James Taylor must feel when he has to play `Fire and Rain' again. 
To tell you the truth, I've moved on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Potts is much more eager to promote ``Any Day Now,'' the show on  
cable's Lifetime channel that reunites two friends, one black and 
one white, after a childhood growing up in the segregationist South 
of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	She feels blessed to have gotten the job after two failed series  
that followed ``Designing Women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As you get older, there aren't as many worthy suitors,'' said  
Potts, 46. 
</P>
<P>
	She costars with Lorraine Toussaint in the dramatic series  
exploring the depths of childhood friendship and lingering racism 
in America.

<HEADLINE> FSU's Warrick Came Back for Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick could have ended up as  
the answer to a trivia question. 
</P>
<P>
	Which Florida State receiver was once roommates with Randy Moss?  
</P>
<P>
	Fate intervened, however, and it seems as if both players have  
benefited. 
</P>
<P>
	After rooming with Warrick as a redshirt freshman, Moss moved to  
Marshall, eventually overcoming his troubles to become an NFL star. 
That left the receiving stage at Florida State wide open for 
Warrick, who returns to the Seminoles this year as one of the top 
players in college football. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have remained friends. They talk regularly on the  
telephone. The conversations will become more interesting when the 
season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've told him, 'I'm going to call you every Saturday night and  
let you know what I did,''' Warrick says. ``I'm going to tell him, 
'I want you to do better than that on Sunday.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick could have joined Moss in the NFL this season. Many  
people expected the Florida State senior to forgo his final year 
for a sure spot in the draft's first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Much like Peyton Manning did two seasons ago, Warrick decided to  
stay in school. He wanted another chance at the national title that 
eluded the Seminoles by one victory last season. Perhaps the 
prospect of winning the Heisman Trophy was a factor, too. 
</P>
<P>
	There could have been other reasons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really think Peter likes Tallahassee, Florida, and he likes  
it at FSU,'' coach Bobby Bowden says. ``I don't think it's like he 
can't wait to get to New York or Philadelphia. Maybe that doesn't 
excite him right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As much as the decision had to do with football, it had to do  
with becoming an adult. Raised by his mother and aunt, Warrick 
never had much of a father figure growing up. Enter Bowden and the 
sage advice he dispenses in his down-home, folksy way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I think, `Gosh, I wonder how it would be if my daddy  
was there,''' Warrick says. ``Coach Bobby is like a father away 
from home. I grew up without my father. I can talk to Bobby in any 
way. He'll tell me, 'I think you need to do this, you need to do 
that.' I try to listen and follow what he tells me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden ranks Warrick up there with the most talented players  
he's ever coached, a list that includes Derrick Brooks, Warrick 
Dunn and Andre Wadsworth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a dangerous football player,'' Bowden says. ``I think you  
better get two or three guys on him or you're not going to get him. 
He's just got a God-given talent to evade people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there are plenty of football-related goals for Warrick to  
chase. He's close to many Florida State and Atlantic Coast 
Conference records. 
</P>
<P>
	He has already scored 25 touchdowns in college. Last year, he  
caught 61 passes for 1,232 yards and 11 touchdowns, and returned 15 
punts for 208 yards. He also rushed for 85 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	He needs 77 catches for 1,016 yards and six touchdowns to set  
career records in all of those categories at Florida State, and he 
is 796 yards shy of the ACC receiving yardage record held by North 
Carolina State's Torry Holt. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding the end zone has always seemed easy for Warrick, a  
muscular 6-foot, 200-pound speedster known his whole life as P-Dub, 
for the W in his last name. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I touched the ball, the first time being out  
there, I ran the kickoff all the way back,'' says Warrick, 
recalling his football debut as a 10-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	He led Southeast High in Bradenton to consecutive state titles,  
accounting for 39 touchdowns in those two years. Although he played 
quarterback his senior year there was never a question about where 
he'd line up at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing the Seminoles was easy for Warrick, whose high school  
team had the same nickname. His favorite player was former Florida 
State great Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick met Sanders this summer, but isn't making any bold  
statements about going head-to-head with the perennial All-Pro 
cornerback one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't ready for that yet,'' Warrick said, laughing. ``I came  
back one more year so I could get ready for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He might also be getting ready for the Heisman. Warrick and  
Wisconsin's Ron Dayne enter the season as the top candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something that will either come or it won't,'' Bowden  
says. ``I don't think that's why he stayed. But our team will be on 
TV every Saturday. Plenty of people will see him. If he's got it, 
they'll see it and they'll vote for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a TV appearance of another nature that may have formed  
the most opinions of Warrick to this point, none of them 
flattering. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's 23-16 loss to Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl, the  
receiver had just one catch for 7 yards. In the second half, TV 
cameras caught him on the sideline, animated and obviously 
frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know on TV they were trying to make it seem like I was mad  
because I wasn't getting the ball,'' he says. ``It probably looked 
like that, but it wasn't like that at all. I was mad because I felt 
we weren't playing together as a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have plenty of time to get it right this year. His  
decision to stay in college one more year was one his former 
roommate, Moss, completely agreed with. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was telling me it's a business up there, like a 9-to-5  
job,'' Warrick said. ``He's glad I stayed. Now he's saying, 'first 
pick, first round, Peter Warrick.' He's going to go crazy.''

<HEADLINE> Hissou Wins 5000 Gold at Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Salah Hissou won Morocco's second distance  
gold medal at the World Championships today, beating Kenyan 
Benjamin Limo to take the 5,000 meters in a championship record 
time. Belgium's Mohammed Mourhit was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Hissou had set the pace for most of the race, taking that  
position from American Bob Kennedy, who fell back. Hissou outkicked 
all opposition in the final lap to finish in 12 minutes 58.13 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Limo clocked a 12:58.72 and the Moroccan-born Mourhit had  
12:58.80 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Daniel Komen of Kenya finished fifth.  
</P>
<P>
	The race missed its biggest star -- Haile Gebrselassie. The  
Ethiopian had won the 10,000-meter world title for the fourth time 
in a row early in the week but is troubled by blisters and sore 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj earlier won the 1,500 meters  
</P>
<P>
	Bob Kennedy of the United States immediately set the early pace,  
but was soon overtaken by Hissou, who tried to make a breakthrough 
halfway through the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Komen tried to assert his authority with 1,600 metrs to go but  
Hissou had no problem following in his wake and took the lead again 
going into the final kilometer, with Komen faltering.

<HEADLINE> Relief Agencies Assess Turkey Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- A World Bank team toured flattened areas  
of western Turkey on Saturday, assessing how much foreign aid is 
needed to help rebuild the tens of thousands of homes and lives 
ruined in last week's powerful quake. 
</P>
<P>
	With days of heavy rains adding to the misery of quake survivors  
camped out in muddy, rat-infested fields, the task of replacing 
soggy, makeshift tents with solid housing was becoming more urgent. 
Damage to houses and infrastructure from the Aug. 17 quake has been 
estimated at $10 billion, and the government says as many as 
600,000 have been left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Ajay Chhibber, the World Bank's Turkey director, said teams  
would be established in the next few days to develop reconstruction 
plans, including energy, water and transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
	But finding dry housing was the immediate order of business.  
</P>
<P>
	In Golcuk, U.S. Marines based on Navy ships in the Sea of  
Marmara began setting up 2,300 tents, all watertight and with 
flooring. The tents will house both people and supplies that had 
been left out for days in the pouring rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Turkey's leading contractors, meeting with government  
officials in Ankara on Saturday, said they could build 60,000 
prefabricated homes in three months, the Anatolia news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A 35-member team from Japan promised 1,000 prefabricated homes  
would be sent to Adapazari, where entire districts were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said his government has put off  
introducing new taxes to pay for reconstruction until October, 
partly to avoid discouraging Turks and others who want to donate 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to see what these aid campaigns from our people and  
from more than 60 countries will produce,'' he told reporters in 
Ankara, implying that new taxes may not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Government plans to boost a variety of taxes had prompted  
nationwide protests. Economists and business leaders warned the 
taxes could further increase already high inflation and induce a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The official death toll from the quake rose to 13,893 Saturday.  
Thousands of people were still missing, and most of them were 
believed buried under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those killed were trapped under the ruins of apartment  
blocks built with substandard materials by contractors who 
allegedly bribed officials to avoid inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has promised to crack down on unscrupulous  
contractors. Yalova prosecutor Metin Fadillioglu said 15 were under 
investigation in his province, where 2,400 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bolu, where 262 people died, police questioned five  
contractors, Milliyet newspaper reported Saturday. Three 
contractors were detained last week on negligence charges in 
Eskisehir. 
</P>
<P>
	Many others have reportedly fled Turkey since the quake.  
</P>
<P>
	Although those convicted of negligence resulting in death could  
receive up to 10 years in prison, Fadillioglu told Anatolia he 
expected few would receive much jail time because of allowances for 
first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Parliament gave the government more authority to deal  
with the quake's aftermath. The new authority includes powers to 
issue construction tenders and designate new residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
	It also ordered the government to ensure that any new buildings  
were earthquake-proof.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan's Assets Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy may be booming, but Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan apparently suffered a downturn in 
his own fortunes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A financial disclosure form made available Friday showed the  
value of Greenspan's assets in 1998 ranged from approximately $2.5 
million to $6.4 million, less than the range of about $3.4 million 
to $7.3 million he reported for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures are not precise because the value of each asset is  
reported using a wide range, not a specific amount. 
</P>
<P>
	In his role as the nation's chief financial policy-maker,  
Greenspan once decried ``irrational exuberance'' in financial 
markets. He opted to put all of investments into safe, short-term 
Treasury bills and none into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who was paid $136,700 last year, stayed out of the  
stock market to avoid any conflict of interest, Fed officials say. 
His words and actions and those of colleagues at the central bank 
can cause the market to soar or plummet. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his holdings, Greenspan listed one Treasury bill valued at  
more than $1 million and three Treasury bills worth between 
$500,001 and $1 million, according to the financial disclosure 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The form also showed that Greenspan sold a Norfolk Southern  
railroad bond last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has filed financial disclosure forms every year since  
he was sworn in as Federal Reserve chairman in August 1987. But 
until last year, they said simply that most of his assets were in a 
blind trust worth more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He liquidated the trust after his 1997 marriage to NBC News  
correspondent Andrea Mitchell so the couple could make joint 
financial plans, Fed officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Greenspan's holdings, his wife's portfolio is weighted  
heavily toward stocks, including holdings in Abbott Laboratories, 
H.J. Heinz Co., American Greetings Corp. and Anheuser Busch Cos. 
Inc.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Issues Dogs GOP Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abortion, the chronic issue in campaigns for  
the Republican presidential nomination, is back on the agenda, one 
of the candidates having lapsed into candor on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain is the political target of anti-abortion  
activists after saying that: 
</P>
<P>
	--To reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion  
now would force thousands of young women to have illegal and 
dangerous operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--He'd choose a vice presidential nominee and nominees to the  
Supreme Court based on their overall qualifications, and would not 
require that they oppose abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Right to Life Committee said McCain flip-flopped,  
having answered yes on a 1998 questionnaire that asked whether he 
supported complete reversal of the abortion decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He replied that he still does, unequivocally, although he's said  
it shouldn't happen until ``we stop this dangerous operation'' 
through counseling, adoption and other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we ought to work to eliminate abortion as a part of  
American life,'' he said on CNN, an improbable, almost certainly 
impossible goal. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also said he was proud of his 17-year record of voting  
for anti-abortion positions in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote the anti-abortion lobby that he hoped he'd clarified  
any ambiguity on his position. But his successive statements made 
it cloudier. For candidates other than the conservative absolutists 
on abortion, a little ambiguity can be useful. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, most Americans don't see the issue in absolute terms  
-- although polls over the years since the court ruling show about 
six people in 10 would oppose an outright ban on legal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy  
Research also says majorities also favor restrictions such as a 
24-hour waiting period, counseling on alternatives, parental 
consent and other limits, which are vehemently opposed by the 
abortion rights lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	That study by public opinion analysts Karlyn Bowman and Everett  
Carll Ladd said surveys after the 1992 and 1996 elections show 
abortion was not a pivotal issue for most voters. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is amplified in the narrower arena of Republican  
primaries and conventions, where conservative abortion foes make up 
a greater share of the vote. That's why the call for a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortion is written into Republican 
campaign platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion opponents have enacted, and just renewed, an assortment  
of bars to federal spending for abortions, but by narrow margins, 
far short of the two-thirds it would take to approve a 
constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	So it's a debating point, not a realistic prospect. That does  
not silence the critics of candidates who say they support an 
amendment but that it can't be done because most Americans don't 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush, the leader for the 2000 GOP nomination,  
takes that position, which irks the purists. So does his statement 
that he'd apply no litmus tests in choosing Supreme Court nominees, 
meaning that he wouldn't limit the field to abortion opponents, as 
the more conservative candidates pledge to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also drew conservative criticism when he was quoted in a  
Talk Magazine article as saying he didn't know whether the number 
of abortions in Texas had gone up or down while he's been governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably down,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Not because of  
anything we've done, though. We haven't passed any laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole said she'd support a constitutional amendment if  
one were possible. ``But of course it's not,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes said much the same thing as a candidate in 1996.  
He's hardened his line in this campaign, seeking to become the 
conservative alternative to Bush. ``Any judge I appoint for life 
will be pro-life,'' he said in a radio ad. ``Some of the 
politicians who are running for president won't tell you what kind 
of judges they would appoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With variations, all those lines have been heard before. And  
will be again, in the campaign and when 2000 Republican platform 
writers act, and almost certainly renew, the plank supporting a 
constitutional amendment against abortion. 
</P>

	When British archaeologist Howard Carter unearthed King Tut's  
tomb in 1922, he revealed history's most dazzling cache of 
artifacts using tools found in any gardener's potting shed -- 
trowels, a fine screen to sift tons of Sahara sand, and 
wheelbarrows to cart off golden loot. 
</P>
<P>
	As the millennium turns, researchers in Egypt's Valley of the  
Kings and thousands of other archaeological sites worldwide still 
lay bare the bones of lost civilizations using the most humble of 
household utensils. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's just the beginning of the job.  
</P>
<P>
	The Victorian image of a solitary scientist dressed in a linen  
suit and pursuing lost worlds with a whisk broom has been zapped 
into oblivion by lasers and particle accelerators. The search for 
ancient cultures now is an expensive, high-tech enterprise that 
borrows from space exploration, medical research and nuclear 
physics.

still-brimming wine jugs in Mediterranean galleys and empty leather 
shoes amid the Titanic wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men and women in white coats, toiling away in their  
laboratories, have become as important as rugged fieldworkers 
slogging away under the hot sun,'' said Christopher Scarre of 
Cambridge University in England, who has prepared a sweeping 
analysis of ``high-tech digging'' for Archaeology magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day we may be able to excavate a site without ever setting  
a spade to earth,'' Scarre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the mysteries that have been with us for generations,  
such as Easter Island, still elude definitive solutions. Others can 
easily be demystified with a simple dose of common sense, as one 
researcher is trying to do at Stonehenge. 
</P>
<P>
	But elsewhere, high-tech methods are revealing surprises, even  
at the most famous and well-documented sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt's pyramids director, Zahi Hawass, believes that decades of  
conventional digging has uncovered only 30 percent of his nation's 
ancient monuments. Now the work Carter made famous is being 
accelerated by remote sensing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Nile Delta, French marine archaeologist Franck Goddio is  
using the global satellite navigation system to map Cleopatra's 
palace submerged beneath Alexandria's murky port. Nearly 2,000 
years after her suicide by snakebite, authorities hope to reopen 
the site as an underwater park. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby waters, Goddio also has found Napoleon's flagship and  
other vessels destroyed in 1798 by British Adm. Horatio Nelson. 
(Descendants of Napoleon and Nelson flew in to witness the 
discovery in June.) 
</P>
<P>
	At the Giza Plateau, archaeologists are using remote sensing and  
animation graphics to map the vast public works system that 
supported the Pyramids' construction by 20,000 laborers more than 
4,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyramid workers typically died in their 30s, two decades earlier  
than royalty. Many suffered from spinal trauma, broken bones and 
amputations. Some had syphilis. How do we know? Genetic analysis 
and CT scans. 
</P>
<P>
	In Peru, U.S. pathologists using CT scans determined that the  
Ice Maiden, a mummy of an Inca girl, died of a blow to the head as 
a human sacrifice 500 years ago rather than freezing to death as 
was initially surmised. 
</P>
<P>
	At Angkor in Cambodia, NASA researchers using a synthetic  
aperture radar are mapping 1,000 temples obscured by the dense 
forest canopy, as well as a network of now-dry canals and 
reservoirs. In 1100 A.D., the images suggest, Angkor may have been 
the world's largest city with one million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The radar is mounted on a DC-8. As the jet flies over the  
tropical jungle, the different pings bouncing off stone, water, 
plants and soil create a three-dimensional map. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway around the world in the Valley of Mexico, different  
technologies are peeling back the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this year, researchers expect to pierce the core of the  
massive Pyramid of the Moon, perhaps revealing the contents of a 
royal tomb that has lain undisturbed since it was sealed 2,000 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	This part of the job remains slow and dirty. Blame it on the  
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt's pyramids are constructed like a giant anthill, with  
strong walls and grand galleries leading to a Pharaoh's 
sarcophagus. 
</P>
<P>
	But at Teotihuacan, 30 miles north of Mexico City, first century  
A.D. pyramids are built more like a huge Tootsie Pop with layers of 
unstable rubble covering a deeply buried tomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrowing into the Moon temple, archaeologists can hear the  
footsteps of tourists ascending the same impossibly steep stairs 
once climbed by astronomer-priests and their unlucky sacrificial 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might find Tutankhamen of the West,'' said forensic  
anthropologist Michael Spence of the University of Western Ontario, 
referring to the lavish burial of the Egyptian boy popularly known 
as King Tut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Or, we might find nothing.''  
</P>
<P>
	At the far end of Teotihuacan's creepy Avenue of the Dead,  
researchers have reassembled the remains of 200 people sacrificed 
during the city's zenith in 200 A.D. at the Temple of the Feathered 
Serpent, or Quetzalcoatl. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence and others are applying crime lab methods to preserved  
biological evidence -- DNA, bone isotopes and skeletal traits -- to 
reconstruct the story behind this ancient mass grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Many victims have bound hands. But none show broken ribs that  
might confirm historical accounts of still-beating hearts being 
ripped from chests in homage to the gods. ``We think they were 
buried alive,'' Spence said. 
</P>
<P>
	Artifacts suggest the victims were related soldiers. Spence and  
colleagues are trying to trace their origins by comparing oxygen 
isotopes in their bones. Groundwater in different locations has 
varied chemical signatures, and bones absorb the oxygen isotopes. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the victims' bone isotopes are not found in groundwater  
around Teotihuacan. Spence believes they were the human trophies of 
a far-flung military campaign, or perhaps a political housecleaning 
of the empire. 
</P>
<P>
	``A clan would not volunteer to lose 30 of its young men,''  
Spence said. 
</P>
<P>
	One doomed young man tried to kick his way to freedom.  
Discovering his 1,800-year-old agony was unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes at night, when you think about what you've you done  
and seen, it gets kind of spooky,'' Spence said. ``You hear the 
echoes of some long-past grief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two thousand miles north near St. Louis, Mo., scientists are  
using geophysical instruments to electronically peer deep inside a 
different type of pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
	Monk's Mound is perhaps the most mysterious ancient structure in  
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthen terrace rises 100 feet over the remnants of the  
aboriginal city of Cahokia, now a 2,200-acre protected site at 
Collinsville, Ill. The city of 15,000 flourished around 1300 A.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have drilled core samples and used remote sensing  
instruments to investigate a stone tomb or ritual platform deep 
inside the mound. Stone construction is unheard of at Cahokia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a large structure and it's very special,'' said project  
director William Woods of Southern Illinois University at 
Edwardsville. ``It looks as if there was at least one mound here 
before Monk's Mound was built.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Above the stone layer, researchers recorded a pair of magnetic  
anomalies 25 meters apart. Each anomaly is about 2 meters wide and 
up to 6 meters deep. More tests are being conducted this summer to 
determine whether they are walls. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, stone is the only material at Easter Island.  
</P>
<P>
	The 63-square mile black lava outcrop in the Pacific Ocean, also  
called Rapa Nui, is the planet's most remote year-round settlement, 
and it's about 1,000 years past its prime. 
</P>
<P>
	All that remains of its prehistoric culture are 900 monstrous  
statues -- busts of basalt weighing up to 60 tons, gazing blankly 
out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Western archaeologists have crisscrossed the island  
searching for clues to what happened on Rapa Nui. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget the space aliens blather of the 1960s. Analysis of  
skeletons, tools, fishing debris and the microscopic pollen of 
hardwood forests suggest a settlement that thrived for centuries, 
then ran out of food, turned to cannibalism and toppled the statues 
in defiance and panic. 
</P>
<P>
	But who built them, why and to what end? The mystery endures.  
</P>
<P>
	High-tech methods may be the most necessary at underwater sites,  
where slate gray seas offer no hint as to what they might be hiding 
miles below. Explorer Robert Ballard employs an ever-expanding 
array of robots, cameras and mini-subs to find celebrated 
deep-water wrecks, among them the Titanic and Bismarck. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Ballard located two 2,500-year-old Phoenician cargo  
galleys, upright and in pristine condition, 30 miles off the coast 
of Israel and about 1,500 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Among their contents: hundreds of wine-filled ceramic jugs. On  
deck, an incense stand was ready to burn an offering to the gods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human history lost on the high seas is waiting to be  
discovered,'' Ballard told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But not every ruin needs robots or satellites.  
</P>
<P>
	Consider Stonehenge, the ring of stone pillars that has brooded  
over Salisbury Plain in England for 5,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Aubrey Burl, a British authority on stone circles, recently  
abandoned a lifelong index card system in favor of personal 
computer. In minutes, he was able to compare 1,300 sites throughout 
the British Isles and northern France. 
</P>
<P>
	Burl's new book, ``Great Stone Circles,'' has bad news for the  
cloaked druids, naked nature-lovers and day-tripping tourists who 
flock to the megalith. 
</P>
<P>
	Brawny, sky-worshiping ancestors of modern Britons, without the  
help of writing or the wheel, are widely thought to have hauled its 
massive stones 200 miles in an epic trek from Wales. They erected 
them to precisely intersect with the seasonal journeys of the sun 
and moon. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``lovely story,'' Burl sniffs. But look again.  
</P>
<P>
	Stonehenge is not really a circle at all. And, almost certainly  
its blocks are leftovers from the Ice Age that Neolithic engineers 
prised from nearby fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Impressive, yes. Heroic? Hardly, says Burl.  
</P>
<P>
	He argues that common sense is enough to debunk the Wales  
theory. Moreover, Stonehenge's shape and carvings are similar to 
those found in Brittany, the western province of modern-day France. 
</P>
<P>
	Stonehenge is French? Sacre Bleu!  
</P>
<P>
	``I won't say Stonehenge is a mongrel, but it certainly is a  
hybrid,'' Burl said. ``The entire design is foreign. It is a 
paradox of construction and nationality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, still a bit of a mystery.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed, 2 Hurt on Roller Coaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Two people were killed and two others  
injured Saturday night after an accident on a roller coaster at an 
amusement park on the beachfront Boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the 10 p.m. accident at Gillian's Wonderland Pier  
was caused by a mechanical malfunction. Witnesses said one car 
crashed into the rear of another on the Wild Wonder ride at the 
park in this resort town about 10 miles south of Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	A child and an adult were killed, said Heidi King, nursing  
supervisor at Shore Memorial Medical Center. Another child and 
adult were treated and released, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims' ages and identities were not immediately available.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert Lee, 11, who lives a few hundred feet from the pier, said  
he heard a crash and thought it was a car or truck coming to a 
sudden stop on the street. He said a police officer told him that 
one roller coaster car got stuck on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car behind it came in and hit it from the rear and knocked  
the people in the first car out of the car,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	E.J. Miranda, a spokesman for the state Department of Community  
Affairs, said inspectors would be at Wonderland Pier on Sunday to 
check the roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ride will remain shut down while that investigation takes  
place and won't reopen until we're satisfied that we know what 
happened, why it happened and that it won't happen again,'' Miranda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen McAlary, a spokeswoman for Wonderland Pier, refused to  
comment and requested that a reporter leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wild Wonder is a two-story roller coaster with cars designed  
to look like animals.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gun Controls Signed Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Outside the medical center where victims of a  
gunman's rampage at a Jewish community center were treated earlier 
this month, Gov. Gray Davis signed into law three bills tightening 
the state's control over guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The laws impose stricter manufacturing standards on cheap  
handguns, require the sale of trigger locks and increase 
regulations at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	With other new laws expanding the state's assault weapons ban  
and limiting residents to purchasing one gun a month, California 
now has the nation's toughest package of gun control laws, Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in the Second Amendment. But we have been able to  
balance the rights of the Second Amendment in a responsible way to 
protect public safety,'' Davis said Friday outside Providence Holy 
Cross Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including the National Rifle Association, said the laws  
will increase illegal gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're high on symbolism and low on substance,'' said Steve  
Helsley, state liaison for the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	California Democrats have pushed for stricter controls for four  
years, but their efforts gained momentum after a 1997 North 
Hollywood shootout between bank robbers and police, the Columbine 
High School tragedy in Littleton, Colo. in April and this month's 
shooting at a Los Angeles Jewish community center. 
</P>
<P>
	The new laws ban the manufacture and sale of poorly made  
handguns and impose stricter manufacturing standards on cheap guns 
commonly referred to as Saturday night specials. 
</P>
<P>
	They also require exhibitors at gun shows to provide more  
information about who will handle the sale of guns, and requires 
minors to be accompanied by a parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trigger locks must be purchased with each gun, though the lock  
does not have to be put on the weapon. Davis said the locks will 
reduce the number of accidental gun deaths, particularly among 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	All three laws go into effect on Jan. 1.

<HEADLINE> Union Recommends New Boeing Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- After days of pessimistic talk that a strike was  
in the offing, the Machinists union today recommended that 44,000 
Boeing Co. workers accept a new contract with the aerospace 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal offered by the company early today is ``the best  
contract in the aerospace industry,'' said Bill Johnson, president 
of Machinists District Lodge 751. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace  
Workers union represents 44,000 Boeing workers, who will vote on 
the pact Wednesday -- hours before the current contract expires at 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Johnson said several aspects should please  
members, including retention of a traditional work week, meaning 
workers would continue to be paid overtime for working on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, the proposal contains no increases in  
member costs for medical benefits, a 25 percent increase in pension 
benefits, and language to help reduce the amount of work contracted 
to outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-month contract proposal includes wage increases of 4  
percent in each of the first two years and 3 percent for the 
remainder of the contract period, said union and company officials. 
The average machinist at Boeing earns $40,000 a year, not counting 
benefits or overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Many union members had mentioned job security as a top issue.  
Johnson said the new contract would provide 180 days' notice when 
work is to be contracted out, and would establish a 
union-management committee to try to keep such work in-house. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had announced the proposal early today.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've done our best, and I think we've delivered an agreement  
that our employees ... will at the end of the day find very, very 
attractive,'' Boeing lead negotiator Jerry Calhoun said at a 2 a.m. 
press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing withdrew a proposed move to a flexible seven-day work  
week that would have cut overtime pay for weekend work. 
</P>
<P>
	Also withdrawn was a proposal to have employees begin paying  
some of the cost of their health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks came as Boeing is undertaking a massive job cut  
program. From a high of 238,000 in June 1998, Boeing plans to 
reduce its work force to between 185,000 and 195,000 by the end of 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contract covers 31,000 workers in Washington state,  
1,400 in Portland, Ore., and 11,600 in Wichita, Kan. Boeing employs 
about 210,000 worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Source: Starr Appeals Leaks Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Usually antagonists, Whitewater prosecutor  
Kenneth Starr and the Clinton Justice Department have joined forces 
to appeal a judge's ruling on alleged grand jury leaks during the 
Monica Lewinsky investigation, legal sources say. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr asked an appeals panel in mid-July to intervene quickly  
and overturn the findings of U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway 
Johnson, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has had its own inquiries into leaks that  
may have come from Starr's office. But it has joined the 
independent counsel in his appeal, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether the independent counsel improperly leaked  
secret grand jury information to the news media. Federal rules 
prohibit prosecutors and court officials from disclosing evidence 
brought before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is not accused of leaking in this case,  
but the department may be worried that the court is setting an 
unreasonable precedent. Justice officials have explained in the 
past that if they got involved in the case it would be to ensure 
that their own prosecutors are not hamstrung in giving reporters 
information in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the impeachment investigation is long over, the judge's  
investigation into alleged leaks remains a concern for the 
embattled independent counsel's office. The prosecutors want to 
clear their names and avoid possible penalties, including fines or 
action against their law licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In his appeal, which remains under seal, Starr argues that  
Johnson was wrong in ruling that investigative matters not yet 
brought before a grand jury should be covered by secrecy rules that 
apply to the grand jury itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also challenged the standard Johnson used to determine  
there was preliminary evidence to believe that news articles in 
question likely came from Starr's office, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources include lawyers or employees inside the federal  
courthouse in Washington. They are not members of Starr's office or 
President Clinton's legal team, which filed the original complaint 
in spring 1998 accusing Starr's office of illegal leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr asked the appeals court to intervene on an expedited basis  
after Johnson ruled in the leaks case, the sources said. They 
weren't more specific except to say the ruling involved a Feb. 1 
complaint filed by presidential lawyer David Kendall that alleged 
additional grand jury leaks by Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The leak accusations were used by Clinton's defenders to  
undermine the credibility of Starr's investigation, especially 
during the sensitive months surrounding the president's impeachment 
and acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the leaks investigation has been played out in secret,  
although documents unsealed by courts give the public a taste of 
how vigorously both sides have waged battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall touched off the court fight during the early days of the  
Lewinsky investigation, when he accused Starr's office of illegally 
leaking damaging information about the president, including the 
testimony of Oval Office secretary Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall cited numerous newspaper and TV reports quoting  
anonymous sources as describing evidence that prosecutors were 
bringing before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who as the chief judge of the federal court in  
Washington oversees grand jury investigation, ruled last summer 
that there was preliminary evidence suggesting Starr's office made 
``serious and repetitive'' violations of grand jury secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge cited 24 news stories she said likely came from  
Starr's office. They included general accounts of Starr's ``next 
moves'' and specific reports that the prosecutor had rejected a 
proposed immunity deal for Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered a court official, called a special master, to  
investigate further. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also concluded that, at least in the court district  
covering Washington, it has been clear that ``government attorneys 
may not reveal documentary evidence that is likely to be presented 
to the grand jury'' -- even if it was not yet presented. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before his appeal, Starr has made clear he disagreed that  
information not yet presented is covered by secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely not grand jury information, if you are talking  
about what witnesses tell FBI agents or us before they testify,'' 
he said last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also has argued that White House and defense lawyers -- not  
the prosecutor's office -- were the prime suspects for the leaks. 
Kendall has countered that the White House had no interest in 
leaking information damaging to the president.

<HEADLINE> Rams' QB Trent Green Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Rams quarterback Trent Green tore a  
left knee ligament near the end of the first half of Saturday 
night's exhibition against the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who completed all 11 passes for 166 yards and a 52-yard  
touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce, suffered a torn medial collateral 
ligament and also sustained possible damage to the anterior 
cruciate ligament. An MRI was scheduled later Saturday night at 
Barnes Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Green was injured on a late hit by safety Rodney Harrison after  
completing his 11th pass, making him 28 of 32 for 406 yards in the 
preseason. He was carted off the field holding the knee with 1:31 
to go in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second dangerous hit of the night by Harrison, who  
took a personal-foul penalty for a hit on wide receiver Isaac Bruce 
in the first quarter. Harrison played at Western Illinois in 
Macomb, Ill., where the Rams hold training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, 29, signed a four-year, $16.5 million free-agent deal  
with the Rams after a breakthrough season with the Washington 
Redskins in his first year as a starter. He threw for 23 touchdowns 
and 3,441 yards in 14 starts, and led Washington to a 6-3 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams' backup quarterback is Kurt Warner, who has played in  
one game as a reserve in his career. The third-stringer is rookie 
Joe Germaine of Ohio State.

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Batters Northern Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- A strengthened Hurricane Dennis battered  
the northern Bahamas on Saturday, tearing up trees and utility 
poles, ripping down buildings under construction and threatening to 
grow even more powerful as it approaches the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters projected Dennis would become a Category 3 storm  
with winds up to 130 mph within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis' core is projected to stay away from shore as it passes  
Florida. But its outer winds could swipe the state on Sunday, and 
it could make landfall as late as Tuesday, most likely somewhere in 
the Carolinas, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our forecast shows it about 100 miles offshore'' when it  
passes Florida, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. ``That's significant because we think 
that 50 or 60 mph winds stick out about 100 miles. That suggests 
that they're going to get strong winds and they're really going to 
get some strong surf out of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From hundreds of miles away, Dennis kicked up 8-foot-high waves  
off Florida and North Carolina, delighting surfers but prompting 
officials to put state troopers and the National Guard on alert. 
Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were issued along 
hundreds of miles of the eastern seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, Dennis was centered 200 miles east-southeast of  
Cape Canaveral in Florida. It had sustained winds of 100 mph, up 
from 80 mph the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm broadened overnight, with hurricane winds extending 40  
miles from its center as it came out of a near-stall and resumed 
its west-northwest track at a crawl close to 6 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell said he was worried because three projections showed  
Dennis stalling again somewhere between Georgia and the Outer Banks 
with winds of 115 to 130 mph. The storm had hovered for hours 
overnight as it crept alongside the Abaco islands in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The destruction can be a lot worse just because it's hammering  
for a long period of time,'' Jarrell said. ``I think that would be 
the great fear from the stall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm had passed the Bahamas by Saturday afternoon. In Grand  
Abaco, a sliver no more than 10 miles wide with a population of 
several thousand, residents told tales of destruction and debris it 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Just back from a drive around Grand Abaco's Marsh Harbour, the  
Rev. Carlton Dorsette said about 70 percent of the walls were down 
on a commercial building under construction and his own house under 
construction was ``totally down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't much rain but lots of wind. I think we probably  
got a direct hit last night,'' he said. ``Lots of trees have 
fallen, power lines are down, a lot of phone lines are damaged, 
cable lines are damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of boats had gone under in the harbor, but the airport  
looked unscathed, Dorsette said. The Bahamas Air Sea Rescue 
Association said it had heard reports of several boats breaking 
their moorings and smashing onto rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Tate, a fisherman at Sweeting's Cay in the Abacos, said  
the storm damaged banana and other fruit trees, smashing some to 
the ground. It ripped the shingles off some roofs and tore down 
shacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to dump up to 10 inches of rain and create  
battering waves up to 8 feet above normal that could damage fragile 
coral reefs and strip beaches of sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Weather Service said projections for Dennis  
``become a bit more uncertain'' after Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane watch remained in effect for the east coast of  
Florida from Sebastian Inlet northward to Fernandina Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	People began preparing for the storm, stocking up on supplies  
and lumber. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was 
stocking up on water and other necessities at regional centers. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, but no decision 
has been made on whether to evacuate people from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, 150,000 coastal residents were put on alert,  
as were state troopers and emergency management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Florida Water Management District lowered water levels  
in canals to lessen the risk of flooding in heavy rains.

<HEADLINE>  Atler Wins 2 Titles in Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Two days after being edged for the  
national all-around title for the second straight year, Vanessa 
Atler showed why she is one of this nation's best hopes for a 
gymnastics medal in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Atler, 17, won gold in the vault and balance beam as the U.S.  
Gymnastics Championships closed Saturday night. Elise Ray won the 
floor exercise and Jamie Dantzscher and Jennie Thompson tied for 
first on the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt better tonight. I've been out of control all week,''  
Atler said. ``I've been nervous and out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atler had a winning score of 9.675 on the vault and 9.775 on the  
beam. Ray scored 9.775 on the floor exercise and Dantzscher and 
Thompson had 9.675s on the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Atler's victories came 48 hours after her fall on the uneven  
bars prevented her from overtaking Kristen Maloney for the national 
all-around title. Maloney competed in two events Saturday, with her 
best finish a second place in the beam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps it feel better, but it does not make up for that,''  
Atler said. ``That's still a big mistake I made, I can't make up 
for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atler, who won gold medals in vault and floor exercise in the  
1998 Goodwill Games, was the national champion in the floor 
exercise last year and national champion in the vault in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, John Roethlisberger had just completed a  
remarkable comeback to the U.S. gymnastics team when he realized 
performing on the floor will be only one of the roles he'll have to 
play on the national squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, 29, a four-time national champion in the early  
1990s, placed second in the all-around competition Friday night to 
make the national team less than a year after reconstructive 
surgery on his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to performing, he expects to act as mentor and  
emotional guide for Jason Gatson, one of the nation's top male 
gymnasts who tore a ligament in his right knee Friday night while 
leading the all-around competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, 18, whose knee buckled as he dismounted from the  
horizontal bar, is expected to have surgery in the next few weeks. 
He flew back to the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., on Saturday for further examination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about what my role would be in these four years  
after 1996. Maybe that's one of the things I need to do is to help 
Jason,'' Roethlisberger said. ``I know how he's feeling right now. 
There's not much of a worse feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blaine Wilson captured an unprecedented fourth straight men's  
national all-around title with a nearly flawless performance in 
Friday's finals after Gatson hurt himself on the night's opening 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's overall score of 115.300 made him the first man to win  
four national titles since Roethlisberger won in 1990, '92, '93 and 
'95. But he was not interested in celebrating -- instead, he was 
thinking of Gatson, his training partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably spend most of my time seeing how he's doing,''  
Wilson said. ``Jason obviously is a big link in our team. He will 
be missed, but he will be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger finished second with a score of 111.800. Brett  
McClure was third with 111.500. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, who finished second in 1996 and '98 and was third in the  
national championships in 1997, held a slim lead over Wilson at the 
start of the all-around finals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	His right knee buckled as he flew off the high bar, and he fell  
to the side of the mat. After getting iced on the competition 
floor, he was helped to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson was second in the national all-around competition in 1996  
and '98, losing both times to Wilson. He was third in 1997 behind 
Wilson and Roethlisberger. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury threatens to keep one of the United States' most  
promising male gymnasts out of the Sydney Olympics, though Gatson 
predicted he will return from the injury in time for the 2000 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I landed, something popped and I just fell to the  
ground, it hurt so bad. I knew something happened, because it was a 
loud pop. My knee just went out on me,'' Gatson said. ``This is 
going to make me stronger. I am going to get it fixed and I am 
going to come back and be on the Olympic team in Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, who competed with a leg brace in the  
championships and wore three huge ice packs on his legs during a 
post-competition news conference, said he's also confident Gatson 
will be fully healed before the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be back, no problem, I guarantee,'' Roethlisberger said.  
``It's going to be a tough year for him. But for sure he's going to 
be back up here next year.''

<HEADLINE> Funding Short for Preservation Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Urban development pushes against Luke  
Brubaker's Pennsylvania farm, making it a prime candidate for 
protection under a program that pays people to keep farming. 
</P>
<P>
	But he may not get anything. Farm preservation programs in most  
states are short of cash and a federal companion program is in 
danger of falling victim to tight congressional spending 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	So Brubaker is not sure whether or when he might qualify for  
help for his dairy, poultry and crops farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't get funding, it would be tempting to sell it for  
development, but I would be disappointed because that is not where 
my heart is,'' Brubaker said. ``One side is basically developed, 
and the other side is pretty well wide open. I can make a 
difference over whether to expand that community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brubaker has applied to sell an easement, or development rights,  
on that tract in Mount Joy, Pa., about 75 miles west of 
Philadelphia and 55 miles north of Baltimore. He already sold an 
easement to protect another farm property farther from the edge of 
sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	By voluntarily selling easements, farmers continue to own the  
land they till but are barred from pursuing non-farm activities. 
Supporters say the programs help channel sprawl and maintain farm 
clusters needed to ensure a viable agricultural supply and support 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the nonprofit American Farmland Trust, at least 15  
states have easement programs, up from nine in 1990. A handful of 
other states are setting up similar programs, while counties and 
other local governments operate dozens of others. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest programs are in the Northeast; California, Colorado,  
Kentucky and Michigan are among states that recently established 
easement programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Most face the same problem: Money available through state  
appropriations and bonds does not keep up with demand as farmers 
increasingly seek help resisting the pressures to sell fertile farm 
land to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	One study estimated that there were at least 2,900 pending  
applications nationwide, and another survey figured that Long 
Island, N.Y., alone needed $180 million. Long Island's Suffolk 
County operates one of the nation's oldest programs but has 
preserved fewer than half of the desired acreage. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are expensive programs, and most of them are not funded  
adequately,'' said Deborah Bowers, who tracks preservation programs 
for the trade newsletter Farmland Preservation Report. ``There's 
lots of development going on, and it's really affecting some of our 
really good, economically strong farming regions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pressures have intensified as more people are willing to  
commute longer distances for what they consider a serene, rural 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 federal farm law set aside $35 million over six years  
to supplement state and local efforts, but the money lasted only 
three years and met fewer than one in five requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills are pending to renew the programs at $55 million a year,  
but even supporters acknowledge that funding is tight. 
</P>
<P>
	Just recently, the Senate had to sidestep spending caps by  
declaring a $7.4 billion farm aid package as ``emergency'' funding. 
The easement program got no funding in pending House and Senate 
spending bills for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farm economy is in the tank, and a program like this is  
not high on the priority list of lawmakers,'' said Chuck Beretz, 
federal policy manager for American Farmland Trust, a chief 
proponent of easement programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But others argue it's a local issue and should be funded  
locally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't see how the federal government is equipped or  
should be responsible for that,'' said Pete Sepp of the National 
Taxpayers Union. Farm preservation may be laudable, he said, but 
``there are plenty of (local) zoning laws, tax incentives and other 
property-use restrictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the limited federal spending raises awareness and  
helps state and local governments create or expand programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can leverage more money than would otherwise be available  
and challenge private groups to match federal funds,'' said Wallace 
Lippincott, land preservation administrator in Baltimore County, 
Md., which surrounds the city of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	But he warned that every year there is a backlog, ``we could  
lose folks who are in emergency financial situations. They would go 
to the development route, and we would lose that land forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers who participate often use the money to buy new  
equipment, pay taxes or mortgages or save for children's college 
tuition. Unlike zoning and other local ordinances, easement 
commitments are permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zoning can change with an election or with some powerful  
people in the community or someone elected with a different 
mindset,'' said June Mengel, director the Lancaster County, Pa., 
Agricultural Preserve Board. ``We're trying to complement zoning.''

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Batters Northern Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- A strengthened Hurricane Dennis battered  
the northern Bahamas on Saturday, tearing up trees and utility 
poles, ripping down buildings under construction and threatening to 
grow even more powerful as it approaches the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters projected Dennis would become a Category 3 storm  
with winds up to 130 mph within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis' core is projected to stay away from shore as it passes  
Florida. But its outer winds could swipe the state on Sunday, and 
it could make landfall as late as Tuesday, most likely somewhere in 
the Carolinas, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our forecast shows it about 100 miles offshore'' when it  
passes Florida, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. ``That's significant because we think 
that 50 or 60 mph winds stick out about 100 miles. That suggests 
that they're going to get strong winds and they're really going to 
get some strong surf out of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From hundreds of miles away, Dennis kicked up 8-foot-high waves  
off Florida and North Carolina, delighting surfers but prompting 
officials to put state troopers and the National Guard on alert. 
Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were issued along 
hundreds of miles of the eastern seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, Dennis was centered 200 miles east-southeast of  
Cape Canaveral in Florida. It had sustained winds of 100 mph, up 
from 80 mph the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm broadened overnight, with hurricane winds extending 40  
miles from its center as it came out of a near-stall and resumed 
its west-northwest track at a crawl close to 6 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell said he was worried because three projections showed  
Dennis stalling again somewhere between Georgia and the Outer Banks 
with winds of 115 to 130 mph. The storm had hovered for hours 
overnight as it crept alongside the Abaco islands in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The destruction can be a lot worse just because it's hammering  
for a long period of time,'' Jarrell said. ``I think that would be 
the great fear from the stall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm had passed the Bahamas by Saturday afternoon. In Grand  
Abaco, a sliver no more than 10 miles wide with a population of 
several thousand, residents told tales of destruction and debris it 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Just back from a drive around Grand Abaco's Marsh Harbour, the  
Rev. Carlton Dorsette said about 70 percent of the walls were down 
on a commercial building under construction and his own house under 
construction was ``totally down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't much rain but lots of wind. I think we probably  
got a direct hit last night,'' he said. ``Lots of trees have 
fallen, power lines are down, a lot of phone lines are damaged, 
cable lines are damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of boats had gone under in the harbor, but the airport  
looked unscathed, Dorsette said. The Bahamas Air Sea Rescue 
Association said it had heard reports of several boats breaking 
their moorings and smashing onto rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Tate, a fisherman at Sweeting's Cay in the Abacos, said  
the storm damaged banana and other fruit trees, smashing some to 
the ground. It ripped the shingles off some roofs and tore down 
shacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to dump up to 10 inches of rain and create  
battering waves up to 8 feet above normal that could damage fragile 
coral reefs and strip beaches of sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Weather Service said projections for Dennis  
``become a bit more uncertain'' after Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane watch remained in effect for the east coast of  
Florida from Sebastian Inlet northward to Fernandina Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	People began preparing for the storm, stocking up on supplies  
and lumber. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was 
stocking up on water and other necessities at regional centers. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, but no decision 
has been made on whether to evacuate people from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, 150,000 coastal residents were put on alert,  
as were state troopers and emergency management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Florida Water Management District lowered water levels  
in canals to lessen the risk of flooding in heavy rains.

	At a recent football clinic for women, where 1,200 showed up for

<P>
	In the words of Mike McGee, South Carolina's athletic director,  
who, upon hearing Lou Holtz agree to become the Gamecocks' coach, 
turned to his wife, looked to the heavens and said: ``Thank you,

	At every other place he's been -- William &AMP; Mary, North Carolina  
State, Arkansas, Minnesota and Notre Dame -- the short, 
fragile-looking 62-year-old coach with a lisp has added to his 
reputation as college football's Great Reviver. 
</P>
<P>
	He even had the Golden Gophers, who lost 17 Big Ten games in a  
row before he arrived in Minneapolis, in the Independence Bowl in 
his second and final season there. 
</P>
<P>
	So, now he takes on his final and toughest coaching task --  
making winners out of the Gamecocks, who are coming off the worst 
season (1-10) in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 4, he'll lead his new team against NC State in Raleigh.  
Then, it's on to Georgia. One-two. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to change the culture here,'' Holtz said. ``We have to  
build confidence, but it's tough going on the road against maybe 
the best NC State team they've had in years, then Georgia, and then 
playing Tennessee, Florida and Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't stay serious for long, though. Asked about his  
timetable for success, Holtz said: ``I'd like to have this thing 
turned around by the second quarter of Sept. 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the day Holtz arrived, when a crowd of 4,000 appeared on  
just three hours' notice for his Dec. 4 news conference in 
Williams-Brice Stadium, much of the state has been in a kind of, 
well, de-LOU-rium. (The fans who aren't root for rival Clemson, 
which has a new coach of its own, Tommy Bowden). 
</P>
<P>
	When Holtz kidded about all the trash he saw on the state  
highways, an antilitter campaign began and a ``Clean the Roads'' 
task force was formed. 
</P>
<P>
	When the school asked for money in the spring, Gamecocks  
boosters answered with a record $10.3 million -- $8.4 million in 
cash. ``We raise more money per win than any school in the 
country,'' Holtz has said dozens of times since replacing Brad 
Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Season ticket sales are approaching a record 54,000, ``it's as  
many as we can sell,'' said Kerry Tharp, longtime sports 
information director. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel rooms around town were booked quicker than ever for the  
Gamecocks' six home games. ``We ought to put him on the front of 
our travel guide,'' said Lou Fontana of the state department of 
parks, recreation and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	For this mission, Holtz isn't on a one-man crusade. He brought  
much of the Holtz Household with him, including his wife, Beth, who 
he says has been gaining strength in her fight with throat cancer. 
``She's my first priority, always,'' he said, ``a very courageous 
woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also along for the revival is his son, Skip Holtz,  
daughter-in-law Jennifer, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Holtz was one of college football's hottest coaches  
after turning I-AA Connecticut into a national title contender. Now 
he's got a multiyear contract to be his dad's offensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	He chose family over fame.  
</P>
<P>
	``Professionally, I don't know how intelligent it was, and  
financially it wasn't the smartest decision I ever made,'' he said. 
``From a family standpoint, it was easy. We now have three 
children. When we moved from South Bend, we didn't have any. Mom is 
fighting cancer, and it's important for me that those kids grow up 
remembering what it was like living in Columbia with Nana and 
Poppa.''	   When it came time to buy a house, it was even easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my wife asked me, I said, `Let Mom and Dad pick their  
house, draw a one mile circle and find a home. We came here to be 
around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Lou Holtz returned to school so he could coach, motivate and  
turn a program that has a single 10-win season into a contender in 
the rugged Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he got back in the game only after his wife assured him  
it was the right thing to do. Two years as an analyst for CBS, 
though, after coming off his 11-year run at Notre Dame that 
included a national title in 1988, left the master motivator 
wanting up-close and personal action. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could be on easy street,'' Skip said in trying to explain  
why his father took a job many coaches advised him to turn down. 
``But if you've ever been around him for any length of time, he 
doesn't have an easy street. His motor runs 9,000 mph. Knowing how 
motivated and driven he is, it doesn't surprise me we're here. He 
lives for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have all he can handle in this state capital where a cargo  
train still runs through the center of town and the Williams-Brice 
Stadium shares land with the State Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	He's out to show the faithful fans, who fill the 80,250-seat  
stadium no matter how ugly the losing gets, their prayers have been 
answered. He wants to end the ``chicken curse,'' a hex placed on 
the school near the turn of the century by Sen. Ben ``Pitchfork'' 
Tillman, who founded Clemson because he didn't like all the 
``bluebloods in Columbia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz plans to keep the best high school players home (he  
started by signing tailback Derek Watson, South Carolina's ``Mr. 
Football''), knock off a Florida, Georgia or Tennessee at some 
point soon, and take Cocky and Co. to a major bowl for the first 
time. South Carolina has plenty of history, it just needs a little 
winning tradition to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobby at the Kay and Eddie Floyd Football Building could use  
some new hardware, too. The only keepsake hanging around on a 
recent visit was George Rogers' 1980 Heisman Trophy, plus the large 
stainless steel sculpture of a Gamecock that came with the 
3-year-old building. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gamecocks do have a few players with star quality in running  
back Boo Williams and free safety Arturo Freeman. The offensive and 
defensive lines are weak, the talent pool is shallow, but Holtz 
showed he means business when he expelled tailback Troy Hambrick, 
the team's leading rusher in '98, for off-field problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am unique in a certain respect,'' Holtz said. ``I have  
certain beliefs and I don't compromise those beliefs. I don't 
compromise them with the players of today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams remembers the first time Holtz met the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``When they announced he was coming, we were all waiting,  
anxious to see if he would show up,'' Williams said. ``A hush fell 
over the crowd. Here was a wonderful thing -- you could see the 
spirit of our team come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, a preseason all-SEC choice before he ripped up his knee  
and missed the '98 season, would have been in the NFL by now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my injury happened so I could come back and play for  
somebody the caliber of coach Holtz,'' Freeman said. ``I feel 
really blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does the University of South Carolina.  
</P>
<P>
	At least until the season starts.

<HEADLINE> Voices We Listened to This Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A TV talk show host starts a book club and millions read the  
novels she recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	A baby doctor offers simple advice and his words become a bible  
to parents. 
</P>
<P>
	A president sits before a microphone and his calm authority  
soothes a worried nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Three voices of three generations -- Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Benjamin  
Spock and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- have little in common, except 
this: 
</P>
<P>
	We listened to them.  
</P>
<P>
	The voices of influence in the 20th century are more a cacophony  
than a chorus: Preachers and politicians, journalists and 
humorists, crooners and crusaders, all have permeated the nation's 
consciousness. Along the way, a few have even made history. 
</P>
<P>
	We know their names: Will Rogers, Billy Graham, Walter Winchell.  
</P>
<P>
	We recognize their faces: Martin Luther King, Eleanor Roosevelt,  
Walter Cronkite. 
</P>
<P>
	But more importantly, we remember how their words entertained  
us, guided us, inspired us, forced us to think. 
</P>
<P>
	These were people, for the most part, who were not elected at  
the ballot box, but selected to enter our homes. Their words came 
to us as we read the newspaper, huddled around wooden radios, 
stared at the boob tube or clicked on our computer mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	And we listened. Especially in our most troubled times.  
</P>
<P>
	Though his name is rarely mentioned now, anyone who remembers  
the Depression remembers Father Charles Coughlin. In an era when 
people were homeless and jobless and wanted to know why, the 
priest-turned-broadcaster took to the air waves weekly, spouting 
isolationist, anti-Semitic tirades, attacking bankers and blaming 
the world's problems on capitalism and Communism. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions tuned in, thousands sent money.  
</P>
<P>
	Fast-forward a few decades to the turbulent Vietnam war years.  
Again, millions tuned in, this time to the nightly TV news 
broadcasts of Cronkite, the avuncular anchorman whose graying 
temples and resonant voice helped made him a symbol of moral 
authority. Polls consistently ranked him among the country's most 
trusted men. 
</P>
<P>
	We listened as Cronkite, returning from a reporting trip in  
Vietnam in 1968, declared the United States ``mired in a 
stalemate.'' Negotiation, he said, was the only rational course. 
</P>
<P>
	The words shook President Lyndon Johnson. ``If we have lost  
Walter, we have lost the country,'' he reportedly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first time in American history that a war had been  
declared over by a commentator,'' author David Halberstam wrote 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``What made that powerful was up to that point he had not  
committed himself,'' Garry Wills, the Pulitzer Prize-winning 
historian says of Cronkite. ``He was expending political capital he 
had accrued over the decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout this century, we listened to political leaders, whose  
words sometimes defined pivotal moments in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every crisis produces a great voice,'' says Marshall Fishwick,  
a professor who specializes in popular culture at Virginia Tech 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	FDR revolutionized politics and radio with his ``fireside  
chats,'' in which he reassured and rallied a nation through the 
bleak years of the Depression and World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to win the war and we are going to win the peace  
that follows,'' he vowed in a broadcast two days after Pearl Harbor 
was bombed. ``And in the difficult hours of this day -- through dark 
days that may be yet to come -- we will know that the vast majority 
of the members of the human race are on our side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decades later, another president, John F. Kennedy, captivated  
the nation with his wit, eloquence and Boston-starched voice as he 
spoke of new frontiers and of a ``torch ... passed to a new 
generation of Americans born in this century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1960s also brought forth voices of change, from Malcolm X,  
with his fiery black nationalist rhetoric, to King, with his 
impassioned cry for racial equality and an end to intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together  
as fools,'' King, the preacher, thundered as blood flowed in the 
streets during the civil rights battles. 
</P>
<P>
	His words still echo 31 years after his assassination, says Char  
Miller, history department chairman at Trinity University in San 
Antonio, Texas. ``What we remember are those extraordinary speeches 
that called into question the fundamental errors of American 
society and did so in a language that has an edge to it,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the way we listen has changed -- we've progressed from a  
scratchy ``wireless'' to 24-hour cable channels -- Miller says there 
has been a remarkable consistency in those we tune in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of what makes somebody famous or infamous is they speak  
directly to the needs of a large number of Americans,'' he says. 
``They pose a question that's been in our heads that we haven't 
articulated, or they provide an answer to a question that's been 
kicking around a long time and we haven't figured out a way to 
solve it. ... We use them as a mirror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes they're guides for everyday life.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Spock told us how to care for our children; Emily Post, how  
to mind our manners; Dale Carnegie, how to win friends and 
influence people; Norman Vincent Peale, how to be a positive 
thinker. And Ann Landers is still telling us how to cope with the 
in-laws, the boss, the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, Ann Landers must have a treasure trove of  
letters that would introduce us to the American psyche and changes 
in society more than anybody else I know,'' says Joe Boskin, 
director of the urban studies program at Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, voices are spiritual guides.  
</P>
<P>
	When radio was in its infancy, the airwaves crackled with Aimee  
Semple McPherson's talk of miracles, heaven and salvation. Decades 
later, when television first entered our living rooms, Archbishop 
Fulton Sheen became not just a voice, but a face, the first to 
combine the force of religion and a mesmerizing new medium. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon dozens of television ministers followed, but none had the  
longevity and legitimacy of the Rev. Billy Graham, whose crusades 
around the globe were beamed into millions of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever a president's in trouble, they trot him out,'' Miller  
says. ``He's a person who can make things all right -- just by his 
presence, he gives you a kind of benediction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes a president need offer only himself.  
</P>
<P>
	President Reagan's voice, cultivated as a broadcaster before he  
entered politics, delivered gentle humor and sunny visions of 
morning in America that helped solidify his reputation as ``the 
great communicator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Reagan often joked about himself, we liked hearing others  
poke fun at politics itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics has become so expensive that it takes a lot of money  
even to be defeated.'' The grumbling of a presidential candidate at 
century's end? Nope. The words of Will Rogers, who combined 
homespun humor with a serious populist message. 
</P>
<P>
	Populism spoke to us, too, in pen and ink, which served as  
America's voice early in the century. 
</P>
<P>
	There were muckraking journalists Ida Tarbell and Upton  
Sinclair, who took on industry, the great iconoclast H.L. Mencken 
and press lord William Randolph Hearst, whose ``penny press'' could 
ignite a war with Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio gave us a new breed of celebrity journalists, none more  
famous than Edward R. Murrow, the world-weary, chain-smoking 
foreign correspondent whose eyewitness accounts (``This -- is 
London'') from rooftops as bombs fell brought the war into our 
living rooms. Later, on television, Murrow helped bring down Sen. 
Joseph McCarthy at the height of the Red Scare. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio also gave us Lowell Thomas, our guide to news fronts  
around the world, and Paul Harvey, who brought us home again with 
the words of a cracker-barrel philosopher and cadences of America's 
heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a pattern to my broadcasts, it is mostly to report  
the things that interest me -- what people want to know and what 
people need to know in a blend that changes every day,'' says 
Harvey, 80, whose voice is still heard on more than 1,300 stations. 
``So much of what we report as news is frivolous, all color and no 
beer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But entertainment has its place, too. Millions tuned in to  
George Burns and Jack Benny for laughs, Sinatra and Elvis for 
music, Johnny Carson and his late-night successors for monologues 
with social and political commentary cloaked in one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, there was Walter Winchell, whose breathless,  
staccato tidbits about the private lives of politicians and movie 
stars pioneered the gossip industry that is a staple at century's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gossip,'' he once said, ``is the art of saying nothing in a  
way that leaves practically nothing unsaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At century's end, the range of voices we listen to has  
broadened, especially in recent decades as racial and gender 
barriers have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are whole parts of America represented or addressed that  
weren't before,'' says Wills, the historian. ``Women, minorities, 
gays -- we have political voices addressing their concerns. We 
didn't have that 50 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were trailblazers, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	Eleanor Roosevelt, both as a first lady and after, lectured and  
wrote, championing the causes of women, the poor and oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Real prosperity can only come when everybody prospers,'' she  
once wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Feminist Betty Friedan challenged us to reconsider our notions  
of a woman's role. ``Who knows what women can be when they are 
finally free to be themselves?'' she wrote in ``The Feminine 
Mystique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, who could have imagined decades ago that millions of TV  
viewers would watch a woman TV host dish about her weight, then run 
out to buy the pajamas she wears, the cookbook she endorses, the 
novels she reads? 
</P>
<P>
	``Oprah is someone who most people could identify with,'' says  
Brian Lavelle, of Loyola University in Chicago. ``She has an air of 
truthfulness and candor about her. She's a true voice for many, 
many women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With so many media outlets, the din has grown and more people  
today have a microphone -- radio shock jocks, real jocks talking 
sports, movie stars pontificating about politics, 
politician-pundits trying to drown each other out. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: Fewer voices dominate the microphone, says Paul  
Levinson, a professor of communications and media studies at 
Fordham University. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the 20th century ends,'' he says, ``rather than one person  
on stage that everyone is paying attention to, there are a lot of 
people standing in a lot of different corners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And one of those still standing -- Paul Harvey -- wonders how long  
the clamor will go on. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the multiplicity of media, we're all sitting on the edge  
of our chairs every day,'' he says. ``I think there will come a 
time, if we're not careful, that we'll all be ignored.''

<HEADLINE> French Authorities Rule Against BNP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Banque Nationale de Paris' plans to create Europe's  
biggest bank ended in failure today when French banking regulators 
ruled that it cannot keep its stake in Societe Generale, its 
unwilling takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, which came after an 11-hour meeting of the Committee  
of Credit and Investment Institutions, culminated a six-month 
banking battle, France's most brutal takeover fight ever. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP ``doesn't hold in a patent manner an effective power of  
control over Societe Generale,'' the committee said in a statement. 
``In these conditions, the committee decided ... not to authorize 
BNP to hold a stake representing 31.8 percent of voting rights in 
Societe Generale,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The much-awaited decision is a blow for those who sought to  
create a French banking ``champion,'' but a victory for those who 
say the market should have the last word. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the ruling, BNP ends up with Paribas, the smaller  
of its targets in a three-way merger attempt -- and the one it never 
really wanted. And Societe Generale is now vulnerable to a foreign 
takeover, which the French government wanted to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first reaction, BNP said in a statement that it will now  
focus on its merger with Paribas. The bank can appeal the ruling 
with France's highest administrative court, the Council of State, 
but said it was unlikely to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP also said a new offer for Societe Generale was unlikely.  
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale said it ``registered with satisfaction'' the  
ruling by banking regulators. The bank also thanked its 
shareholders for their trust and loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling comes amid intensified banking merger activity  
elsewhere. On Monday, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank 
raised the possibility of a full merger by confirming a retail 
banking link. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, BNP launched a twin, $37 billion hostile takeover bid  
for Societe Generale and Paribas, which were in the midst of a 
friendly merger. BNP's three-way merger would have created a 
banking giant with more than $1 trillion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	While BNP won control of Paribas, it garnered only a 37.1  
percent stake -- and 31.8 percent of voting rights -- in Societe 
Generale, leaving the outcome with the regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee had said it would intervene in the stock market  
battle if a bank failed to gain 50.01 percent of the voting rights 
in its target. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will be popular with Societe Generale employees, who  
had demonstrated Friday in front of the Bank of France, saying they 
feared the merger would lead to wage and job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP had claimed it had enough shares for effective control over  
Societe Generale, which vigorously opposed BNP, saying its hostile 
suitor would not have the authority to make major decisions for the 
bank.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Sign No. 1 Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Pitcher Josh Beckett on Saturday became the last  
of this summer's first-round draft picks to sign a pro contract, 
getting a four-year, $7 million deal from the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett, picked No. 2 overall in June, will make his debut in  
the Fall Instructional League. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old right-hander had planned to start classes at  
Blinn Junior College in Texas next week if there was no deal. If 
that had happened, the Marlins would have lost his rights and 
Beckett would have become eligible for the draft again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so pleased and glad that this deal got done,'' Beckett  
said. ``It was a long process, but now I look forward to playing 
baseball for the Marlins. It's hard to put into words how happy I 
am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett, who will be placed on the Marlins' 40-man roster, got a  
signing bonus of $3,625,000. His contract runs through the 2002 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a long but amicable negotiation, and we feel we have  
signed one of the most talented pitchers to come through the draft 
in several years,'' Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett was the first high school right-hander taken in the top  
two picks since Bill Gullickson in 1979. He was 13-2 with an 0.39 
ERA and 178 strikeouts in 89 innings this season at Spring High 
School in suburban Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins announced the signing at the Astrodome prior to  
their game at Houston on Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Celebrates Royal Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Volleys of cannon fire Saturday  
celebrated Denmark's first royal birth in 24 years. Prince Joachim 
and wife Princess Alexandra had a boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly there was a son,'' a jubilant Prince Joachim said at  
the hospital where he attended delivery and cut the umbilical cord. 
``I hyperventilated a few times and was close to fainting more than 
once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The baby weighed in at 5.8 pounds. Joachim declined to say what  
name the baby would be given. The prince, 30, is the youngest son 
of Queen Margrethe. It was her first grandchild. Her oldest son and 
heir to the throne, Crown Prince Frederik, 31, is not married. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra, of Britain, married Prince Joachim in November 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	The newborn became third in the line of succession. He also is  
the seventh-generation member of the Gluecksborg House, which has 
ruled the kingdom since 1863. The Danish monarchy dates to 940 A.D. 
and is Europe's oldest. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon, cannons at Copenhagen's naval base and at the Kronborg  
castle, north of the Danish capital, fired 21 rounds to salute the 
birth.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Newspaper Suspends TV Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Star and News has suspended  
and reassigned its television writer for plagiarizing a story 
written by a writer at another newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Hall admitted he made a ``stupid mistake'' and received a  
three-week, unpaid suspension. When he returns, he will be assigned 
to reporting duties that do not involve opinion writing, according 
to a statement by Executive Editor Frank Caperton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He also has been warned that if any further lapses in honesty  
come to light he will be dismissed,'' Caperton said in the 
statement, which was printed on the front page of today's editions 
and posted on the newspaper's Web site Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall's story was not published but ``he submitted it for  
publication with every intention of having it appear in the 
paper,'' Caperton said today. He said there were no indications 
that this had happened in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call by The Associated Press to Hall was not  
returned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Hall, who has been a television writer at the  
newspaper for 13 years, apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of time pressures, I made a stupid mistake and  
violated a sacred law of our profession,'' he said. ``I apologize 
to our readers and my family, co-workers and friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plagiarism was discovered when an editor at the newspaper  
noticed a story submitted by Hall was similar to one written by a 
television writer at another newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	No details were given about Hall's story, and the other  
newspaper and writer were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsroom staffs of the Star and News merged in 1995 and the  
News is due to close Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Wife of Kans. State Coach Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Nancy Bennett, wife of Kansas State  
defensive coordinator Phil Bennett, died Saturday of injuries 
sustained when she was struck by lightning over two weeks ago while 
jogging during a violent thunderstorm. She was 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett had been in intensive care at Mercy Hospital since she  
was injured Aug. 11 and never regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides her husband, she leaves two young children, Sam, 11, and  
Maddie, 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, who worked as a registered nurse while following her  
husband through his various coaching jobs, was struck by lightning 
near the Kansas State campus. Bennett, worried about his wife being 
out in the storm, arrived on the scene just as she was being put in 
the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, who has missed practices to be with his wife, said in a  
statement issued through the school that he was grateful for 
thousands of people who had expressed their compassion and concern 
through the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett joined the Kansas State staff in January and was named  
defensive coordinator in February. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to Kansas State from Oklahoma, where he had coached the  
secondary. He also coached at Texas Christian, Texas A&AMP;M, LSU, 
Purdue and Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, 43, played defensive end at Texas A&AMP;M from 1974-77.  
</P>
<P>
	Other survivors include Nancy Bennett's parents, Dr. and Mrs.  
O.T. Harris of Texas, two sisters and two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Services are scheduled for 1 p.m. Monday at the First United  
Methodist Church in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> New Wiretapping Rules on Cell Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New government wiretapping rules will allow  
police, with a judge's permission, to track cellular phone users by 
their location at the beginning and end of a call. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, announced Friday by the Federal Communications  
Commission, are intended to help law enforcement authorities keep 
pace with advances in phone technology. Privacy groups complained 
that the government was effectively turning cellular phones into 
tracking devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Another rule would allow investigators to listen in on phone  
conversations of all parties to a conference call, even if some are 
put on hold and are no longer talking to the target of the legal 
wiretap. Authorities with a court order also could determine when 
someone is using call-forwarding, three-way calling or other 
features. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our actions today will help ensure that law enforcement has  
the most up-to-date technology to fight crime,'' FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules help implement a 1994 law that requires companies to  
make digital wiretapping technology available to law enforcement 
agencies. The commission stepped in after the Justice Department, 
FBI and the telecommunications industry failed to agree on a plan 
after years of negotiations. The Justice Department and FBI got 
much of what they sought. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have until March 2000 to set equipment standards  
that integrate the added requirements and until Sept. 30, 2001, to 
implement them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the FCC's order addressed its major  
concerns and would aid officers in fighting terrorism, organized 
crime and illegal drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuing technological changes in the nation's  
telecommunications systems present increasing challenges to law 
enforcement,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. ``This ruling will 
enable law enforcement to keep pace with these changes and ensure 
we will be able to maintain our capability to conduct 
court-authorized electronic surveillance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups said the FCC overstepped the 1994 law.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply disappointed that on all the issues that  
mattered, the commission ruled against privacy and in favor of 
expanded FBI surveillance,'' said Jim Dempsey, counsel at the 
Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry groups said communications companies will have a hard  
time meeting the deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real time crunch and resource drain,'' said Grant  
Seiffert, vice president for government relations at the 
Telecommunications Industry Association, which represents major 
equipment manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The requirements also will be costly for the nation's local  
phone companies, according to the United States Telephone 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wheeler, head of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry  
Association, said he hoped law enforcement authorities would 
``provide carriers with the flexibility necessary to implement 
these capabilities in a way that makes sense.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Releases Education Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton took another  
opportunity Saturday to denounce the Republicans' $792 billion 
tax-cut package as unacceptably risky, this time calling it a 
threat to the future of public education. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address, Clinton also announced $95 million  
in aid for charter schools and endorsed the education idea as 
``freer of red tape and top-down management'' than traditional 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton contrasted the tax-cut plan with what he called the  
education successes of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charter schools are living proof of what parents and teachers  
can do to reinvigorate public education. Investing in them means 
investing in accountability and excellence and a much better future 
for our children,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But just as our children are returning to class, the  
Republicans' risky tax-cut plan would undermine these investments 
by forcing deep and irresponsible cuts to education and other 
national priorities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grants include $41 million for 19 states, the District of  
Columbia and Puerto Rico to fund the first of three-year grants for 
new charter schools. Another $54 million will go to existing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter schools are often created by concerned parents or  
teachers and operate with a charter from a public agency. 
Supporters say such schools offer solutions to problems weighing on 
public classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one charter school existed nationally when Clinton took  
office in 1993, he said. Now there are more than 1,700, and the 
administration hopes to help foster 3,000 by 2001, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charter schools offer parents and students more choice in the  
kinds of public education available to them, coupled with public 
accountability,'' Education Secretary Richard Riley said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, meanwhile, accused Clinton of playing politics with  
Americans' money by threatening to veto the tax cuts that 
congressional Republicans passed earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining a list of Republican governors and members of Congress  
who have touted the proposed reductions in the GOP's weekly radio 
address, Arizona Gov. Jane Hull questioned Clinton's plan to veto 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He either has a deep-seated desire to increase government  
spending, or he just does not want to give the money back to the 
people who earned it in the first place,'' she said. ``President 
Clinton is playing politics with your money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton typically tapes the radio address in advance. But he  
delivered the brief speech live Saturday at Edgartown School before 
an audience of Martha's Vineyard residents who helped White House 
staff and reporters during the Clintons' vacation this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton family then left the island for a house-hunting trip  
to Westchester County, N.Y., near New York City, and a weekend of 
fund-raising parties in the wealthy seashore suburbs of Long 
Island.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Leader Wraps Up U.S. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- About 3,200 people gathered at Chicago's Field  
Museum on Saturday to hear the Dalai Lama's nonsectarian message of 
peace, compassion and human rights on the last day of a 17-day U.S. 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The exiled spiritual leader of the world's Tibetan Buddhists  
also spoke in New York and in Bloomington, Ind., where his brother 
founded the Tibetan Cultural Center in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the same physically, spiritually and emotionally,'' the  
Dalai Lama told the crowd at Saturday's fundraiser. ``We have the 
same potential ... to help other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also spoke of the importance of meditation to prepare to face  
life's problems and noted that much blood had been shed in the name 
of religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept of one religion and one truth is bad,'' he said,  
adding that love and compassion for mankind is necessary to be 
happy, complicated philosophy and doctrine are not. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is surprising to see Western people so interested in him,''  
said Julie Zhang, a computer programmer from Canton, China. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the crowd were talk show host Oprah Winfrey and  
actress Goldie Hawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he said was very simple and very direct. There is a need  
for love and compassion,'' said Allison Williams, who considers 
herself a Buddhist in training. 
</P>
<P>
	After his remarks, the Dalai Lama blessed a Tibetan ``thangka''  
-- an 18th century painting depicting the 2nd, 4th and 6th Dalai 
Lamas -- in the Field Museum's collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama was to return to his home in Dharmsala, India,  
Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Devers Wins 100-Meter Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Gail Devers and Ludmila Engquist, two  
perfect illustrations of medical miracles, performed some 
miraculous feats at the World Championships on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Devers, who has overcome life-threatening  
Graves' Disease, ran the race of her life, winning the 100-meter 
hurdles title for the third time in 12.37 seconds, the fastest in 
the world in seven years and an American record. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspirational Engquist, 35, now in the midst of chemotherapy  
treatment for breast cancer, was a fast-closing third in 12.47, her 
best of a star-crossed year, and just behind the 12.44 of silver 
medalist Glory Alozie of Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	The warmth and empathy between Devers and Engquist was evident  
after the stunningly fast race. 
</P>
<P>
	The two hugged and embraced, then took a victory lap together,  
each stopping to kiss Engquist's husband, Johan. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she got across the finish line I just told her, `I am so  
proud of you,''' Devers said. ``It's amazing. She makes me think of 
what I had to overcome and what I had to go through. She's already 
15,000 miles ahead of where she should be. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Her comeback) let everybody know if you are believing in  
yourself dreams do come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Devers, the dream did come true -- again.  
</P>
<P>
	This was her fifth gold medal, the most by any woman ever at the  
championships. She also has one each in the 100 meters and 400 
relay, and will try to extend her record to six in the relay 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dream almost disappeared Saturday over the last of the 10  
hurdles, a scary reminder of the 1992 Olympics, when she fell while 
leading and had to scramble over the finish line for fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to attack the hurdles and I didn't want 1992 to  
come back at me,'' she said. ``Over the last two hurdles it felt 
like I was getting too close to them. I backed off a little, but I 
tried to attack the last hurdle. I bumped it, but I was determined 
to stay on my feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Devers' time was the fastest since Engquist ran 12.26 at Seville  
on June 6, 1992, and broke her U.S. record of 12.46, set at 
Stuttgart, Germany, on Aug. 20, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers was diagnosed with Graves' Disease in 1989 and didn't  
compete again until June 1991. Her condition, requiring radiation 
and chemotherapy treatments, became so serious that she came close 
to having a foot amputated. She then made an astonishingly rapid 
recovery and won the 100 hurdles at the 1991 USA Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease flared up again this year and she ran the World  
Indoor Championships in extreme pain, finishing second. It still 
bothers her occasionally, causing difficulty in sleeping and 
eating, and her body to ache badly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the physical anguish, Devers could lay claim to  
being the greatest woman track and field athlete of the decade and 
the best sprinter-hurdler ever. In addition to her accomplishments 
in the World Outdoor Championships, including two silver medals, 
she has won two Olympic 100 titles and one relay gold medal, and 
two world indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Devers, Engquist's dream was not realized.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am a little disappointed because I dreamt that I would have  
the gold medal,'' the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and two-time world 
champion said. ``However, a medal is a wonderful thing for me to 
have after all that I have been through with my illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enquist's performance capped the most remarkable and  
inspirational story of the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian-born Swede was diagnosed with breast cancer in  
March. She had her right breast removed on April 21, and returned 
to competition July 30, winning a race in Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
	Engquist has continued to train through four chemotherapy  
sessions. She will undergo the fifth of her six treatments 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the championships, Engquist had said she only hoped to  
reach the final. But she won all of her qualifying heats, including 
a sizzling 12.50 in Friday's semifinals, establishing herself a 
serious contender for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	In the race, Devers broke on top quickly, with Engquist trailing  
badly. Engquist rallied, but too late to catch Devers or Alozie, 
the world's top-ranked hurdler last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's most popular winner with the crowd of 52,273 was  
marathoner Abel Anton of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Anton overcame searing heat of 97 degrees at the start and won  
his second straight world title in 2:13:36, 27 seconds ahead of 
Italy's Vicenzo Modica. 
</P>
<P>
	As Anton entered the stadium for the final lap, he raised his  
hands and blew kisses to the crowd. The fans responded with chants 
of ``Ole, Ole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I got away in the last four or five kilometers,'' Anton said.  
``I was surprised because I usually wait to the very end. When I 
left the Japanese (third-place finisher Nobuyuki Sato) and Italian 
behind, I knew I had the gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anton said he was helped -- not just by the screaming fans in the  
stadium -- but by the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of Seville was in the street supporting me,'' he said ``I  
think there were around 200,000 people.'' Police estimates were at 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain's Martin Fiz, the 1995 champion and runner-up to Anton in  
1997, finished eighth in 2:16:17, and South Africa's Gert Thys, the 
second-fastest marathoner in history, was 15th in 2:17:13. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's other finals, Cuba's Ivan Pedroso, the four-time  
world indoor champion in the men's long jump, won his third outdoor 
title at 28 feet, 1 inch; Morocco's Salah Hissou set a championship 
record in winning the men's 5,000 in 12:58.13, and Greece's Mirela 
Manjani-Tzelili took the women's javelin with a season's best 
220-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers came back later and anchored the U.S. team to victory in  
the semifinals of the 400 relay in 42.28, the year's fastest time. 
Inger Miller, the 200 champion, won the third leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Greene, the 100 and 200 champion, anchored the U.S. 400  
relay team to victory in the men's semifinals in 38.06, the fastest 
by any nation this year, while two-time defending champion Canada 
was disqualified for passing out of the zone. For the Americans, it 
was a moral victory after being disqualified in the past two 
championships for dropping the baton.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Search for Home in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The First Family ended their island  
vacation and stepped into a silver Suburban for another day of 
house hunting in Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton brushed aside a question about whether he and  
his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were close to buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some place nice and airy that will make Hillary happy -- that's  
what I want,'' he said today. Mrs. Clinton, standing a few yards 
behind her husband on Air Force One, laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea, were continuing  
on to the Hamptons to raise political money this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The family spent a Sunday earlier this month visiting properties  
in the area, where Mrs. Clinton would like to settle to establish 
residency to run for an open Senate seat in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mrs. Clinton slipped of the island unnoticed last Saturday  
for another round of house hunting, administration officials, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Friday's golf game ended badly -- a steady, drenching  
rain forced his party off the course at the 15th hole Friday -- at 
least Clinton didn't lose Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The president joined Britain's Prince Andrew, the duke of York,  
on the links at the Farm Neck Golf Club. He noted that in the 17th 
century the island off the Massachusetts coast was owned by 
Andrew's predecessor dukes of York. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what the bet is? If he beats me, we have to give him  
back the island,'' Clinton said, stopping his golf cart near a 
gaggle of reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game was rained out, the prince came splashing across  
the parking lot toward a black Land Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked the game's outcome, Andrew pulled a crumpled wad of  
American bills from his pocket and replied: ``I have still got a 
little money in my pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Clinton returned to the private home where he and his  
family have spent the past week. The family was to leave today for 
a fund-raising weekend at the Hamptons on Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the money will go toward Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
possible Senate race in New York. Tonight in East Hampton the 
Clintons are hosts at the airport terminal to a buffet reception of 
the young Democrats' ``Saxophone Club.'' At $250 per person, some 
800 people are expected to turn out for the Clintons and comedian 
Jon Stewart to net about $200,000 for the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, it's on to a $1,000 per plate barbecue dinner at a  
private East Hampton residence. Singer Phoebe Snow will entertain 
the 300 people contributing jointly to the DNC, Mrs. Clinton's 
campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Clintons star at a $5,000-per-person lunch for 80  
at a Southampton home. The first $1,000 of every ticket price, a 
party official said, will go to Mrs. Clinton's race, and the 
remainder will be shared by the DNC and DSCC. 
</P>
<P>
	In the priciest of the galas, rocker Jon Bon Jovi provides the  
music at a Bridgehampton dinner on Sunday night solely benefiting 
the DNC. At $25,000 per couple, the event is expected to bag 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes and Jim  
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, were 
starting a drive to cram the airwaves in upstate Skaneateles, N.Y., 
the Clintons' final stop on this half-recreational, half-political 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 30-second television commercial being shown in the  
Skaneateles market, Nicholson urged Clinton to ``take a moment from 
your vacation to talk about real tax relief with Hillary and Al 
(Gore). You'll be glad you did when you're living in New York -- or 
whatever state you decide to call home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Forbes campaign bought five days' worth of spots on three  
Syracuse-area radio stations -- WSYR, WSEN and WNSS -- to hammer at 
the president's opposition to a Republican tax-cut bill pending in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sign the tax cut, Mr. President,'' Forbes says in the ad. ``I  
would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the American Conservative Union purchased television time  
in the upstate region to criticize Clinton's decision to offer 
conditional clemency to 16 imprisoned Puerto Rican militants. Those 
ads are scheduled to run next Monday through Friday.

	Union Recommends New Boeing Deal  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- After days of pessimistic talk that a strike was  
in the offing, the Machinists union today recommended that 44,000 
Boeing workers accept a new contract with the aerospace company. A 
proposal offered by the company early today is ``the best contract 
in the aerospace industry,'' said Bill Johnson, president of 
Machinists District Lodge 751. The workers will vote on the pact 
Wednesday. Johnson said several aspects of the deal should please 
members, including keeping a traditional work week, so workers will 
continue to be paid overtime for working on weekends.

	Hurricane Dennis Grows Stronger  
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis grew stronger today as  
it blows through the Bahamas and chugs toward the U.S. eastern 
seaboard. With Dennis intensifying and slowing down at the same 
time, U.S. forecasters say the storm is expected to stay offshore 
as it moves past Florida, with landfall on the mainland possibly 
late Monday or Tuesday somewhere in the Carolinas. From hundreds of 
miles away, Dennis kicked up 8-foot-high waves off Florida and 
North Carolina, prompting officials to put state troopers and the 
National Guard on alert.

	East Timor Gangs Defy U.N.

<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Defying U.N. demands for peace in the  
days before a referendum on independence, militia gangs roamed 
unchecked through East Timor's capital today, sending hundreds of 
people fleeing in terror. The anti-independence gangs' sweep 
through the dusty streets of eastern Dili followed days of violence 
that have left at least 10 dead across the troubled territory. 
Residents of the former Portuguese colony are to vote Monday in a 
historic U.N.-supervised referendum on whether to break away from 
Indonesia.

	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes struck Iraqi air defense  
systems with bombs and missiles today after being targeted and 
fired on by the Iraqi forces, the U.S. military said. U.S. fighter 
planes dropped precision-guided bombs on a military radar site 
south of the city of Mosul, the U.S. European Command said. They 
also fired missiles at an installation that targeted the planes 
with missile-guidance radar.

	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The First Family ended their island  
vacation today and stepped into a silver Suburban for another day 
of house hunting in Westchester County. President Clinton brushed 
aside a question about whether he and his wife, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, were close to buying. ``Some place nice and airy that will 
make Hillary happy -- that's what I want,'' he said today. Later, 
the Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea, will continue on to the 
Hamptons for fund-raisers this weekend.

	French Bank Appeal Unlikely  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Banque Nationale de Paris is likely to scrap its  
attempts to create Europe's biggest bank after French regulators 
killed its hostile bid for Societe Generale, ordering it to 
relinquish its stake in the bank. BNP can appeal the order to 
France's highest administrative court, but it said in a statement 
today that an appeal is ``highly unlikely.'' The ruling marks a big 
victory for the market in France where the government often plays a 
big role in regulating the economy: The regulators didn't force the 
merger, even though the government wanted it to go through.

fight is a go for Nov. 13,'' said Greg Fritz, of Don King 
Productions. The official announcement will be made at a news 
conference Tuesday. The fight will be held at the Thomas &AMP; Mack 
center on the UNLV campus. Holyfield and Lewis fought to a 
controversial draw March 13 in a fight many ringsiders felt was won

</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Six bodybuilders were stripped of their  
medals at the Arab Games today after testing positive for 
muscle-building steroids. Substances that showed up in the tests 
were Nandrolone, Metenolone, Stanozolol and testasterone, according 
to Reda Kazem, head of the Arab Games Doping Committee. The 
drug-control committee targeted bodybuilders because the Arab Union 
of Bodybuilders, preparing for the Sydney Olympics, wanted to show 
that its competitors were clean, Kazem said.

<HEADLINE> Rabid Bear a Concern in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLERMONT, Iowa (AP) -- As many as 100 people may have been  
exposed to a bear cub that died of rabies at a rural northeastern 
Iowa petting zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	State health official said visitors who had come in contact with  
the bear in the past month should see a doctor immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-month-old black bear, which was on display at the Wild  
Midwest Petting Zoo in Clermont, died Friday afternoon. Tests 
performed by the zoo's veterinarian determined that the bear was 
rabid, and the Iowa Department of Public Health was informed 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things we're trying to find out is how long the  
bear had spread rabies,'' state epidemiologist Dr. Patricia 
Quinlisk said. ``Right now, I would say that anybody who was bitten 
by the bear or got saliva on their face or in an open wound in the 
last two weeks needs to go and see their doctor and may need rabies 
shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabies is a viral disease found in the saliva of infected  
animals and is transmitted to pets and humans by bites, or possibly 
by contamination of an open cut. Untreated, rabies causes a painful 
death by attacking the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Swenson, 39, the petting zoo's owner, said the bear may  
have been in contact with approximately 100 people during the past 
week and a half.

<HEADLINE> St. Peter's 'Purified' After Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Sprinkling holy water toward the marble  
walls, a Vatican priest symbolically cleansed St. Peter's Basilica 
after the suicide there of a distraught Italian pensioner. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, identified as 64-year-old Benedetto Minnini of the port  
city of Bari, shot himself in the mouth Tuesday afternoon while the 
basilica was crowded with tourists. A woman videotaping inside 
happened to catch the suicide on tape, and apparently was the first 
to alert authorities in the vast church. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Vatican parish priest the Rev. Giovanni Ferrotti  
performed a purification rite under canon law, casting holy water 
toward all sides of the basilica from the nave where the man killed 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``We entrust to the mercy of God the spirit of our brother,''  
Ferrotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The archbishop of St. Peter's, Cardinal Virgilio Noe, determined  
a fuller reconsecration ceremony was unnecessary because the act 
was neither a deliberate profanation of the church nor a 
sacrilegious act in itself, although suicide is a grave sin under 
church law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican briefly cleared the basilica of tourists after the  
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no explanation for why the man killed himself; a  
message on his family's answering machine in Bari said they 
themselves were trying to understand why. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian media called it the first recorded suicide within the  
basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been several past suicides outside the Roman Catholic  
faith's most prominent church, including a man who set himself on 
fire in St. Peter's Square last year to protest society's treatment 
of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, a would-be assassin shot and badly wounded Pope John  
Paul II in the square. 
</P>
<P>
	Security officers at St. Peter's said metal detectors are used  
at the entrance only on Wednesdays, when Pope John Paul II holds 
his regular weekly audience. Guards at the door at other times 
chiefly check whether visitors are properly attired.

<HEADLINE> Working Conditions Tough in Amazon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ACAILANDIA, Brazil (AP) -- Ask Jose Rubens Barbosa whether he'd  
rather make charcoal or clear pasture and he just laughs. Charcoal 
may be dirty and unhealthy, but it's safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not falling into that trap,'' says Barbosa.  
</P>
<P>
	He knows a better-paying offer to clear pasture in the middle of  
the jungle often ends in virtual slavery at a remote ranch, where 
the chance of escape is almost nil. 
</P>
<P>
	So he and his mates work near town, where they can come and go  
and are fairly sure they'll get paid. No matter that they earn less 
than Brazil's meager $75 monthly minimum wage or that working 
conditions are hard. 
</P>
<P>
	For about $50 a month, they fill dozens of igloo-shaped brick  
ovens with firewood, where it cooks for three days turning to 
charcoal. 
</P>
<P>
	The ash is everywhere and creeps into the crevices of clothing,  
skin, nostrils and lungs. With the help of a strong wind, it can 
turn the sun dark at noon. Hacking coughs and other breathing 
disorders are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety regulations require kiln workers to wear helmets and  
masks, but even when the gear is available they don't use it 
because of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pindarei charcoal factory, a stone's throw from a major  
highway, a 2-year-old boy in ragged red shorts works alongside his 
mother tossing little pieces of wood into the brick furnace. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't make ends meet on what we earn,'' says Memes Neri  
Costa, who has tried his hand at everything from wildcat mining to 
logging to clearing pasture. ``I keep a little garden plot. I have 
to in order to survive''

<HEADLINE> Reputed Mob Leader Denies Bank Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A reputed Russian mob leader denied accusations  
that he was involved in the alleged laundering of billions of 
dollars through an American bank, according to a jocular interview 
with him published Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only dream of such money. ... All these accusations are  
the nightmarish delirium of the FBI,'' Semyon Mogilevich told the 
Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper. ``If I could earn -- not steal -- a 
third of that money, my life would be a success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mogilevich said he had only laundered money once in his life:  
``I washed $5 dollars worth of Russian currency I'd left in my 
shirt, not noticing that they had been left in the pocket. I want 
to say that the money looked a lot cleaner and brighter after 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering is the process of moving ill-gotten gains  
through a series of bank accounts until they appear to be 
legitimate profits from legal businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mogilevich has long denied any involvement with organized crime,  
though he has been linked to a company called Benex, which had 
accounts at the Bank of New York that raised the suspicion of U.S. 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Moskovsky Komsomolets did not say where Mogilevich was when he  
gave the interview published Saturday, though he is believed to be 
based in Budapest, Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged with wrongdoing in the alleged  
laundering of between $4.2 billion and $10 billion by the Russian 
mob through the Bank of New York. The case is potentially the 
biggest money-laundering affair ever uncovered in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Bank of New York fired a London-based executive,  
Lucy Edwards, who was in charge of its Eastern European operations. 
The bank would not elaborate on Edwards' dismissal, but Dow Jones 
Newswires reported that the institution suspected her of misconduct 
and falsifying records. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Russian-born Bank of New York executive, Natasha  
Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, has been suspended. Her husband, Russian 
businessman Konstantin Kagalovsky, has also been implicated in the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview on Russian television Saturday, Konstantin  
Kagalovsky again denied he and his wife were involved in the 
scheme. He said the scandal was being blown out of proportion by 
U.S. politicians battling about aid to Russia, which is expected to 
be a sensitive issue in next year's U.S. presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife is accused because she's married to me, a Russian  
businessman,'' and the West always associates Russian businessmen 
with organized crime, he said from his home outside Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a U.S. investigation into the bank, Russia's  
Federal Securities Commission said Friday it would audit 33 Russian 
companies with dealings with the Bank of New York. The companies 
include oil giants Lukoil and Sibneft, Russia's largest automaker 
Avtovaz and several other major firms, the Interfax news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering and capital flight have been major problems for  
Russia throughout this decade, with tens of billions of dollars 
pouring out of the country. Many wealthy Russians, particularly 
those who made their fortunes illegally, have sought to hide their 
money overseas, largely to avoid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other people linked to the Bank of New York case have  
also denied involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Another powerful Russian businessman implicated in the scandal,  
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, said in Saturday's New York Times that the 
money that moved through the Bank of New York belonged to Russian 
officials trying to protect their assets before the economy crashed 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government has not been accused of any wrongdoing in  
the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Khodorkovsky is the chairman of the Yukos oil company and once  
led Menatep, a Russian bank that collapsed after the crisis. 
Menatep is being investigated over whether it also funneled money 
illegally through the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In his interview with the Times, Khodorkovsky said that  
Mogilevich was involved in the matter.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Confirms Tripp Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky has confirmed the  
authenticity of taped conversations secretly recorded by Linda 
Tripp, according to court documents filed by state prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	A Maryland grand jury indicted Mrs. Tripp on July 30 on two  
felony counts, charging that she illegally tape-recorded the former 
White House intern on Dec. 22, 1997 and disclosed the contents of 
the conversation to Newsweek magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 16, Ms. Lewinsky listened to copies of tapes made by  
Tripp in October 1997, and confirmed the identities of the voices 
on them, state prosecutors said Thursday. Mrs. Tripp testified that 
she taped several conversations with Lewinsky in late 1997, even 
after an attorney told her it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also disclosed that the copies were provided to the  
state by Lucianne Goldberg, a New York literary agent. Ms. 
Goldberg, who testified in Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
investigation last November, said she urged Mrs. Tripp to start 
taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp turned over the tapes to Starr, triggering the  
investigation into Ms. Lewinsky's affair with President Clinton. In 
return, she received a federal grant of immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Mrs. Tripp have asked a judge to dismiss the  
charges, arguing state prosecutors improperly relied on her 
immunized testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli has denied that his office  
used information gathered by federal sources.

<HEADLINE> Letter Details Battle of Midway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For decades, as chroniclers of the battle that  
turned the tide of World War II in the Pacific second-guessed Vice 
Adm. Stanhope Cotton Ring, his voice was silent. He had locked it 
away in his sea chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Navy commander who lost 27 aircraft from a 60-plane  
squadron in the confusion of the early hours of the Battle of 
Midway speaks from the grave about what went wrong. It's all there 
in a 22-page, handwritten letter dated March 28, 1946, and only 
recently discovered in a sea chest by his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been much written about the Battle of Midway, and in  
many respects there has been a startling lack of accuracy,'' begins 
Ring, who died in 1963. ``This is an attempt, almost four years 
after the action, to set down in black and white my best 
recollections of what occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was early on June 4, 1942, when Ring led his air wing from  
the carrier USS Hornet in one of the first forays against a 
four-carrier Japanese task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Of his 60 planes, 45 never saw the Japanese armada, and many ran  
out of fuel and crashed into the sea. The 15 that engaged the 
enemy, a squadron of slow and defenseless Devastator torpedo 
bombers flying without fighter protection, were picked off one by 
one by Japanese Zeros without making a single hit on the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 15 torpedo bombers, 10 fighters and two dive  
bombers were lost. The two fighter pilots and 29 of the 30 pilots 
and radio operators of the torpedo bombers died. 
</P>
<P>
	On returning to the Hornet, Ring found only 18 Douglas Dauntless  
scout bombers had made it back; 15 of the 17 dive bombers landed on 
Midway island and later were able to return to action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shaken at the realization of such losses,'' Ring wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	None of the major historians of the battle talked with Ring  
about his role, but their near-unanimous verdict was that his 
planes lost their way. The line of reasoning held that his 
inability to attack in the battle's crucial early hours caused 
greater American losses than necessary, including the carrier USS 
Yorktown. 
</P>
<P>
	Ring, the Hornet's senior aviator whose air wing accounted for  
one-third of the strike force at Midway, admits to a mistaken 
assessment of a murky situation. 
</P>
<P>
	His letter makes clear, however, that ``he was never lost at  
all'' said Navy Capt. Bruce Linder, who edited and annotated the 
letter for the Annapolis, Md.,-based Naval Institute. ``Those that 
jumped to that oversimplification lost the true significance of the 
complexity of the fledgling level of naval aviation in the early 
1940s'' when navigation and communications methods were poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Lost Letter of Midway'' was published in the U.S. Naval  
Institute's monthly ``Proceedings'' magazine in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Ring's planes, along with the air group from the USS Enterprise,  
were to fly under radio silence to a location near Midway where the 
Japanese carriers were expected, with their planes away attacking 
U.S. installations at Midway. The undefended carriers would have 
been easy targets -- if only they had been there. 
</P>
<P>
	When he didn't see the carriers, Ring said he ``decided that I  
should proceed on the assumption that the enemy was closing Midway 
and directed the course of the (planes) accordingly'' toward the 
island. ``My change of Air Group course to the south was based 
entirely on my estimate of the situation (which proved faulty) and 
not on definite information of the enemy movements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese had learned of the approaching American naval force  
and had turned to the northeast to find it, a 90-degree angle from 
Ring's course. 
</P>
<P>
	Approaching Midway, Ring saw smoke but no enemy and decided  
``immediate return to the carrier was necessary ... since fuel 
supply was running low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ring picked up an unfamiliar homing signal -- the code had been  
changed, and Hornet had not received word -- and signaled his planes 
to ignore the beacon and return by dead reckoning. His scout 
bombers followed him, but the dive bombers and fighters did not. He 
tried to turn them back, ``but I could not catch them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I finally gave up the chase, VS-8 had disappeared from  
sight and VB-8 was apparently headed for Midway,'' he said of the 
plane groups. 
</P>
<P>
	His analysis of what went wrong -- mainly communication problems  
and an inexperienced crew -- agree with the evaluation of Adm. 
Chester W. Nimitz, the Pacific commander in chief, who wrote in his 
official report that the battle illustrated a need for better 
training for land and sea forces and more effective communication. 
</P>
<P>
	The torpedo bombers turned northward and chanced upon the  
Japanese carriers at roughly the same time as the Enterprise 
aviators. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Cmdr. John Waldron, commanding the Devastators,  
``courageously and in the face of certain destruction led his 
command in a torpedo attack against the enemy,'' Ring wrote. By 
tying up the Zeros in defending their carriers against the 
torpedoes, Waldron's attack allowed dive bombers from Enterprise to 
mortally wound three of the Japanese carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole survivor of the Hornet torpedo crews was Ens. George  
Gay, a pilot who clung to a seat cushion as war swirled about him. 
He was picked up 30 hours later and reported having thought to 
himself during his ordeal: ``It's the end of the world, and I have 
a grandstand seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gay died four years ago, and his ashes were put into the Pacific  
on Aug. 31, 1995, at the spot where his comrades died 53 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans eventually prevailed at Midway.  
</P>
<P>
	During the three-day battle, an outnumbered U.S. force sank all  
four Japanese carriers and a heavy cruiser, put another cruiser out 
of action and destroyed more than 250 planes and some of the 
Japanese Navy's most experienced combat pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle 1,100 miles west of Hawaii ended Japan's early  
advance through the Pacific toward the American territory and put 
the Allies on course to Japan's surrender on Sept. 2, 1945.

	HENDERSON, Ky. (AP) -- Lines of Beauty took the lead from the  
start and held off a late challenge from Roza Robata to win by a 
neck in the $200,000 Gardenia Stakes on Saturday at Ellis Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old, with jockey Francisco Torres, held a comfortable  
lead midway on the far turn until Roza Robata quickly closed and 
pulled beside her. The two ran side by side for an eighth of a mile 
before Lines of Beauty drew away to win the mile-and-an-eighth 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Castle Blaze finished six lengths behind in third place in the  
field of 10 fillies and mares. 
</P>
<P>
	Lines of Beauty, trained by Randy Martin, covered the distance  
in 1:49 3-5 and paid $24.40, $11.20 and $7.60. The win earned owner 
Marco Thoroughbred Corp. $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Roza Robata, ridden by Robby Albarado, paid $4.80 and $4.20,  
while Castle Blaze returned $12.40.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Zimmer Out of Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer was  
released from Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center on Saturday, two 
days after he was admitted when a heart ailment flared up. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, will rejoin the Yankees on Sunday. New York manager  
Joe Torre said Zimmer wanted to go to the ballpark Saturday but 
doctors talked him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, in his 51st season of professional baseball, had a minor  
cardiac abnormality, according to the Yankees. He led New York to a 
21-15 record this year as interim manager while Torre recovered

<HEADLINE> How Midway Battle Letter Was Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice Adm. Stanhope Cotton Ring's version of  
the Battle of Midway was discovered by his daughter, Susan Keith, 
tucked away in a sea chest Ring shared with his wife, Eleanor. Mrs. 
Keith, from a venerable San Diego Navy family, said she came across 
the document about six months ago as she went through old records 
of her mother, who died four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was his letter,'' she said in a telephone interview  
from San Diego. ``I recognized his gorgeous handwriting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Lost Letter of Midway'' was published in the U.S. Naval  
Institute's monthly ``Proceedings'' magazine in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Navy Capt. Bruce Linder, who edited and annotated the  
letter for the Annapolis, Md.-based Naval Institute, discovered the 
material as he discussed with Mrs. Keith material for a book on San 
Diego's naval history. He said he was about to leave when Mrs. 
Keith asked: ``Of course you've heard about the Midway letter?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After borrowing the letter for an evening, I became convinced  
that I had stumbled upon something of significance ... that told an 
entirely different story than that told in the more popular 
histories of battle,'' Linder said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said former naval aviators who flew in the war or in similar  
circumstances ``confirmed for me that Ring's take on what had 
happened at Midway was much closer to the truth than what had 
largely been surmised by historians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Ring, he rose to command three carriers, including the  
storied USS Saratoga, and had a string of prestigious commands as a 
rear admiral and vice admiral. And Nimitz personally awarded Ring 
the Navy Cross for valor at Midway.

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw Named WNBA's Top Rookie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw of the Washington Mystics  
was voted WNBA Rookie of the Year, getting 48 of a possible 51 
votes in results announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, the No. 1 pick in the May draft, averaged 16.9 points  
and 7.9 rebounds and helped the Mystics to a 12-20 record, a major 
improvement from 3-27 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 Holdsclaw was a two-time WNBA Player of the Week  
and started for the East team in the WNBA All-Star game in July. 
</P>
<P>
	One vote each from a panel of sportwriters and broadcasters went  
to Detroit's Dominique Canty, Orlando's Nykesha Sales and New 
York's Tamika Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw said that while she was honored to receive the award,  
she missed her No. 1 goal: making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	She looked for greater progress next season.  
</P>
<P>
	``We won four times as many games, and with the draft,  
hopefully, we'll acquire some better players,'' she told a news 
conference. ``We'll make some trades here and there and maybe have 
a better team next year.''

<HEADLINE> Fires May Show Need To Thin Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Critics say the more than 20 major  
wildfires charring brush and timber on thousands of acres in five 
western states demonstrate the need to thin forests to prevent 
catastrophic fires. 
</P>
<P>
	The blazes have burned more than 190,000 acres as of Friday.  
Michael Paparian, a Sierra Club representative, said the wildfires 
underscore the need for active forest management. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of aggressive firefighting have allowed brush to flourish  
that, left alone, would have been cleared away naturally by 
wildfires, he said. That brush now fuels wildfires, making them so 
hot they kill large trees that otherwise would likely survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the forests have been managed up to now can lead to  
more catastrophic fires than using a more rational approach,'' 
Paparian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Bischel, president of the California Forestry Association,  
which represents the timber industry, agreed the forests need 
thinning. However, timber companies want the process to include 
more logging than the environmental groups support. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, firefighters have carved bare-earth control lines around  
some of the smaller lightning-sparked fires so they can focus on 
battling uncontrolled blazes. More than half the fires were in 
California. Others were in Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been able to handle the new starts and get a better  
handle on what they're already fighting. Things are looking better 
today,'' Janelle Smith of the National Interagency Fire Center in 
Boise, Idaho, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildfires temporarily chased hundreds of residents from their  
homes in California and Nevada early this week but have burned few 
homes. There were no mandatory evacuations in effect Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10,000 firefighters with 700 fire engines and scores  
of helicopters and air tankers battled the wildfires Friday. 
Several were sparked by lightning, and some have been burning since 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, fires have burned tens of thousands of acres in  
the Shasta-Trinity, Lassen, Klamath, Plumas, Modoc, Stanislaus and 
Angeles national forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters in Nevada battled a 7,400-acre grass fire 70 miles  
northwest of Winnemucca, a cluster of fires totaling 36,000 acres 
north of Reno, and a 2,000 acre-fire near Carson City. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oregon, a 30,000-acre brush fire burned in the Sheldon-Hart  
National Wildlife Refuge. Firefighters in Washington battled a 
350-acre blaze on the Colville Indian Reservation. And in Texas, 
fires burned 1,500 acres northwest of Lampasas and 580 acres near 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildfires earlier this week in Montana and Idaho had been  
brought under control by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists and loggers say the government should conduct  
more controlled burns and cutting to clear undergrowth that fuels 
wildfires. But government officials said the answer wouldn't be 
simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no magic solution to the condition of the forests,''  
said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Matt Mathes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our forests have gotten into their current state during 150  
years of human manipulation,'' he said. ``It will take us many 
years of thinning and prescribed burning to get the forest back to 
where it would have been if humans had not intervened.''

<HEADLINE> Stabbing Suspect Was Tossed Off Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A day before three people were stabbed aboard  
an Amtrak train in Ohio, the man charged in the knifing attack was 
removed from a Greyhound bus in Illinois as an unruly passenger, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Hall, 41, of Ontario, Calif., is being held on three  
counts of attempted murder for the Thursday assault outside of 
Cleveland. During Wednesday's bus disturbance in Princeton, Ill., 
Hall was not arrested and no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when Illinois State Police checked Hall for weapons,  
they found a pocketknife with a 2 1/2-inch blade, which they allowed 
him to keep. Olmsted Township Police Chief Dennis McCafferty said 
it apparently is the weapon used in the attack on the Amtrak train 
outside Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspect claimed the same thing there as he did here, that  
he was afraid of gang members who had a gun,'' McCafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Piszczek, appointed as Hall's attorney, was unavailable  
to comment Friday, his secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois State Police Master Sgt. Lincoln Hampton said Hall had  
boarded a bus in Iowa and was headed to Chicago. He said that on 
Interstate 80 near Princeton, 100 miles west of Chicago, the bus 
driver notified a Greyhound dispatcher that a passenger complained 
he was being threatened by four other passengers with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	A patrol trooper stopped the bus and searched the four  
passengers Hall had pointed out and then searched Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampton said no gun was found, and the passengers denied having  
threatened Hall. When Hall was searched, a pocketknife was found, 
but he was allowed to keep it because carrying a small pocketknife 
is legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then the driver asked that Mr. Hall not be returned to bus.  
Greyhound arranged for him to continue on another bus from 
Princeton,'' Hampton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanyo said Hall caught the Amtrak train in Chicago and was  
headed to New York. After the stabbings, in court, Hall told 
reporters he was trying to disarm an attacker and acted in 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall is accused of stabbing two Amtrak employees and a passenger  
on the Lake Shore Limited outside Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Two victims remained hospitalized today. Amtrak employee Michael  
Dwyer, 52, was in serious condition with a head wound. The 
passenger, John Henry Crotty, 36, of Butler, Ind., was in stable 
condition with stab wounds to his cheek and jaw, hospital officials 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Graf: Walking Away Is Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Steffi Graf came back to the U.S. Open wearing  
pumps instead of sneakers, a sleek navy blue dress instead of 
tennis whites, and a carefree smile that revealed how comfortable 
she is with her decision to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be a time when Graf will miss the game so much that  
she will change her mind, lace up again and grab her rackets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now,'' she said Saturday on the eve of the tournament  
she won five times, walking away ``seems extremely easy. I don't 
know if that's going to be the case in a few months.''

<HEADLINE>  Graf: Walking Away Is Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Steffi Graf came back to the U.S. Open wearing  
pumps instead of sneakers, a sleek navy blue dress instead of 
tennis whites, and a carefree smile that revealed how comfortable 
she is with her decision to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be a time when Graf will miss the game so much that  
she will change her mind, lace up again and grab her rackets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now,'' she said Saturday on the eve of the tournament  
she won five times, walking away ``seems extremely easy. I don't 
know if that's going to be the case in a few months.''

<HEADLINE> Forced Labor Common in Amazon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUARAI, Brazil (AP) -- These days, Lazo Martins dos Santos and  
his son know better than to accept offers of easy money clearing 
Amazon rain forest. They did last year, and had to be rescued by 
federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all their companions were so lucky.  
</P>
<P>
	``Six men tried to escape and only three were ever seen again,''  
says Santos' 17-year-old son, Jose. ``If it wasn't for the federals 
we'd probably still be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a century after slavery was abolished in Brazil,  
forced labor remains widespread, especially in the sparsely settled 
Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
	In dirt-poor towns like Guarai (pronounced gwar-aah-EE) in  
Tocantins state, 1,000 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, men like 
Ze Maria earn their living recruiting workers for big ranchers and 
plantation owners. Brazilians call such a gang boss a ``gato,'' 
Portuguese for cat. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos, Jose and 18 other men accepted job offers from Ze Maria  
back in January 1998. He gave each an advance of 30 reals ($18) -- 
to tide their wives over while they were away -- then they climbed 
into a cattle truck for the ride to the Estrela de Maceio ranch 200 
miles away in the neighboring state of Para. 
</P>
<P>
	Once out in the jungle, where roads are few and some ranches are  
the size of small nations, promises of good conditions disappeared. 
The men lived in a lean-to, drank muddy water and had to buy on 
credit everything from food to the tarpaulin they slept under. 
</P>
<P>
	When Santos asked for his pay at the end of the month, he was  
told that his advance plus the things he had purchased cost more 
than he had earned cutting trees. And, Ze Maria added, no one was 
leaving without paying off his debts. He faced down complainers at 
gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the city he's a Christian; out there he's got a gun up your  
rear end,'' Santos says. 
</P>
<P>
	Six workers fled anyway -- two came back, and only one of the  
other four was seen again. After spending nights in the jungle and 
slipping past three armed checkpoints, he reached federal 
authorities, who sent officers to free the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, when President Fernando Henrique Cardoso created the  
Special Mobile Enforcement Group to combat labor abuses, 790 
workers have been rescued from slavery-like conditions. But human 
rights defenders say the government has barely scratched the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to even learn of a slave labor situation a worker has  
to escape,'' says the Rev. Henri Burin des Roziers, a French lawyer 
and priest with the Catholic Church's Pastoral Land Commission. 
``This can mean walking 125 miles through the jungle with armed men 
on your back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debt servitude goes back to 1888, when Brazil became the last  
nation in the Western Hemisphere to outlaw slavery. Sugar and 
coffee plantation owners began bringing in European immigrants -- 
many of whom spent the rest of their lives paying off the cost of 
the trans-Atlantic voyage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1960s, the practice resurfaced in the Amazon.  
Ranchers lured destitute manual laborers from Brazil's 
drought-ridden northeast to cut down the jungle under a 
government-sponsored drive to develop the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pastoral Land Commission estimates 100,000 people a year  
were used as ``slave labor'' from the late 1960s until the 
mid-1980s, when pressure from environmentalists put an end to 
government financial incentives for cutting down jungle. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is generally believed forced labor declined  
dramatically with the end of the incentives, activists say an 
upswing in logging has revived the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is less slavery than there once was, but there's  
still so, so, so much. It's part of the culture,'' says Neide 
Cardoso Oliveira, the first federal prosecutor to win conviction of 
a rancher on slavery charges. 
</P>
<P>
	During her 18 months in Para, Oliveira managed two more  
convictions for slavery, which Brazilian law defines as any 
situation in which a worker is not paid and is physically impeded 
from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Although slavery is punishable by two to eight years in prison,  
no rancher has spent a single day in jail. Instead, their sentences 
were reduced to fines on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Worker advocates liken the punishment to a slap on the wrist and  
say it mocks the efforts of the Special Mobile Enforcement Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you talk to the landowners, they don't think there's  
anything wrong with what they're doing,'' says Claudia Ribeiro, one 
of the agency's four regional coordinators. ``The sad thing is most 
of the workers don't either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case with Manoel Luis Martins Moreira, who was  
freed from the Pantera ranch along with 12 others by Ribeiro's unit 
on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got there, some of the men took one look at the  
situation and left, but I felt that wasn't right,'' Moreira says. 
``After all, they fed us and gave us the advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, when he decided nine days later that he wanted to  
leave, the gato threatened Moreira's life and forced him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just how things are done around here,'' shrugs Diva  
Barbosa, who runs the Pantera ranch with her husband, Nivaldo. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbosa says laws requiring housing with running water and  
electricity for the workers just aren't practical on a ranch the 
size of hers. To comply, they would have to build several barracks 
around the property, or else just one barracks from which the 
workers would spend most of the day just getting to work. Neither 
approach is workable, she contends. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, she says, the workers don't appreciate what they get  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We give them an advance. We pay to bring them here and we give  
them lunch, and in the middle of the night they leave.''

<HEADLINE> Relief Agencies Assess Turkey Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- A World Bank team toured flattened areas  
of western Turkey on Saturday, assessing how much foreign aid is 
needed to help rebuild the tens of thousands of homes and lives 
ruined in last week's powerful quake. 
</P>
<P>
	With days of heavy rains adding to the misery of quake survivors  
camped out in muddy, rat-infested fields, the task of replacing 
soggy, makeshift tents with solid housing was becoming more urgent. 
Damage to houses and infrastructure from the Aug. 17 quake has been 
estimated at $10 billion, and the government says as many as 
600,000 have been left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Ajay Chhibber, the World Bank's Turkey director, said teams  
would be established in the next few days to develop reconstruction 
plans, including energy, water and transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
	But finding dry housing was the immediate order of business.  
</P>
<P>
	In Golcuk, U.S. Marines based on Navy ships in the Sea of  
Marmara began setting up 2,300 tents, all watertight and with 
flooring. The tents will house both people and supplies that had 
been left out for days in the pouring rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Turkey's leading contractors, meeting with government  
officials in Ankara on Saturday, said they could build 60,000 
prefabricated homes in three months, the Anatolia news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A 35-member team from Japan promised 1,000 prefabricated homes  
would be sent to Adapazari, where entire districts were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said his government has put off  
introducing new taxes to pay for reconstruction until October, 
partly to avoid discouraging Turks and others who want to donate 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to see what these aid campaigns from our people and  
from more than 60 countries will produce,'' he told reporters in 
Ankara, implying that new taxes may not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Government plans to boost a variety of taxes had prompted  
nationwide protests. Economists and business leaders warned the 
taxes could further increase already high inflation and induce a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The official death toll from the quake rose to 13,893 Saturday.  
Thousands of people were still missing, and most of them were 
believed buried under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those killed were trapped under the ruins of apartment  
blocks built with substandard materials by contractors who 
allegedly bribed officials to avoid inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has promised to crack down on unscrupulous  
contractors. Yalova prosecutor Metin Fadillioglu said 15 were under 
investigation in his province, where 2,400 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bolu, where 262 people died, police questioned five  
contractors, Milliyet newspaper reported Saturday. Three 
contractors were detained last week on negligence charges in 
Eskisehir. 
</P>
<P>
	Many others have reportedly fled Turkey since the quake.  
</P>
<P>
	Although those convicted of negligence resulting in death could  
receive up to 10 years in prison, Fadillioglu told Anatolia he 
expected few would receive much jail time because of allowances for 
first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Parliament gave the government more authority to deal  
with the quake's aftermath. The new authority includes powers to 
issue construction tenders and designate new residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
	It also ordered the government to ensure that any new buildings  
were earthquake-proof.

<HEADLINE> Pedroso Wins Third Long Jump Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Indoors or outdoors, it doesn't matter for  
Ivan Pedroso. The Cuban long jumper has won seven World 
Championship titles since 1993. It's the Olympics in which he's 
still winless. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedroso added his third straight outdoor title Saturday,  
overcoming muscle problems to soar 28 feet, 1 inch and earn the 
gold medal ahead of the home favorite Yago Lamela. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stirring competition, Lamela jumped 27-6 3/4. Gregor Cankar  
gave Slovenia its first World Championship medal in history by 
taking the bronze at 27-5 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he fouled out of the 1993 outdoor championships, Pedroso  
hasn't lost in the worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's had no such luck in the Olympics. In 1992 at Barcelona,  
he just missed out, finishing fourth as a 19-year-old newcomer. At 
Atlanta four years later, Pedroso was coming off hamstring surgery 
and reached the final, only to finish last. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great goal for every athlete is to win the Olympic gold  
medal. I was too young in Barcelona and I was unlucky to get 
injured before Atlanta. I hope to have better luck in Sydney next 
year,'' Pedroso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Atlanta, he has largely dominated the long jump and, at  
26, is young enough to have bigger goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from the Olympic gold, there is also the matter of Mike  
Powell's world record of 29-4 1/2 set eight years ago. Pedroso leaped 
29-4 3/4 in a meet at Sestriere, Italy in 1995, but a judge standing 
too close to the wind meter cast doubt on the legality of the jump, 
which was never recognized as a record by the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had a narrow foul on a 29-7 1/2 jump in the 1995  
Pan-American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Pedroso was just concerned with getting into the  
top eight in the first three series and hoping to save his best 
efforts for the last three jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	But a twinge in his muscle forced Pedroso to skip two of his  
last three jumps, and cut short his fifth attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	His third leap, which came close to his season-leading 28-2 3/4,  
was good enough for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my first two jumps, I was just trying to make the last  
eight. But my coach told me that I was too slow in my approach and 
I stepped it up in the third.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in good shape before the competition and I felt I could  
go 28-6 1/2 or more. But then I started feeling muscle problems and I 
couldn't really jump any better,'' Pedroso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamela, 22, leaped 27-4 1/2 in his first effort, lifted by the  
partisan capacity crowd at the Estadio Olimpico. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lamela and the crowd put some pressure on me, but I knew I had  
the gold after going over 8.50 (27-10 3/4),'' Pedroso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamela was in danger of losing the silver when the 24-year-old  
Slovenian hit 27-5 1/4 in the fourth series. But the Spaniard, who 
also took silver behind Pedroso in this winter's indoors, 
immediately replied with a 27-6 3/4 effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get a big jump at the start. I was very aggressive  
and I risked a lot,'' said Lamela, who fouled on his second and 
third jumps. ``It was a great honor to compete in front of the 
Spanish crowd, but maybe I got carried away by all the support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every time Lamela came up to jump, the crowd broke into a  
deafening shout of ``Yago! Yago!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cankar put in the most consistent series of his career, fouling  
only once and his worst jump was 26-5 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some problems in my approach. Even my best jump was not  
perfect and I felt I was capable of doing more tonight,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Activity Trays Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 100,000 activity trays and toy nets are  
being recalled following reports that young children have choked on 
suction cups used to attach them to surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled the Stroller  
Snack and Activity Trays, Bathtime Activity Trays and Bathtime Toy 
Netting -- sold by Graco Children's Products and Children on the Go. 
The federal agency said children can easily detach the suction cups 
and choke on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Graco has received reports of four choking incidents, one each  
in Wisconsin and Ohio and two in New York, commission spokeswoman 
Nychelle Fleming said Friday. In the Ohio incident, the suction cup 
was dislodged from the throat of a 7-month-old. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled items can be used with toys from the Mix 'N Move  
line and attached to strollers, bath tub tiles or other smooth 
surfaces. They were sold nationwide at discount, department and toy 
stores from January 1998 until this month for $10 to $15 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should call (800) 446-1366 to receive a free repair  
kit that will permanently attach the suction cups to the trays.

	STARA CIKATOVA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ex-Balkan troubleshooter

new U.N. ambassador, toured a mass grave site Saturday and 
declared, ``we need to remember what brought us here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke went to Stara Cikatova soon after his helicopter  
landed in Pristina, the provincial capital. The town 12 miles west 
of Pristina has a mass grave believed to contain bodies of men, 
women and children killed by the Serbs early this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights began exhuming  
bodies more than a month ago and has found about 130 so far at 
three separate but neighboring sites. But the group has problems 
identifying the bodies because of their advanced state of 
decomposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke spent about 45 minutes at the mass grave area, also  
visiting a ridge where the victims were allegedly lined up and 
shot, and talked to several villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not learning anything here that isn't in previous  
accounts,'' he told reporters. ``But to be in the physical presence 
of the events, that is different. While we are trying to forge a 
peace, we need to remember what brought us here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. diplomat is due to spend three days in Kosovo before  
going to Bosnia and Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Pristina, he said he had come to the region at the  
request of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright because ``the 
U.N. is being tested in Kosovo as it has never been tested before, 
with responsibilities greater than ever before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he planned to meet with Bernard Koucher, the chief U.N.  
administrator of Kosovo; senior commanders of the NATO-led 
peacekeeping force; Hashim Thaci, leader of the rebel Kosovo 
Liberation Army; and moderate Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim 
Rugova. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke's visit is filled with symbolism.  
</P>
<P>
	He helped broker the 1995 Dayton accords that ended the 3 1/2-year  
war in Bosnia and later served as President Clinton's special envoy 
to Yugoslavia on Kosovo, which is a province in the Yugoslav 
federation's dominant republic of Serbia. He failed to persuade 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to compromise, and 78 days of 
NATO bombing followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke comes to Kosovo amid widespread ethnic violence,  
mostly against Serbs by majority ethnic Albanians seeking to avenge 
the 18-month Serb crackdown that left about 10,000 people dead and 
hundreds of thousands temporary refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	International peacekeepers in Kosovo have been unable to stop a  
wave of revenge attacks by the ethnic Albanians -- 90 percent of 
Kosovo's prewar population of 2.1 million -- against Serbs, Gypsies 
and other non-Albanian groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In an example of the tension, a strong explosion before  
Holbrooke arrive rocked downtown Pristina, damaging a communist-era 
monument to ethnic harmony. Nobody was hurt in the pre-dawn blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Friday, international peacekeepers found the corpses of two  
women. One, a 60-year-old Serb woman, was found in the southwestern 
city of Prizren in central Kosovo. The other, unidentified and in 
her late 30s, apparently was beaten to death. No other details were 
given.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan's Assets Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy may be booming, but Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan apparently suffered a downturn in 
his own fortunes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A financial disclosure form made available Friday showed the  
value of Greenspan's assets in 1998 ranged from approximately $2.5 
million to $6.4 million, less than the range of about $3.4 million 
to $7.3 million he reported for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures are not precise because the value of each asset is  
reported using a wide range, not a specific amount. 
</P>
<P>
	In his role as the nation's chief financial policy-maker,  
Greenspan once decried ``irrational exuberance'' in financial 
markets. He opted to put all of investments into safe, short-term 
Treasury bills and none into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who was paid $136,700 last year, stayed out of the  
stock market to avoid any conflict of interest, Fed officials say. 
His words and actions and those of colleagues at the central bank 
can cause the market to soar or plummet. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his holdings, Greenspan listed one Treasury bill valued at  
more than $1 million and three Treasury bills worth between 
$500,001 and $1 million, according to the financial disclosure 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The form also showed that Greenspan sold a Norfolk Southern  
railroad bond last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has filed financial disclosure forms every year since  
he was sworn in as Federal Reserve chairman in August 1987. But 
until last year, they said simply that most of his assets were in a 
blind trust worth more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He liquidated the trust after his 1997 marriage to NBC News  
correspondent Andrea Mitchell so the couple could make joint 
financial plans, Fed officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Greenspan's holdings, his wife's portfolio is weighted  
heavily toward stocks, including holdings in Abbott Laboratories, 
H.J. Heinz Co., American Greetings Corp. and Anheuser Busch Cos. 
Inc.

<HEADLINE> Springinthecountry Wins at Calder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Springinthecountry rallied for a 2 1/4-length victory  
over Sejm's Lunar Star in the $50,000 Convenience Stakes for 
3-year-old fillies at Calder Race Course on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Veranda, the favorite, was third in the field of eight.  
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Abdiel Toribio, Springinthecountry covered 1 1-16  
miles on the turf in 1:43 and paid $8.40, $3.40 and $3. Sejm's 
Lunar Star returned $2.80 and $2.60, while Grand Veranda was $2.80 
to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Glitterman, despite bearing out in the run to the first  
turn, opened a five-length lead and still was in front by three 
lengths at the five-eighths pole with Sejm's Lunar Star seventh and 
Springinthecountry last. 
</P>
<P>
	On the far turn, Miss Glitterman faded and Grand Veranda and  
Christie Light fought for the lead. Beauty Sweet rallied on the 
outside and Springinthecountry looked for room on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Veranda, on the hedge, took a lengthy lead at the eighth  
pole with Beauty Sweet moving into second. Springinthecountry drove 
between them at the sixteenth pole and drew out. Sejm's Lunar Star 
closed fast to be second by a neck over Grand Veranda. 
</P>
<P>
	Springinthecountry is a Florida-bred by Country Pine owned by  
Ruth Goldman. She has won three of 10 starts and has finished in 
the money eight times, earning $67,835. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June 18 she was beaten in a $20,000 claiming race. The  
Convenience was her first appearance in a stakes.

<HEADLINE> Separatist's Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Organized crime convictions against  
Republic of Texas leader Richard McLaren and an associate were 
overturned by an appeals court that said there was insufficient 
evidence against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it boils down to is if you allege it you've got to prove  
it,'' said Mike Barclay, an attorney for McLaren associate Robert 
``White Eagle'' Otto. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate but nearly identical opinions issued Friday, the  
Texas 8th Court of Appeals entered judgments of acquittal for 
McLaren and Otto in connection with the kidnapping of a couple. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no showing that McLaren abducted Joe and Margaret  
Ann Rowe,'' the El Paso-based appellate court said. Prosecutors had 
argued that while McLaren was not present at the Rowes' home, he 
had plotted and directed the kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnapping preceded a weeklong standoff by the Republic of  
Texas -- which believes Texas is an independent nation -- with about 
100 law enforcement officers in the mountains of far West Texas in 
April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaren is serving a 99-year prison sentence and Otto received a  
50-year term for the kidnapping. Barclay said he plans to ask for 
bail for Otto as early as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unlikely McLaren will be released from prison any time  
soon. In addition to the state term, he was sentenced to 12 1/2 years 
in federal prison for participating in a fraudulent scheme to 
distribute $1.8 billion in worthless Republic warrants, which 
resembled cashier's checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Albert Valadez said an appeal was in the works. He  
also said McLaren and Otto could face additional charges stemming 
from the same incident, such as burglary or aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the possibility of additional charges, McLaren  
attorney Frank Brown said: ``We'll have to litigate the issue of 
double-jeopardy at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in McLaren's trial in October 1997 in Alpine showed  
that three of his followers in the Republic had stormed the Rowes' 
home in the Davis Mountains Resort and taken them hostage on April 
27, 1997. The couple, who lived near Republic members and had 
quarreled with McLaren, were taken hostage, allegedly in 
retaliation for the arrest of another Republic member, Robert 
Scheidt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rowes were held hostage in their own home for more than 12  
hours before they were exchanged for Scheidt. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostage-taking touched off a standoff between McLaren and  
other Republic members and scores of state troopers, who laid siege 
to the group's remote resort 175 miles southeast of El Paso until 
the group surrendered a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Months later, McLaren and Otto were convicted of engaging in  
organized criminal activity -- essentially participating in a 
conspiracy -- to commit aggravated kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Republic members contend the U.S. annexation of Texas in 1845  
was illegal and refuse to recognize Texas' statehood and 
institutions, including the court system. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, McLaren and Otto represented themselves and treated  
the proceedings as a sham. After the prosecution rested, they asked 
their standby court-appointed counsel to file motions for a 
mistrial and for directed verdicts of acquittal. The judge denied 
both and a jury eventually took less than two hours to convict.

<HEADLINE> 1939 Boys of Summer Reunite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- The only home they aim to reach these  
days is their own and they are more likely to catch a cold than a 
fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, 18 of the 30 boys who played in Little League's  
first season in 1939, had vivid and fond memories of their days on 
the baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a real camaraderie,'' Peter Smith recalled Friday as  
the men gathered for a reunion on the eve of the Little League 
World Series championship game. ``We couldn't wait for our games. 
</P>
<P>
	Little League was founded in this town with three teams and 30  
players. The Little League World Series for 11- and 12-year-olds 
started in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a retired businessman from Dayton, Ohio, played for a  
team in nearby Lycoming. Before Little League his games were played 
on sandlots without the benefit of uniforms and standard fields. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Charles, recalled helping league founder Carl Stoz  
measure the basepaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember running the bases to see they were right,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Smith, who lives in York, also thinks he and his  
teammates were more driven than their modern counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had more desire to win. We only had 10 players so it was  
the only the best who played,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said it was ``very competitive,'' even more so than today.  
</P>
<P>
	Though for many of the players Little League was the pinnacle of  
their ball playing, Al Yearick went on. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Boston Braves and spent five years in the  
minor leagues. But he recalls his Little League experience as a 
turning point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my first opportunity to play with official bats and  
uniforms as opposed to the stuff we played with on the sandlots,'' 
he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks today's players have it easier.  
</P>
<P>
	``The equipment is so much better than what we had. The  
biological makeup of the kids is different. They are bigger and 
stronger,'' Yearick said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Frazier, a former outfielder who organized the reunion  
with Yearick, said money has changed baseball for the worse, even 
among kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to play every day for fun and that was all. Now they  
want something more,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Heyns, Krayzelburg Break Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Records don't stand a chance in the  
pool that will be the site for the next Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's Penny Heyns and American Lenny Krayzelburg were  
the latest to topple world marks Saturday in the Pan Pacific swim 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns broke her eighth breaststroke world record in 11 swims and  
Krayzelburg set his third backstroke mark of the meet in special 
50-meter time trials organized around the main program. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve records have been broken -- at least one in seven straight  
days -- in the pool that will be used for the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns set up a 50 time trial during the morning heats and  
Krayzelburg did the same in tackling the 50 backstroke at the end 
of the finals session. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns' time of 30.83 seconds beat her 30.95 set in the Goodwill  
Games at New York last August. Krayzelburg's 24.99 beat the 25.13 
set by fellow American Jeff Rouse before the event was given world 
record status two years ago by FINA, the governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about it a couple of days ago and they pretty much  
told me it was up to me,'' Krayzelburg said. ``I thought about it 
after the 100 when I went out in 25.9, and that was pretty close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa enjoyed a double celebration as Brendon Dedekind  
edged Olympic silver medalist Gary Hall Jr. and world champion Bill 
Pilczuk in the 50 free to claim the country's first gold by a male 
swimmer in the PanPacs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I only breathed once,'' the exhausted Dedekind said. ``I  
usually breathe twice, but I saw Gary there so I thought I better 
only breathe once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dedekind's 22.06 matched the fifth-fastest by a man with  
Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband, who had a 22.06 in the European 
Championships earlier this month. Hall was clocked in 22.26 and 
Pilczuk finished in 22.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Klim, the 100 butterfly world record-holder, couldn't  
improve his time of 52.15 but was happy just to beat fellow 
Australian Geoff Huegill and take a fourth gold of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Klim, the world champion, finished second and was behind until  
the last few strokes before touching first in 52.49, ahead of 
Huegill's 52.51. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the plan for me tonight, to finish strong in the last  
six strokes,'' said Klim, who also won the 100 freestyle and two 
relays. ``That's where I thought it was going to be won and that's 
how it turned out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Brooke Bennett continued her reign in the 800  
freestyle, cruising to a victory in a personal-best 8:25.06, 
10th-best in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett won the gold medal in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and  
followed with victories in the 1997 PanPacs and last year's world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's World Student Games champion Tomoko Hagiwara held off  
national record holder Miki Nakao in the 200 backstroke for the 
country's second gold. Mai Nakamura, who won a gold in the 100, 
failed to reach the 200 final. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time Olympic 1,500-meter champion Kieren Perkins might have  
competed in his last international race after failing to qualify 
for Sunday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	The world record holder, whose campaign was derailed by illness,  
was beaten by Craig Stevens in Saturday's first heat. Perkins and 
Stevens then watched world champion Grant Hackett better their 
times in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins' time of 15:28.43 was almost 47 seconds slower than the  
world record of 14:41.66 he set in the 1994 Commonwealth Games. It 
was his worst time in nine years.

<HEADLINE> Union Recommends New Boeing Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Machinists union is urging its 44,000 Boeing  
Co. workers to accept the company's new contract offer, which one 
union official called the best in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of strike threats, Boeing officials relented on two  
of the most contentious issues -- job security and a company plan to 
end overtime pay for weekend work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this contract is the best contract in the aerospace  
industry,'' Bill Johnson, president of Machinists District Lodge 
751, told union members Saturday morning. Though he added, ``I wish 
we could have negotiated better language on job security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow union members who stopped by the Seattle headquarters to  
read the 44-month contract offer were reacting positively, said Tom 
Lux, who was handing out summaries. He predicted it would pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great! All of it!'' declared Robert MacDuff, 53, a  
Boeing worker from Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend work was ``a strike issue,'' he said. ``If they had gone  
to that, this company would have been shut down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal keeps the traditional work week, meaning workers  
would continue to be paid overtime for working on weekends; it has 
no increase in worker fees for medical benefits; and it includes a 
25 percent increase in pension benefits, a 10 percent signing bonus 
and annual wage increases of 4 percent, 4 percent and 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also allows review by union member of proposals to contract  
work to outside companies. The company, however, retains the right 
to decide when to contract out work. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers will decide if they agree with Johnson on Wednesday  
-- the day their current contract expires. A majority vote in favor 
would ratify the contract. A two-thirds majority would be required 
in a separate vote to authorize a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Many union members, like Cliff Standfill, a 20-year Boeing  
employee in Renton, Wash., said job security was the most important 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a money issue,'' Standfill said. ``It never has  
been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the company promised that no employees would be  
laid off because of contracting out work. The company's offer also 
would provide 180 days' notice when work is to be contracted out 
and establish a joint committee to review such proposals, but the 
company would still make the final decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal summary said the no-layoff promise does not apply  
to offsets, a practice of assigning jobs to workers chosen by 
airplane customers, such as China. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson praised Boeing Chairman Phil Condit as a ``visionary''  
who understands union members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a whole bunch we've got to do,'' Condit said  
Saturday as he shook hands with Johnson at a news conference. ``If 
we work together, we can make this place tremendously competitive, 
and that's what we're after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the negotiations, Condit said cost was the bottom line  
for Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, and he 
emphasized the company's competition from European rival Airbus 
Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is undertaking a massive job cut program to reduce its  
work force from a high of 238,000 in June 1998 to between 185,000 
and 195,000 by the end of next year. The Seattle-based company 
currently employs about 206,000 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done our best, and I think we've delivered an agreement  
that our employees ... will at the end of the day find very, very 
attractive,'' Boeing lead negotiator Jerry Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Machinists struck Boeing in two of their last three  
negotiations, including a 69-day strike in 1995. Boeing workers in 
Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan., had voted informally in 
July to support another strike if negotiations failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contract covers 31,000 workers in Washington state,  
1,400 in Portland and 11,600 in Wichita. The average machinist at 
Boeing earns $40,000 a year, not counting benefits or overtime.

<HEADLINE> Bodybuilders Stripped of Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Six bodybuilders were stripped of their  
medals at the Arab Games on Saturday after testing positive for 
muscle-building steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Substances that showed up in the tests were Nandrolone,  
Metenolone, Stanozolol and testasterone, according to Reda Kazem, 
head of the Arab Games Doping Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the bodybuilders tested positive for more than one  
steroid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time that bodybuilding was included in the  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug-control committee targeted bodybuilders because the  
Arab Union of Bodybuilders, preparing for the Sydney Olympics, 
wanted to show that its competitors were clean, Kazem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing their gold medals were Iraq's Asad Jaafar and Zahi Ammar  
of Algeria. Egyptian Ahmad el-Sayed and Lebanon's Yousef al-Zein 
lost their silver medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's Bilal Abu Rajuh and Lebanese Mahmood Shukair had to  
give back bronze medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazem said four athletes tested positive for Nandrolone, which  
has shown up in a rash of tests in recent months in other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug testing was introduced in the Arab Games for the first time  
in 1997 when the event was held in Beirut, Lebanon. Twelve athletes 
tested positive for banned substances during those games.

<HEADLINE> Priest Fights Slavery in Amazon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	XINGUARA, Brazil (AP) -- It's been so long since the Catholic  
Church was the leading voice against labor abuses in the Amazon 
that locals say ``pistoleiros'' don't even know what to charge for 
killing a troublesome priest. 
</P>
<P>
	That might be why the Rev. Henri Burin des Roziers is still  
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true, the church has become a lot less active in social  
issues,'' says des Roziers, a French Dominican friar and lawyer. 
``It has made my work more difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For two decades, he has worked with the church's Pastoral Land  
Commission, denouncing forced labor and other abusive working 
conditions in the southern Amazon. It's a largely lawless frontier 
region where disputes are often settled by ``pistoleiros'' -- gunmen 
who have a sliding fee scale for killings depending on the target. 
</P>
<P>
	While des Roziers and a few others still crusade against forced  
labor, they have lost the support of many local parishes. When he 
asks local clergymen to watch for penniless people asking for food 
because they might be fleeing from slavery, many priests don't want 
to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Undeterred, des Roziers continues to document cases and navigate  
Brazil's labyrinthine legal system to bring them before often 
corrupt courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good legal work may not win the case, but it brings political  
pressure on the authorities to act,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Des Roziers now is preparing to appeal a $1.4 million award to  
rancher Luis Martins Pereira as compensation for land seized by 
authorities after 220 forced laborers were freed from his Flor da 
Mata ranch in southern Para state. He purchased the land for just 
$57,000 three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the slaves were freed, the Agriculture Minister said the  
ranch would be confiscated as punishment,'' des Roziers says. ``But 
after half a dozen congressmen and three senators flew down to 
Brasilia (the federal capital), Pereira ended up making a profit.''

<HEADLINE> Letter Details Battle of Midway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For decades, as chroniclers of the battle that  
turned the tide of World War II in the Pacific second-guessed Vice 
Adm. Stanhope Cotton Ring, his voice was silent. He had locked it 
away in his sea chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Navy commander who lost 27 aircraft from a 60-plane  
squadron in the confusion of the early hours of the Battle of 
Midway speaks from the grave about what went wrong. It's all there 
in a 22-page, handwritten letter dated March 28, 1946, and only 
recently discovered in a sea chest by his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been much written about the Battle of Midway, and in  
many respects there has been a startling lack of accuracy,'' begins 
Ring, who died in 1963. ``This is an attempt, almost four years 
after the action, to set down in black and white my best 
recollections of what occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was early on June 4, 1942, when Ring led his air wing from  
the carrier USS Hornet in one of the first forays against a 
four-carrier Japanese task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Of his 60 planes, 45 never saw the Japanese armada, and many ran  
out of fuel and crashed into the sea. The 15 that engaged the 
enemy, a squadron of slow and defenseless Devastator torpedo 
bombers flying without fighter protection, were picked off one by 
one by Japanese Zeros without making a single hit on the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 15 torpedo bombers, 10 fighters and two dive  
bombers were lost. The two fighter pilots and 29 of the 30 pilots 
and radio operators of the torpedo bombers died. 
</P>
<P>
	On returning to the Hornet, Ring found only 18 Douglas Dauntless  
scout bombers had made it back; 15 of the 17 dive bombers landed on 
Midway island and later were able to return to action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shaken at the realization of such losses,'' Ring wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	None of the major historians of the battle talked with Ring  
about his role, but their near-unanimous verdict was that his 
planes lost their way. The line of reasoning held that his 
inability to attack in the battle's crucial early hours caused 
greater American losses than necessary, including the carrier USS 
Yorktown. 
</P>
<P>
	Ring, the Hornet's senior aviator whose air wing accounted for  
one-third of the strike force at Midway, admits to a mistaken 
assessment of a murky situation. 
</P>
<P>
	His letter makes clear, however, that ``he was never lost at  
all'' said Navy Capt. Bruce Linder, who edited and annotated the 
letter for the Annapolis, Md.,-based Naval Institute. ``Those that 
jumped to that oversimplification lost the true significance of the 
complexity of the fledgling level of naval aviation in the early 
1940s'' when navigation and communications methods were poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Lost Letter of Midway'' was published in the U.S. Naval  
Institute's monthly ``Proceedings'' magazine in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Ring's planes, along with the air group from the USS Enterprise,  
were to fly under radio silence to a location near Midway where the 
Japanese carriers were expected, with their planes away attacking 
U.S. installations at Midway. The undefended carriers would have 
been easy targets -- if only they had been there. 
</P>
<P>
	When he didn't see the carriers, Ring said he ``decided that I  
should proceed on the assumption that the enemy was closing Midway 
and directed the course of the (planes) accordingly'' toward the 
island. ``My change of Air Group course to the south was based 
entirely on my estimate of the situation (which proved faulty) and 
not on definite information of the enemy movements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese had learned of the approaching American naval force  
and had turned to the northeast to find it, a 90-degree angle from 
Ring's course. 
</P>
<P>
	Approaching Midway, Ring saw smoke but no enemy and decided  
``immediate return to the carrier was necessary ... since fuel 
supply was running low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ring picked up an unfamiliar homing signal -- the code had been  
changed, and Hornet had not received word -- and signaled his planes 
to ignore the beacon and return by dead reckoning. His scout 
bombers followed him, but the dive bombers and fighters did not. He 
tried to turn them back, ``but I could not catch them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I finally gave up the chase, VS-8 had disappeared from  
sight and VB-8 was apparently headed for Midway,'' he said of the 
plane groups. 
</P>
<P>
	His analysis of what went wrong -- mainly communication problems  
and an inexperienced crew -- agree with the evaluation of Adm. 
Chester W. Nimitz, the Pacific commander in chief, who wrote in his 
official report that the battle illustrated a need for better 
training for land and sea forces and more effective communication. 
</P>
<P>
	The torpedo bombers turned northward and chanced upon the  
Japanese carriers at roughly the same time as the Enterprise 
aviators. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Cmdr. John Waldron, commanding the Devastators,  
``courageously and in the face of certain destruction led his 
command in a torpedo attack against the enemy,'' Ring wrote. By 
tying up the Zeros in defending their carriers against the 
torpedoes, Waldron's attack allowed dive bombers from Enterprise to 
mortally wound three of the Japanese carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole survivor of the Hornet torpedo crews was Ens. George  
Gay, a pilot who clung to a seat cushion as war swirled about him. 
He was picked up 30 hours later and reported having thought to 
himself during his ordeal: ``It's the end of the world, and I have 
a grandstand seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gay died four years ago, and his ashes were put into the Pacific  
on Aug. 31, 1995, at the spot where his comrades died 53 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans eventually prevailed at Midway.  
</P>
<P>
	During the three-day battle, an outnumbered U.S. force sank all  
four Japanese carriers and a heavy cruiser, put another cruiser out 
of action and destroyed more than 250 planes and some of the 
Japanese Navy's most experienced combat pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle 1,100 miles west of Hawaii ended Japan's early  
advance through the Pacific toward the American territory and put 
the Allies on course to Japan's surrender on Sept. 2, 1945.

<HEADLINE> Burn 1, Galaxy 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ariel Graziani's goal in the 54th minute gave the  
Dallas Burn a 1-0 victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Graziani, the Ecuadorian forward acquired by the Burn in a trade  
from New England, has scored three goals in as many games with 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Burn midfielder Temoc Suarez pushed the ball forward from the  
outside of the Galaxy penalty area. Graziani collected the ball, 
split the LA defense and chipped the ball over Kevin Hartman into 
the back of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy had several opportunities late in the second half. In  
the 64th minute, midfielder Roy Myers had the ball directly in 
front of the Dallas net following a long cross by teammate Mauricio 
Cienfuegos. Myers fired a quick shot, but Jordan was able to make 
the save. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, Cienfuegos missed the net by inches when his  
23-yard free kick passed over the upper left corner of the net.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Releases Education Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton took another  
opportunity Saturday to denounce the Republicans' $792 billion 
tax-cut package as unacceptably risky, this time calling it a 
threat to the future of public education. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address, Clinton also announced $95 million  
in aid for charter schools and endorsed the education idea as 
``freer of red tape and top-down management'' than traditional 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton contrasted the tax-cut plan with what he called the  
education successes of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charter schools are living proof of what parents and teachers  
can do to reinvigorate public education. Investing in them means 
investing in accountability and excellence and a much better future 
for our children,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But just as our children are returning to class, the  
Republicans' risky tax-cut plan would undermine these investments 
by forcing deep and irresponsible cuts to education and other 
national priorities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grants include $41 million for 19 states, the District of  
Columbia and Puerto Rico to fund the first of three-year grants for 
new charter schools. Another $54 million will go to existing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter schools are often created by concerned parents or  
teachers and operate with a charter from a public agency. 
Supporters say such schools offer solutions to problems weighing on 
public classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one charter school existed nationally when Clinton took  
office in 1993, he said. Now there are more than 1,700, and the 
administration hopes to help foster 3,000 by 2001, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charter schools offer parents and students more choice in the  
kinds of public education available to them, coupled with public 
accountability,'' Education Secretary Richard Riley said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, meanwhile, accused Clinton of playing politics with  
Americans' money by threatening to veto the tax cuts that 
congressional Republicans passed earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining a list of Republican governors and members of Congress  
who have touted the proposed reductions in the GOP's weekly radio 
address, Arizona Gov. Jane Hull questioned Clinton's plan to veto 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He either has a deep-seated desire to increase government  
spending, or he just does not want to give the money back to the 
people who earned it in the first place,'' she said. ``President 
Clinton is playing politics with your money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton typically tapes the radio address in advance. But he  
delivered the brief speech live Saturday at Edgartown School before 
an audience of Martha's Vineyard residents who helped White House 
staff and reporters during the Clintons' vacation this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton family then left the island for a house-hunting trip  
to Westchester County, N.Y., near New York City, and a weekend of 
fund-raising parties in the wealthy seashore suburbs of Long 
Island.

<HEADLINE> Vermont Town Had 1 Crime Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANBY, Vt. (AP) -- Town Clerk Nellie Noble didn't know. Neither  
did Jeff Brown, who took a break from building Granby's first store 
to ponder the question. Betty Brown, his cousin who lives just down 
the road, shut off her lawnmower to think. She didn't know, either. 
</P>
<P>
	So just what was Granby's only crime of 1998?  
</P>
<P>
	State police, court record-keepers, the local game warden, the  
Essex County sheriff's dispatcher: None of them had any idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there it is. Of 73,370 crimes reported in the state last  
year, Granby tallied one: a fraud, recorded without elaboration in 
Vermont's 1998 crime report. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably isn't anybody from Granby,'' Noble said. ``Who  
knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown thought he did. Someone stole his father's pickup truck,  
but Brown saw the perpetrator maneuver across the lawn and called 
the sheriff, who caught him on the road out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	But the thief was from nearby Lancaster, N.H.  
</P>
<P>
	And it wasn't last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only crime I know of here,'' Brown said. And he  
means in the 38 years, his entire life, he's lived in the northeast 
Vermont town. 
</P>
<P>
	Granby -- population roughly 90 -- is the essence of small town,  
where almost everyone is related and even those who aren't know 
each other like cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are used to going into other people's homes and taking  
things out of the cupboard,'' says Betty Brown, who married into 
one of the community's longtime families 25 years ago. ``Then we'll 
call them up later and tell them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isolation keeps Granby tight-knit. It takes a 20-minute drive  
over potholed roads to reach a state highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Granby also boasts one of the state's last one-room elementary  
schools. It has one teacher and nine students. For the annual class 
trip, the whole town is invited, and most people go. The town 
supports school clubs and the church, and although there isn't much 
speeding, donations from residents bought a used radar gun for 
Sheriff Amos Colby. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime is simply not something Granby residents think about.  
</P>
<P>
	``We did have a camp in Granby where there was a party going on.  
We had to resolve that and take some people back to (jail in) St. 
Johnsbury,'' Colby said. 
</P>
<P>
	When?  
</P>
<P>
	``Eight or nine years ago.''  
</P>
<P>
	It took Colby most of a day to track down the details of last  
year's crime. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 9, 1998, a man wrote Fred Hodgdon a $300 check for six  
piglets. The check bounced, and the man couldn't be found. The case 
remains open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think nothing about that,'' Hodgdon said.  
</P>
<P>
	He could well be Granby's lone crime victim for 1999 as well,  
but it won't appear in the state crime report. Hodgdon didn't 
report it. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a woman bought four piglets from him and paid  
cash. He didn't count the money until later when he discovered he'd 
been shorted by half. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident didn't shake his faith in people or his hometown.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't trade it for any other place,'' he says. ``If they  
wanted something, I'd give it to them.

<HEADLINE>  Gymnastics Champ To Play Dual Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- John Roethlisberger had just completed  
a remarkable comeback to the U.S. gymnastics team. Yet he realized 
performing on the floor will be only one of the roles he'll have to 
play on the national squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, 29, a four-time national champion in the early  
1990s, placed second in the all-around competition Friday night to 
make the national team less than a year after reconstructive 
surgery on his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to performing, he expects to act as mentor and  
emotional guide for Jason Gatson, one of the nation's top male 
gymnasts who tore a ligament in his right knee Friday night while 
leading the all-around competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, 18, whose knee buckled as he dismounted from the  
horizontal bar, is expected to have surgery in the next few weeks. 
He flew back to the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., on Saturday for further examination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about what my role would be in these four years  
after 1996. Maybe that's one of the things I need to do is to help 
Jason,'' Roethlisberger said. ``I know how he's feeling right now. 
There's not much of a worse feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women were set to compete in individual events Saturday on  
the closing night of the U.S. Gymnastics Championships. Kristen 
Maloney won the women's all-around title Thursday, edging Vanessa 
Atler for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaine Wilson captured an unprecedented fourth straight men's  
national all-around title with a nearly flawless performance in 
Friday's finals after Gatson hurt himself on the night's opening 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's overall score of 115.300 points made him the first man  
to win four national titles since Roethlisberger won in 1990, '92, 
'93 and '95. But he was not interested in celebrating -- instead, he 
was thinking of Gatson, his training partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably spend most of my time seeing how he's doing,''  
Wilson said. ``Jason obviously is a big link in our team. He will 
be missed, but he will be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger finished second with a score of 111.800. Brett  
McClure was third with 111.500. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 14 men and 14 women in the all-around competition  
qualify for the World Championships team trials, to be held Sept. 
15-18 in Kansas City. That event will help choose the American 
squad for the World Gymnastics Championships Oct. 8-16 in Tianjin, 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, who finished second in 1996 and '98 and was third in the  
national championships in 1997, held a slim lead over Wilson at the 
start of the all-around finals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But his right knee buckled as he flew off the high bar, and he  
fell to the side of the mat. After getting iced on the competition 
floor, he was helped to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson was second in the national all-around competition in 1996  
and '98, losing both times to Wilson. He was third in 1997 behind 
Wilson and Roethlisberger. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury threatens to keep one of the United States' most  
promising male gymnasts out of the Sydney Olympics, though Gatson 
predicted he will return from the injury in time for the 2000 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I landed, something popped and I just fell to the  
ground, it hurt so bad. I knew something happened, because it was a 
loud pop. My knee just went out on me,'' Gatson said. ``This is 
going to make me stronger. I am going to get it fixed and I am 
going to come back and be on the Olympic team in Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, who competed with a leg brace at the  
championships and wore three huge ice packs on his legs during a 
post-competition news conference, said he's also confident Gatson 
will be fully healed before the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be back, no problem, I guarantee,'' Roethlisberger said.  
``It's going to be a tough year for him. But for sure he's going to 
be back up here next year.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson: Not Getting Respect Earned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- In a way, Michael Johnson is similar to  
Babe Ruth, and he doesn't get nearly as much credit for his 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twice, Michael predicted what he was going to do,'' coach  
Clyde Hart said Friday, ``just like Babe Ruth did when he said he 
was going to hit a home run for the little boy in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Atlanta (at the 1996 Olympics), he said he was going to  
double (in the 200 and 400 meters) and do something special,'' Hart 
added, referring to Johnson's astonishing world record of 19.32 
seconds for the 200. ``This year, he said he wanted to win the 
world championship and set a world record -- and he did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the sign of a great athlete.''  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's athletic greatness is unquestionable. He has won three  
Olympic gold medals, a record-tying eight gold medals at the World 
Championships and is only the second man to hold world records in 
the 200 and 400 simultaneously, joining Tommie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for track and field's most outstanding athlete of  
the decade, he has been unduly criticized often. Johnson and Hart 
feel the criticism is unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson doesn't even think his latest feat, breaking Butch  
Reynolds' 11-year-old record of 43.29 in the 400 with a remarkable 
43.18 Thursday night at the World Championships, will silence 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to say whatever they want,'' he said. ``I  
need to try not to let it get to me. This year, I let it get to me 
a little more, but I was able to regroup and get back to what I do 
best and that's keeping my mouth shut and running on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What rankled Johnson and Hart most were insinuations during the  
USA Championships at Eugene, Ore., in June that the sprint great 
was ducking 100-meter world record-holder Maurice Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were supposed to meet in a much-hyped 200 showdown at  
the championships, but Johnson withdrew at the last minute because 
of a chronic hip alignment problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime Michael doesn't run against Maurice, people say he's  
ducking Maurice,'' Hart said. ``When Maurice doesn't run against 
Michael, people don't write that Maurice is ducking Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said his next race would be a 200 at Brussels, Belgium,  
on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Maurice wants to come there and run, fine,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson will complete his season with another 200 at Rieti,  
Italy, on Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he will rest before beginning preparations for another  
200-400 double at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The usually unflappable Johnson almost didn't get to the World  
Championships. He became so frustrated after being forced to stop 
in mid-race during a 200 at Stockholm on July 30 that he was ready 
to end his season then. 
</P>
<P>
	``That brought him to the low edge,'' Hart said. ``He was  
depressed, he was down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart convinced him to continue, telling him he could whip him  
into shape by the championships and that he could break the 400 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Johnson wanted to run at the lucrative Golden League meet  
at Zurich, Switzerland, on Aug. 11. Hart, who has coached Johnson 
for 14 years, didn't think that was the smartest move, and told 
Johnson to keep training. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave him a rigorous schedule of 12 workouts in 13 days, doing  
a series of 350-meter runs with little rest in between. Those tough 
workouts continued after Johnson arrived in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Johnson ran his first-round heat last Sunday, he was  
ready mentally and physically. His attitude toward running changed 
completely, going from sour to sweet, and his health was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	As each round of the 400 unfolded, it was evident he was primed  
for a memorable performance. He gave it Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	People noticed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael looked super,'' said Mel Rosen, the U.S. men's Olympic  
coach in 1992. ``He looks like he can do anything he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This record will last 20 years. The 200 record will last 50  
years. The 200 is a better record than the 400.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Williams, the U.S. men's coach at the World  
Championships, was impressed with Johnson's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been coaching more than 28 years, and that's one of the  
best races I've ever seen,'' he said. ``Not only in the 
quarter-mile, but any race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scintillating victory triggered calls for a match race  
between Johnson and Greene, the world's two fastest sprinters, 
similar to the highly hyped duel between Johnson and Donovan Bailey 
in 1997. During that race, Johnson tore his right quadriceps muscle 
and didn't finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Hart scotched the latest suggestion.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anything for me to gain from it,''  
Johnson said. ``Leave those for the Olympic trials and Olympic 
Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the Bailey race ``infamous,'' Hart said Johnson still  
has repercussions from the quad injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sometimes feels it when he's running slow,'' Hart said.  
``It's taken him two years to get his conditioning back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Johnson's conditioning holds up into next year's Olympics,  
he'll probably go for the 400 record in a quest for an 
unprecedented double-double in the sprints. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps two world records in his two Olympic specialties and his  
second straight sweep would finally give him the recognition he 
deserves.

<HEADLINE>  Gymnastics Champ To Play Dual Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- John Roethlisberger had just completed  
a remarkable comeback to the U.S. gymnastics team. Yet he realized 
performing on the floor will be only one of the roles he'll have to 
play on the national squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, 29, a four-time national champion in the early  
1990s, placed second in the all-around competition Friday night to 
make the national team less than a year after reconstructive 
surgery on his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to performing, he expects to act as mentor and  
emotional guide for Jason Gatson, one of the nation's top male 
gymnasts who tore a ligament in his right knee Friday night while 
leading the all-around competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, 18, whose knee buckled as he dismounted from the  
horizontal bar, is expected to have surgery in the next few weeks. 
He flew back to the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., on Saturday for further examination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about what my role would be in these four years  
after 1996. Maybe that's one of the things I need to do is to help 
Jason,'' Roethlisberger said. ``I know how he's feeling right now. 
There's not much of a worse feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women were set to compete in individual events Saturday on  
the closing night of the U.S. Gymnastics Championships. Kristen 
Maloney won the women's all-around title Thursday, edging Vanessa 
Atler for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaine Wilson captured an unprecedented fourth straight men's  
national all-around title with a nearly flawless performance in 
Friday's finals after Gatson hurt himself on the night's opening 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's overall score of 115.300 points made him the first man  
to win four national titles since Roethlisberger won in 1990, '92, 
'93 and '95. But he was not interested in celebrating -- instead, he 
was thinking of Gatson, his training partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably spend most of my time seeing how he's doing,''  
Wilson said. ``Jason obviously is a big link in our team. He will 
be missed, but he will be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger finished second with a score of 111.800. Brett  
McClure was third with 111.500. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 14 men and 14 women in the all-around competition  
qualify for the World Championships team trials, to be held Sept. 
15-18 in Kansas City. That event will help choose the American 
squad for the World Gymnastics Championships Oct. 8-16 in Tianjin, 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, who finished second in 1996 and '98 and was third in the  
national championships in 1997, held a slim lead over Wilson at the 
start of the all-around finals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But his right knee buckled as he flew off the high bar, and he  
fell to the side of the mat. After getting iced on the competition 
floor, he was helped to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson was second in the national all-around competition in 1996  
and '98, losing both times to Wilson. He was third in 1997 behind 
Wilson and Roethlisberger. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury threatens to keep one of the United States' most  
promising male gymnasts out of the Sydney Olympics, though Gatson 
predicted he will return from the injury in time for the 2000 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I landed, something popped and I just fell to the  
ground, it hurt so bad. I knew something happened, because it was a 
loud pop. My knee just went out on me,'' Gatson said. ``This is 
going to make me stronger. I am going to get it fixed and I am 
going to come back and be on the Olympic team in Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, who competed with a leg brace at the  
championships and wore three huge ice packs on his legs during a 
post-competition news conference, said he's also confident Gatson 
will be fully healed before the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be back, no problem, I guarantee,'' Roethlisberger said.  
``It's going to be a tough year for him. But for sure he's going to 
be back up here next year.''

<HEADLINE>  Facts About Top Seeds at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A quick look at the seeded players in the U.S.  
Open tennis championships being played Aug. 30-Sept. 12 at the USTA 
National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows: 
</P>
<P>
                              *Women    	
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 1 Martina Hingis    	
</P>
<P>
	Although she won the Australian Open in January and has regained  
the No. 1 ranking, Martina Hingis is trying to put her winning game 
back together after losing the French Open final to Steffi Graf, 
then being shocked by Jelena Dokic in the first round at Wimbledon. 
While she is still a marvelous all-court player with great 
anticipation and every shot in the book, other players are finding 
ways to beat Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 2 Lindsay Davenport    	
</P>
<P>
	The defending U.S. Open champion, the 6-foot-2, 175-pound  
right-hander won her second Grand Slam tournament title in 
impressive fashion, beating Steffi Graf in the Wimbledon final. 
While she hasn't dominated the hard court circuit this year, 
Davenport comes into the U.S. Open full of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 3 Venus Williams    	
</P>
<P>
	Venus has the game to win it all: huge serve, big forehand,  
penetrating backhand, quick feet, great range. And neither Venus 
nor her sister, seventh-seeded Serena, lack confidence. She has 
wins over all the top players, but not in the biggest tournaments 
of all, the majors. Perhaps this is the year. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 4. Monica Seles    	
</P>
<P>
	Once the dominating force in women's tennis, Seles has shown  
that she can again be a factor in the big tournaments. But she now 
stands on or behind the baseline instead of inside, her angles 
aren't quite as sharp, nor does she seem to hit the ball as hard. 
That, however, could be because everyone else is hitting the ball 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 5. Mary Pierce    	
</P>
<P>
	One of the hardest hitters in women's tennis, Pierce has always  
been hampered by her lack of mobility. The French woman, who has 
had a series of nagging injuries, has yet to win a title in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 6 Amanda Coetzer    	
</P>
<P>
	It's sometimes hard to figure out how this little South African  
-- she stands only 5-foot-2 -- can be ranked so high. And while she 
has yet to win a Grand Slam tournament, Coetzer's consistency, hard 
work and doggedness means she always around when the quarterfinals 
are played. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 7 Serena Williams    	
</P>
<P>
	Father Richard Williams said Serena will eventually be the  
better of the two Williams sisters. She has won three tournaments 
this year, posting victories over the top players. It's lack of 
experience that could keep her out of the winner's circle at 
Flushing Meadow until the next century. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 8 Jana Novotna    	
</P>
<P>
	Winning Wimbledon in 1998 was the apex of her career, and she  
has since played that way. One of the few serve-and-volleyers in 
the women's game, at age 30 Novotna is a half-step slower and more 
error-prone with her forehand. 
</P>
<P>
                     *No. 9 Julie Halard-Decugis    	
</P>
<P>
	Has been consistent this year. And her experience gives her an  
edge over players with more weapons. 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 10 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario    	
</P>
<P>
	Like Coetzer, the 5-6 1/2 Sanchez-Vicario's forte has been her  
running down every shot and making her opponent hit yet another. 
But she seems to have lost a half-step and doesn't have a weapon to 
really hurt her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 11 Nathalie Tauziat    	
</P>
<P>
	Late in her career -- she's 31 -- the French woman has found  
success. But her game won't stand up to the power or the craftiness 
of the top teen-agers in the field. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 12 Barbara Schett    	
</P>
<P>
	An Austrian right-hander, Schett is capable of upsetting some of  
the top players, but not enough of them to win the U.S. 0pen. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 13 Dominique Van Roost    	
</P>
<P>
	Van Roost last year became the first Belgian to be ranked in the  
world's Top 10. This year the right-hander reached the 
quarterfinals at the Australian Open and the fourth round at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 14 Sandrine Testud    	
</P>
<P>
	While dangerous, this French woman is not considered a contender  
in the year's final major. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 15 Amelie Mauresmo    	
</P>
<P>
	A French left-hander with heavy ground strokes, Mauresmo was a  
surprising finalist at the Australian Open in January. She won't 
get that far at Flushing Meadow. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 16 Conchita Martinez    	
</P>
<P>
	This Spaniard's big topspin shots took her to the Wimbledon  
title five years ago, and she has twice reached the semifinals of 
the U.S. Open. Her chances of doing it again, however, are growing 
slim. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Men    	
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 1 Pete Sampras    	
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras is going after history. He tied Roy Emerson by  
winning his 12th Grand Slam tournament men's singles title when he 
captured Wimbledon for the sixth time in July. Sampras has the 
game, the temperament and the confidence to win his fifth U.S. Open 
crown, although he is coming into the tournament after suffering a 
strained hip flexor. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 2 Andre Agassi    	
</P>
<P>
	When he won the French Open in June, Agassi became only the  
fifth man to win all four Grand Slam tournaments in a career, and 
the first American since Don Budge won all four in 1938. Agassi 
then reached the final at Wimbledon before falling to Sampras, yet 
took over the No. 1 ranking for three weeks, the first time Agassi 
had led the rankings since 1996. His return of serve makes him a 
strong candidate to win his second U.S. Open. His serve, however, 
is a liability. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 3 Yevgeny Kafelnikov    	
</P>
<P>
	He could cap an up-and-down year with his first U.S. Open crown.  
The Russian right-hander began the year by winning the Australian 
Open. Then, after suffering six straight opening-round defeats, 
Kafelnikov took over the No. 1 ranking before promptly losing 
again. If he is confident, Kafelnikov could be a factor. If he's 
not, he might not get through the first round. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 4 Patrick Rafter    	
</P>
<P>
	Rafter's serve-and-volley game fits perfectly on the hard courts  
of Arthur Ashe Stadium, where he has won the last two U.S. Opens. 
He seemed ready to do it again before he had to pull out of his 
last two tournaments with tendinitis in his right shoulder. The key 
is whether the shoulder will hold up through the entire two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 5 Gustavo Kuerten    	
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian right-hander has become much more consistent since  
he was a surprising winner at the French Open in 1997. He has a 
powerful baseline game, yet is not afraid to come to the net when 
he gets a short ball. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 6 Tim Henman    	
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long time since a British player has been one of the  
favorites to win a Grand Slam men's singles title, but Tim Henman 
fits that bill with a strong serve and crisp net play. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 7 Todd Martin    	
</P>
<P>
	Missed most of 1997 with injuries, but has come back strongly  
behind his big serve. The right-hander's biggest problem has been 
his court coverage. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 8 Carlos Moya    	
</P>
<P>
	One of the best clay court players in the game, Moya last year  
showed that he could play on hard court, reaching the semifinals at 
the National Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 9 Greg Rusedski    	
</P>
<P>
	A British Davis Cup teammate of Tim Henman, Rusedski has a big  
left-handed serve that took him to the U.S. Open final in 1997. He 
is coming off his latest injury and has not played much this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 10 Marcelo Rios    	
</P>
<P>
	American Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson said of Rios: ``Always  
talented, always dangerous, always moody.'' Enough said of the 
talented left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 11 Mark Philippoussis    	
</P>
<P>
	Was a U.S. Open finalist last year, but has missed his last two  
tournaments with tendinitis in his right shoulder, an injury that 
also sidelined him earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 12 Richard Krajicek    	
</P>
<P>
	Another big server, this Dutchman won Wimbledon in 1996. He has  
reached the fourth round at Flushing Meadow, but not since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 13 Alex Corretja    	
</P>
<P>
	A baseliner, the Spanish right-hander has shown he can win on  
most surfaces, capturing the year-ending ATP Tour World 
Championship on carpet last year after reaching the fourth round at 
the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 14 Tommy Haas    	
</P>
<P>
	Haas and Kiefer have carried German hopes into the top 20 in the  
world. The 21-year-old right-hander has victories over Agassi, 
Kafelnikov and Henman. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 15 Nicolas Kiefer    	
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer, a right-hander, has a perfect record against Rafter,  
beating the Australian three times. He also has victories over 
Kafelnikov, Kuerten and Henman. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 16 Nicolas Lapentti    	
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti has zoomed up the rankings, becoming No. 16 when he won  
the Indianapolis tournament a week ago, his first title in almost 
four years. He's reached the quarterfinals or better in five of his 
last six tournaments.

	Has been consistent this year. And her experience gives her an  
edge over players with more weapons. 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 10 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario    	
</P>
<P>
	Like Coetzer, the 5-6 1/2 Sanchez-Vicario's forte has been her  
running down every shot and making her opponent hit yet another. 
But she seems to have lost a half-step and doesn't have a weapon to 
really hurt her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 11 Nathalie Tauziat    	
</P>
<P>
	Late in her career -- she's 31 -- the French woman has found  
success. But her game won't stand up to the power or the craftiness 
of the top teen-agers in the field. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 12 Barbara Schett    	
</P>
<P>
	An Austrian right-hander, Schett is capable of upsetting some of  
the top players, but not enough of them to win the U.S. 0pen. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 13 Dominique Van Roost    	
</P>
<P>
	Van Roost last year became the first Belgian to be ranked in the  
world's Top 10. This year the right-hander reached the 
quarterfinals at the Australian Open and the fourth round at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 14 Sandrine Testud    	
</P>
<P>
	While dangerous, this French woman is not considered a contender  
in the year's final major. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 15 Amelie Mauresmo    	
</P>
<P>
	A French left-hander with heavy ground strokes, Mauresmo was a  
surprising finalist at the Australian Open in January. She won't 
get that far at Flushing Meadow. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 16 Conchita Martinez    	
</P>
<P>
	This Spaniard's big topspin shots took her to the Wimbledon  
title five years ago, and she has twice reached the semifinals of 
the U.S. Open. Her chances of doing it again, however, are growing 
slim. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Men    	
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 1 Pete Sampras    	
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras is going after history. He tied Roy Emerson by  
winning his 12th Grand Slam tournament men's singles title when he 
captured Wimbledon for the sixth time in July. Sampras has the 
game, the temperament and the confidence to win his fifth U.S. Open 
crown, although he is coming into the tournament after suffering a 
strained hip flexor. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 2 Andre Agassi    	
</P>
<P>
	When he won the French Open in June, Agassi became only the  
fifth man to win all four Grand Slam tournaments in a career, and 
the first American since Don Budge won all four in 1938. Agassi 
then reached the final at Wimbledon before falling to Sampras, yet 
took over the No. 1 ranking for three weeks, the first time Agassi 
had led the rankings since 1996. His return of serve makes him a 
strong candidate to win his second U.S. Open. His serve, however, 
is a liability. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 3 Yevgeny Kafelnikov    	
</P>
<P>
	He could cap an up-and-down year with his first U.S. Open crown.  
The Russian right-hander began the year by winning the Australian 
Open. Then, after suffering six straight opening-round defeats, 
Kafelnikov took over the No. 1 ranking before promptly losing 
again. If he is confident, Kafelnikov could be a factor. If he's 
not, he might not get through the first round. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 4 Patrick Rafter    	
</P>
<P>
	Rafter's serve-and-volley game fits perfectly on the hard courts  
of Arthur Ashe Stadium, where he has won the last two U.S. Opens. 
He seemed ready to do it again before he had to pull out of his 
last two tournaments with tendinitis in his right shoulder. The key 
is whether the shoulder will hold up through the entire two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 5 Gustavo Kuerten    	
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian right-hander has become much more consistent since  
he was a surprising winner at the French Open in 1997. He has a 
powerful baseline game, yet is not afraid to come to the net when 
he gets a short ball. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 6 Tim Henman    	
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long time since a British player has been one of the  
favorites to win a Grand Slam men's singles title, but Tim Henman 
fits that bill with a strong serve and crisp net play. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 7 Todd Martin    	
</P>
<P>
	Missed most of 1997 with injuries, but has come back strongly  
behind his big serve. The right-hander's biggest problem has been 
his court coverage. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 8 Carlos Moya    	
</P>
<P>
	One of the best clay court players in the game, Moya last year  
showed that he could play on hard court, reaching the semifinals at 
the National Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 9 Greg Rusedski    	
</P>
<P>
	A British Davis Cup teammate of Tim Henman, Rusedski has a big  
left-handed serve that took him to the U.S. Open final in 1997. He 
is coming off his latest injury and has not played much this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
                         *No. 10 Marcelo Rios    	
</P>
<P>
	American Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson said of Rios: ``Always  
talented, always dangerous, always moody.'' Enough said of the 
talented left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
                      *No. 11 Mark Philippoussis    	
</P>
<P>
	Was a U.S. Open finalist last year, but has missed his last two  
tournaments with tendinitis in his right shoulder, an injury that 
also sidelined him earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 12 Richard Krajicek    	
</P>
<P>
	Another big server, this Dutchman won Wimbledon in 1996. He has  
reached the fourth round at Flushing Meadow, but not since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 13 Alex Corretja    	
</P>
<P>
	A baseliner, the Spanish right-hander has shown he can win on  
most surfaces, capturing the year-ending ATP Tour World 
Championship on carpet last year after reaching the fourth round at 
the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
                          *No. 14 Tommy Haas    	
</P>
<P>
	Haas and Kiefer have carried German hopes into the top 20 in the  
world. The 21-year-old right-hander has victories over Agassi, 
Kafelnikov and Henman. 
</P>
<P>
                        *No. 15 Nicolas Kiefer    	
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer, a right-hander, has a perfect record against Rafter,  
beating the Australian three times. He also has victories over 
Kafelnikov, Kuerten and Henman. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 16 Nicolas Lapentti    	
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti has zoomed up the rankings, becoming No. 16 when he won  
the Indianapolis tournament a week ago, his first title in almost 
four years. He's reached the quarterfinals or better in five of his 
last six tournaments.

<HEADLINE>  East Coast Beachgoers on Watch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- East Coast beachgoers and coastal  
residents kept a watch on changing weather forecasts Saturday as 
Hurricane Dennis added muscle while moving slowly through the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm's course was uncertain. Various computer models  
suggested it could affect the coast of the Carolinas late Monday or 
Tuesday, or veer away from land, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some glimmer of hope,'' National Hurricane Center  
director Jerry Jarrell said Saturday afternoon. ``Some of the 
models are beginning to show that it may miss the coast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters also had warned that Dennis might stall somewhere  
along the coast, giving it more time to pile up a storm surge and 
to batter the beach with erosive waves. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane center cautioned that storms can deviate widely  
from projections. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time to let down our guard nor is there any  
reason to panic,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Smith wasn't letting his guard down, as he stocked up with  
20 gallons of bottled water on South Carolina's Isle of Palms. 
</P>
<P>
	``My gut feeling is it's not going to hit, but I like to be  
prepared just in case,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis battered the northern Bahamas early Saturday, tearing up  
trees and utility poles, ripping small boats from their moorings 
and breaking down buildings under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	At North Carolina's Kill Devil Hills, on the Outer Banks chain  
of islands, Howard and Jean Wamsley of Colonial Heights, Va., 
boarded up the windows and 8-foot glass sliding doors at their 
vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my dream house and we've got to protect it,'' Mrs.  
Wamsley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Wilmington, N.C., Wrightsville Beach lifeguards posted red  
flags along the beach Saturday, warning people not to enter the 
water because of the possibility that the surf could generate 
dangerous rip currents. A 10-year-old swimmer drowned in a rip 
current before Hurricane Bonnie last year at Atlantic Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, Dennis had strengthened, with its sustained wind  
accelerating to 105 mph, and was centered about 325 miles southeast 
of Charleston, S.C., the hurricane center said. It was moving 
toward the northwest at about 7 mph, and was expected to gradually 
turn toward the north on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane was expected to strengthen, and could become a  
Category 3 storm, with wind of 111 mph to 130 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Saturday night a hurricane watch was issued from north of  
Savannagh, Ga. to Surf City, N.C., and a tropical storm warning was 
in effect for part of Florida's east coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruise ships changed routes and small boats were moved inland  
Saturday as an intensifying Hurricane Dennis threatened to brush 
Florida with storm-force winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Three ships -- Disney's Wonder, Carnival's Fantasy and Cape  
Canaveral's Dolphin IV -- were scheduled to return Sunday to Port 
Canaveral, but cruise officials were looking at alternatives after 
the port shut down Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A heavy surf advisory was posted for the coast of Georgia. Some  
people called resorts to cancel their reservations while others 
went to the beach to surf in the high waves. 
</P>
<P>
	Five-foot seas also attracted dozens of surfers Saturday off  
Cocoa Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in Hawaii so the only real challenge left is to say  
I've surfed hurricane waves,'' Bill Boggs, 45, said as he watched 
fellow surfers off the Cocoa Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheryl Woods-Flowers, the mayor of Mount Pleasant, S.C., just  
east of Charleston, said people should at least get ready for 
protective measures such as covering windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably not going to start putting my husband on a ladder  
until tomorrow,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 South Carolina National Guardsmen moved toward the  
coast on Saturday and several hundred law enforcement officers were 
already there in case they are needed to direct traffic in the 
event of an evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hodges met with emergency officials early Saturday to  
be briefed on the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we are still not talking about any evacuation,  
we are simply taking the normal precautions that should be taken,'' 
Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Isle of Palms, landscaper David Schwartz stocked up on  
water but said he would likely leave if Dennis threatens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the last ones have been, I have no gut feeling,'' he  
said. ``They are so unpredictable.

<HEADLINE> FBI Handling of Waco May Be Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by the latest furor over federal law  
enforcement's conduct during the final, fateful hours in the 1993 
standoff with the Branch Davidians, Congress is scurrying to review 
years-old hearing records and organize a fresh round of inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional ire was raised with the FBI's admission Wednesday  
-- after years of claims to the contrary -- that a ``very limited 
number'' of incendiary tear gas grenades were lobbed near the 
Davidians' compound outside Waco, Texas, in the hours before the 
wooden structure erupted in flames. The acknowledgment came on the 
heels of a newspaper report challenging the earlier statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now clear that the Justice Department misled the  
Congress and the American people,'' said House Government Reform 
Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., accusing officials of 
``sitting on this evidence for six years, all the while maintaining 
that it didn't exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, who dispatched investigators to Austin this week to  
review evidence gathered from the compound's charred remains, 
pledged to convene hearings, calling them ``absolutely essential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, agreed: ``We've got to  
get to the truth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who  
pronounced the credibility of Attorney General Janet Reno's Justice 
Department at ``an all-time low,'' is moving towards hearings as 
well. House Judiciary Committee staffers are wading through 
testimony from the 10 days of nationally televised House hearings 
in 1995 to determine if new inquiries are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Bob Barr, who participated in the earlier hearings,  
suggested that Congress should consider perjury charges. 
</P>
<P>
	A clearly frustrated Reno, who had earlier assured Congress that  
only non-burning tear gas was used during the April 19, 1993, 
assault, ordered up a probe of her own. ``I don't think it's very 
good for my credibility,'' she said of the FBI's about-face. 
``That's the reason I'm going to pursue it until I get to the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, for one, said he expects little from the Justice probe.  
``I'm sure information will be slow in coming,'' the frequent 
Clinton administration critic said. ``With this administration, 
it's always that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, who has been a favorite target of congressional  
Republicans over her handling of issues including Whitewater and 
Democratic campaign fund-raising, will face the hot seat again. 
Burton said he will summon Reno to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Burton's announcement, Reno said she would welcome  
congressional oversight. ``I'll be happy to cooperate in every way 
that I can,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither the Justice Department nor Congress can properly  
investigate the matter, argued Danny Coulson, the former senior FBI 
official who touched off the controversy by publicly revealing that 
military pyrotechnic canisters were used in the waning hours of the 
51-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Justice Department ``has no business'' investigating  
itself and called congressional hearings political theater. He 
suggested an independent investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needs to be investigated and decided in a cooler  
environment, one away from the TV cameras,'' said Coulson, who was 
a deputy assistant FBI director during the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred by the FBI's reversal, Barr and others are pressing for  
inquiries far afield of the tear gas issue. They are demanding 
answers to some nagging controversies, among them why the Army's 
secretive Delta Force was on the scene, and whether shots were 
fired into the compound by federal agents on the siege's final day 
-- a contention the government has vigorously denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have always been serious lingering questions and now,  
with this latest information, I think it's imperative that we look 
into it,'' Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Film producer Michael McNulty, who next month will release a  
documentary that alleges government cover-ups at Waco, is hoping 
Congress will investigate. That said, the producer of ``Waco: A New 
Revelation'' gave Congress an ``F-minus'' for its hearings, saying 
both parties used the sessions chiefly to score political points. 
</P>
<P>
	``They missed the most important issue of all: What happened at  
Waco,'' said McNulty. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's admission doesn't change earlier findings that the  
fires were set by people inside the compound, Reno and FBI 
officials maintain. ``I have no reason at this point to believe the 
FBI is responsible for the deaths of those people,'' Reno said of 
cult leader David Koresh and some 80 followers who died during the 
inferno. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says the incendiary rounds were fired hours before the  
fire at a concrete bunker 40 yards from the compound after 
non-burning canisters proved ineffective. The pyrotechnic devices, 
which bounced off the bunker's roof and rolled into a field, could 
not have ignited the blaze, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	That assessment is shared by a member of the team of independent  
arson investigators who determined, during the 1993 Justice 
Department post-siege inquiry, that the fire was deliberately set 
in three places simultaneously inside the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Hastings, chief deputy fire marshal for Alleghany County,  
Pa., said the pyrotechnic canisters could not in ``any way, shape 
or form'' have started the fire.

<HEADLINE> Lasorda Manages One More Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- So you a have a minor league  
baseball team, your manager is unavailable and you need to find a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	How about a Hall of Famer?  
</P>
<P>
	Former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda returned to the  
dugout Friday to lead the Class A Vero Beach Dodgers to a 1-0 win 
in a Florida State League game against the St. Lucie Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Vero Beach manager Alvaro Espinoza, whose wife recently had a  
baby, was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasorda, the Dodgers' senior vice president, was in town to  
evaluate players and was asked to step in for one game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice,'' Lasorda said. ``But I'm just down here. My  
purpose in coming here is to look at the players, evaluate them, 
motivate them, inspire them. They asked me to do this, so I thought 
I'd do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Lasorda's first time managing since he retired three  
years ago because of heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasorda was elected to the baseball Hall of Fame in 1997 by the  
Veterans Committee in his first year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I miss managing, I really do,'' Lasorda said. ``But when I had  
my heart problem, I just felt that I'd had enough of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's game was Lasorda's first minor league management stint  
in 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time I've ever managed a team since I retired,  
so it better be a winning one,'' he said before the game.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Said Assessing Abortion Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A 14-year-old foster girl who says she was raped  
is reportedly expected to travel to Kansas for a late-term abortion 
unless Arizona officials succeed in winning a court ruling to stop 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no direct word from the girl because of foster  
care confidentiality requirements and a court seal on the case. 
She's said to be about 24 weeks into the pregnancy now, past the 
stage at which abortions are performed in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republic quoted sources Saturday as saying Gov. Jane  
Hull had changed direction on Thursday about an appeal and had 
decided to have the girl's competency re-evaluated. But a judge on 
Friday reaffirmed his decision to allow the abortion, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's office was working feverishly late Friday on a  
second appeal, the Republic said. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for 
the governor refused to discuss whether a second appeal would be 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, a ward of the state since she was 5 and now a ward of  
Maricopa County Superior Court, told the state she was raped. She 
requested an abortion 14 weeks into the pregnancy but then ran 
away, showing up again only recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Judge William Sargeant authorized the abortion and  
having the girl taken elsewhere for it.

<HEADLINE> Rookie Sets Pace in IRL Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOUNTAIN, Colo. (AP) -- With a logjam at the top of the point  
standings and three races remaining, the chase for the Indy Racing 
League's $1 million bonus is anybody's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Just ask those in the lead.  
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the Colorado Indy 200, Scott Goodyear leads the  
standings with 193 points, Greg Ray has 191 and Kenny Brack 179. 
But six other drivers are within a single victory -- worth 50 points 
-- of taking over the lead, and four others are realistically within 
striking distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The three of us might wind up in the infield on Sunday,''  
Goodyear noted, ``and it might be three different people you're 
looking at at Texas (the final race on Oct. 17). You've got guys 
who are running strong and haven't won yet, hard chargers like Sam 
Schmidt and Jeff Ward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ray, who triumphed in the Radisson 200 here on June 27,  
``The way the point structure is, it changes so drastically, so 
quickly. One guy can have a bad weekend and he can go from second 
to eighth. Or you can go from sixth to first real quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Scott Harrington is far off the pace, but he too is  
capable of making some noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington had the fastest times in Friday's two practice  
sessions in preparation for today's qualifying and Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington turned a lap of 175.234 mph in the morning session on  
Pikes Peak International Raceway's one-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt was next at 173.972 mph, and Ward was timed in 173.871.  
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, Harrington went 174.258 mph, bettering Robby  
McGehee, at 172.538, and Ward, at 172.166. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear, Ray and Brack all posted modest practice speeds on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago on this track, Harrington was poised for a  
top-three finish -- and possibly a win -- when he brushed the wall 
with 17 laps to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were reeling in Sam (Schmidt, the race's runnerup) and  
Greg,'' Harrington recalled. ``I feel like we should have won that 
one. I definitely feel we let that one get away from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He challenged for the lead despite driving with a broken right  
leg, torn ligaments in his left knee and three cracked ribs as a 
result of a crash two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Harrington still wore a brace on his left knee, but  
he said he was significantly improved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, I'm way better,'' he said. ``Probably the biggest  
thing I'm dealing with now is the physical conditioning. I had a 
pretty regular routine of working out. Then I had injuries to both 
legs, and the ribs prevented me from doing much upper-body work. 
The conditioning definitely has suffered, but in the last four 
weeks I've been able to do a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His car, meanwhile, remains in superb condition.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're using pretty much the same setup we had in June,'' he  
said. ``Very minor changes. This afternoon, we got close to where 
we were this morning. We figured we knew what we needed to know so 
we decided to park it and skip the last part of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just got a great race car this weekend. This is  
definitely the fastest car we've had all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington, 35, of Indianapolis admitted that his team remains  
basically a shoestring operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've run one engine since Charlotte (on May 1),'' he said.  
``We rebuild it every weekend. It's kind of hard for us to practice 
pit stops because we only have two guys who work for us. The rest 
of the guys are volunteers and weekend help. It's hard for me to 
sit in the car and plug the air jack in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Kite lost an engine during the morning session and did not  
practice in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyce Carlson caused heavy damage to the rear of his car when he  
hit the wall in Turn 4. Carlson wasn't hurt, and he turned several 
laps in his backup car in the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Report: Brewers Interview Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers have interviewed Toronto  
assistant general manager Dave Stewart as part of a search to 
replace former general manager Sal Bando, according to the 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper, citing unidentified sources, also said that Wendy  
Selig-Prieb, the Brewers' president and chief executive officer, 
will interview former Cleveland Indians assistant general manager 
Dan O'Dowd on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb has refused to comment on the search process for a  
new GM, the Journal Sentinel reported in Sunday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Phil Garner was fired and Bando was reassigned Aug. 12,  
as the Brewers appeared headed to their seventh straight losing 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who was interviewed by Selig-Prieb on Thursday, said he  
was the first candidate interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I answered questions, told her what I thought of their club,  
their minor league system and scouting,'' Stewart said. ``There is 
a lot to build on there as they move into their new park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers currently are building a new stadium, called Miller  
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was a four-time 20-game winner during a 15-year  
major league career with five clubs. He played on three World 
Series championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	After finishing his playing career with Oakland in 1995, he  
worked for a year as the A's assistant general manager before 
moving to San Diego. After one year as an assistant to general 
manager Kevin Towers, he moved into the dugout as the pitching 
coach and helped guide the Padres to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He then moved to Toronto.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd, 41, has spent 17 seasons in professional baseball, most  
recently in Cleveland, where he helped build the Indians farm 
system into one of the strongest in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball sources said last week that the Brewers had compiled a  
list of 12 potential candidates, including Stewart, O'Dowd, former 
Dodgers general manager Fred Claire, New York Mets assistant GM 
Omar Minaya, Chicago White Sox director of baseball operations Dan 
Evans; and Cincinnati Reds assistant GM Darrell ``Doc'' Rodgers, 
the Journal Sentinel reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Yankees GM Bob Watson and Cleveland scout Ted Simmons  
also are believed to be on the list, the Journal Sentinel reported.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Search for Home in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The First Family ended their island  
vacation and stepped into a silver Suburban for another day of 
house hunting in Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton brushed aside a question about whether he and  
his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were close to buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some place nice and airy that will make Hillary happy -- that's  
what I want,'' he said today. Mrs. Clinton, standing a few yards 
behind her husband on Air Force One, laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea, were continuing  
on to the Hamptons to raise political money this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The family spent a Sunday earlier this month visiting properties  
in the area, where Mrs. Clinton would like to settle to establish 
residency to run for an open Senate seat in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mrs. Clinton slipped of the island unnoticed last Saturday  
for another round of house hunting, administration officials, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Friday's golf game ended badly -- a steady, drenching  
rain forced his party off the course at the 15th hole Friday -- at 
least Clinton didn't lose Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The president joined Britain's Prince Andrew, the duke of York,  
on the links at the Farm Neck Golf Club. He noted that in the 17th 
century the island off the Massachusetts coast was owned by 
Andrew's predecessor dukes of York. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what the bet is? If he beats me, we have to give him  
back the island,'' Clinton said, stopping his golf cart near a 
gaggle of reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game was rained out, the prince came splashing across  
the parking lot toward a black Land Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked the game's outcome, Andrew pulled a crumpled wad of  
American bills from his pocket and replied: ``I have still got a 
little money in my pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Clinton returned to the private home where he and his  
family have spent the past week. The family was to leave today for 
a fund-raising weekend at the Hamptons on Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the money will go toward Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
possible Senate race in New York. Tonight in East Hampton the 
Clintons are hosts at the airport terminal to a buffet reception of 
the young Democrats' ``Saxophone Club.'' At $250 per person, some 
800 people are expected to turn out for the Clintons and comedian 
Jon Stewart to net about $200,000 for the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, it's on to a $1,000 per plate barbecue dinner at a  
private East Hampton residence. Singer Phoebe Snow will entertain 
the 300 people contributing jointly to the DNC, Mrs. Clinton's 
campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Clintons star at a $5,000-per-person lunch for 80  
at a Southampton home. The first $1,000 of every ticket price, a 
party official said, will go to Mrs. Clinton's race, and the 
remainder will be shared by the DNC and DSCC. 
</P>
<P>
	In the priciest of the galas, rocker Jon Bon Jovi provides the  
music at a Bridgehampton dinner on Sunday night solely benefiting 
the DNC. At $25,000 per couple, the event is expected to bag 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes and Jim  
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, were 
starting a drive to cram the airwaves in upstate Skaneateles, N.Y., 
the Clintons' final stop on this half-recreational, half-political 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 30-second television commercial being shown in the  
Skaneateles market, Nicholson urged Clinton to ``take a moment from 
your vacation to talk about real tax relief with Hillary and Al 
(Gore). You'll be glad you did when you're living in New York -- or 
whatever state you decide to call home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Forbes campaign bought five days' worth of spots on three  
Syracuse-area radio stations -- WSYR, WSEN and WNSS -- to hammer at 
the president's opposition to a Republican tax-cut bill pending in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sign the tax cut, Mr. President,'' Forbes says in the ad. ``I  
would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the American Conservative Union purchased television time  
in the upstate region to criticize Clinton's decision to offer 
conditional clemency to 16 imprisoned Puerto Rican militants. Those 
ads are scheduled to run next Monday through Friday.

<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Spain's Abel Anton delighted a home crowd  
at Olympic Stadium Saturday, using his finishing kick over the last 
12 minutes to win his second straight World Championships marathon 
and Spain's second gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Anton, 36, finished in 2 hours, 13 minutes, 36 seconds, with  
Italy's Vincenzo Modica (2:14:03) finishing second and Nobuyuki 
Sato of Japan (2:14:07) earning the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Spain's third straight gold in the World Championships  
marathon, with Martin Fiz winning in 1995 and taking second to 
Anton in '97. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the race, the temperature was 97 degrees,  
creating some of the toughest conditions ever for a major marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	At the finish, as Anton entered the stadium greeted by thousands  
of fluttering yellow and red Spanish flags, the temperature had 
dropped to 86 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Anton caught Sato with about 12 minutes left, paced him for  
about 90 seconds, and then pulled away relentlessly.

<HEADLINE> West Bank Pullback in Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators tried  
Saturday to resolve the final barriers to implementing a 
U.S.-brokered peace accord ahead of a visit to the region by U.S. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences over Israel's promised release of Palestinian  
prisoners has been holding up a long-delayed deal to turn over more 
of the West Bank to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the two sides apparently had ironed out most of the  
details to clear the way for Israel's withdrawal from 11 percent of 
the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting top Palestinian negotiators at her Washington home  
on Friday, Albright told reporters, ``I think we are looking 
forward to the conclusion of this aspect of the peace process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat met with  
his Israeli counterpart, Gilead Sher, at a Jerusalem hotel. The 
talks lasted for three hours, but neither side provided details on 
their contents. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiators were slated to meet again Sunday, Israel radio  
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat met with his Israeli  
counterpart, Gilead Sher, at a Jerusalem hotel on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is expected to participate Thursday in a signing  
ceremony in Alexandria, Egypt, if the agreement is worked out in 
time. The peace deal would be the first to be signed under the rule 
of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who came to power in July. 
</P>
<P>
	During the meeting with the Palestinian negotiators, Albright  
promised to try to help find a solution for the issue of prisoners, 
said Hasan Abdel Rahman, the PLO representative in Washington who 
participated in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians are demanding the release of detainees jailed  
for involvement in anti-Israel activities. Israel insists it will 
not free prisoners with ``blood on their hands'' -- meaning 
prisoners connected to attacks that injured or killed Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat's cabinet, meeting Friday, stressed the importance of the  
prisoner issue in a statement, saying the matter is ``one of the 
most important and sensitive issues for the Palestinian people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	International cooperation minister Nabil Shaath was optimistic  
about the chances an understanding could be reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that we are closer. The differences have  
been narrowed and some topics have been concluded,'' Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides are trying to iron out differences on just how to  
implement the U.S.-brokered Wye accord, signed in October by former 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who then froze 
implementation of the agreement in December. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the emerging deal, Israel will withdraw from 11  
percent of the West Bank by the end of January and establish ``safe 
passage'' routes for Palestinians to travel between the Gaza Strip 
and West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians will also be allowed through the agreement to  
open a port in the Gaza Strip.

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- B.F. ``Sandy'' Coggan, who led the Convair  
Division of General Dynamics during the aerospace boom of the 1950s 
and went on to advise the Defense Department and United Nations, 
died Sunday from complications of Alzheimer's disease. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Bernard Frederick Coggan in Gary, Ind., he grew up in  
Michigan and earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering 
at Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, Coggan moved to San Diego to become vice-president and  
general manager of Convair, which had a work force of 45,000 
designing and manufacturing aircraft and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	As a consultant to the Department of Defense in 1961, Coggan  
conducted worldwide audits of military hospitals and radar 
installations. As a United Nations adviser in 1966, he was part of 
a team assigned to audit a five-year economic plan of Indian Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi.

	TENAFLY, N.J. (AP) -- Joseph Gold, the nation's oldest living  
Marine and one of the few remaining World War I veterans, died 
Wednesday of pneumonia. He was 107. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold, who served with the American Expeditionary Force in the  
Battle of Belleau Wood in June 1918, was one of two servicemen to 
receive France's Legion of Honor award last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few weeks ago, interviewers from the U.S. Marine Corps  
Research Center arrived at Gold's nursing home to record his 
thoughts on the war he fought and his service in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine records show Gold was the oldest living Marine. He is one  
of only a few who remembered fighting during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, Gold remained in Europe until 1919 to help with  
postwar reconstruction.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- David Graham, who led the Oxford University  
students' hugely controversial vote against fighting ``for king and 
country'' in the year Adolf Hitler came to power, died Aug. 12, 
according to newspaper reports. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	While a student at Oxford in February 1933, Graham drafted the  
pacifist debating motion that ``this house will in no circumstances 
fight for its king and country.'' The Oxford Union passed the 
matter by a vote of 275-173, causing an uproar among conservatives 
in the British Parliament and the press. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to The Daily Telegraph, Graham was not so much a  
pacifist as an ``independent spirit fond of controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham joined the British Broadcasting Corp. shortly after his  
graduation from Oxford and his career there spanned four decades. 
His first task was to adapt Leo Tolstoy's ``War and Peace'' for 
radio, The New York Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	When World War II broke out, Graham, eager to use his fluency in  
German and knowledge of the country to support Britain's war 
effort, became part of a small BBC team that broadcast to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a daughter and two sons.

</P>
<P>
	Harrell was an innovator in physician training, emphasizing  
understanding and caring for the patient as a whole. He advocated 
training students in small groups to prepare them for work in

<HEADLINE> Charges Vs. Santee Sioux Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A federal judge who threatened to jail Santee  
Sioux leaders for failing to close the tribe's outlawed casino 
dismissed civil contempt charges against them after determining 
leaders had no authority to shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Cambridge said Friday that the  
Tribal Council was not in contempt of his previous order to close 
the casino since it is bound by the tribe's Aug. 3 referendum to 
keep the casino open. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the judge said authorities should pursue criminal  
charges to close the casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to jail,'' Tribal Chairman Butch Denny  
said between hugs with tribal members Friday. Inside the courtroom, 
about 60 members of the tribe cheered the ruling, while outside 
others broke out in tribal song. 
</P>
<P>
	If the leaders had been convicted and sentenced to jail, it  
would have been the first time an Indian had been imprisoned over a 
gambling dispute since Congress first allowed tribes to negotiate 
gaming compacts with states 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The court hearing was the latest in a three-year effort by state  
and federal officials to close the casino on the Santee Sioux 
reservation near the South Dakota border in northeast Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe opened the Ohiya Casino in February 1996 without the  
necessary state approval. Casino-style gambling is illegal in 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 requires states to  
negotiate such agreements with tribes to set rules and limits on 
gambling. The tribe sued the state, alleging it failed to negotiate 
in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's office attempted to get the Tribal Council  
to close the casino under an order issued by Cambridge in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambridge said the casino is clearly illegal and should be  
closed. U.S. Attorney Tom Monaghan said the tribe will continue to 
be fined $6,000 per day for operating the casino. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe faces $726,000 in fines to date. None had been paid as  
of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Denny said he hopes the tribe will negotiate a gaming compact  
with the U.S. Department of Interior under new rules that allow 
tribes to negotiate with the federal agency when states have been 
reluctant to talk with the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santee said the casino's 23 jobs are much needed on the  
reservation where the unemployment rate is 74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to break anybody's laws,'' casino manager  
Thelma Thomas said. ``We're just trying to make life better for our 
people.''

<HEADLINE> Denmark Celebrates Royal Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Volleys of cannon fire Saturday  
celebrated Denmark's first royal birth in 24 years. Prince Joachim 
and wife Princess Alexandra had a boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly there was a son,'' a jubilant Prince Joachim said at  
the hospital where he attended delivery and cut the umbilical cord. 
``I hyperventilated a few times and was close to fainting more than 
once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The baby weighed in at 5.8 pounds. Joachim declined to say what  
name the baby would be given. The prince, 30, is the youngest son 
of Queen Margrethe. It was her first grandchild. Her oldest son and 
heir to the throne, Crown Prince Frederik, 31, is not married. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra, of Britain, married Prince Joachim in November 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	The newborn became third in the line of succession. He also is  
the seventh-generation member of the Gluecksborg House, which has 
ruled the kingdom since 1863. The Danish monarchy dates to 940 A.D. 
and is Europe's oldest. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon, cannons at Copenhagen's naval base and at the Kronborg  
castle, north of the Danish capital, fired 21 rounds to salute the 
birth.

<HEADLINE>  Clintons Raise Money, Shop for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton delivered his  
warmest endorsement yet of his wife's all-but-declared Senate race 
as both Clintons came to New York on Saturday to raise money for 
her and other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton deserves her own chance at elected  
office, after an adult lifetime of unelected public service, 
Clinton said at the first of a string of political fund-raising 
parties in the Hamptons, a tony district on the eastern end of Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want somebody who has thought about this stuff and  
worked hard and always tried to do it for other people for 30 
years,'' Clinton began, ``who has more heart, more intelligence, 
more ability and more commitment than any person I have ever known, 
... then you ought to send her to the Senate and give her a chance 
to serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is raising money for a possible 2000 run for the  
Senate seat now held by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton sounded very much like a candidate.  
</P>
<P>
	``Like most of you, I've always been somebody who's supported  
other people,'' she told about 300 supporters who paid $1,000 for a 
barbecue supper with the Clintons, and entertainment by gospel 
singer Phoebe Snow. ``And now I'm stepping forward and asking you 
for your support and your help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	En route to the Hamptons from a nine-day stay on the  
Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, the Clintons and 
daughter Chelsea made another house-hunting stop in Westchester 
County, north of New York City 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the money raised at three events Saturday night will go  
to Mrs. Clinton's campaign, and some to Democratic candidates 
generally. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has often described his wife as a partner in their  
political agenda, and he fondly described that relationship before 
the loudly cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I met Hillary in 1971 we began a conversation about this  
stuff that was still going on at 1:30 last night, 28 years later,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president brought down the house with an apparent reference  
to last year's extramarital sex-and-impeachment scandal, and his 
wife's stoicism. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the couple took a walk Saturday, their last full day  
vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, and he asked whether she was 
tired of their political life. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, 'No, it's still very interesting to me. You may be a  
lot of things, but you're not boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are spending the weekend in the Hamptons, at the  
home of filmmaker Steven Spielberg, for two days of Democratic 
politicking. 
</P>
<P>
	In East Hampton, the Clintons also were hosts at a buffet  
reception of the young Democrats' ``Saxophone Club.'' The 
relatively low $250 ticket price drew about 750 people, and was 
expected to raise some $200,000 for the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	After music from hip-hop star Wyclef Jean, both Mrs. Clinton and  
the president asked for the support of younger Democrats. Clinton's 
brief address concluded with another endorsement of his wife's 
Senate qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York would do well to send her to the United States  
Senate,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	A $5,000-per-person lunch for 80 is planned for Sunday in  
Southampton. The first $1,000 from every ticket, a party official 
said, will go to Mrs. Clinton's race, with the remainder shared by 
the DNC and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the priciest of the galas, rocker Jon Bon Jovi provides the  
music at a Bridgehampton dinner Sunday night for the DNC. At 
$25,000 per couple, Democrats hope the event will raise $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Before beginning the money hunt, the Clinton family did a little  
house-hunting Saturday afternoon, visiting a four-story colonial in 
Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton brushed aside a question about what he wanted in a home.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some place nice and airy that will make Hillary happy -- that's  
what I want,'' the president said. His wife, standing a few yards 
behind him on Air Force One, laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mrs. Clinton decides to run for the Senate next year, she'll  
need to establish residency by Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons spent nearly two hours inspecting a white Georgian  
colonial in Chappaqua that a listing agent said costs nearly $1.7 
million. It boasts a swimming pool out back and an exercise room on 
the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The house sits screened by evergreens at the end of a cul-de-sac  
called Old House Lane, in a community described by neighbors as a 
quiet area with good schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very nice house, but we don't have any announcement to  
make,'' Clinton said after the visit. It was the only house the 
Clintons saw Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the house tour, Clinton left his unusually small motorcade  
to shake hands with neighbors gathered at the bottom of the street. 
</P>
<P>
	One potential neighbor, Osman Osmani, wished the first lady  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you become our next senator,'' Osmani said.  
</P>
<P>
	The president jumped in with a reply: ``She becomes the senator,  
I'd be the first neighbor?'' Clinton said. ``I'm looking for a new 
role in life, you know? I like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another neighbor said the home's current owner is a doctor who  
founded a chain of health clinics. Many other neighbors are 
doctors, bankers and other professionals, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the family spent a Sunday visiting  
properties in the area, and Mrs. Clinton left Martha's Vineyard 
unnoticed on Aug. 21 for additional house hunting, said 
administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> How Midway Battle Letter Was Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice Adm. Stanhope Cotton Ring's version of  
the Battle of Midway was discovered by his daughter, Susan Keith, 
tucked away in a sea chest Ring shared with his wife, Eleanor. Mrs. 
Keith, from a venerable San Diego Navy family, said she came across 
the document about six months ago as she went through old records 
of her mother, who died four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was his letter,'' she said in a telephone interview  
from San Diego. ``I recognized his gorgeous handwriting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Lost Letter of Midway'' was published in the U.S. Naval  
Institute's monthly ``Proceedings'' magazine in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Navy Capt. Bruce Linder, who edited and annotated the  
letter for the Annapolis, Md.-based Naval Institute, discovered the 
material as he discussed with Mrs. Keith material for a book on San 
Diego's naval history. He said he was about to leave when Mrs. 
Keith asked: ``Of course you've heard about the Midway letter?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After borrowing the letter for an evening, I became convinced  
that I had stumbled upon something of significance ... that told an 
entirely different story than that told in the more popular 
histories of battle,'' Linder said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said former naval aviators who flew in the war or in similar  
circumstances ``confirmed for me that Ring's take on what had 
happened at Midway was much closer to the truth than what had 
largely been surmised by historians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Ring, he rose to command three carriers, including the  
storied USS Saratoga, and had a string of prestigious commands as a 
rear admiral and vice admiral. And Nimitz personally awarded Ring 
the Navy Cross for valor at Midway.

<HEADLINE> US Open Closes Great Tennis Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A few years after cynics claimed tennis was  
dying, record crowds are expected at the U.S. Open amid the 
blossoming of new players and the renewed rivalry between Pete 
Sampras and Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open starting Monday closes out a sizzling summer that  
began with Agassi and Steffi Graf triumphing on the French clay, 
moved on to wins by Sampras and Lindsay Davenport on Wimbledon's 
grass, and winds up on the hardcourts of the National Tennis 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The game is full of talented and personable young players:  
Alexandra Stevenson and Jelena Dokic, the latest in a long parade 
of talented teens making their mark; Marat Safin and Dominik 
Hrbaty, breaking through on the men's side. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Rafter, tennis' GQ cover boy, comes into the Open as the  
two-time defending champion and is giving the men's game the 
feeling of the late '70s and early '80s, when three great players -- 
Connors, Borg and McEnroe -- vied for big titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything is looking up for the sport these days, from soaring  
TV ratings to climbing sales of tennis balls and rackets as more 
kids and weekend hackers take to the courts. The rise of Venus and 
Serena Williams to prominence had as much to do with that as 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennis never was on the critical list, much less dying, as one  
national magazine and various pundits suggested. But the sport did 
suffer through a lull for several years as Agassi drifted off and 
on the court and few new players had established themselves, 
especially among the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's decline began after he lost the 1995 U.S. Open final to  
Sampras -- their last match at a major until this year's Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Andre took it very, very hard and didn't seem to  
recover,'' said Sampras, who is 16-10 against Agassi. ``I remember 
he didn't play at all that fall, and the balloon popped a little 
bit for him, probably for the next year or so. For me, I just kind 
of rode the wave and went to Europe and played great and finished 
No. 1. Our careers kind of went in different directions after that 
match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras went on to run his major singles titles total to a  
record-tying 12, including his July 4th Wimbledon victory over 
Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi came out of his deep sleep with the surge to his first  
French Open title and the completion of a career Grand Slam in 
early June -- an accomplishment that Sampras envies. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi doesn't have any regrets about the time he took away from  
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's helped my sanity certainly,'' he said. ``I don't know if  
it's helped my career. I mean, guys respond differently to 
preparing themselves. For me to sustain the grind year after year 
has never been easy or, quite honestly, even possible. I have to 
work really hard to win matches. Pete can win five and six and 
actually feel like it was pretty routine. I think it's been 
necessary for my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi felt that the alternative, playing all the time, might  
have dulled his spirits and his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A methodical approach to the game could have kept me from  
accomplishing the things I have,'' he said. ``But all in all, what 
happened in Paris this year answered any regrets I'll ever be 
capable of having.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The renewal of the Sampras-Agassi rivalry is one of the best  
things to happen to tennis -- and to Sampras and Agassi -- in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing him in the final at Wimbledon and being on the court  
with him in that scene, I felt like a heavyweight fighter going out 
against another heavyweight fighter,'' Sampras said. ``When I play 
Andre, I have to be at my best and, in some way, that calms me 
down. I have to go for it. And every now and then when I go for it, 
things click like they did in the final. It was the best tennis I 
think I've ever played on that court. He forces me to play at a 
level that I don't have to be at playing other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Sampras stays as dominant as he's been so far this summer --  
he beat Agassi in the finals of Los Angeles and the semifinals of 
Cincinnati -- the rivalry may lose its luster. Worse, he could drive 
Agassi away from the game again. 
</P>
<P>
	But Agassi is not showing signs of fatigue or depression. He  
rebounded to win in Washington, and he's been playing well enough 
to grab a measure of revenge against Sampras if they meet in the 
U.S. Open final. On the medium-speed hardcourt at the National 
Tennis Center, Agassi's baseline style can be as effective as 
Sampras' net-charging tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you play somebody so many times you get to a point where  
it really doesn't matter about the wins or the losses,'' Agassi 
said. ``It is about how you do that day. While it is not ideal to 
lose to him going into the Open, it is always different every week, 
every court, three out of five sets. There are always variables. If 
I could only have one (win), I would take it at the Open.''

<HEADLINE> A Life and Death on NYC Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dion Webster talked loud and laughed louder. He  
was a prankster, a kid who got things started. But late one cold 
November night, his laughter ceased. He was found dead on the 
street, a knife shoved into his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Freeman was a quiet young man, an introvert with bright  
eyes. Six months after his friend Webster was murdered, Freeman's 
body turned up in a park not far away with his skull nearly split 
in half. 
</P>
<P>
	Few mourned these two young men: their fellow street people,  
some social workers. 
</P>
<P>
	These were people passersby ignored; the type police rousted and  
arrested. They were homeless, addicted to crack cocaine, and stuck 
in a dead end of life before age 30. Besides, they lived in the 
hidden realm of the ``transgendered,'' men believing they should 
have been born female. They worked the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	In a city that boasts its dropping crime rate and safer streets,  
their murders barely registered. There were no news conferences, no 
task forces, no public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were dead already to the world. When they were killed, it  
just made it official,'' said Carl Siciliano, a social worker who 
knew them. 
</P>
<P>
	Police will not discuss the cases in depth. The murders remain  
unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
	One man tried hard to find out what happened. He questioned  
people and fed information to police. He discovered that Freeman 
had been killed over a drug deal, Webster when a trick went bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Forney was a friend of the two, another young man sharing  
their netherworld. ``The three musketeers,'' a friend 
affectionately called them. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months after Freeman's killing and just blocks away from  
both murder scenes, Forney's body was found, a single gunshot wound 
to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	This is his story.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Ali He'shun Forney was born in Charlotte, N.C., on April 12,  
1975, his name reflecting his family's Muslim faith. As a child, he 
moved with his single mother to a housing project in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Treaver Forney, and her children don't want to talk  
about Ali's life or his death. 
</P>
<P>
	But dozens of friends, social workers and street outreach  
workers speak of him, and hospital and court records and even 
personal writings and recorded interviews paint a vivid portrait: A 
boy who longed for a family, a singer who relished the spotlight, a 
young man with hard-earned street smarts who struggled with life, 
gave up, then struggled again. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali's boyhood neighborhood of East New York is a world of  
poverty-blighted high-rises, beat-up cars, stark store fronts and 
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not an easy place to be a child. The area ranks near the  
top of the charts every year when it comes to violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	From an early age, Ali knew he was different from other boys,  
preferring to play with dolls and dress up in his mother's clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is frustrating trying to hide something you have to let  
out. I tried for years. But my mother knew something was there 
...,'' he wrote in 1993 in an essay for the Streetwork Project, a 
drop-in center for homeless teens run by the private, nonprofit 
Victim Services agency. 
</P>
<P>
	As he grew, he became a gangly thing, all arms and legs -- a  
favorite target of the neighborhood's teen-age toughs and an 
awkward presence for his brothers. Once, preparing to pummel a 
young man in drag, they stopped short. ``Oh (expletive), Ali, 
that's you!'' he recalled one brother saying. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, Ali was acting up in school, getting into fights and  
stealing. He was 13 when he was sent to live in a group home for 
troubled youths, but ran away within months. 
</P>
<P>
	That began a four-year cycle of bouncing between the streets and  
foster care. He lived in at least four homes, including a state 
mental institution because of ``volatile behavior''; he had 
barricaded himself in a room after being belittled by other teens. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned his first trick at 13.  
</P>
<P>
	After pocketing $40, he recalled feeling wealthy -- ``like Donald  
Trump.'' But he was ``throwing shade,'' covering the pain, says 
Trevor Brown, who recorded Ali's story for the New York Peer AIDS 
Education Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	In those years, Ali spent his days hanging out on street corners  
or at Coney Island, hustling or stealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The nights he was on the lam from foster care, he rode the last  
car of the E train, a subway line known among New York's 15,000 to 
20,000 homeless teens as a hotel on wheels. It's a long ride, and 
at the last station you can get on the train going the other way 
without paying an extra fare. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in a cramped office on the 22nd floor of a Manhattan  
high-rise, Inez Robledo stared across the Hudson River, tears 
welling up. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the first time that kids who showed up at Streetwork  
later turned up dead. She had most of them committed to memory -- 
names, ages and faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially their faces.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are all such babies, you know,'' she said. ``They grow up  
fast on the street, learning how to get-over on people, stay alive 
-- things that nobody should have to learn. But in the end, you 
know, they are still babies, children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali was 17 when he walked through the door at Streetwork, a  
haven for homeless teens a stone's throw from the West Village's 
meat-packing district -- a haunt of desperate kids used to making a 
few, quick bucks selling their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	At Streetwork, counselors helped Ali apply for a Social Security  
number and a medical card. He completed his high school equivalency 
exam. 
</P>
<P>
	Video footage of a show at the drop-in center taken in 1993  
shows a shy Ali peeking over the shoulder of another teen, his hand 
cupped over his mouth. He stared wide-eyed at the cross-dressing 
man in the sequined black gown belting out Chaka Khan's ``I'm Every 
Woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw myself,'' he later told Ms. Robledo. Soon the pants he  
wore turned into shorts, and the shorts into skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	He found a more comfortable place to live, a group home for gay  
youths. He found some peace. 
</P>
<P>
	His 18th birthday brought him a $10,000 settlement from a  
childhood traffic accident. Waiting for it, he talked of little 
except using the money to reunite with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd say, `I'm gonna get that money and go home, and  
everything's going to be good again,''' Ms. Robledo said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he received the check, he bought gifts for his younger  
brothers. He also took out a life insurance policy, naming his 
mother as beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
	He left Streetwork full of hope.  
</P>
<P>
	But days later he was back, despondent, Ms. Robledo recalled. It  
hadn't worked out was all he would say. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Ali met Dion Webster and Kevin Freeman at Streetwork.  
</P>
<P>
	Webster was tough, smart-mouthed, quick to anger and wise beyond  
his years. He had been on the streets more than half of his life, 
he told people. He was 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman was the reserved one, distant, sharing little with  
people. He was 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they formed a family of outcasts.  
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't have a family of their own, so they created one  
for themselves,'' said Siciliano, director of Safe Space, another 
drop-in center. 
</P>
<P>
	And together the three worked the streets.  
</P>
<P>
	By day, East Harlem's Marcus Garvey Park is a breath of fresh  
air in a concrete jungle of housing projects; by night, it is a 
blanket of darkness with pools of hard light from street lamps. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was convenient to their new part-time home -- a shack  
built out of discarded aluminum siding, rubber tires and bricks. 
</P>
<P>
	It became a home of last resort after their eligibility for New  
York's youth shelters ended at age 19. 
</P>
<P>
	It was then Ali's drug use escalated, his drug of choice crack  
cocaine, $5 to $10 a vial. The drug eased the degradation and fear 
of selling himself, he said in the AIDS coalition interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Life was closing in: In 2 1/2 years, Ali was arrested 42 times.  
Jumping subway turnstiles. Possession of drugs. Prostitution. He 
went to jail at least seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	His appearance became outlandish -- a wig, skirt, combat boots  
and a two-day stubble. With an exaggerated walk, small steps and 
arms bouncing, the once shy boy now called himself Luscious. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drugs and the prostitution, Ali attended counseling  
sessions at outreach programs. The meetings were an outlet. He 
developed an aptitude for peer counseling and became an advocate 
for street safety, preaching commandments for self-preservation. 
One of them: Always make sure somebody sees you go with a trick. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore a black vest jacket with a back pocket filled with  
condoms that people could take as he passed by. He bragged about 
being HIV negative. 
</P>
<P>
	With outreach workers, Ali pounded the pavement. ``I approach  
the drug dealers and (say), `I'm buying some drugs, you want some 
condoms?''' he said in the AIDS coalition interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	His work brought attention and he was invited to San Francisco  
in 1996 to tell social workers about the needs of homeless 
transgendered kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he saw a future for himself, this was it,'' Ms. Robledo  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He stood before a crowd, recounting his story. Afterward, many  
congratulated him. But no one offered him a job. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The corner of East Harlem's Third Avenue and 122nd Street is  
quiet, except for the sound of high heels striking concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	The garages and stores are shuttered. Christina Devoe steps out  
from behind a tree, wearing a red minidress, walks toward a car and 
leans in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty dollars.''  
</P>
<P>
	The man behind the wheel shakes his head and drives off.  
</P>
<P>
	Devoe, a 35-year-old transgender whose real name is Christopher,  
has worked these streets for more than a decade. This is someone 
who does not cry easily. 
</P>
<P>
	But the voice softens, recollecting the three boys. Devoe was  
the one who called them the Three Musketeers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were sweet kids. It shouldn't have happened like that,''  
Devoe said, recalling one cold night: Nov. 4, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali stood on the street corner shivering, pleading with Webster  
to call it a night. Freeman had already left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I promise we'll leave after this one,'' Webster said. ``This  
is one of my regulars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the last time they ever spoke.  
</P>
<P>
	When Webster didn't return, Ali headed home -- a spot on the  
floor of Devoe's apartment that he shared with Webster. 
</P>
<P>
	When he awoke hours later, word was already out among the  
transgendered prostitutes that one of their own was dead -- knifed 
in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	At the police precinct, Ali identified his friend. ``He cried  
and cried and cried. It's like his whole world sort of caved in,'' 
Ms. Robledo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, according to Ms. Robledo, Devoe and others, he told the  
police everything he saw: the make and model of the car, the 
description of the john and how he was one of Webster's regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	Police turned down repeated requests by The Associated Press to  
discuss the allegations, the murder or the suspected murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali hit the streets nightly for weeks after the murder, working  
the same area, hoping to glimpse the killer. Weeks turned into 
months. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that, Ali just went downhill,'' said Ms. Robledo. ``In  
his eyes, he had lost the only family he had ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Ali cursed the police. Once, in a meeting at the AIDS coalition,  
he wondered aloud when he would join Webster. He attempted suicide 
twice, with overdoses. 
</P>
<P>
	His drug use increased. He dropped weight. He got into fights.  
He was kicked out of outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ali and Freeman still hung out sometimes, Webster's  
death, for whatever reason, had driven a wedge between them. 
</P>
<P>
	By spring 1997, shortly before his 21st birthday, Ali was trying  
to put the death behind him. He moved in with a friend who gave him 
money, lessening the lure of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
	But soon, he was lying to sneak out. ``I would tell him I was  
doing outreach. I would get high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Freeman was getting into trouble. He was making deals  
with drug dealers, promising to pay later -- with interest -- but 
failing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman's body was found by a passerby -- face down in the dirt  
at Marcus Garvey Park on June 20, 1997. His skull was nearly split 
in half. 
</P>
<P>
	Word on the street was that Freeman was killed in a drug deal  
gone bad. Ali reportedly knew the dealer; they had done business. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Safe Space Talent Show is a favorite among street kids. It's  
one night when they can dress up and show off for an approving 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Ali's favorite night of the year. Here, he was the star.  
</P>
<P>
	From its beginning in 1995, Ali sang in the show. By 1996, he  
was closing the show with a preacher-style oratory put to music, 
known as ``hymning.'' It was a talent he picked up as a child 
singing in the church choir. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Ali took to the stage one last time. His song  
prophetic: 
</P>
<P>
	``Though the storms keep on raging in my life,  
</P>
<P>
	``and sometimes its hard to tell the night from day.  
</P>
<P>
	``Still that hope that I pray for is reassured,  
</P>
<P>
	``as I keep my eyes upon the distant shore.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know he'll lead me safely to that pleasant place he has for  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone call came the morning of Dec. 5, 1997. The police  
officer said he had a John Doe at Harlem Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali, Siciliano thought.  
</P>
<P>
	Just four days earlier, he had talked with him. Ali was sitting  
in the 49th Street subway station. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen you in a while,'' Siciliano said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been away,'' Ali told him, explaining he'd been in jail  
for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Siciliano remembered asking him what he was doing. Ali told him  
he had a date, meaning prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be careful,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Later that night, Devoe saw Ali and remembered him saying he had  
something he had to take care of: He had taken drugs from a dealer 
and had promised to pay the next day. But before he could, Ali had 
gone to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4 a.m., police responded to a 911 call: Shots fired; a man  
down on the sidewalk in front of a housing project on East 131st 
Street. No I.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Yola Norville stood in the hospital room staring at the body  
swaddled in white, life support machines attached. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' she said. ``That's Ali Forney.''  
</P>
<P>
	Siciliano had sent Ms. Norville, a coworker, to identify the  
body. ``He looked like he was sleeping,'' she said. The bedding was 
tucked around his body with only his shoulders, arms and head 
protruding from the white cocoon. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman stood at the bedside, crying. She introduced herself as  
Ali's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mother?'' Ms. Norville thought. She couldn't bring herself to  
tell the woman that Ali told everybody she was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Ms. Robledo arrived. ``He looked like that boy who I had  
first met,'' she said. ``It's like all those years and experiences 
were washed away from his face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	When homeless teens die in New York City, a memorial service is  
held at a Times Square church. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, it is in a small sanctuary. But when 75 people --  
street kids, outreach workers and the Forney family -- showed up, 
Ali's memorial was moved into the church's main sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, people paid tribute to Ali. Some called him  
Luscious. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Robledo, who still keeps Ali's lapsed life insurance policy  
in her desk, said some words. So did friends from Safe Space, which 
recently announced it will open a special home for transgendered 
youths, the Ali Forney House. 
</P>
<P>
	The year of his death, Ali had closed the talent show singing,  
``God loves everybody for who they are.'' At the service, Siciliano 
closed the book on his life saying the same words.

<HEADLINE> Bodybuilders Stripped of Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Six bodybuilders were stripped of their  
medals at the Arab Games on Saturday after testing positive for 
muscle-building steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Substances that showed up in the tests were Nandrolone,  
Metenolone, Stanozolol and testasterone, according to Reda Kazem, 
head of the Arab Games Doping Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the bodybuilders tested positive for more than one  
steroid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time that bodybuilding was included in the  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug-control committee targeted bodybuilders because the  
Arab Union of Bodybuilders, preparing for the Sydney Olympics, 
wanted to show that its competitors were clean, Kazem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing their gold medals were Iraq's Asad Jaafar and Zahi Ammar  
of Algeria. Egyptian Ahmad el-Sayed and Lebanon's Yousef al-Zein 
lost their silver medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's Bilal Abu Rajuh and Lebanese Mahmood Shukair had to  
give back bronze medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazem said four athletes tested positive for Nandrolone, which  
has shown up in a rash of tests in recent months in other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug testing was introduced in the Arab Games for the first time  
in 1997 when the event was held in Beirut, Lebanon. Twelve athletes 
tested positive for banned substances during those games.

<HEADLINE>  Tough Road for Buckeyes Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Ohio State's players are trying not  
to look at their problems getting to the Kickoff Classic as a bad 
omen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's been bad so far,'' linebacker Na'il Diggs said.  
``Hopefully, it'll get better as the weekend goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, the Big Apple has been rotten for the Buckeyes.  
</P>
<P>
	They waited for 90 minutes to depart Columbus on Friday and only  
were permitted to leave after they left behind all of their baggage 
because the plane couldn't take the weight. 
</P>
<P>
	And that came after it became public that two of their top  
linebackers would not play in the game, one because of a suspension 
for a violation of team rules and the other because of academic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see, we're scrambling around here,'' a harried John  
Cooper said upon arrival at a news conference Friday afternoon at 
Giants Stadium. ``We were delayed a couple of hours in Columbus for 
whatever reason. And our luggage gets in here tonight at 10 
o'clock. Other than that, it's been a great trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's first plane had mechanical problems, so another was  
flown in to take its place. But it couldn't accommodate the 
players, coaches and all of their baggage, so all of the team 
members' personal items and clothing were left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes were forced to wear the same white polo shirts and  
khakis or jeans all day, including to a bowl function on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami had similar problems on Thursday night. The Hurricanes  
were scheduled to depart Miami at 6:30 p.m., but didn't leave until 
7:50 because of the backup of air traffic in the wake of a powerful 
storm in the New York and Newark, N.J., area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes' destination was shifted to Kennedy Airport,  
resulting in a longer bus trip to the team hotel in Teaneck, N.J. 
The players were supposed to be in the hotel by 10 p.m., but didn't 
get in until 12:30 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were able to sleep in an hour later because of their travel  
problems, and had a tour of New York cut to a boat tour of New York 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State wasn't able to make up for the lost time. The delay  
cut the Buckeyes' 1 hour and 15 minute practice to 25 minutes on 
the grass field at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sure could have slept in a little,'' Ohio State safety Gary  
Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The travel snafu further aggravated Cooper and Ohio State  
administrators who revealed Friday that Courtland Bullard and Chris 
Kirk would not be available for the game. The linebackers were 
candidates to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullard was suspended for a game for an unspecified ``violation  
of team rules,'' according to Cooper. Asked what the violation was, 
Cooper snapped, ``I'm not getting into that!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk missed most of the August practices while he did his  
classwork, leaving the door open for sophomore Jason Ott to take 
over at middle linebacker. Kirk hoped to take the spot vacated by 
longtime friend and fellow Westerville native Andy Katzenmoyer, who 
left a year early and was drafted by the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will really affect us depthwise,'' Cooper said. ``We're  
going to be scrambling a little bit at those positions in this 
ballgame.''

	``As you can see, we're scrambling around here,'' a harried John  
Cooper said upon arrival at a news conference Friday afternoon at 
Giants Stadium. ``We were delayed a couple of hours in Columbus for 
whatever reason. And our luggage gets in here tonight at 10 
o'clock. Other than that, it's been a great trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's first plane had mechanical problems, so another was  
flown in to take its place. But it couldn't accommodate the 
players, coaches and all of their baggage, so all of the team 
members' personal items and clothing were left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes were forced to wear the same white polo shirts and  
khakis or jeans all day, including to a bowl function on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami had similar problems on Thursday night. The Hurricanes  
were scheduled to depart Miami at 6:30 p.m., but didn't leave until 
7:50 because of the backup of air traffic in the wake of a powerful 
storm in the New York and Newark, N.J., area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes' destination was shifted to Kennedy Airport,  
resulting in a longer bus trip to the team hotel in Teaneck, N.J. 
The players were supposed to be in the hotel by 10 p.m., but didn't 
get in until 12:30 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were able to sleep in an hour later because of their travel  
problems, and had a tour of New York cut to a boat tour of New York 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State wasn't able to make up for the lost time. The delay  
cut the Buckeyes' 1 hour and 15 minute practice to 25 minutes on 
the grass field at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sure could have slept in a little,'' Ohio State safety Gary  
Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The travel snafu further aggravated Cooper and Ohio State  
administrators who revealed Friday that Courtland Bullard and Chris 
Kirk would not be available for the game. The linebackers were 
candidates to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullard was suspended for a game for an unspecified ``violation  
of team rules,'' according to Cooper. Asked what the violation was, 
Cooper snapped, ``I'm not getting into that!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk missed most of the August practices while he did his  
classwork, leaving the door open for sophomore Jason Ott to take 
over at middle linebacker. Kirk hoped to take the spot vacated by 
longtime friend and fellow Westerville native Andy Katzenmoyer, who 
left a year early and was drafted by the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will really affect us depthwise,'' Cooper said. ``We're  
going to be scrambling a little bit at those positions in this 
ballgame.''

<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Ronald Cerritos' goal with 23 seconds  
left forced a shootout and John Doyle scored the winning goal in 
the tiebreaker as the San Jose Clash beat the New York-New Jersey 
MetroStars 2-1 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Lewis, Dario Brose and Alejandro Sequeira also scored in  
the shootout for the Clash (14-10). 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars (5-21) lost their 11th consecutive game.  
</P>
<P>
	Dallas held a 1-0 lead for most of the game, following Billy  
Walsh's goal in the ninth minute. But with the Clash pushing 
forward in the final minute, Cerritos took a shot from the middle 
of the penalty arc and beat goalkeeper Tim Howard just inside the 
left post. 
</P>
<P>
	In the shootout, the MetroStars took leads of 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2  
on goals by Petter Villegas, Miles Joseph and Ramiro Carrales. But 
Lewis, Brose and Sequeira countered, Clash goalkeeper Joe Cannon 
stopped Mark Semioli's attempt in the seventh round, and Doyle then 
made the game-winner.

	Hurricane Threatens Bahamas, U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Whipping up gale-force winds that doubled  
over coconut palms and storm surges that crashed onto roadways, 
Hurricane Dennis closed in on the northern Bahamas and threatened 
to strike Florida. Forecasters said Dennis could strengthen and hit 
the United States as a major storm today, clawing up the Florida 
coast and heading into North Carolina by Monday. From hundreds of 
miles away, Dennis kicked up 8-foot-high waves off Florida and 
North Carolina, delighting surfers but prompting officials to put 
state troopers and the National Guard on alert. Hurricane watches 
and tropical storm warnings were issued along hundreds of miles of 
the eastern seaboard.

	Indonesian Landslide Kills Dozens

<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Rain triggered a landslide at a  
government-run gold mine in Indonesia's West Java province, killing 
at least 30 miners, news reports said today. The Berita Buana 
newspaper reported that about 10 other miners were missing and 
believed trapped under the earth and rocks. The landslide occurred 
on Wednesday. It was the second fatal landslide at the Pongkor mine 
near Bogor, 50 miles southeast of the capital of Jakarta, this 
year.

	Several Killed in Yemen Blasts  
</P>
<P>
	SAN`A, Yemen (AP) -- Authorities refuse to speculate if bomb  
blasts, which killed several people in three Yemen cities, were 
related. In the Yemeni capital of San`a today, a car bomb killed 
several people, injured many others, and damaged a number of 
embassies and diplomatic homes. No diplomatic personnel were 
injured in the 2 a.m. explosion outside a supermarket in the Hadda 
area, which came hours after two bombs went off in southern Yemen. 
Officials could not give an exact number of casualties in the 
latest explosion. In the southern port city of Aden, a bomb 
exploded near the National Bank building, slightly damaging the 
walls surrounding the building. And in Zinjibar, a bomb went off in 
front of the prosecutors's office. Authorities refused to speculate 
if the three blasts were related.

	Explosion Hits Downtown Pristina  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A strong explosion rocked downtown  
Pristina today, damaging a communist-era monument to ethnic harmony 
and reflecting anew the hatreds bedeviling international efforts to 
establish normality in postwar Kosovo. Nobody was hurt in the 
predawn explosion, said members of the NATO-led peacekeeping force, 
but the power of the blast rattled windows in a section of the 
Kosovo capital. The three-pronged concrete Brotherhood and Unity 
monument was erected during the rule of Josip Broz Tito, founder of 
communist Yugoslavia and a proponent of multiethnic coexistence. 
Tito died in 1980, and the breakup of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines 
turned bloody a decade later, with the Serb-Albanian conflict in 
Kosovo just the latest conflict.

	Turkey Punishing Shoddy Builders  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Responding to widespread anger at  
shoddily constructed buildings that collapsed during last week's 
earthquake, the Turkish parliament passed a bill today that 
attempts to relieve overcrowded jails by giving amnesty to 
thousands of prisoners -- excluding builders. The bill frees 
juveniles and some prisoners who received sentences of up to 12 
years and would have included builders convicted of negligence. 
Their exclusion was mainly a symbolic gesture, since few have been 
prosecuted in the past for haphazard building practices. Builders 
drew nationwide ire after the Aug. 17 quake flattened thousands of 
poorly constructed buildings, killing 13,479 people and injuring 
tens of thousands. Several thousand bodies are believed to be still 
buried under the rubble.

	Waco Filmmaker Finds Satisfaction

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- For years, filmmaker Michael McNulty accused the  
government of lying about its actions during the seven-week 
confrontation with Branch Davidians that ended in fiery tragedy in 
1993. Finally this week, after years of denials, the government 
admitted it did use pyrotechnic devices the day the Davidian's 
Mount Caramel compound burned down, killing David Koresh and about 
80 followers. But while McNulty said he is gratified the truth is 
finally coming out -- he believes there is more that is yet to be 
revealed. ``Getting answers is satisfying, but it will be much more 
satisfying when the people who are responsible are in prison,'' he 
said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball owners have told umpires they will be  
fired if they strike next week. AL president Gene Budig and NL 
president Len Coleman sent the warning in an Aug. 25 memo that many 
umpires received before they worked last night's games. Some of the 
umpires backing union head Richie Phillips have talked about 
striking over baseball's refusal to allow 22 umpires to withdraw 
their resignations, which are effective Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi Gov. Hopeful Risked All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- For a longshot chance to become  
Mississippi's governor, Dan Gibson gave up most of his worldly 
possessions -- a $208,000 antebellum home, two Cadillacs and antique 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	It was God's will that he do so, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, trounced in his party's primary, he's without a job and  
living in a one-bedroom apartment with his wife, Tonya, and 
5-year-old son, Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I would have loved to have won, but looking back on  
it, I really wasn't prepared for it,'' Gibson said with an 
interminably upbeat, Southern drawl. ``I need more maturity. Not 
only in government and politics, but more maturity as a 
Christian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, the former real estate agent gave up the post of  
mayor of Crystal Springs, to which he was elected in 1996, and sold 
his possessions to finance his longshot bid to win the Republican 
nomination for the state's highest office. 
</P>
<P>
	He came in fourth in a six-candidate field in the Aug. 3  
primary. Former U.S. Rep. Mike Parker won the nomination to face 
Democratic Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove in November. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one will hear the 34-year-old Gibson complaining about  
the downturn in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``God is providing. We have not had to beg for bread and I don't  
think we are going to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He calls his new Jackson apartment ``cozy.'' He acknowledges  
that it is old and says that as soon as he and his wife moved in 
they started painting the walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Until he bought a used car this past week, he had been driving a  
pickup borrowed from a fellow member of his church. 
</P>
<P>
	Just months ago, the family lived in a 4,300-square-foot house  
with five bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths. Now, all three share a bedroom, 
with a separate bed for Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonya Gibson, 27, said making the transition from the large  
house to the apartment has been ``physically hard and mentally 
hard,'' but said selling the house was for the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never utilized the house that we had so it really didn't  
make sense (to keep it),'' she said. ``At one point, I had wished 
that we had our cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since his election loss, Gibson has received one offer. He said  
he's interested in returning to real estate, or possibly starting a 
nonprofit organization focusing on family issues. He also won't 
rule out staying in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson says he has no regrets about trying to win over voters  
with a platform promising to bring God back to politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``God's way is higher than our ways,'' he said. ``Sometimes we  
don't see the full picture until we go through something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others believe Gibson sacrificed too much.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's an incredible commitment he made,'' said former  
gubernatorial candidate Pete Johnson. ``I've known governors as far 
back as J.P. Coleman in the 50s, and I have never heard of any 
candidate selling his house to put money in the campaign. That's a 
commitment that's above and beyond the call of duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a Clarksdale lawyer who lost the Republican nomination  
to Gov. Kirk Fordice in 1991, said Gibson should be admired for his 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the eyes of many it was something quite foolish, but I've  
got to respect that,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson said he is not broke, and has always had a place to lay  
his head since selling his house, with the family even invited to 
live with supporters after the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``God has just really blessed us through this whole thing,'' he  
said with a smile. ``The most important thing is that we have 
learned so much about what is important in life. Family, even being 
in a one-bedroom apartment, is so much more important than keeping 
up with the Joneses.''

<HEADLINE> Tough Road for Buckeyes Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Ohio State's players are trying not  
to look at their problems getting to the Kickoff Classic as a bad 
omen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's been bad so far,'' linebacker Na'il Diggs said.  
``Hopefully, it'll get better as the weekend goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, the Big Apple has been rotten for the Buckeyes.  
</P>
<P>
	They waited for 90 minutes to depart Columbus on Friday and only  
were permitted to leave after they left behind all of their baggage 
because the plane couldn't take the weight. 
</P>
<P>
	And that came after it became public that two of their top  
linebackers would not play in the game, one because of a suspension 
for a violation of team rules and the other because of academic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see, we're scrambling around here,'' a harried John  
Cooper said upon arrival at a news conference Friday afternoon at

<HEADLINE> Abortion Issues Dogs GOP Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abortion, the chronic issue in campaigns for  
the Republican presidential nomination, is back on the agenda, one 
of the candidates having lapsed into candor on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain is the political target of anti-abortion  
activists after saying that: 
</P>
<P>
	--To reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion  
now would force thousands of young women to have illegal and 
dangerous operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--He'd choose a vice presidential nominee and nominees to the  
Supreme Court based on their overall qualifications, and would not 
require that they oppose abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Right to Life Committee said McCain flip-flopped,  
having answered yes on a 1998 questionnaire that asked whether he 
supported complete reversal of the abortion decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He replied that he still does, unequivocally, although he's said  
it shouldn't happen until ``we stop this dangerous operation'' 
through counseling, adoption and other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we ought to work to eliminate abortion as a part of  
American life,'' he said on CNN, an improbable, almost certainly 
impossible goal. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also said he was proud of his 17-year record of voting  
for anti-abortion positions in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote the anti-abortion lobby that he hoped he'd clarified  
any ambiguity on his position. But his successive statements made 
it cloudier. For candidates other than the conservative absolutists 
on abortion, a little ambiguity can be useful. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, most Americans don't see the issue in absolute terms  
-- although polls over the years since the court ruling show about 
six people in 10 would oppose an outright ban on legal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy  
Research also says majorities also favor restrictions such as a 
24-hour waiting period, counseling on alternatives, parental 
consent and other limits, which are vehemently opposed by the 
abortion rights lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	That study by public opinion analysts Karlyn Bowman and Everett  
Carll Ladd said surveys after the 1992 and 1996 elections show 
abortion was not a pivotal issue for most voters. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is amplified in the narrower arena of Republican  
primaries and conventions, where conservative abortion foes make up 
a greater share of the vote. That's why the call for a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortion is written into Republican 
campaign platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion opponents have enacted, and just renewed, an assortment  
of bars to federal spending for abortions, but by narrow margins, 
far short of the two-thirds it would take to approve a 
constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	So it's a debating point, not a realistic prospect. That does  
not silence the critics of candidates who say they support an 
amendment but that it can't be done because most Americans don't 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush, the leader for the 2000 GOP nomination,  
takes that position, which irks the purists. So does his statement 
that he'd apply no litmus tests in choosing Supreme Court nominees, 
meaning that he wouldn't limit the field to abortion opponents, as 
the more conservative candidates pledge to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also drew conservative criticism when he was quoted in a  
Talk Magazine article as saying he didn't know whether the number 
of abortions in Texas had gone up or down while he's been governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably down,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Not because of  
anything we've done, though. We haven't passed any laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole said she'd support a constitutional amendment if  
one were possible. ``But of course it's not,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes said much the same thing as a candidate in 1996.  
He's hardened his line in this campaign, seeking to become the 
conservative alternative to Bush. ``Any judge I appoint for life 
will be pro-life,'' he said in a radio ad. ``Some of the 
politicians who are running for president won't tell you what kind 
of judges they would appoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With variations, all those lines have been heard before. And  
will be again, in the campaign and when 2000 Republican platform 
writers act, and almost certainly renew, the plank supporting a 
constitutional amendment against abortion.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Slams Clinton on Veto Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arizona Gov. Jane Hull accused President  
Clinton today of playing politics with Americans' money by 
threatening to veto the $792 billion in tax cuts passed by 
Republicans last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining a list of Republican governors and members of Congress  
who have used the GOP's weekly radio address this summer to tout 
the tax cuts, Hull asked rhetorically why Clinton would veto the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He either has a deep-seated desire to increase government  
spending, or he just does not want to give the money back to the 
people who earned it in the first place,'' she said. ``President 
Clinton is playing politics with your money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House says the Republican tax-cut plan, if enacted,  
would squeeze future budgets to the point where it would force 
automatic cuts in Medicare and other basic federal services. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Clinton said the proposed 10-year tax cut  
would create ``an impossible budgeting problem'' requiring cuts of 
nearly 50 percent in programs ranging from education to air traffic 
control to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a decade, the bill would reduce all income tax rates by one  
percentage point, cut capital gains taxes, improve retirement 
savings, ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by many two-income 
couples, gradually eliminate the alternative minimum tax, provide 
new breaks for education and health care and benefit large and 
small businesses.

<HEADLINE> Five Dead in Domestic Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five people were found fatally shot late  
Friday in what investigators suspect was a murder-suicide sparked 
by a domestic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers received a report of gunfire about 8:30 p.m. and  
arrived to find two women and three men dead in a Koreatown 
apartment, Lt. Sharyn Buck said. The women were believed to be in 
their 20s, but the men's ages were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty sure it's a murder-suicide,'' she said. ``There  
are witnesses saying that the wife and husband were having a 
dispute. She had come back today -- apparently had moved out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buck said investigators believe the shooter is among the dead,  
but was unsure of who it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Edith Arreola, a 15-year-old who lived in a neighboring  
apartment complex, said she was watching television when she heard 
the gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard screaming and then they shoot, like, 20, 21, 23,  
shots, and the lady was screaming 'help','' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koreatown is a working class, ethnically mixed community located  
about 4 miles west of downtown.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Forgoes Waldorf Astoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A swanky, $30,000-a-month suite above the  
Waldorf Astoria Hotel, traditionally reserved for the U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations, has been occupied by a junior 
staffer since Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke decided to pass it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ambassador will continue to live in his private home in  
Manhattan rather than the Waldorf suite -- one of the most 
sought-after U.S. diplomatic residences, The Washington Post 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Holbrooke's 27-year-old assistant, R.P. Eddy, will  
enjoy the luxury digs until he finds his own apartment. The young 
man is being allowed to stay there to save the government the money 
for a separate hotel room, the Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The official ambassador's residence has mostly been vacant since  
last September, when Bill Richardson left to become President 
Clinton's energy secretary. Holbrooke reportedly plans to use it to 
entertain foreign dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was sworn in as ambassador this week after a 14-month  
delay in his confirmation by the Senate, a delay caused by 
Republican-erected hurdles and an ethics investigation that has 
since been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was on an official visit to the Balkans on Saturday,  
and neither he nor his staff were available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Waldorf suite is in the Art Deco ``Towers'' section of the  
hotel, with a separate entrance on 51st Street between Park and 
Lexington avenues. It has been used as the official U.S. 
ambassador's residence since 1949.

<HEADLINE> Explosions Kill Two in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN`A, Yemen (AP) -- A car bomb exploded outside a supermarket in  
an upscale diplomatic neighborhood Saturday, killing at least two 
people in the most serious blast in the capital since Yemen's 1994 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Glass shards and charred debris littered the tree-lined streets  
near several foreign embassies. Death toll reports ranged from two 
to six, and 12 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Several suspects were arrested and being questioned, according  
to an Interior Ministry statement. Initial indications were that 
the motive was not political, it said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Turkish Embassy was heavily damaged, and doors and windows  
were blown out in homes and offices up to a half mile away. No 
diplomatic personnel were reported injured or killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy, six miles away in the capital's eastern  
suburbs, was not affected, but the home of U.S. cultural attache 
Chris Eccles was slightly damaged. Eccles was on vacation, a U.S. 
Embassy employee said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Offices of the Washington-based National Democratic Institute,  
which assists in elections worldwide, also were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Businessmen said the supermarket's owner -- Abdullah al-Omairi,  
who died in the explosion -- may have been the target. Last week, 
al-Omairi advertised in area newspapers that his partners hadn't 
fulfilled their duties so he was taking sole ownership of the 
store, a popular place among foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Islamic fundamentalists responsible for the  
December kidnapping of 16 Western tourists -- four of whom died in a 
botched rescue attempt -- had threatened to continue to target 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no claim of responsibility for the blast, or for two  
others in southern Yemen. Hours earlier in the southern port city 
of Aden, a bomb caused slight damage near the National Bank 
building. And in nearby Zinjibar, a bomb went off in front of the 
prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported in those explosions. Authorities  
refused to speculate if the three blasts were related.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil To Aid Earthquake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq will start pumping more oil to aid  
victims of Turkey's earthquake, the official Iraqi News Agency said 
Saturday, although it was unclear whether the move had U.N. 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	INA said Iraqi's aid package would be $10 million more than  
United States' quake aid contribution. Iraq's Red Crescent Society 
and its Turkish counterpart have agreed to hand out revenue from 
the extra oil exports to families of the victims, INA reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has been barred from unauthorized oil exports since the  
U.N. Security Council imposed an embargo following Iraq's 1990 
invasion of Kuwait. But the council launched a so-called 
oil-for-food program in 1996 to try to care for Iraqis suffering 
under the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether Iraq had obtained U.N. approval to sell  
more oil to help Turkey. Iraq is only allowed limited exports of 
$5.2 billion each six months. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials could not immediately be reached for comment, and  
a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department in Washington said 
they were unaware of the development. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.N. rules, proceeds from oil sales must go to a U.N. fund  
that oversees Iraqi humanitarian purchases meant to cut the impact 
of U.N. trade sanctions on ordinary Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
	INA said the Iraqi cabinet, following a meeting chaired by  
President Saddam Hussein, ordered the Oil Ministry to go ahead with 
the exports, but it did not make clear whether the pumping has 
started. 
</P>
<P>
	INA said Iraq was determined to sell enough oil to make a  
contribution to Turkey larger than the United States'. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run newspapers also said preparations were under way to  
send an Iraqi medical team to attend those injured in the Aug. 17 
earthquake, which killed tens of thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	They called on Turkey to reconsider its anti-Baghdad policies by  
helping put an end to the flights by U.S. and British planes based 
in Turkey patrolling a no-fly zone in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Baghdad has long contended that it is suffering a humanitarian  
catastrophe because of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Saeed Hasan called the United  
States ``a bloodsucker of the people,'' and complained that Iraqi 
children are dying at an alarming rate because of the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited both a report by Secretary-General Kofi Annan which  
concluded that the U.N. relief program could not put an end to the 
deteriorating humanitarian situation in Iraq, and the first survey 
of child mortality in Iraq since 1991, released this month by 
UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the charge, a senior U.N. official called for a  
halt to the use of Iraqi children for ``propaganda purposes.''

<HEADLINE> United 1, Rapids 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Ben Olsen slipped behind the defense 16 minutes  
into the game and scored to give D.C. United a 1-0 victory over the 
Colorado Rapids on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was a showdown of MLS conference leaders with United  
(19-7) leading the East and Colorado (16-8) ahead in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Jorge Dely Valdes had an apparent goal disallowed  
with four minutes to play after the referee whistled Marcelo Balboa 
for an off-the-ball foul. 
</P>
<P>
	The call was criticized from Rapids coach Glenn Myernick.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will not be afraid to say tonight that we got cheated by the  
referee,'' Myernick said. ``He called a foul on a tangle in the box 
in the middle when the ball went to the far post?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lone goal came when United beat Colorado's offside trap.  
Jamie Moreno played back for Geoff Aunger on the right before 
looping the ball behind the Rapids' back line. Olsen slipped in and 
beat the trap.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys, Broncos Get Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The Denver Broncos and Dallas Cowboys  
should have powerful offensives this season. They just haven't 
shown them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team's first unit had nine drives over three exhibition  
games and each scored one touchdown. It's not much cause for panic, 
but it is a slump both teams would like to shake out of Sunday 
night when the starters get their last extended look of the 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver and Dallas will both stick with their first teams  
throughout the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody talks about how good or bad a team looks in  
preseason and it really doesn't matter,'' Cowboys quarterback Troy 
Aikman said. ``We're evaluating players, seeing which guys are 
doing what and how aggressive they're playing and whether they know 
their assignments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An offensive fade was behind Dallas' 2-4 skid to end last season  
and many of the problems were addressed in the offseason. So far, 
there's been little improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman ended three drives by fumbling a snap and throwing two  
interceptions. Fellow starters haven't helped, committing five 
penalties for 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking at results so much,'' Aikman said. ``We're  
working on a lot of different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who is 0-8 in exhibition games over  
two summers, is looking for improvement more than a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it goes great, we don't need to pat ourselves on the back  
and say we're a lock for the Super Bowl,'' Gailey said. ``We know 
we have work to do no matter what.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver is 2-1 this preseason but its only score from the first  
team was a 3-yard touchdown run by Derek Loville in the second 
game. Despite the drought, the two-time Super Bowl champions aren't 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``So what?'' receiver Rod Smith said. ``It's not like we're not  
going to score any touchdowns. Just right now, it's a feeling-out 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Elway could brush off his August critics the way Aikman is,  
but it's not as easy for Elway's successor, Bubby Brister. He's 
made himself an easy target by throwing interceptions on the first 
play of Denver's first and third games. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister fully understands the pressure he's facing and hopes  
that more playing time Sunday will give him a better chance to get 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We moved the ball pretty well in every game, but we just shot  
ourselves in the foot,'' Brister said. ``We need to get in there 
and score and finish off drives and gain some confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One way of doing that would be by giving the ball to Terrell  
Davis as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to that, seeing where I am as far as my  
stamina and whether I can go a half down there in the hot Dallas 
weather,'' he said. ``It should be a good test for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister will be relieved by Brian Griese. Chris Miller will miss  
a third straight game with tendinitis in his throwing elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury report is improving for the Cowboys as receiver  
Raghib Ismail, offensive linemen Everett McIver and Tony Hutson and 
cornerback Charlie Williams are expected to get into their first 
games of the summer. Running back Chris Warren should be back after 
missing the New England game. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas also will be keeping a close watch on how veteran Alonzo  
Spellman handles his first full-time gig at defensive tackle. The 
lifelong end moved inside this week as an experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys still won't have linebacker Quentin Coryatt  
(Achilles' tendon) or cornerback Kevin Smith (bulging disk). 
</P>
<P>
	While both teams will use the first two quarters to evaluate  
their overall progress, the second half will be final auditions for 
reserves fighting to stick around past Tuesday, when rosters are 
cut to 65 players.

<HEADLINE> Opponent's Title Entices Mullings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- David Reid is more concerned with Keith  
Mullings than he is with his droopy left eyelid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keith Mullings is a tough guy, but that's what we're here  
for,'' Reid said. ``There's only going to be one winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid defends his WBA 154-pound title tonight against Mullings,  
who held the WBC version of the title before losing it earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll do it once again with the droopy left eyelid that proves  
so enticing to his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``People question my eye, but it's not a big deal,'' Reid said.  
``I know I'm not worried about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid has undergone three different operations to repair the  
eyelid, which tends to come down in fights and limits his vision 
out of the left eye. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problem hasn't damaged the career of the 1996 Olympic  
gold medalist, who is undefeated in 13 fights and won the WBA title 
March 6 with a decision over Laurent Boudouani. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with the eyeball, it's the eyelid that  
comes down,'' Reid's trainer, Al Mitchell, said. ``Sometimes it 
comes down in a fight and sometimes it doesn't. But he can see, and 
that's the main thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the eye has proven to be an attractive target for Reid's  
opponents, and Mullings is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely something to go after,'' Mullings said. ``But  
I may just go after the other eye and close that one, too. Then 
he'll be totally blind in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid will make the second defense of his title -- and the second  
in just six weeks -- in the scheduled 12-round fight on a card at 
the Hard Rock hotel-casino that will be televised on HBO beginning 
at 11 p.m. EDT. Both fighters weighed in Friday at the class limit 
of 154 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last fight, Reid was knocked down by Kevin Kelly and  
taken the distance for the third straight time, but still ended up 
with a unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, who stopped seven of his first 10 opponents, hasn't  
knocked anyone down since, while hitting the canvas three times 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really worried about it because I'm getting the  
wins,'' the 25-year-old from Philadelphia said. ``Whenever a guy 
looks like he's a superior fighter and he gets taken to the 
distance, people question him. But I'm at the top of my game and 
I'm very confident in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid is a 4-1 favorite against Mullings, who held the WBC  
version of the 154-pound title after stopping Terry Norris in the 
ninth round Nov. 6, 1997, in a shocking upset. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullings (16-5-1, 11 knockouts) didn't enjoy his championship  
reign long, though, losing the title after only one defense in a 
disputed 12-round split decision to Francisco Castillejo in Spain 
on Jan. 29. It was the fourth split decision loss of Mullings' 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beating Reid would finally give me the recognition I  
deserve,'' said Mullings, a 31-year-old from Brooklyn, N.Y., who 
began his pro career at the age of 25 following a stint in the Army 
that saw him serve in Desert Storm. ``If I beat the gold medal 
winner, I'll be the one people are talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the card is undefeated heavyweight Monte Barrett of New  
York, who will put his 21-0 record against Lance Whitaker, a 
6-foot-8 puncher who lost for the first time in 19 pro fights when 
he dropped a 10-round decision to Lou Savarese on March 6.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Confirms Tripp Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky has confirmed the  
authenticity of taped conversations secretly recorded by Linda 
Tripp, according to court documents filed by state prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	A Maryland grand jury indicted Mrs. Tripp on July 30 on two  
felony counts, charging that she illegally tape-recorded the former 
White House intern on Dec. 22, 1997 and disclosed the contents of 
the conversation to Newsweek magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 16, Ms. Lewinsky listened to copies of tapes made by  
Tripp in October 1997, and confirmed the identities of the voices 
on them, state prosecutors said Thursday. Mrs. Tripp testified that 
she taped several conversations with Lewinsky in late 1997, even 
after an attorney told her it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also disclosed that the copies were provided to the  
state by Lucianne Goldberg, a New York literary agent. Ms. 
Goldberg, who testified in Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
investigation last November, said she urged Mrs. Tripp to start 
taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp turned over the tapes to Starr, triggering the  
investigation into Ms. Lewinsky's affair with President Clinton. In 
return, she received a federal grant of immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Mrs. Tripp have asked a judge to dismiss the  
charges, arguing state prosecutors improperly relied on her 
immunized testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli has denied that his office  
used information gathered by federal sources.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Considers Smog Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- After demanding for years that the Midwest  
drastically cut the floating pollutants that acidify Northeastern 
rain and sully air with smog, Northeastern leaders are considering 
a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	While the plan put on the table last week would still require  
lower emissions from power plants and factories than those 
currently coming out of the Midwest, it would allow emissions at a 
rate higher than New York and 10 other states originally pushed 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't agreed to anything yet,'' John Cahill, commissioner  
of New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, said 
Saturday. ``We have to weigh the proposal and benefits with the 
costs of litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cahill said the compromise could be an opportunity to get better  
air quality more quickly, instead of fighting potential court 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the compromise plan was put together at the request of  
the Environmental Protection Agency by him and officials from the 
other northeastern states -- Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode 
Island and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Cahill has acted as the lead negotiator throughout the talks  
with the 14 Southern and Midwestern states. Environmentalists are 
upset with New York's commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cahill should be fighting to make sure the Midwest has to  
clean up to the same standards that New York plants have to meet,'' 
said Peter Iwanowicz, director of environmental health for the 
American Lung Association of New York. ``Anything less than that is 
going to equal more misery for people with lung diseases and that's 
just unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise involves nitrogen oxide.  
</P>
<P>
	Acid rain or snow is caused by nitrogen and sulfur mixing with  
airborne moisture. Many of the chemicals are produced by in the 
Midwest, where emissions standards are lax, but are carried to the 
Northeast by wind. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the Northeast has said it would meet a standard  
-- and demand the same of other states -- of 0.15 pounds of nitrogen 
oxide emissions for every million British thermal units of fuel 
consumption in the summer, when hot weather worsens ozone levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The solution now being considered would ask the Midwest to bring  
the level to 0.25 by 2003. But Cahill said even that wouldn't be 
acceptable unless there was an agreement to go to 0.20 by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Umpires' Union Fees Are Pricey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The umpires' failed resignation strategy is  
costing 22 of them their jobs. All, however, are paying a lot of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires are charged 25 percent more per person in union fees  
than players, according to federal disclosure documents obtained by 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, it came to an average of $5,756 for each of the 66  
members of the umpires' union, according to a form filed in April 
with the U.S. Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The union imposes annual dues of $500 per member plus a $1,000  
initiation fee, collecting a total of $28,000 last year. In 
addition, umpires paid their union $351,922 in special assessments. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, players owe their union $25 in dues for each day  
they are on an active major league roster, $4,575 for an entire 
183-day season. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, however, they never pay a cent because the money  
they accrue from the union's licensing program is more than 10 
times the amount they owe in dues. That enables them to cover their 
multimillion-dollar legal fees for collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	While umpires make $95,000 to $282,500 annually, according to  
seniority, player salaries range from $200,000 to $11.9 million 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the umpires' money appears to be going to their  
legal team, headed by Richie Phillips. The union lists no 
employees, but paid $406,293 last year in professional fees, which 
were listed as expenses and reimbursements. That was up from 
$377,900 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Jan. 1, the union had $94.63 in assets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've asked for the records. I've asked, in written form, for  
the expenditures, but have received no response,'' said AL umpire 
Dave Phillips, one of the umps opposed to the union leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even some of these people who are board members haven't been  
invited to participate,'' said Dave Phillips, who is not related to 
the union leader. ``If you're one of Richie's guys, in his comfort 
zone, you get that information. If you're not, you get absolutely 
zero. That's one of the big, big issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the form did not say to whom the professional fees were  
paid, Richie Phillips and two lawyers on his staff, Pat Campbell 
and Bob Opalka, have done most of the legal work for umpires in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips could not be reached Saturday to comment on the  
disclosure forms, according to a member of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amount of money our law firm earns from the Major League  
Umpires Association is privileged,'' Campbell said Saturday. ``The 
major league umpires have other professionals, including 
accountants who prepare tax returns. There are other expenses of 
the Major League Umpires Association in addition to attorney 
fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union president Jerry Crawford, an NL umpire, said Dave Phillips  
had been given a full accounting of union money for the past 12-15 
years but was not provided a copy of the federal filing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's public record. We don't have to give him a copy of  
anything,'' Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of their failed resignation strategy, umpires hired  
a major New York labor law firm, Cohen, Weiss and Simon, and that 
figures to cause a marked increase in special assessments for this 
year, which has raised questions among the umpires who oppose 
Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Aug. 19 letter to umpires accompanying a position paper  
filed with the National Labor Relations Board outlining unfair 
labor practice charges against owners, Richie Phillips said ``at 
least 10 labor lawyers exhausted hundreds of hours of research in 
developing this document.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of concerns, but the major concern is getting  
everybody their job back,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers at major New York law firms bill $200 an hour and up,  
meaning legal work costs a minimum of $20,000 for each 100 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a bill,'' Crawford said. ``When it's all said and done,  
we will figure it out. Right now, everybody's willing to bite the 
bullet. If we win, it's worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While players are able to spread their costs over 750-plus union  
members, umpires are a much smaller group, raising the amount each 
individual must pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that's what the leagues are counting on,'' Crawford  
said. ``I think it's worth it. You have to take a shot at it.''

<HEADLINE> Waco Filmmaker Finds Satisfaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- For years, filmmaker Michael McNulty accused the  
government of lying about its actions during the seven-week 
confrontation with Branch Davidians that ended in fiery tragedy in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally this week, after years of denials, the government  
admitted it did use pyrotechnic devices the day the Davidian's 
Mount Caramel compound burned down, killing David Koresh and about 
80 followers. 
</P>
<P>
	But while McNulty said he is gratified the truth is finally  
coming out -- he believes there is more that is yet to be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting answers is satisfying, but it will be much more  
satisfying when the people who are responsible are in prison,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this is not about Mike McNulty, or the films that have  
been done, or about selling the films. It's about finding the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty's 1997 film, ``Waco: Rules of Engagement,'' is based on  
grainy, black and white videotape recorded by an FBI surveillance 
aircraft circling over the compound. It was nominated for an Oscar 
in 1998 for Best Documentary Feature. 
</P>
<P>
	The film suggests that after Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
agents botched the raid of Koresh's compound 10 miles east of Waco 
on Feb. 28, 1993, the FBI recklessly attacked the religious group 
50 days later, on April 19, with tank-driving commandos, intent on 
avenging the death of four agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The film cast doubt on Justice Department claims it used only  
non-burning grenades on April 19, 1993. McNulty said he found 
physical evidence to that effect -- one pyrotechnic shell and a 
photograph of another shell that had been misidentified -- more than 
a year after the movie's release. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence will be included in the Fort Collins, Colo.,  
resident's second film, ``Waco: A New Revelation,'' to be released 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, following a former FBI official's  
acknowledgment of the devices, said on Wednesday that the 
incendiaries were used and ordered a full investigation. Congress 
now says it also will investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American public has a right to know the truth,'' said  
Danny O. Coulson, the retired FBI assistant deputy director whose 
statements sparked Reno's admission. ``And we have an obligation to 
tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Coulson's statements to The Dallas Morning News that  
forced this week's admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Rangers, custodians of the evidence through an  
arrangement with the federal government, earlier this year opened 
an inquiry into evidence identified by McNulty. 
</P>
<P>
	David Thibodeau, a former Koresh follower and one of nine siege  
survivors, said Friday that the latest revelations are ``things we 
were saying for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People automatically just did believe what they were told  
because the government and certain members of the press did such a 
good job of demonizing the Branch Davidians,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has attracted a cadre of researchers, experts and  
lawyers who consider themselves government watchdogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona attorney David Hardy has fought his battles through open  
records laws, repeatedly winning Freedom of Information lawsuits 
against agencies that denied him access to documents about the 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Hardy won $32,000 in attorney's fees -- the only  
financial remedy allowable in such suits -- after a judge ruled the 
FBI and ATF had ``stonewalled'' his requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exhilarating because I've spent three years compiling  
these documents, and to finally have them all, in the space of a 
week, become useful is great,'' Hardy said of the new public 
scrutiny. ``We had to pry those documents away from the government 
one at a time.''

<HEADLINE> Military Clashes in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Government soldiers clashed  
repeatedly with Muslim rebels this week after the rebels allegedly 
abducted a 4-year-old girl, and at least 16 people have died in the 
fighting, the military said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead included two soldiers and the rest were rebels, the  
military said. 
</P>
<P>
	Troops tried Saturday to overrun a camp of the Moro Islamic  
Liberation Front in the southern Philippines province of Basilan, 
550 miles south of Manila. Meanwhile, helicopter gunships and army 
artillery pounded an area of the province's hinterlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The military operation was launched Wednesday after negotiations  
for the release of the kidnapped girl broke down. The child, 
Wilmarie Furigay, was abducted more than two weeks ago, is the 
granddaughter of a former mayor of Lamitan, a local town. 
</P>
<P>
	Shariff Julabbi, a regional Liberation Front leader, denied the  
rebels were involved in the girl's kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	The military said the kidnappers seized the girl because of a  
personal feud with her grandfather, from whom they are demanding 
$12,820 and 30 head of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberation Front and the government, longtime foes, have  
begun preliminary peace talks and signed a cease-fire agreement, 
but sporadic clashes continue.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane A Distant Threat in S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- As Hurricane Dennis inched closer to  
the lower East Coast today, surfers took advantage of high waves 
and tourists bathed in the sun on the beach, taking reports about 
the approaching storm system in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just watch the weather periodically,'' said Shara  
Lindsey-Walters, as she husband Frank Walters and their two 
daughters sat in the sand Friday afternoon at Myrtle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We trust Myrtle Beach will give us plenty of warning,'' said  
Walters, from Staunton, Va. ``Myrtle Beach is ready for that kind 
of stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis strengthened slightly today with wind hitting a sustained  
100 mph. The storm was expected to move parallel to the coast of 
Florida on a path that could take it to the Carolinas on Monday or 
Tuesday. Five-foot surf washed northern Florida beaches today. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a chance the storm could stall off the coast of the  
Carolinas, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane 
Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear of a stall is that it makes the storm surge much  
larger because it sits there and pushes water up onto the coast for 
a long period of time,'' he said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hurricane threat, Thomas Edwards, manager of the  
Holiday Sands Motel that overlooks the beach, said Friday the motel 
was booked solid with about 400 people and no one had called to 
cancel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the governor calls a mandatory evacuation of the area,  
it's business as usual,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials put state troopers and the National Guard on alert.  
</P>
<P>
	Tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches were in effect  
today along the Florida coast, and a heavy surf advisory was issued 
for the coast of Georgia. The storm was expected to parallel the 
Florida shore through Sunday, with the center remaining about 100 
miles out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. EDT, the hurricane was centered about 35 miles north  
of Abaco in the Bahamas, or about 220 miles east-southeast of Cape 
Canaveral, Fla., the hurricane center said. It was moving toward 
the northwest at about 6 mph and was expected to gradually turn 
toward the north-northwest on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	While surfers took advantage of the waves, county officials  
removed traffic signs, lifeguard towers and barricades from the 
beach so they wouldn't be blown away by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrimp boats returned early to Port Canaveral, and the South  
Florida Water Management District lowered water levels in canals to 
lessen the risk of flooding in heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, the governor ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, while in North 
Carolina, 150,000 coastal residents were put on alert, as were 
state troopers and emergency management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	However, most people in this city that thrives on tourism  
enjoyed the sun and surf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not really a huge issue right now,'' lifeguard Mike Miehm  
said, who said he was in for a lot of work ``because people try to 
get in as much surfing before the hurricane. It's really 
dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Breakers Hotel, manager Kay Harris said most of 400 rooms  
were filled for Friday night with golfers, tourists and some 
reporters. She said reports of the storm chased away a lot of 
walk-in business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally we have a trail of traffic up (U.S.) Highway 501 and  
tonight there's nothing,'' Ms. Harris said. With the weather 
channels and the Internet, she said, ``it seems we start earlier 
with the worry and warnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near Charleston, S.C., John Pharr, a senior at the College of  
Charleston, was surfing 5-foot waves at Folly Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's happened before,'' the Virginia Beach, Va., resident  
said. ``I'm not too worried.''

<HEADLINE>  Tough Road for Buckeyes Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Ohio State's players are trying not  
to look at their problems getting to the Kickoff Classic as a bad 
omen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's been bad so far,'' linebacker Na'il Diggs said.  
``Hopefully, it'll get better as the weekend goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, the Big Apple has been rotten for the Buckeyes.  
</P>
<P>
	They waited for 90 minutes to depart Columbus on Friday and only  
were permitted to leave after they left behind all of their baggage 
because the plane couldn't take the weight. 
</P>
<P>
	And that came after it became public that two of their top  
linebackers would not play in the game, one because of a suspension 
for a violation of team rules and the other because of academic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see, we're scrambling around here,'' a harried John  
Cooper said upon arrival at a news conference Friday afternoon at 
Giants Stadium. ``We were delayed a couple of hours in Columbus for 
whatever reason. And our luggage gets in here tonight at 10 
o'clock. Other than that, it's been a great trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's first plane had mechanical problems, so another was  
flown in to take its place. But it couldn't accommodate the 
players, coaches and all of their baggage, so all of the team 
members' personal items and clothing were left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes were forced to wear the same white polo shirts and  
khakis or jeans all day, including to a bowl function on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami had similar problems on Thursday night. The Hurricanes  
were scheduled to depart Miami at 6:30 p.m., but didn't leave until 
7:50 because of the backup of air traffic in the wake of a powerful 
storm in the New York and Newark, N.J., area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes' destination was shifted to Kennedy Airport,  
resulting in a longer bus trip to the team hotel in Teaneck, N.J. 
The players were supposed to be in the hotel by 10 p.m., but didn't 
get in until 12:30 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were able to sleep in an hour later because of their travel  
problems, and had a tour of New York cut to a boat tour of New York 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State wasn't able to make up for the lost time. The delay  
cut the Buckeyes' 1 hour and 15 minute practice to 25 minutes on 
the grass field at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sure could have slept in a little,'' Ohio State safety Gary  
Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The travel snafu further aggravated Cooper and Ohio State  
administrators who revealed Friday that Courtland Bullard and Chris 
Kirk would not be available for the game. The linebackers were 
candidates to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullard was suspended for a game for an unspecified ``violation  
of team rules,'' according to Cooper. Asked what the violation was, 
Cooper snapped, ``I'm not getting into that!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk missed most of the August practices while he did his  
classwork, leaving the door open for sophomore Jason Ott to take 
over at middle linebacker. Kirk hoped to take the spot vacated by 
longtime friend and fellow Westerville native Andy Katzenmoyer, who 
left a year early and was drafted by the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will really affect us depthwise,'' Cooper said. ``We're  
going to be scrambling a little bit at those positions in this 
ballgame.''

to look at their problems getting to the Kickoff Classic as a bad 
omen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's been bad so far,'' linebacker Na'il Diggs said.  
``Hopefully, it'll get better as the weekend goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, the Big Apple has been rotten for the Buckeyes.  
</P>
<P>
	They waited for 90 minutes to depart Columbus on Friday and only  
were permitted to leave after they left behind all of their baggage 
because the plane couldn't take the weight. 
</P>
<P>
	And that came after it became public that two of their top  
linebackers would not play in the game, one because of a suspension 
for a violation of team rules and the other because of academic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see, we're scrambling around here,'' a harried John  
Cooper said upon arrival at a news conference Friday afternoon at 
Giants Stadium. ``We were delayed a couple of hours in Columbus for 
whatever reason. And our luggage gets in here tonight at 10 
o'clock. Other than that, it's been a great trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's first plane had mechanical problems, so another was  
flown in to take its place. But it couldn't accommodate the 
players, coaches and all of their baggage, so all of the team 
members' personal items and clothing were left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes were forced to wear the same white polo shirts and  
khakis or jeans all day, including to a bowl function on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami had similar problems on Thursday night. The Hurricanes  
were scheduled to depart Miami at 6:30 p.m., but didn't leave until 
7:50 because of the backup of air traffic in the wake of a powerful 
storm in the New York and Newark, N.J., area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes' destination was shifted to Kennedy Airport,  
resulting in a longer bus trip to the team hotel in Teaneck, N.J. 
The players were supposed to be in the hotel by 10 p.m., but didn't 
get in until 12:30 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were able to sleep in an hour later because of their travel  
problems, and had a tour of New York cut to a boat tour of New York 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State wasn't able to make up for the lost time. The delay  
cut the Buckeyes' 1 hour and 15 minute practice to 25 minutes on 
the grass field at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sure could have slept in a little,'' Ohio State safety Gary  
Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The travel snafu further aggravated Cooper and Ohio State  
administrators who revealed Friday that Courtland Bullard and Chris 
Kirk would not be available for the game. The linebackers were 
candidates to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullard was suspended for a game for an unspecified ``violation  
of team rules,'' according to Cooper. Asked what the violation was, 
Cooper snapped, ``I'm not getting into that!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk missed most of the August practices while he did his  
classwork, leaving the door open for sophomore Jason Ott to take 
over at middle linebacker. Kirk hoped to take the spot vacated by 
longtime friend and fellow Westerville native Andy Katzenmoyer, who 
left a year early and was drafted by the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will really affect us depthwise,'' Cooper said. ``We're  
going to be scrambling a little bit at those positions in this 
ballgame.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Midway Battle Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the ``Lost Letter of Midway,'' newly discovered  
recollections of Vice Adm. Stanhope Cotton Ring, who wrote in 1946 
about the early hours of the pivotal World War II Battle of Midway, 
June 4-6, 1942: 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Early on the morning of 4 June we received word that the  
Japanese attacking force had been located and that initial attack 
on Midway had been made. Course from Hornet's position to the enemy 
was plotted and immediate preparations made to launch the Air 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	It is ... my understanding that USS Enterprise Group (which  
engaged the Japanese carriers) was favored with later information 
of the whereabouts of the enemy than was the Hornet Group. Although 
communications in 1942 were most unreliable between air and surface 
craft, even though Hornet might have broken radio silence to keep 
the Group informed of the latest developments, there was no 
assurance that such information would have been received by the 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	My change of Air Group course to the south was based entirely on  
my estimate of the situation (which proved faulty) and not on 
definite information of the enemy movements. ... VT-8 (Ring's 
torpedo bombers) and Enterprise Group made contact with the enemy, 
north of the point at which I turned south. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	I then resumed my dead reckoning course to intercept Hornet,  
proceeding singly at 20,000 feet. Since oxygen supply was failing, 
and I began to notice the effects of lack of oxygen, I dropped 
gradually to 10,000 feet. ... After about 4.5 hours in the air (and 
having assured Parker, my radioman, that a water landing could be 
easily effected), I sighted the white wakes of a Task Force at high 
speed. Further investigation revealed it to be our own force. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Reports concerning the enemy were meager on 5 June, but in  
midafternoon contact report was received on an enemy carrier 
``disappearing to the westward into a front.'' ... On the way out 
on the search we flew over the scene of 4 June attack on Japanese 
(carriers) and observed many survivors in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	During the forenoon of 6 June we received a contact report on an  
enemy force. ... Hornet Air Group was launched to search and 
attack. ... During these operations ``first name'' calls were used, 
so that when VB-8 which was on the left flank of our scouting line 
sighted the enemy, Lt. Cmdr. Johnson called on the voice radio: 
``Stanhope from Robert, enemy below on port bow.'' As an indication 
of how alert the Japanese were, in a very short time the following 
message in very oriental tone came over the air: ``Stanhope from 
Robert, return to base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In executing our dive bombing attack, everyone did much better  
than he had (in a futile attack) the day before, when buck fever 
probably had us. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	We had lost Yorktown, (destroyer USS) Hammann, VT-8 and many  
other pilots, but the Japanese had suffered heavily. Undoubtedly 
the cream of their naval aviation was destroyed in the sinking of 
their four carriers. We felt then (as was later proved) that we had 
dealt the Japanese a decisive defeat.

<HEADLINE> Caretaker Gets Life Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A woman who admitted setting fire to a  
75-year-old man she was entrusted to care for, hacking him apart 
with an ax and scattering pieces of his body in the woods, avoided 
the death penalty by pleading no contest in exchange for a life 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nora Swails, 50, received the no-parole sentence Friday. She was  
charged with killing retired Air Force Lt. Col. Cornell 
Christenson. Neighbors who noticed he failed to take down his flag 
last Veterans Day reported him missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Swails later led police to some of his dismembered remains.  
</P>
<P>
	She worked for Christenson and his 77-year-old wife, Shirley,  
who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. Mrs. Christenson died of a 
stroke a week after her husband's remains were found, a death 
police believe Swails caused with unneeded insulin injections. 
</P>
<P>
	Swails was not charged in Mrs. Christenson's death. She meant to  
profit from Christenson's death after forging his name on a 
traveler's check, a personal check and the title to his car, 
Escambia County sheriff's investigator Frank Fillingim said.

<HEADLINE> Western Wildfires Still a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Firefighters in the Western states were making progress Saturday  
on blazes that have burned more than 200,000 acres, though hot 
weather and frequent lightning strikes continued to pose a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like things are stabilizing,'' said Janelle Smith, of  
the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. ``There are a 
lot of new lightning strikes but we are getting to them as best we 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week's worth of effort paid off Saturday, as firefighters  
approached containment on the largest fires. Crews then did a 
largely successful job of concentrating their efforts on new and 
remaining fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen large fires were burning in California, Nevada, Oregon  
and Texas, though nine were expected to be contained Sunday. Over 
200,000 acres had been consumed. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the fires were in Northern California, drawing  
more than 7,000 firefighters. The fires took up most of the state's 
firefighting budget only two months into the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada's biggest blaze, north of Reno, blackened 40,000 acres.  
Full containment was expected by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire near Oregon's Sheldon-Hart National Wildlife Refuge  
charred 30,000 acres and was expected to be contained by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas National Guard helicopters were called out to battle a  
1,700-acre fire west of Lampasas. 
</P>
<P>
	A 600-acre blaze near Okanogan, Wash., was completely contained  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern California's weekend weather was expected to be hot,  
but tempered by lower winds. Montana, eastern Idaho and Wyoming 
were to see some scattered thunderstorms. That would mean dangerous 
lightning but also rain.

<HEADLINE> FBI Handling of Waco May Be Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by the latest furor over federal law  
enforcement's conduct during the final, fateful hours in the 1993 
standoff with the Branch Davidians, Congress is scurrying to review 
years-old hearing records and organize a fresh round of inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional ire was raised with the FBI's admission Wednesday  
-- after years of claims to the contrary -- that a ``very limited 
number'' of incendiary tear gas grenades were lobbed near the 
Davidians' compound outside Waco, Texas, in the hours before the 
wooden structure erupted in flames. The acknowledgment came on the 
heels of a newspaper report challenging the earlier statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now clear that the Justice Department misled the  
Congress and the American people,'' said House Government Reform 
Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., accusing officials of 
``sitting on this evidence for six years, all the while maintaining 
that it didn't exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, who dispatched investigators to Austin this week to  
review evidence gathered from the compound's charred remains, 
pledged to convene hearings, calling them ``absolutely essential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, agreed: ``We've got to  
get to the truth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who  
pronounced the credibility of Attorney General Janet Reno's Justice 
Department at ``an all-time low,'' is moving towards hearings as 
well. House Judiciary Committee staffers are wading through 
testimony from the 10 days of nationally televised House hearings 
in 1995 to determine if new inquiries are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Bob Barr, who participated in the earlier hearings,  
suggested that Congress should consider perjury charges. 
</P>
<P>
	A clearly frustrated Reno, who had earlier assured Congress that  
only non-burning tear gas was used during the April 19, 1993, 
assault, ordered up a probe of her own. ``I don't think it's very 
good for my credibility,'' she said of the FBI's about-face. 
``That's the reason I'm going to pursue it until I get to the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, for one, said he expects little from the Justice probe.  
``I'm sure information will be slow in coming,'' the frequent 
Clinton administration critic said. ``With this administration, 
it's always that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, who has been a favorite target of congressional  
Republicans over her handling of issues including Whitewater and 
Democratic campaign fund-raising, will face the hot seat again. 
Burton said he will summon Reno to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Burton's announcement, Reno said she would welcome  
congressional oversight. ``I'll be happy to cooperate in every way 
that I can,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither the Justice Department nor Congress can properly  
investigate the matter, argued Danny Coulson, the former senior FBI 
official who touched off the controversy by publicly revealing that 
military pyrotechnic canisters were used in the waning hours of the 
51-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Justice Department ``has no business'' investigating  
itself and called congressional hearings political theater. He 
suggested an independent investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needs to be investigated and decided in a cooler  
environment, one away from the TV cameras,'' said Coulson, who was 
a deputy assistant FBI director during the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred by the FBI's reversal, Barr and others are pressing for  
inquiries far afield of the tear gas issue. They are demanding 
answers to some nagging controversies, among them why the Army's 
secretive Delta Force was on the scene, and whether shots were 
fired into the compound by federal agents on the siege's final day 
-- a contention the government has vigorously denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have always been serious lingering questions and now,  
with this latest information, I think it's imperative that we look 
into it,'' Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Film producer Michael McNulty, who next month will release a  
documentary that alleges government cover-ups at Waco, is hoping 
Congress will investigate. That said, the producer of ``Waco: A New 
Revelation'' gave Congress an ``F-minus'' for its hearings, saying 
both parties used the sessions chiefly to score political points. 
</P>
<P>
	``They missed the most important issue of all: What happened at  
Waco,'' said McNulty. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's admission doesn't change earlier findings that the  
fires were set by people inside the compound, Reno and FBI 
officials maintain. ``I have no reason at this point to believe the 
FBI is responsible for the deaths of those people,'' Reno said of 
cult leader David Koresh and some 80 followers who died during the 
inferno. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says the incendiary rounds were fired hours before the  
fire at a concrete bunker 40 yards from the compound after 
non-burning canisters proved ineffective. The pyrotechnic devices, 
which bounced off the bunker's roof and rolled into a field, could 
not have ignited the blaze, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	That assessment is shared by a member of the team of independent  
arson investigators who determined, during the 1993 Justice 
Department post-siege inquiry, that the fire was deliberately set 
in three places simultaneously inside the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Hastings, chief deputy fire marshal for Alleghany County,  
Pa., said the pyrotechnic canisters could not in ``any way, shape 
or form'' have started the fire.

<HEADLINE> Track Star Jones' Season in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Marion Jones flew home Saturday for  
further medical checks on the back injury which knocked her out of 
the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The American sprinter and long jumper was seeking a record four  
gold medals at the championships, but left with only one gold and a 
bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Track and Field said Jones, who lives outside Raleigh, N.C.,  
would be seen by her personal doctor before deciding whether to 
compete again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is in good spirits and is moving around well,'' a USTAF  
spokesman said. ``But she is still experiencing some back pains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilfried Meert, organizer of Friday's Golden League meet in  
Brussels, doubted Jones would be back for the event, which would 
cost her a chance at sharing the $1 million jackpot offered by the 
series of seven meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Meert said he was told that Jones would decide by Tuesday  
whether to run in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the 100 meters last Sunday in 10.70 seconds, Jones  
settled for bronze in the long jump, dashing her hopes for four 
gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was the heavy favorite in the 200, but she pulled up in  
her semifinal race and crumbled to the track with what was 
described as back spasms and cramps. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones withdrew from the rest of the championships.  
</P>
<P>
	Meert said he had been told that, in addition to spasms, Jones  
had experienced swelling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Van Damme Memorial meet is the sixth of the seven Golden  
League series in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be surprised if she does come back,'' Meert said. ``My  
personal opinion is no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meert also suggested it wouldn't be in Jones' interest to run  
against fellow American Inger Miller, who won Friday's 200-meters 
in 21.77 seconds, fastest time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have to meet her after an injury and after traveling  
back and after medical exams, that's a tough chore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is one of four still in contention for a share of the  
prize, which is split among athletes who win at all the Golden 
League meets.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ex-rapper Mase swore off hip hop to seek a higher  
calling. Now, he's seeking a higher education. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old, whose real name is Mason Betha, enrolled at  
Clark Atlanta University this semester, majoring in business. 
</P>
<P>
	Mase's religious convictions led him to leave rap behind and  
switch to gospel music. Magic Johnson's Los Angeles-based talent 
agency is now managing his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York native visited the historically black school two  
months ago before enrolling in classes, which began Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``He fits right in and acts just like any other student,'' said  
Getchel Caldwell, a school spokeswoman. ``He's not signing 
autographs. He's very serious about his education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may be downplaying his superstar status on campus, but he

<HEADLINE> US Doctor Using Turkey Connections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The doctor has treated not one patient  
since arriving in his ravaged homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	That was never his plan. Dr. Sait Tarhan of Minnesota's Mayo  
Clinic came to save lives by pulling strings. His friends here are 
government officials, powerful journalists, the rich and the 
well-connected. 
</P>
<P>
	In Turkey, ``I wouldn't go anywhere without him,'' said an aid  
worker with Connecticut-based AmeriCares, which brought Tarhan and 
41 tons of supplies last week on a DC-8 cargo jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarhan's group arrived five days after a 7.4-magnitude  
earthquake crippled Turkey on Aug. 17, killing more than 12,000 
people and injuring some 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Even under normal circumstances, the bloated Turkish bureaucracy  
is moribund. Now, it barely staggers along and Tarhan's connections 
are invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tarhan, a Turk who emigrated to America in 1958, was on the  
job before he landed here. When the quake set a giant refinery 
burning out of control, he called friends at the Ankara government 
crisis center and gave them the name of a Texas company that helped 
extinguish Kuwait's raging oil field fires during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	The firefighters came. But Tarhan does not take credit. ``I  
doubt it was because of me,'' he said, eating breakfast at his 
hotel before leaving to check distribution efforts at the giant 
warehouse holding AmeriCares relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarhan refuses to say exactly whom he knows in high places.  
</P>
<P>
	But he does say how he knows them.  
</P>
<P>
	For 35 years, he was an anesthesiologist at one of the  
prestigious Mayo clinics, which treat patients from all over the 
world. He tried to retire in 1997, but hospital administrators 
talked him into staying. Now he arranges all travel and medical 
needs for patients arriving from Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	In both jobs, he helped some of the country's highest-ranking  
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is how I move things around here,'' he said. ``I have  
established really close friendships. You help people out in their 
most desperate moments, and they never forget you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So ``when I call them up and say `I need your help. How can we  
make something happen?' They will give their help without 
hesitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is nervous about being interviewed. ``What are you going to  
write, eh?'' he asks several times. ``Please be careful not to make 
it look like I am exploiting my friendships with these people. 
Please be kind. Because we may need them again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time he has accompanied AmeriCares to Turkey  
after an earthquake. The first was in 1992, when 485 were killed by 
a 6.5-magnitude quake in the central city of Ercinzan. 
</P>
<P>
	He speaks fluent Turkish and is forever on his cell phone,  
arranging meetings and ways to distribute medicine, blankets and 
tents. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, accompanied by two aid workers and four journalists,  
he finagled his way into the country's largest navy installation, 
which has been sealed since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	The naval base is in Golcuk, one of Turkey's hardest-hit cities.  
More than 2,000 people died. At least 500 were Navy personnel, many 
of them top-ranking officers. The secretive military tried to play 
down its loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called a very powerful (newspaper) columnist. He called up  
and told the navy that some people were coming from the Mayo Clinic 
and that was that,'' said Tarhan. ``In every country, it's not what 
you know, it's who you know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the shattered base, where military headquarters operated  
under tents in pouring rain, Tarhan huddled with an admiral, 
speaking rapid-fire Turkish. Eventually the conversation turned to 
English, with several officers joining in. They needed temporary 
shelter, they told Tarhan, while an aid worker scribbled notes. 
</P>
<P>
	They also needed surgical kits and portable toilets, sleeping  
bags and tents. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Tarhan was asked what the admiral had said to him in  
Turkish. ``I think all military people are very careful, very 
secretive,'' he said. Then he smiled and winked. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, he stood outside a housing project near Izmit,  
another heavily damaged area. With him were the AmeriCares workers 
and two representatives of tobacco giant Philip Morris, which has 
offered to help erect a 200-tent city and provide food to its 
inhabitants until more permanent housing can be built. 
</P>
<P>
	The cigarette maker ``has a big presence in this country because  
the Turkish people just smoke way the hell too much.'' Tarhan 
chuckled. ``So let's just say, maybe this gives them a chance to 
repay the favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tarhan, now 67, was just out of the army when he came to America  
41 years ago to complete his medical residency. After four years of 
working in Kentucky and Ohio hospitals, he sent an application to 
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., thinking he was not good 
enough to get in. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was accepted. He chose to specialize in anesthesiology  
because ``I thought it was the easiest. I would be in the operating 
room all morning and playing golf in the afternoon,'' he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	His sense of humor is self-deprecating and mischievous. It also  
covers a sensitive heart. 
</P>
<P>
	He has always come home to Turkey, to visit family and to  
vacation with his American wife and two sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarhan was 4 when his Turkish family escaped the Russians in  
Crimea and fled to this country. 
</P>
<P>
	He loves Turkey and its people, and he is haunted by the  
devastation he sees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes an imprint on your subconscious,'' he said. ``And it  
comes back at the most unexpected times, like a movie that runs in 
your head. And it is the same one all the time -- the suffering, the 
smell. You cannot forget those things.''

<HEADLINE> Saints' Quarterback Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Billy Joe Hobert, expected to be the New  
Orleans Saints' starting quarterback this season, had to leave the 
exhibition game against the Green Bay Packers Saturday night after 
a helmet blow to his right side cracked a rib. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert spent last season on injured reserve after rupturing his  
Achilles' tendon in the first game of the year. He missed the first 
two exhibition games this year -- because of a groin pull before the 
first and the death of his sister before the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert stayed in Saturday's game for most of the first half,  
despite the injury. He was 10-of-15 for 179 yards and two 
touchdowns, a 12-yarder and a 58-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert was sacked three times, but said the injury occurred when  
a player's helmet hit him during a pass play.

<HEADLINE>  Brazilian Archbishop Camara Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian Archbishop Dom Helder  
Camara, whose campaigns against social inequality and human rights 
abuses won him international recognition, has died, church leaders 
said Saturday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	As Archbishop of Recife and Olinda, two neighboring northeastern  
cities in Brazil's poor northeast, Camara earned praise from Pope 
John Paul II, who called him a ``brother of the poor,'' and scorn 
from the military dictators who ruled Brazil, who called him a 
``subversive communist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camara died Friday night at his home in Recife, 1,520 miles  
northeast of Rio, after suffering a cardiac arrest, reports said. 
He had been admitted hospitalized with a urinary infection 10 days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Camara was a founder of the main Roman Catholic church body in  
Brazil, the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops, and 
continually worked to draw attention to the suffering of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	He campaigned for the government to combat drought in the dry,  
northeast and spoke out against Brazil's 1964-85 military 
dictatorship. His criticism even led to his home coming under 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Camara was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize four times,  
although he never received the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II sent a message to church leaders in Recife on  
Saturday, paying tribute to Camara. 
</P>
<P>
	French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin also issued his condolences.  
``The world has lost with him a great humanist and a free man,'' he 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in the northeastern city of Fortaleza, Camara was ordained  
at age 21. He moved to Rio de Janeiro in his late 20s and set up a 
series of charities before moving back to his native northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sermon of Dom Helder will be always present for us and all  
the church,'' Dom Jose Cardoso Sobrinho, who replaced Camara in 
1995 as Archbishop of Recife and Olinda, said in a radio interview.
