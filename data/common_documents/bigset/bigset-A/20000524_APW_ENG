<HEADLINE> Widows and children of slain Attica guards lobby in Albany  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Saying justice has been delayed for too
long, widows and children of guards slain in the 1971 Attica prison
riot asked state lawmakers to help their campaign for restitution.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives of the guards want an apology from the state and a
more comprehensive compensation package than what New York has
already approved. The relatives -- many who have been silently
discontent for years -- were galvanized into action this year after
inmates won approval of a $12 million settlement from New York.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 members of a group called Forgotten Victims of
Attica came to Albany on Tuesday to make their case. Deanne Quinn
Miller, whose father was slain by inmates as they took over Attica,
told the group that the state should accept some liability for the
loss suffered by her mother and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father was stolen from us,'' Miller said, her voice
choking. ''He missed our growing up. He missed our marriages. He
has missed his grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Surviving hostages and widows did receive some benefits from the
state. But many of them claim they were never told they forfeited
their right to sue for damages by cashing their benefit checks.
Many of the survivors have nursed feelings for years that New York
state treated them shabbily.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were pushed under the rug. We were lied to. We were
scammed,'' said Ann D'Arcangelo, the widow of slain hostage John
D'Arcangelo.
</P>
<P>
   This year after a federal judge approved the inmates' $12
million settlement -- with $4 million of that going to legal fees --
lawmakers responded by approving in the new state budget a $50,000
payment to each of the 11 families of slain prison workers.
</P>
<P>
   Those payments have been scoffed at by some survivors as too
little, too late. Some relatives say they won't cash the checks.
The victims group wants:
</P>
<P>
   --A formal apology from New York state;
</P>
<P>
   --All records related to the riot and subsequent investigations
opened;
</P>
<P>
   --Support of a memorial service outside the prison each Sept. 13,
the date of the bloody retaking of the prison;
</P>
<P>
   --The availability of psychological counseling to family members;
</P>
<P>
   --Additional money, including payments for the guards who were
injured or taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope that someone has the moral conviction to help us
see this through to some sort of resolution that gives us all some
closure,'' said Michael Smith, a prison guard who was taken
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Daniel Burling, a Republican whose district includes
Attica, told the group the expanded compensation package they seek
could cost from $50 million to $60 million. He said they would have
to ''raise a ruckus'' with lawmakers to get what they want.
</P>
<P>
   But both he and Republican state Sen. Dale Volker promised to do
what they could to help the group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether or not we can get an apology from the state of New
York, I don't know,'' Burling told the gathering. ''But I think we
can come pretty darn close to it.''

<HEADLINE> Bragman: ''I did the right thing''  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Former Assembly Majority Leader Michael
Bragman said a failed attempt to oust Speaker Sheldon Silver
doesn't mean he made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did the right thing,'' the Syracuse-area Democrat insisted
Tuesday. ''I don't care what the result is. This was a conscious
decision on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman resolution challenging state Assembly Speaker Silver's
leadership was defeated by the chamber Monday, but he said that was
''just the beginning'' of reform. Critics have complained that
Silver's method of doing business was autocratic and secretive, and
Bragman said he intends to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every revolution has to start some place. We've started the
revolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he plans to meet with his supporters in the newly
formed Democratic Majority Reform Caucus to discuss plans for
establishing reforms laid out in the groups' statement of
principles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to come back and talk about how we bring
change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will also not be dissuaded by any retaliatory moves from
Silver, he added. Bragman lost his leadership post last week, which
carried a $34,500-a-year stipend, and with it went his Capitol
office and some staff.
</P>
<P>
   He is also certain to be evicted from the majority leader's
office in the Legislative Office Building. Bragman's successor has
not yet been selected by Silver and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care if I'm in a broom closet,'' Bragman said. ''I'm
here because the majority wants change. We're going to move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said that he continued to be a ''friend'' to state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who became a central figure in the coup
attempt, if only in Bragman's mind. Bragman said he ''thought we
had a partnership'' with McCall that would include McCall using his
considerable influence with black state Assembly Democrats to help
Bragman against Silver.
</P>
<P>
   But McCall, the only black elected to statewide office in New
York, insisted that he viewed the Bragman-Silver dispute as a
matter only for Assembly Democrats and said he did no lobbying for
Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Carl and I need to talk,'' Bragman said on Albany
radio station WROW-AM on Tuesday. ''I need to know if he wants me
to support his gubernatorial bid. He and I will talk about the
whole past week and we'll go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman was an early backer of McCall for governor in 2002. The
other most likely candidate at this point is HUD Secretary Andrew
Cuomo, whom had been considered close to Silver.
</P>
<P>
   The McCall-Cuomo competition for governor grew to be one of the
bones of contention between Bragman and Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman has been in the Assembly for 20 years. He hinted Tuesday
that he intends to seek re-election in November, but added that he
will discuss his political future with his family and constituents
first before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any reason for not being here,'' he said. ''This
is far from over.''
</P>
<P>
   As of January, Bragman reported having about $943,000 in his
campaign account -- a huge amount for a state legislator.

<HEADLINE> Silver: I'm guilty of being a 'nice guy'  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A challenge to his job beaten back, Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver says his chamber's Democrats should come
together and put a week of intraparty strife behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Silver appeared before reporters Tuesday for the first time
since ex-majority leader Michael Bragman's challenge for speaker
emerged last week to say a ''time for healing'' had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to call many of the 19 dissident Democrats
who voted against him on Monday when the challenge to his position
formally failed on the floor of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Bragman's move against him was ''four years in the
making'' and that he probably should have heeded other members'
warnings about the ambitions of the ex-majority leader on his job.
</P>
<P>
   ''While other people have said it to me over and over again
during the four years, I chose not to believe it,'' Silver said.
''In hindsight, I am guilty of one thing, probably being an
optimist and a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though calling for party unity, Silver was anything but contrite
Tuesday as he appeared surrounded by more than 50 Democratic
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is stronger from what he called the ''family feud''
involving Bragman ''because we cut the cancer out of the leadership
team'' in the Assembly. Silver fired Bragman as majority leader
after he went public with his challenge to the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Very few of the dissidents supporting Bragman have
''legitimate'' concerns about how he has run the Assembly, Silver
contended. They included complaints that Silver is distant and hard
for members to see, that his staff controls the flow of legislation
and negotiations with the Senate and governor and that
rank-and-file members are shut out from meaningful participation in
the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Bragman supporters have issued a ''statement of principles''
calling on Democrats in the Assembly to reform the way they run the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver gave only vague answers to reporters' questions about
whether he would adopt reforms to give members more of a voice in
the operation of the Assembly. ''Criticism is always valid in
context,'' he said at one point Tuesday. Silver said later that
Democrats would rule in a ''more open fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his Democrats would look at the dissidents' proposed
reforms to ''make a determination as to which, if any, of those
items have some credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was not willing to acknowledge if the battle with Bragman
had convinced him to change his leadership style in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It obviously always gives you cause for introspection,'' he
said, ''always, both in terms of who you trust and who you don't
trust. How you operate. How you communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   A Silver supporter, Richard Brodsky of Westchester County, said
the speaker was not weakened by the overthrow attempt, and that
Bragman's coup had nothing to do with reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about the statement of principles,'' Brodsky said.
''Those have to be looked at. There may be something there that has
value to us. We're going to make that decision ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver himself said that using the words ''reform'' and
''Bragman'' together is an ''oxymoron.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver denied a frequent charge by Bragman in the past week,
that Silver and his allies had extorted support from dozens of
members by threatening their committee chairmenships or to ruin
them at the polls later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''No sir,'' he said. ''Me or any member of my staff did not call
or threaten anybody in this house.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, who also talked to reporters Tuesday, replied that,
''The members know that what I say is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver also said Bragman's contention that lobbyists formulate
legislation in the Assembly was ''unequivocally not true.''

<HEADLINE> Business group and insurance association laud Pataki proposal  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Merchants who lose business when nearby
disasters cut off customer access, like North Country shops did
when an ice storm struck two years ago, could get some relief from
a bill proposed by Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The ''civil authority'' insurance would allow policies to cover
business lost when governments close roads. It was quickly praised
by both a business group and an insurance association.
</P>
<P>
   ''We love it,'' Business Council spokesman Matthew Maguire said
Tuesday. ''It puts a business in a position where it can protect
itself a little bit more thoroughly for the effects of events that
are harmful but only indirectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sheldon, the owner of the Albany Tastee Freeze who lost
about half his business after torrential rains last week washed out
the road it sits on, was equally pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon said he is now working with his insurer on the
possibility he might be covered but is facing an obstacle since his
business was not damaged. The neighboring suburb of Bethlehem,
where most patrons live, was cut off by the road closing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue that needs to be addressed,'' Sheldon said.
''If (Pataki) wants to use me as a test case, send 'im on down. The
lieutenant governor had a cone here yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   As is, so-called ''business interruption'' insurance says a
business has to be physically damaged before a merchant can collect
money.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important change that must be made to protect
businesses from situations that are beyond their control,'' Pataki
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether any insurer would accept Pataki's
offer and provide the coverage. While the industry group New York
Insurance Association supports the bill, spokesman Bernie Bordeau
said Tuesday, insurers who offer that coverage would be engaging in
''risky business.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike the whims of nature ... you're now adding the whims of
a political entity,'' he said. Bordeau said his group was pleased,
however, that insurers would not be required to offer the coverage,
but would merely be allowed to. ''We like the fact that the
administration is giving new opportunities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's bill was in the Rules committee, which is controlled by
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said his proposal ''will help New York State business,
especially small businesses, stay in business during trying
times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly's Democratic leadership said they would ''take a
look'' at the bill.

<HEADLINE> Oneidas, counties seek to renew land claim talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- The Oneida Indian Nation and Madison and
Oneida counties want to take one more stab at settling the tribe's
long-standing land claim out of court.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed Monday with U.S. District Court Judge Neal
McCurn, the tribe and counties said they would like to continue
negotiations rather than have the judge declare an impasse and
schedule the land claim for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Oneida Nation remains committed to settling this land
claim through negotiations and wants to continue that process,''
tribal spokesman Mark Emery said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the two counties also see negotiations as the best
alternative, they said in confidential status reports filed with
McCurn, who pushed back his filing deadline several times in hopes
that the two sides would resume formal talks.
</P>
<P>
   New York state also would like to resume negotiations, but only
if the Oneidas are earnest about reaching a settlement, said
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been down this path before only to be disappointed by
their insistence of linking the land claim to gaming issues,''
McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas have said it was the state that has brought gaming
issues into the talks, seeking to secure a share of the profits
from the Oneidas' Turning Stone casino in Verona.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas, who now live in New York, Wisconsin and Canada, are
seeking compensation for 250,000 acres in Madison and Oneida
counties they claim the state purchased illegally in the late 18th
and early 19th centuries. Yearlong negotiations broke off April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Emery said Tuesday the nation had made ''additional constructive
ideas'' to the judge intended to help settle the land claim. He
would not elaborate on what those ideas were.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a settlement, the counties have insisted the
1,100-member Oneida Indian Nation of New York pay property taxes
and collect sales taxes from non-Indians who purchase goods on
reservation land. The counties have also demanded the Oneidas limit
reservation land to 25,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas have offered to pay the counties $20 million, in the
form of $1 million each year for 20 years, to offset sales taxes
they say sovereign Indian nations do not have to collect. They also
have offered to set aside $25 million of the settlement money for
the counties to offset unpaid property taxes and limit their
reservation to 40,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The 14,000-member Oneida Nation in Wisconsin told the judge they
see no point in continuing negotiations if the New York Oneidas and
the counties cannot compromise. The Wisconsin Oneidas have no
differences of opinion with the counties, said Arlinda Locklear,
their lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Media Crackdown Continues in Iran  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranian hard-liners, stung by the confirmed
victory of reformist candidates, shut down a newly launched
newspaper Tuesday, the 19th paper closed in a crackdown that began
last month.
</P>
<P>
   State-run radio also warned newspapers that questioning the
results of recent parliamentary elections could lead to
prosecution, as the feud between reformers and hard-liners over
alleged vote tampering deepened in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Mellat daily was banned by the judiciary for ''violating
press laws,'' a day after printing its maiden issue Monday,
according to Saeed Mortazavi, a judge who ordered the daily's
closure.
</P>
<P>
   In the Feb. 18 polls, reformist allies of President Mohammad
Khatami won about three-quarters of the 290 seats, seizing control
of the powerful parliament from hard-liners for the first time
since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Since the election, the hard-line crackdown has muted the
opposition. The Guardian Council, a panel dominated by hard-liners
that supervises elections, then threatened to annul the key
election results in Tehran, where an initial count indicated
reformers won 29 of the 30 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The council on Saturday finally endorsed the Tehran results
under pressure from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
but confirmed only 26 reformist victories. It gave two seats to
hard-liners, including one to former president Hashemi Rafsanjani,
and annulled two other reformist victories.
</P>
<P>
   The council has alleged widespread ballot fraud and has
threatened to prosecute Interior Ministry officials; the ministry
and council jointly handled the initial vote count. The council,
too, has been accused of vote tampering.
</P>
<P>
   After a three month delay, the finalized Tehran results showed
Rafsanjani jumping from No. 30 in votes received -- last of those to
win seats -- to No. 20. In recent days, the few remaining
independent newspapers have ridiculed the Guardian Council for
moving Rafsanjani up 10 places.
</P>
<P>
   ''Baseless charges about the final result of Tehran elections by
newspapers will be subject to prosecution,'' said Tehran radio,
which also is controlled by hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani is believed to be the hard-liners' choice for the
powerful position of house speaker.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent leader of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the
country's largest pro-reform party, has said reformers could block
Rafsanjani's entry to the house. Each deputy must be endorsed by
two-thirds of the Majlis, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, we should see whether or not Rafsanjani's
credentials will be approved in the parliament, let alone his
candidacy for the post of speaker,'' the daily Bahar quoted Mohsen
Mirdamadi, a top member of the Participation Front as saying
Tuesday. He is one of the potential candidates for the speaker's
post.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh, meanwhile, has
threatened to sue Ahmad Jannati, head of the Guardian Council, over
the fraud allegations against ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Jannati fails to prove his claims, he will be subject to
prosecution,'' the daily Bayan on Tuesday quoted Tajzadeh as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Tomb of Mummified Mayor Revealed  </HEADLINE>
By TANALEE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAWITI, Egypt (AP) -- For 2,500 years, an Egyptian mayor who
thought himself the pharaoh's equal, lay hidden in his grave until
a small hole revealed his resting place.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, an archaeological team led by Zahi Hawass was
digging in this city -- a little over a mile from the temple Djed
Khonsu Eus Ankh, the mayor of Bahariya Oasis around 500 B.C., had
built for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a hole in a tomb revealed a chamber of a neighboring
tomb. Hieroglyphs on the colorfully painted walls proved the crew
had found the celebrated mayor's final resting place.
</P>
<P>
   The finding was shown in a live broadcast Tuesday night as
Hawass' team led Fox Television along with actor Bill Pullman into
the tomb for the opening of the sarcophagi in the two-hour special:
''Opening of the Tombs of the Golden Mummies: Live!''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone was looking for the mayor because he was a very
important man,'' said archaeologist Hawass.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of his body had mostly deteriorated and were laying
inside two finely carved sarcophagi -- one inside the other --
surrounded by amulets.
</P>
<P>
   As the camera showed some bones and artifacts, an archaeologist
explained that the mummy had deteriorated over the centuries
because of the moisture and humidity in that part of the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the personality of the ancient figure was revealed
on the walls of his tomb. with drawing that depicted him as a
haughty figure who had apparently believed he was on a level with
the pharaoh.
</P>
<P>
   The tour took also viewers to the nearby Valley of the Golden
Mummies, where Hawass' team continued to unearth dozens of mummies
in a 2.32 sq.-mile cemetery dating back approximately 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   In several scenes, the explorers first lowered a mini-camera
into a small hole into the coffins, clearly showing still-intact,
mummified remains.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the valley, 235 miles southwest of Cairo, captured
world attention with the discovery of 105 mummies, most of them
covered in gold and plaster-covered linen with hieroglyphics
depicting gods, goddesses and funerary scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Hawass said that 102 mummies found in this year's two-month
digging season are mostly poor and middle class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays -- performed for the first time at an Egyptian
archaeological site -- suggest that most of those buried were
between 30 and 40 when they died, likely of kidney and liver
diseases which Hawass suspects was due to the high level of iron in
local water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day we understand more about the people who lived
here,'' said Hawass. ''This is the most scientific excavation ever
done in Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the tombs will not be open to the public, and his team
is covering up the latest findings as the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of our work is about preservation and conservation of
the mummies and artifacts,'' he said. ''We leave most as we found
them and exhibit some in the Bahariya Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Fox's second year broadcasting a live archaeological
event from Egypt. Last year, the station followed Hawass into a
4,200-year-old tomb near Cairo's three Giza pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The Fox Show) is not planned as a yearly event,'' Hawass
said. ''But it gives us funds for excavation and it is good to
educate the public and to show that Egyptian archaeologists make
major discoveries.''

<HEADLINE> NTSB investigators prepare to remove plane wreckage for closer study </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Crash investigators retrieved the
engines and propeller assemblies Tuesday from a plane that crashed
on a remote mountainside over the weekend and prepared to send them
to the factories for closer examination.
</P>
<P>
   A team of forensic investigators also arrived from across the
country to help identify the remains of the 19 people killed in
Sunday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board officials hired
construction workers to lay thousands of pounds of gravel atop a
rain-soaked dirt road that snakes near the site of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery vehicles made their way up the winding roads,
through miles of thick forests of northeastern Pennsylvania late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The study of the engines is something we want to do at the
manufacturers' assembly plant. They have the tools,'' NTSB
investigator Frank Hilldrup said Tuesday night. ''No disassembly
will occur at the hangar where we are storing the parts until
delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   The engines are bound for a Honeywell plant in Phoenix, Hilldrup
said. The cockpit voice recorder box, which officials say did not
record any sound, is to be sent to a Fairchild Inc. plant in
Florida. Hilldrup said he did not know where the propellers would
be sent.
</P>
<P>
   An official tape of a conversation between pilots and the
control tower is headed to Washington for analysis by NTSB sound
experts, as well as a recording made by a teen-age aviation buff
who was listening to a police scanner at the time of the crash. The
sound analysis could reveal background noises on the plane that
could provide more clues, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hilldrup said he did not know how long it would take for the
last of the wreckage to be removed from the crash site, ending the
on-site investigation. He said a final NTSB report could take up to
a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday morning, the Executive Airlines twin-engine
turboprop crashed in the rain 9 miles south of the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. It was carrying
passengers home from a gambling trip to Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A tape recording of a final conversation between air traffic
controllers and the two pilots on the plane has emerged as the
primary source of information about what happened just before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots declared an emergency soon after missing their first
approach of an airport runway. The plane rose to 4,000 feet
immediately after the first approach. Just before the second
approach, the pilots said they had lost both engines.
</P>
<P>
   Early analysis of radar indicates the plane veered to the south,
NTSB officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers began providing information about the
terrain and elevation after radar indicated the plane was flying at
about 2,000 feet above sea level, considerably lower than the
minimum safe altitude, Hilldrup said. The crash site was 1,765 feet
above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers suggested that they were near several
highways and other areas that might have worked as a landing zone,
including the northeast extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials believe the plane crashed moments later. They
said they have no evidence that the plane was attempting to land.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that air traffic controllers lost the plane on
radar nearly three tenths of a mile from where it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Painting a more complete picture of the accident could be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   An early analysis of the cockpit voice recorder box revealed
that the tape had been erased, but it was unclear when that
happened, Hilldrup said. Executive Airlines policy required
recorders to be tested on the first flight of every day, he said.
The NTSB said earlier that the recorder might have failed to
operate because of an improper power supply.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know at this point whether the box was ever
operational on this plane during past flights,'' NTSB member George
Black said. ''That is something we are looking into.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane was also without another piece of equipment
investigators said might have provided valuable clues -- a flight
data recorder. That device records such data as the plane's speed
and altitude. Such a recorder is not required for the model of
airplane that crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also plan a careful inspection of the fuel system
and a reconstruction of the electrical system. On Monday,
investigators tested fuel from the truck that had last fueled the
plane and confirmed that it was uncontaminated. Efforts to test
fuel traces at the crash site were inconclusive as of Tuesday
night, Hilldrup said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not optimistic that we're going to get anything from
(fuel analysis),'' Hilldrup said. ''The fact of the fire and the
intensity of the fire means that we don't have much of a sample.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, members of the Disaster Mortuary Operations Response
Team were setting up a mortuary in an airport hangar at the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton airport Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have yet to release the names of the victims, but
various news organizations were able to confirm some of the
identities Tuesday. Officials said the names would be released as
each is positively identified.

<HEADLINE> Settlement reached in I-95 crash lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
jlbcfls1dr1
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDIA, Pa. (AP) -- A settlement was reached Tuesday only hours
after a trial began in the state's civil lawsuit against a New
Jersey company whose truck caused a fiery explosion on Interstate
95 on Memorial Day weekend 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Connolly, a spokesman for Attorney General Mike Fisher,
said the settlement reimburses the state for the entire $2.95
million it spent repairing the I-95 bridge in Chester that was
destroyed when a gasoline-filled tanker truck careened over the
concrete median of I-95 in Chester, sideswiped a bus, struck a
pickup truck and exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Both truck drivers were killed and a section of I-95 was closed
for five months after the May 23, 1998, crash.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came after opening statements and testimony by
two witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The state will not receive punitive damages from Samuel
Coraluzzo Co. of Vineland, N.J., or any admission of fault by the
company. The firm rejected the state's charge that it violated
federal trucker-rest regulations, contributing to the crash.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 6, Pirates 1  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Steve Finley drove in four runs with his 17th
homer and sacrifice fly, and Matt Williams went 2-for-4 in his
first game of the season as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the
Pittsburgh Pirates 6-1 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Finley hit a three-run homer in the first inning off Jimmy
Anderson (1-2) and added a sacrifice fly in the fifth off Rich
Loiselle.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who broke his right foot March 28 when he fouled off a
pitch during spring training, singled twice, scored one run and
started three inning-ending double plays at third base.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Anderson (4-0) gave up the one runs and eight hits in
eight innings as the Diamondbacks stopped a three-game losing
streak and won for just the second time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson gave up five hits in the first two innings, but retired
14 of his last 16 batters. Matt Mantei, activated from the disabled
list Sunday, finished with a hitless ninth in his first appearance
since May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles hit into two of the double plays started by
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Anderson was rocked for for six runs and seven hits in 4
1-3 innings. In addition to Finley's homer, Jay Bell hit an RBI
triple in the fifth and scored on a double by Luis Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Loiselle allowed three hits and a walk in 1 2-3 innings, his
first major league appearance since May 5, 1999, when he lost at
St. Louis. He spent most of last year and all this spring in
rehabilitation after surgery on a ligament in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Wil Cordero hit a first-inning sacrifice fly and extended his
hitting streak to 15 games with a single in the third inning. Tony
Womack singled in the eighth, extending his hitting streak to 18
games, tying Dmitri Young for the longest in the NL this season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Finley's homer was his eighth off a left-hander. ... The
Pirates have had an extra-base hit in each game this year. Jason
Kendall extended the streak to 43 with a first-inning triple. ...
Jimmy Anderson has given up a run in the first inning in five
consecutive starts, a total of 13 in eight starts, and has not
started a game 1-2-3 all year. ... Arizona minor league RHP John
Patterson, long considered a future starter, will have surgery
Thursday to replace a ligament in his right elbow. Dr. James
Andrews of Birmingham, Ala., will operate. Andrews also did
Loiselle's surgery.

<HEADLINE> Williams Returns to D'Backs  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Matt Williams returned to the Arizona
Diamondbacks' lineup on Tuesday after missing the first 43 games of
the season because of a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my opening day,'' said Williams, who got a standing
ovation from his teammates when he trotted out for warmups before
Tuesday night's game against Pittsburgh. ''I'll have my private
moment with myself and go from there. I'm disappointed that that
happened, but I'm ready to play now.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams went 2-for-4 and started three inning-ending double
plays at third base as Arizona beat the Pirates 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Williams broke the second metatarsal bone in his right foot
March 28, when he fouled a pitch off the arch during an exhibition
game against the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time he broke that bone with a foul ball. The
first break was more severe and sidelined Williams for 68 games in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Williams wore a right shoe modified with a titanium
sole to ease the stress on his foot, and a half-moon of Kevlar over
the arch -- a protective design he plans to wear the rest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Matt's been really good on this process, I think, because he
remembers what happened the last time,'' Arizona general manager
Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ''He has not pushed this. At every level,
it's been, 'OK, it feels good enough to try the next thing.' So
we're very confident that he's at no risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, activated before the game, became the second key
player in three days to rejoin the Diamondbacks. Closer Matt Mantei
was activated from the DL on Sunday after spending 15 days
strengthening his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He did not get into his first eligible game -- a 7-6 loss to the
New York Mets on Sunday that sent the Diamondbacks to their sixth
loss in the last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep in mind that these two guys are coming back, and I don't
think you assume that they fit into the form they've had in the
past,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter said. ''Eventually they'll
get there. My experience with things like that is that they have
the adrenaline the first day or two, and then they have a little
spell before they really get into a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had surgery April 1 to insert a metal plate that helped
stabilize the foot during rehabilitation and wore a protective boot
when he began taking batting practice May 5. The All-Star third
baseman spent a week with the Double-A El Paso Diablos farm team,
hitting .461 (6-for-13) in five games.
</P>
<P>
   His return was more than a week in advance of the June 1 target
date set by team physician Dr. David Zeman.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 34, set career highs of 142 RBIs and 190 hits last
season, getting 37 doubles and 35 home runs while batting .303.

<HEADLINE> Astros 10, Phillies 2  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Chris Holt finally got the breakthrough
performance the Houston Astros needed.
</P>
<P>
   Holt pitched his second career complete game, and his two-run
single in the second inning put the Astros ahead to stay on the way
to a 10-2 victory over Philadelphia that snapped their seven-game
losing streak Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that we needed to pull together as a team, and I was
fortunate to battle through the early innings,'' said Holt, who
hadn't won since April 28. ''I finally figured out that my sinker
and slider was working.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt (2-6) had lost three straight decisions since pitching the
Astros' only other complete game of the season on April 28 with a
one-hit, 7-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I finally started to get in a groove here at Enron Field,''
Holt said. ''They make a big stink about Enron, but you keep it
down, in and away, and you don't have any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, coming off an 0-6 road trip, snapped their longest
losing streak since they lost nine straight in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's single to left field in the second inning put the Astros
ahead 3-2. Holt allowed eight hits, struck out a season-high seven
and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   ''Holt gave them exactly what they needed, a guy to take them
deep into the game, and he did that,'' Phillies manager Terry
Francona said. ''Them scoring all those runs early made it easier
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt was impressive in the seventh. After yielding a single and
walk, he struck out Doug Glanville, Ron Gant and Bobby Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were facing their big guys and he made some good sinker
pitches,'' catcher Tony Eusebio said. ''We needed a strong
performance from our starting pitcher and now we can feel well and
change things around a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wolf (3-3) was the winning pitcher at Enron Field in a 4-1
victory over the Astros to open the regular season April 7. He
lasted only three innings Tuesday, allowing six runs and eight hits
as the Phillies lost for the eighth time in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't feel my stuff was bad enough to give up six runs in
three innings,'' Wolf said. ''Sometimes you throw too many strikes
that are hittable. I'll have to forget it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf helped his own cause with a two-run single in the second
inning, the first RBIs of his major league career in 47 major
league at-bats. Mickey Morandini walked and went to third on Desi
Relaford's double before Wolf's hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros got the lead right back in the second on an RBI
double by Tim Bogar and Holt's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf got the first two batters out in the third, but walked Ken
Caminiti before Moises Alou hit his sixth homer. Richard Hidalgo
followed with a single and scored on Eusebio's double for a 6-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio's RBI single and a bases-loaded walk by Jason Boyd
gave the Astros two more runs in the seventh. They made it 10-2 in
the eighth on Roger Cedeno's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a command performance,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said of Holt. ''He started out kind of shaky, but he kind of fought
his way through those first few innings and then he started doing
what he does best, getting those ground balls.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Astros are 0-12 this season in one-run games. ... The
Astros have allowed 73 home runs this season, highest total in the
NL. ... In 43 games this season, Phillies starters have gone seven
innings 18 times. ... In his Enron debut April 7, Wolf held Houston
to five hits and one run, Hidalgo's homer. ... Phillies third
baseman Scott Rolen left the game with a sprained left ankle and
was listed as day to day.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Ruling Party Leads in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By LISA J. ADAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An independent poll Tuesday showed the
presidential candidate from Mexico's ruling party significantly
ahead of an upstart opposition campaign that could be the most
serious electoral threat to Mexico's establishment in 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   The ACNielsen poll conducted for the daily newspaper Milenio was
the latest in several weeks of varying results by different polling
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting undecided voters, Institutional Revolutionary Party
candidate Francisco Labastida was favored by 42.9 percent, while
Vicente Fox of the center-right National Action Party was preferred
by 35.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two major recent polls had shown Fox ahead, although in both
cases the difference was within the margin of error. Fox has
recently been surging in the polls after starting out well behind
Labastida, whose party, known as the PRI, has held the presidency
since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party,
followed in third place in the poll published Tuesday with 17.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted from May 13-19 and interviewed 2,005
likely voters in urban and rural locations, Milenio said. The
margin of error was 2.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the three candidates met Tuesday at Cardenas'
campaign headquarters and agreed on a nationally broadcast debate
Friday -- but only after an acrimonious squabble over Fox's proposal
that the three accept one network's offer to hold the debate
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fox charged that the other candidates' insistence on a delay
showed they were the ones putting up obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would show up Friday, he said, ''I haven't taken the
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the decision to talk did not come easily. It came after
three days of public squabbling and televised mini-debates in which
Labastida and Fox accused each other of lying, attacked each
other's records and blamed the other for causing the debate to
collapse. Cardenas, meanwhile, compared both Labastida and Fox to
reviled former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida accused Fox of being afraid to debate because of the
latest poll, which seemed to reverse a recent trend showing Fox
pulling even and even moving ahead. Fox said polls had nothing to
do with the candidates' disagreements over the debate.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists argue Millstone cases in state Supreme Court  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court is considering
the allegations of environmentalist who claim the Millstone nuclear
power reactors are polluting Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The state's highest court heard Tuesday from lawyers
representing plant-operator Northeast Utilities and environmental
groups including Fish Unlimited. There is no deadline for the
justices to rule.
</P>
<P>
   The high court took from the Appellate Court three cases in
which the groups allege that the reactors emit illegal pollution
into the sound and harm the fishery.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we claim in those cases is bad faith and collusion
between the (Department of Environmental Protection) and Northeast
Utilities,'' said Nancy Burton, the attorney for Fish Unlimited and
other groups from Connecticut and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But NU spokesman Joe Pillittere said the case is not really
about environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've stated repeatedly that their sole goal is to shut down
Millstone,'' he said. ''Our goal is really to be the best of the
best both in terms of operation and environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The first case involves a 1998 settlement between NU and the DEP
over alleged violations of Millstone's water discharge permit. The
$1.2 million settlement included a $700,000 fine and a $500,000
donation to environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   Fish Unlimited claims the penalty was not high enough and
amounts to collusion between NU and the DEP. Burton also said it
has done nothing to stop future environmental abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant Attorney General Richard Webb said it was among
the highest monetary settlements of any such case. He also said
that environmental programs implemented since the settlement have
''directly enhanced the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   NU attorney Elizabeth Barton said it was a ''significant
settlement,'' adding that the trial judge called it ''tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The second appeal dealt with allegations that the Millstone Unit
2 cooling system is damaging winter flounder in Niantic Bay and
Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit by Fish Unlimited sought to shut down the plant until
a cooling system was installed that would recirculate water from
the sound instead of drawing in fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   NU has said that its nuclear plant cooling systems have a
negligible impact on the fish population. A Hartford Superior Court
judge last year blamed overfishing for the drop in numbers of fish.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Burton said, a DEP official has agreed with a
report from a winter flounder expert from Rhode Island who blamed
Millstone for the problem. The trial judge failed a year ago to
allow rebuttal from that expert, Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   The third appeal involves claims that the DEP issued an improper
wastewater discharge permit to the Millstone complex. The groups
argued that the permit was invalid since the complex was idled for
months because of safety concerns. NU has said it has the proper
permits.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who said she was optimistic after Tuesday's session,
called it a historic day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the first time the Supreme Court has set aside its whole
morning on an issue regarding environmental grievances and
Millstone,'' she said. ''Nobody has ever challenged Northeast
Utilities' right to operate.''

   Kirk Rueter (2-3) gave up three runs on nine hits in seven
innings. He has not won in his last five starts dating to April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro now has 22 multihit games, including eight with three
hits. He's batting .522 (24-for-46) since May 11, with eight
doubles, three homers and 13 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   White had his first four-hit game of the season and extended his
hitting streak to 10 games. He's hitting .419 (18-for-43) during
that span with six doubles and four homers. White's .359
(70-for-195) career average against the Giants is his best against
any team.
</P>
<P>
   White's seventh homer of the season gave the Expos a 2-0 lead
after Vidro singled in the first. White hit the first pitch from
Rueter over the 404-foot sign in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Cabrera added his fourth homer of the year to put
Montreal ahead 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' 17th homer, in the fourth, cleared the right-field stands
and bounced off the boardwalk before splashing into McCovey Cove.
Bonds also doubled home a run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Giants SS Rich Aurilia was ejected by umpire Greg Gibson
for arguing balls and strikes in the fourth. He became the second
Giants player (Jeff Kent) to be ejected this season. ... Vidro and
White were a combined 4-for-19 (.211) against Rueter entering the
game. ... The Expos are 12-3 in the first game of a series. ... The
Giants were 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position on Tuesday.
They entered the game hitting .301 in those situations.

<HEADLINE> China Bill Brings Mixed Rhetoric  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. David Dreier, the chairman of the House
Rules Committee, suggested that the China trade bill before the
House was ''the single most important vote this session.''
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, upped the ante,
calling it ''the most important vote we will make -- not only in
this Congress, but perhaps in our total careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to be outdone, Dreier, R-Calif., amended and revised
his remarks, as lawmakers are sometimes wont to do. The China vote
could possibly be the most important vote in the 200-plus year
history of Congress, Dreier asserted.
</P>
<P>
   To Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, ''This is the most important vote in 50
years.'' For Rep. James Moran, R-Va., ''This may be the most
important thing we can do for our children's children.''
</P>
<P>
   The China bill has produced more than its share of lofty
rhetoric, grand characterizations and sweeping generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The consequences of this vote will be felt after I am no
longer president,'' President Clinton reflected on Tuesday. ''Our
country fought three wars in Asia in the last half-century. We
ought to give our children a chance to have a different 50 years
ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Rep. Bernard Sanders, a political independent from
Vermont, ''When all is said and done, this debate is about two
words: corporate greed.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill seems rather straightforward at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   It extends permanent normal trade relations to China, giving the
Chinese permanently the same access to U.S. markets Beijing has
gotten annually for the past two decades. Nearly every other nation
in the world already has such permanent trade relations with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors claim the measure is also a necessary step for U.S.
businesses to be able to take advantage of the market-opening
concessions China has made to join the World Trade Organization,
the Geneva-based organization that oversees world commerce.
</P>
<P>
   However, the vote in Congress has no bearing on Chinese WTO
membership. But denying normal trade relations could mean other
countries would get increased access to China's vast market, but
not U.S. businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have differing takes of what the legislation is really
all about.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue is not really about China. It's about America,''
said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., a supporter.
</P>
<P>
   And the real objections to the bill seem to be political, not
economic.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say it would reward a nuclear power that routinely
violates human rights and which is a military threat to its
neighbors -- and possibly the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions, still unhappy about their loss on the North
American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, made defeat a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Millions were spent to influence the outcome of the House vote
by rival labor and business groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days, the Clinton administration helped build
support by spreading largesse throughout the districts of
congressional holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who hopes to preside over increased U.S.
trade with China as Clinton's successor, said Monday that he
strongly supported the bill ''because I believe it is right for
America's economy and right for the cause of reform in China.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponent Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., sees the legislation
as, ''creating a monster with blood on its hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a terrible deal. We have lost our moral compass,''
said opponent William J. Pascrell, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., another opponent, compared it to
''marrying someone you hope to change. It doesn't work. It's a bad
marriage. The United States must not say 'I do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been including the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
when he lists Asian leaders who have supported the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Dreier picked up on this theme, sending out a ''Dear Colleague
letter'' that asserted, ''When the Dalai Lama talks, we should all
listen. Stand with the Dalai Lama and support PNTR.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a rebuttal from Richard Nishimura of the
International Campaign for Tibet, who said the exiled leader had
only voiced support for China's WTO membership. In fact, there's an
anti-trade bill link on the campaign's Web site
(http://www.savetibet.org).
</P>
<P>
   So the campaign put out its own letter to members emphasizing
that ''the Dalai Lama has not endorsed PNTR for China.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Vote NO on PNTR,'' the letter concluded.

<HEADLINE> Otter Wins Bid in Idaho  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four-term Lt. Gov. Butch Otter won his bid Tuesday to succeed
ultraconservative GOP Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, while Arkansas
Democrats hoping to challenge embattled GOP Rep. Jay Dickey went to
a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever won Idaho's GOP primary was heavily favored to win the
fall election. With more than half the precincts reporting, Otter
took nearly twice as many votes as Dennis Mansfield, who founded
the religious right group Idaho Family Forum with Chenoweth-Hage.
</P>
<P>
   With 59 percent of precincts reporting, Otter, a millionaire
businessman, won with 49 percent, or 24,195 votes, to Mansfield's
25 percent, or 12,499. The two led a field of eight Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky also held congressional primaries, and all three states
had presidential contests made meaningless because Al Gore and
George W. Bush have already wrapped up their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republican leaders backed Otter in an election campaign
that focused on who would inherit Chenoweth-Hage's conservative
mantle. Though she did not endorse anyone, she did not object to a
national term limits organization's ads linking her politics to
Mansfield's.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield, who focused on social and moral issues, is a staunch
opponent of abortion. Otter opposes abortion but says he takes a
more libertarian approach that keeps government out of people's
lives, and prefers to talk about land rights issues and gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will face Democrat Linda Pall, a Moscow City Council
member, and candidates from the Libertarian and Reform parties.
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth-Hage, who fulfilled a campaign pledge to retire after
three terms, built her career on her opposition to big government
and what she called environmental extremism. Her remarks after the
1995 Oklahoma City bombing were viewed as sympathetic to the
militia. She also once claimed that minorities don't like northern
Idaho because it's too cold.
</P>
<P>
   In President Clinton's home state, the crowded field ensured a
June 13 runoff.
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of precincts in Arkansas reporting, state Sen.
Mike Ross was the leading vote-getter, with 44 percent, or 39,182
votes. Second-place was less clear: former TV reporter Dewayne
Graham had 23 percent and 20,556 votes, while former state Rep.
Judy Smith, who lost to Dickey in 1998, had 22 percent and 19,610
votes. A fourth candidate got 12 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a runoff, the winner had to get more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   None of the candidates hoping to challenge Dickey made his vote
for impeachment an issue, though Dickey said he expected it to come
up in the campaign. GOP Rep. Asa Hutchinson -- one of the House
prosecutors in Clinton's trial -- faced no opposition from either
party.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey is seeking his fifth term in the traditionally Democratic
district, which includes Clinton's hometowns of Hope and Hot
Springs. Dickey, who has no Republican opposition, was criticized
this year after he told black farmers he could do little for their
efforts to seek federal help for discrimination because they didn't
support him politically. He later mended fences with one group of
farmers who recently endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, state Rep. Eleanor Jordan defeated two lesser-known
candidates to win the Democratic nomination to challenge two-term
GOP Rep. Anne Northup in a district that is 2-1 Democratic. Jordan,
the only black woman in the state Legislature, hopes to become
Kentucky's first black member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Northup had no opposition in the primary.

<HEADLINE> Momentum Picking Up on China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of a measure to normalize trade
relations with China claimed to have seized the momentum as both
sides of the issue dueled for a dwindling pool of undecided
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   A showdown vote was scheduled today in the House. The Clinton
administration and business lobbyists worked behind the scenes to
line up the votes needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're going to make this PNTR vote for China,'' a
confident President Clinton told reporters late Tuesday night about
one of his top legislative priorities for his final year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., who is chairman of the House Rules
Committee, said negotiators had cleared away the last hurdles to a
floor vote today with the inclusion of language sought by Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., to specifically list human rights
protections that a watchdog commission would examine each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to win tomorrow. I am convinced we are on track
for victory,'' Dreier said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would extend permanent normal trade relations to China,
guaranteeing China the same low-tariff access to U.S. markets that
nearly every other country in the world has.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, China has received this benefit, but only
after an annual congressional vote, which gave opponents a platform
to attack China's record on a host of issues from human rights to
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In return for U.S. support for China's bid to join the World
Trade Organization, China has offered to lower high trade barriers
that American manufacturers and farmers have complained are costing
them billions of dollars in lost sales annually.
</P>
<P>
   American corporations have spent millions of dollars lobbying on
behalf of the China trade bill but they faced determined opposition
from organized labor, which believes normalizing trade relations
will result in the movement of more high-paying U.S. manufacturing
jobs to China.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to sidetrack the legislation, opponents
were considering offering an amendment to tie the trade benefits to
Taiwan's security as a way to gain conservative GOP votes.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters claimed momentum was on their side following the
pickup of a number of fence-sitters Tuesday as the Clinton
administration conducted its own version of ''Lets Make a Deal'' to
offer inducements to wavering lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Among those announcing in favor of the proposal Tuesday was Rep.
Martin Frost, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, and four
other members of the Texas delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Frost said he would vote yes after the administration provided
assurances of financial support being sought by Northrop Grumman to
keep its defense plant in Grand Prairie, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to gain support from black and Hispanic Democrats
representing poor districts, the administration reached an
agreement with Republicans on a package of tax breaks aimed at
helping distressed rural and urban areas. Clinton and House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., announced the deal at the White House on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to pick up votes of lawmakers from tobacco states, the
administration also announced that China had agreed to drop an
11-year ban on the importation of U.S. tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of House debate, supporters argued that the world's
biggest economy had to remain engaged with the fast-growing Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over one billion people will not be ignored in the
international marketplace,'' said House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argued that granting China normal trade relations
with the United States would only worsen America's trade deficit
with that country, which hit a record $68 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us have the guts to stand up to the big money interests
who are more concerned about the bottom line than the best
interests of the American people,'' said Rep. Bernard Sanders,
I-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The House Rules Committee incorporated into the China proposals
two amendments agreed to earlier by sponsors. One would set up a
watchdog commission to monitor human rights in China. The other
would help protect U.S. industries against surges in imports from
China.

<HEADLINE> Caffeine May Prevent Parkinson's  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A new study published today suggests that coffee
may prevent Parkinson's disease, the degenerative brain disorder
that affects more than 1 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   How a product that makes people jittery could keep them from
getting a disease that gives them tremors is not examined in the
study of 8,004 Japanese-American men in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers said the benefits are probably due to
caffeine -- apparently the more, the better -- and they suggest some
theories about how it might work.
</P>
<P>
   Outside experts said that if the findings hold up, they could
lead to ways to treat Parkinson's more effectively or even prevent
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that men who didn't drink coffee were five times
more likely to develop Parkinson's than those who drank the most --
4{ to 5{ 6-ounce cups a day. Non-coffee drinkers were two to three
times more likely to get the disease than men who drank 4 ounces to
four cups a day.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said it is uncertain whether their results would
hold true in women and other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association. It was led by Dr. G. Webster Ross, a
neurologist at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said it is possible that heavy coffee drinkers have a brain
composition that may make them resistant to Parkinson's. Previous
studies have found low rates of Parkinson's in ''thrill-seeking''
people who tend to engage in high-risk behavior like smoking and
heavy drinking, and heavy coffee drinking also fits that
personality profile, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also suggested that caffeine may somehow protect against
the nerve-cell destruction that causes Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ross said it is too early to recommend coffee as a
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, this will lead to more basic research on caffeine
and its effect on areas of the brain affected by Parkinson's
disease,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said his study was larger than similar previous research
and took into account other factors that could explain the
findings, such as cigarette smoking, which has also been linked to
a decreased Parkinson's risk.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Carvey, director of the neuropharmacology research
laboratories at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in
Chicago, said the study is important because it traced the benefits
to caffeine, showing similar results with caffeine-laden foods
other than coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Abraham Lieberman, medical director for the National
Parkinson Foundation, called the results ''very interesting and
very provocative.'' He said that if caffeine does have benefits, it
is unclear whether it can actually prevent Parkinson's or slow its
progression.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's is usually associated with aging, though it has made
headlines recently with actor Michael J. Fox's disclosure that he
was diagnosed seven years ago at age 30. Attorney General Janet
Reno and Muhammad Ali are among others with Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   The disease involves gradual deterioration of nerve cell
clusters that make the chemical dopamine, which helps control
muscle movements. Ross and colleagues speculated that caffeine
might increase dopamine levels.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of Parkinson's include hand and head tremors, loss of
balance, and stiffness. Dementia and depression also can result.
</P>
<P>
   Medication helps victims function, but over time the disease
usually renders patients unable to care for themselves. Its cause
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers examined data from the ongoing Honolulu Heart
Program. Participants -- age 53 on average when the study began --
were asked about coffee consumption at the outset in 1965 and again
in 1971. The researchers then measured Parkinson's disease rates
from 1991 to 1996. The disease developed in 102 men.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Drugs Show Danger and Hope  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Drugs designed to stop tumors by cutting off
their blood supply, among the most closely watched new developments
in cancer research, have raised concerns about possible dangerous
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis inhibitors, as the drugs are called, have shown
modest benefit in tests against three kinds of cancer. In animal
studies, they sometimes dramatically reverse cancer, and hopes are
high they will do something similar in people.
</P>
<P>
   Several reports on mid-size studies of these medicines were
reported at this week's annual cancer conference sponsored by the
American Society of Clinical Oncology. Together, experts say, these
studies offer proof that the concept is sound: Attacking tumors'
ability to sprout blood vessels clearly inhibits cancer growth,
even in terminally ill patients who have tried all of the standard
cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   However, these studies also show that these drugs can have a
variety of side effects, some of which are fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are drugs in every sense of the word,'' said Dr. George
Sledge of Indiana University. ''They have activity, and they have
toxicity.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, doctors reported studies on drugs developed by
Genentech and Sugen that are designed to block tumors' use of
vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This substance is a
key fuel that allows the cancer to grow new blood vessels and
repair old ones. Without a new blood supply, cancers never get
bigger than a pinhead.
</P>
<P>
   As is usual at this stage of testing, the drugs were given only
to people with spreading, incurable tumors, sometimes alone,
sometimes in combination with standard chemotherapy medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that while no one was clearly cured, the anti-VEGF
compounds did seem to slow the tumors' spread, at least for a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have three common solid tumors -- breast, colon and lung
cancer -- and this drug shows some evidence of clinical benefit in
all three, the most common cancers we deal with. That's the real
significance,'' said Dr. Russell DeVore of Vanderbilt University,
referring to new results with the Genentech drug.
</P>
<P>
   However, DeVore's study, conducted on 99 terminally ill lung
cancer patients, also shows the drugs' potential hazards. Six
patients developed sudden, catastrophic bleeding in their tumors,
killing four of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were taken by surprise. This was not an expected side
effect,'' DeVore said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Nicholas Vogelzang of the University of Chicago
called this bleeding ''very exciting,'' despite its unfortunate
consequences, since it suggests the treatment truly does appear to
disrupt the tumor's ability to maintain a blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Other dangerous side effects of anti-VEGF treatment include high
blood pressure and blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Rosen of the University of California at Los Angeles
tested Sugen's anti-VEGF drug, code-named SU5416, in combination
with standard chemotherapy on 28 people with advanced colon cancer.
The combination stopped cancer growth for an average of 9{ months,
compared with six months for the usual therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 28, ''25 are still alive, some as long as a year so far,
and they are all doing very, very well,'' Rosen said. Although the
study is small, ''the data are very interesting and very promising.
This really validates the target. By regulating VEGF, we seem to be
doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were pleasantly surprised in these studies to see
evidence that the anti-VEGF drugs seem to make tumors shrink. In
theory, they might have halted cancer's spread while doing nothing
to make them go away.
</P>
<P>
   The data from these studies are promising enough for Sugen and
Genentech to begin large studies that will enroll several hundred
cancer patients in an attempt to prove that the two drugs actually
lengthen patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I continue to feel this is an enormously interesting way to
treat patients with cancer,'' said Dr. Susan Hellman, Genentech's
development chief. ''Now we need to move into the next phase and
see how much we will help patients and what the risks will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the enthusiasm for blocking blood vessels came from
optimistic coverage of the development of the drugs endostatin and
angiostatin by Harvard's Dr. Judah Folkman, the field's pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin is in early testing at three hospitals, and
participating doctors have been silent about the effects so far. At
the meeting Monday, Folkman said he is ''very pleased'' with the
results in Boston.

<HEADLINE> Study: G-Rated Films Are Violent  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A survey of G-rated animated films found that
many contain a surprising amount of violence, from ''Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs'' to ''The Rugrats Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is often criticized for violence in movies for adults,
but parents should be aware of what is in G-rated movies, according
to the study published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The two researchers cited scenes of fisticuffs, sword-fighting,
gunplay and other aggressive action.
</P>
<P>
   The survey examined 74 G-rated theatrical films available on
video and found that each contained at least one act of violence.
At least one character was injured in 46 of the movies, and at
least one was killed in half of the films.
</P>
<P>
   The movies averaged 9.5 minutes of violence, with the 1998 King
Arthur tale ''Quest for Camelot'' topping the list with 24 minutes
of violence, or almost 30 percent of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said they believe their study included every
G-rated theatrical feature available on video before last
September.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were surprised that every single one of them had some act
of violence,'' said Kimberly Thompson, assistant professor of risk
analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''We're just
raising the red flag. It's important for parents to be aware of the
violence content in these movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Much cartoon violence is slapstick intended for comic effect,
whose influence on children's behavior is uncertain, said Fumie
Yokota, a Harvard doctoral student in health policy who co-wrote
the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may desensitize kids so much, they think it's OK and no big
deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,'' Yokota
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the movies may send the message that force is an
acceptable way to resolve differences, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cartoon violence is one of the most likely forms to promote
imitation,'' said Joanne Cantor, a communications professor
emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, who has researched media
influence on children. ''It normalizes violence and also
trivializes violence in a way by focusing not on negative
consequences of violence but making it funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Yokota recommended that the Motion Picture
Association of America consider changing its rating system to
include more detail on the content of G-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   MPAA chief Jack Valenti said in a statement that the ratings
system in place since the late 1960s consistently receives ''high
approval marks'' from parents.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also advised parents to screen G-rated movies
beforehand or watch them with their children so they can discuss
the violent content. They noted that Web sites such as Kids-in-Mind
and Screenit provide details about violence, sex and other content
for many movies.

<HEADLINE> Bombings Unnerve Philippines  </HEADLINE>
By RU PAJUELAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Shaggy police dogs sniff their way
through the malls. Guards poke politely through even the smallest
purse carried into public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Manila residents are on edge after a string of bombings, the
last one deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I make it a point not to go near any unattended package or
plastic bags because people say that most of them contain
explosives,'' said Gertrudes Amoncio, 30, who was out with her
husband and children on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   People are taking taxis instead of the packed, buslike jeepneys
that crowd Manila's streets. They are skipping family outings, and
shunning malls -- where two of the attacks occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and editorial writers have called for calm and
vigilance, but creation of a rumor-control center has been
suggested. Scare after scare fizzles into nothing, then another
bomb goes off.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks and the peso have tumbled, and there are fears the
attacks could hurt the crucial tourism industry -- problems this
developing country cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents blame the country's Muslim rebels, but
responsibility for the worst violence since coup attempts against
former President Corazon Aquino more than a decade ago is not easy
to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   The larger and more moderate of the two rebel groups fighting
for an Islamic state in the southern Philippines denies involvement
with at least some of the attacks in Manila and in the south,
though it has threatened to bring its jungle war to the cities.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller and more extreme group, the Abu Sayyaf, is thought
to be too small and disorganized to mount such attacks. Its members
are holding 21 Western and Asian hostages on southern Jolo Island,
as well as another five Filipino children and two teachers on
nearby Basilan Island.
</P>
<P>
   Even the government of this mostly Roman Catholic country can't
agree on who is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   National police director general Panfilo Lacson says it is
probably neither the Abu Sayyaf nor the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front. He blames rightists trying ''to create an atmosphere of
political instability as well as economic instability.''
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado says the rebels are
probably responsible because the attacks in Manila began after the
guerrillas were pushed back by the military in the southern region
of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
   A small bomb in a central Manila park slightly injured a man
sleeping nearby on May 6. Then in suburban Manila, gunmen fired
automatic rifles at the headquarters of the National Intelligence
Coordinating Agency, and a week later a rocket-propelled grenade
was fired at the national police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion on May 17 at the posh Glorietta mall in Manila's
business district injured 13 people. Police, unfamiliar with the
explosive used, sent fragments to the United States for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sunday, a bomb at the country's biggest shopping center,
Manila's SM MegaMall, killed a young janitor and injured at least
11 other people.
</P>
<P>
   Both mall bombs were experts' work, the national police chief
said. ''In the two cases, they had the opportunity to inflict
maximum damage, but they did not,'' Lacson added.
</P>
<P>
   Even the possibility of a bomb has caused chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Many shoppers were injured in a stampede at a department store
in the southern city of Zamboanga on Tuesday after a woman
screamed, ''There's a bomb! There's a bomb!''
</P>
<P>
   ''If God is with us, who can be against us,'' said Maria
Victoria Olino, 36, an assistant principal at an international
school, as she tried to catch a cab in a commercial district of
Manila. ''I always pray before going out of the house.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Coins Being Hoarded  </HEADLINE>
By C.G. WALLACE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Millions of the new Sacagawea golden
dollar coins are in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, normally spend-happy Americans are squirreling away
the coins instead of using them as pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are hoarding them. They get them in change and because
they haven't seen them before, they'll save it,'' said H. Robert
Campbell, president of the American Numismatic Association and
owner of All About Coins in Salt Lake City. ''They are almost
spellbound by the coins.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers are snapping up uncirculated dollar coins that
Campbell is selling at his store for $2 each.
</P>
<P>
   The golden-colored coins were introduced in January. It depicts
the young Shoshone Indian woman who accompanied explorers
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to the Pacific Ocean in 1805.
</P>
<P>
   Within its first four months of existence, 500 million Sacagawea
coins were in circulation, U.S. Mint officials said. By this
summer, shipments of the new Golden Dollar coins are expected to
exceed 1 billion, with 6 million new coins are being minted each
day.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Susan B. Anthony coin was a disappointment. In
the past 21 years, just 921 million Susan B. Anthony dollar coins
have been minted.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Mint has been trying to persuade people to circulate
the dollars with a $40 million ad campaign featuring the face of
George Washington from the dollar bill. Nationwide, 18 major
transit authorities, including those in New York, Chicago, Boston
and San Diego, have pledged to use the new dollar coins, Mint
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At New York's Rockefeller Center, the vending machines for the
subway's Metrocard accept the new coins. But some people there said
they had never even seen one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never held one, so I can't say what I think,'' said David
Winkler, a Manhattan contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the collectors such as Meredith Tranberg, a
customer service manager at Macy's who lives in Manhattan
</P>
<P>
   ''I like them,'' she said. ''I collect them and hardly ever
spend them, although I think I've used them on the bus a few
times.''
</P>
<P>
   On the trolleys in San Diego, riders also can pay the fare with
the dollar coins. But transit department employee Frances Batiste
hasn't had anyone purchase tickets using the Sacagawea dollar at
her kiosk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they're that popular,'' Batiste said. ''I don't
know what to think about them because I haven't seen them. ... I
think maybe some people are saving them for collectors items.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenna Goodacre, the Santa Fe, N.M., sculptor who designed the
image of the young Sacagawea, is doing her part to get the coins in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love to carry them with me and give them away. But I'm
amazed how many people have never seen one,'' Goodacre said.
</P>
<P>
   Randy'L He-dow Teton, a recent art history graduate from the
University of New Mexico, was the model for the coin's face side.
She said she had to spend her first golden dollar after realizing
it was the only cash she had.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even have one of my own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Teton has seen lots of the coins -- especially from people
who recognize her face on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come across a lot of people who show me the coins and they
want me to autograph them, right on the coin,'' she said, somewhat
amazed at the request.

<HEADLINE> Homosexuality Debate Election Issue  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN FLESHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- When city commissioners adopted a
bitterly contested resolution opposing discrimination against
homosexuals, opponents didn't back down.
</P>
<P>
   They began circulating petitions to force a vote in November on
a proposed city charter amendment that would nullify the toothless
resolution and prohibit commissions from approving gay-rights
measures of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the proverbial door opens, it continues to open,'' says
Fred Weber, leader of the petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   If his group collects enough signatures, Traverse City will join
a growing list of cities and states where the debate over gay
rights is being played out at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Referendums are proposed on same-sex marriage, on teaching
public school students about homosexuality and on whether gays
should receive the same civil rights protections as racial and
religious minorities. Many votes are being requested by groups who
oppose what they call ''special rights'' for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''To our knowledge, there have never been this many (gay-rights
issues) on the ballot,'' says David Elliott, spokesman for the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ''It's a backlash against the
progress we've made toward equality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition is seeking a September referendum on
repealing a gay-rights ordinance in Dade County, Fla. Oregon
activists are collecting signatures in support of banning
homosexual instruction in public schools. And critics of an
anti-discrimination measure adopted this year in Davenport, Iowa,
have begun a drive to overturn it.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont remains the only state granting gay couples legal rights
similar to marriage under a law recognizing civil unions. The issue
may go before Maine voters soon, but California voters banned
same-sex marriages in March and a similar proposal could be on the
Nevada ballot this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Glenn, president of the American Family Association of
Michigan, says people are taking matters into their own hands
because officeholders are ignoring their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a growing disparity between where the people of this
country stand ... and where politicians, pressured by homosexual
political action committees and their allies in the media, are
voting,'' says Glenn, who coaches activists across Michigan working
to amend city charters.
</P>
<P>
   They are basing their efforts on a precedent set in Cincinnati,
where voters in 1993 amended the charter to overturn a gay-rights
ordinance adopted the previous year. The amendment was upheld by a
federal appeals court, a decision that became final when the U.S.
Supreme Court refused in 1998 to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-rights foes across Michigan are using language in the
Cincinnati case. ''It's been tested before the highest court
available and found to be constitutional,'' Glenn says.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Anderson, leader of the Traverse City Campaign Against
Discrimination, says she still smarts from being told seven years
ago she could not volunteer with a local youth agency because she
is a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hear it again and again: 'There is no discrimination in
this town,''' she says. ''Well, I know from personal experience
that that simply isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to gay rights say it's a matter of religious
principle.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, homosexuality is wrong,'' Weber says. ''I follow the
word of God and it tells me these things are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Williams, a leader of the Grand Rapids petition
drive, says gays do not qualify as a persecuted minority. Unlike
blacks, he says, homosexuals are not economically deprived and
haven't been denied an education or the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We maintain that people in the gay community already have
equal rights like everybody else,'' says Williams, who is black.

<HEADLINE> Christian Group May Disappear  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Council of Churches wants to help
form a new organization that would for the first time include all
major branches of U.S. Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Though much is uncertain about the plan approved by the
council's board Tuesday, one possibility is that the organization
itself would go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The council is made up of mainline Protestant, black Protestant
and Orthodox denominations. The majority of U.S. Christians are
outside the council, in the Roman Catholic Church, Southern Baptist
Convention, and Evangelical and Pentecostal groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find this extremely helpful and hopeful,'' said the chief
executive of one key council member, the Rev. Clifton Kirkpatrick
of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).
</P>
<P>
   The board did not discuss the future existence of the council.
But chief executive Robert Edgar said in an interview it's an open
question whether the council would continue on alongside the new
body, or disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes an organizational structure has to be willing to
die. We have to be willing to entertain that,'' said the Rev.
Wesley Granberg-Michaelson, chief executive of the Reformed Church
in America.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar and Granberg-Michaelson are members of a small task force
that will hold preliminary talks with Christian groups outside the
council, invite them to join the process and propose next steps to
the council's national assembly in November.
</P>
<P>
   The project faces numerous obstacles, both ideological and
practical.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Protestants -- Evangelicals, Pentecostals and
Southern Baptists -- have been indifferent or hostile toward the
council, often accusing it of theological liberalism and promoting
political causes to the neglect of spiritual ones.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Catholic Church decided a generation ago not to enter
the council, partly because Roman Catholics in this country alone
exceed the 50 million members in the council's 35 denominations.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the Second Vatican Council, Catholic bishops have
been free to join cooperative bodies with other Christians and have
done so in 55 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar sent word of the proposal two weeks ago to the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Association of
Evangelicals and plans early contact with Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   In another major action, the council board settled a
long-running dispute by granting independent financial control to
its relief agency, Church World Service. The agency, which brings
in 85 percent of council revenues, has been dissatisfied with the
cost and quality of council administration.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, leaders' negotiations over the Church World Service
problem April 20 led to the idea of creating the new pan-Christian
group. ''It was a surprise for all of us,'' said the Rev. Bruce
Robbins, ecumenical officer for the United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   The council has struggled through financial trouble, with a $4
million deficit for 1999. Revenues are still ''seriously lagging
budget,'' a financial report said. But Edgar expressed confidence
that anticipated special gifts, staff cuts and other economies
would stabilize finances by the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Reds 3, Dodgers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Larkin homered as
as the Cincinnati Reds ended the Los Angeles Dodgers' six-game
winning streak with a 3-1 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Osvaldo Fernandez (1-0), who made his major league debut with
San Francisco nine months after defecting from Cuba in July 1995,
allowed three hits, struck out four and was pulled after a leadoff
walk to pinch-hitter F.P. Santangelo in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the right-hander's first in the majors since
April 27, 1997, when he beat Houston 3-2 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Graves struck out the side in the ninth for his eighth
save in as many opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati, which has won 11 of 16, took the lead for good with
a pair of runs in the third against Eric Gagne (0-3), who allowed
three runs and five hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Benito Santiago led off with a double, advanced on a sacrifice
by Fernandez and scored on a groundout by Pokey Reese.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, who missed 22 games because of an injury to the middle
finger of his left hand before returning last week, followed with
for his third homer of the season, his first in 32 at-bats since
April 20 against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey ended a seven-game homer drought in the sixth with his
14th of the year -- only his third RBI in 20 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 runs Gagne has allowed in his last four starts, 12
have scored on homers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who loaded the bases in four of the last five
innings of their 14-inning, 4-3 victory on Monday night, did it
again in the first inning with no one out against Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth opened the inning with a single and scored on
a sacrifice fly by cleanup hitter Eric Karros. But the Dodgers had
only two more runners in the next 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The X-rays on the sprained right ankle of Dodgers LF Gary
Sheffield were negative, and he expects to return to the lineup
Friday night. Sheffield was injured sliding into second base while
trying to break up a double play in the 11th inning Monday night.
... Larkin doubled in the seventh inning and left the game because
of a sore left hand. ... Former World Series MVP Orel Hershiser,
who returned to the Dodgers this season and beat the Reds 8-1 in
the home opener, has allowed nine earned runs in 5 1-3 innings
during four relief appearances since being demoted to the bullpen
on April 20. He hasn't appeared in a game since May 9. ...
Fernandez singled in the seventh for his first hit since Sept. 11,
1996, ending an 0-for-23 drought at the plate by Reds pitchers
since Graves' homer May 12 at Houston. ... Todd Hundley struck out
all four times he batted.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Celebrate Israel's Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Arabs are celebrating what they view as a
victory over Israel, though some worry that Israel's withdrawal
from south Lebanon happened so quickly it threatens stability.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli pullout from land it has invaded twice and occupied
since 1982 marked the first time Israel withdrew from Arab land
without negotiating a settlement -- a situation that makes the event
more chaotic -- but to many, far sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a clear sign that determination and will can lead to
the liberation of an occupied homeland,'' said Abu Ahmed Fouad of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical PLO
faction opposed to the peace accords with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the Lebanese guerrilla group that led the effort to
drive Israel out, was widely praised throughout the Arab world
Tuesday. In the past, Arab nations have supported Hezbollah's goals
but distanced themselves from it, trying to avoid quarrels with a
U.S. government that considers Hezbollah a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   Syria should ''borrow Hezbollah for the Golan, or set up its
own. It will cut the long negotiations short for them,'' said Fouad
al-Hashem, a columnist for Kuwait's Al-Watan daily.
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks between Israel and Syria -- the main power in
Lebanon -- that were aimed at eventually returning most or all of
the Golan Heights to Syria have been stalled since January.
</P>
<P>
   Damascus state-run radio called the withdrawal a ''sound defeat
to Israel'' and credited the ''cohesion between Syria, Lebanon and
the heroic (Lebanese) resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel started pulling its troops from southern Lebanon six
weeks ahead of its July 7 deadline and rushed to finish the
withdrawal after the rapid collapse of its militia ally, the South
Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo said the pullout
''proves that occupation, no matter how long it lasts, will end'' --
referring to Israel's 33-year presence in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of the 22-member Arab League, the group's Assistant
Secretary-General Saeed Kamal said: ''We congratulate Lebanon and
the Lebanese people for this historic achievement by forcing out
occupation forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt, the first Arab nation to
sign a peace deal with Israel, said the withdrawal was a necessity
and the ''faster it is carried out the better.'' If the situation
remains tense too long, it will hurt the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait University political science professor Massouma
al-Mubarak, however, warned in an article in Al-Siyassah newspaper
that the ''sudden pullout will certainly upset Lebanese security
arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been fears that an Israeli withdrawal in the absence
of a peace agreement with Syria would result in bloody retaliation
by guerrillas seeking vengeance on those who allied with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail Daghestani, a member of the Saudi Consultative Council,
called on Lebanon's government to take control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lebanese government should make sure that the situation in
the south remains calm now that Israel is leaving -- and make sure
that the Lebanese people there do not turn on each other.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Refugees Move Smoothly  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR AMNUN, Israel (AP) -- Israeli-allied militiamen fleeing the
chaos of Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon are being greeted by
orderly bureaucrats who register them by computer for housing, ID
cards and health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army may have miscalculated how quickly the
militiamen would flee Lebanon, but the Jewish state -- which has
absorbed hundreds of thousands of immigrants -- is already preparing
to teach them Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,000 refugees, members of the South Lebanon Army and their
families, crossed into Israel on Tuesday, fearing retaliation by
Hezbollah guerrillas who are taking over a border zone the militia
and Israeli troops patrolled for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In less than three days, the 2,500-member SLA disintegrated,
some fighters fleeing to Israel, others surrendering to Lebanese
authorities and a few remaining to defend their villages. Those who
made it to this makeshift transit camp in an idyllic resort on the
Sea of Galilee bitterly criticized Israel for the tumult.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli army withdrew from there and left us inside,''
said an exhausted 24-year-old militia member who fled after
Hezbollah captured the outpost he was defending. He would not give
his name for fear of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the refugees, many of whom know Israel from jobs or
vacations there, reluctantly resigned themselves to their new home.
Some planned to seek refuge in a third country. Almost all harbored
dreams of returning to their villages.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which until this week had publicly given only vague
promises about the militiamen's future, expects up to 10,000
refugees -- many of them Christians who fear revenge attacks from
the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Buses streamed into the transit camp Tuesday, unloading refugees
who lined up inside a tent to be photographed, receive an ID card
and register for health insurance and Social Security. Each was
given a name tag with a picture of an Israeli flag and a Lebanese
cedar, the SLA symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Education Minister Yossi Sarid said the adults would be
offered Hebrew classes and the children would be registered in
schools by September. In the meantime, he said, he would set up
summer camps.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has successfully processed waves of Jewish immigrants
fleeing violence in their home countries, but SLA refugees may find
it particularly difficult to readjust.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Israeli Arab villages, long-time opponents of
Israel's occupation of Lebanon, have said they don't want the
newcomers living in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Word had already spread in the transit camp, and many refugees
said they preferred to live in Jewish towns.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees know that unless Israel can make peace with Syria,
the real power in Lebanon, they will likely never return home.
Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down in January.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has promised to deliver militiamen who surrender to
the Lebanese authorities, but the refugees -- many of whom have been
sentenced to death or long jail terms in absentia -- do not trust
the Lebanese government, either.

<HEADLINE> Army To Test Laser Weapon  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is preparing a crucial test this week
of a new laser weapon being developed specifically to shield Israel
from short-range rocket attacks across its border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The test will be the first attempt to use the Tactical High
Energy Laser to shoot down an armed Katyusha rocket in flight.
</P>
<P>
   An Army announcement said the test would be at White Sands
Missile Range, N.M., ''before the end of May.'' An Army official
speaking on condition of anonymity said it may be as soon as today.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the laser weapon to Israeli security is
underscored by the chaos that erupted this week along the country's
border with south Lebanon when Israel's allied militia in the area
collapsed. The militia for years had occupied a security zone there
meant to protect Israel from Katyusha rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A string of rocket attacks in early 1996 prompted President
Clinton to approve a crash program by the Army and the Israeli
Ministry of Defense to develop the Tactical High Energy Laser. Army
officials plan to turn the $250 million weapon over to Israel this
fall if a series of scheduled tests prove that it is effective.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen,
said Tuesday it was up to Israel to disclose how and when it plans
to deploy the new laser weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel sought the weapon precisely to deal with this type of
threat,'' he said, referring to Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon was asked whether the Clinton administration was prepared
to contribute to an enlarged U.N. peacekeeping force in southern
Lebanon, as a means of stabilizing the situation after Israel
completes with pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly are prepared to provide assistance if we get
specific requests,'' he said. ''I don't believe we have at this
stage. We have not talked about committing manpower to that force.
A number of other countries have. But we are willing to provide
assistance if we find we can help and if there's a need for us to
do so.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at White Sands, officials tested the laser's system
for tracking a Katyusha rocket armed with a dummy warhead. The next
step, possibly this week, will be to fire the laser for the first
time at a Katyusha rocket in flight with a real warhead. Later, it
will attempt to shoot down multiple rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The laser weapon is being built under contract by
Cleveland-based TRW Space and Laser Programs Division. The costs
have been shared by the Israeli and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   Although this would be the first laser weapon built for defense
against rockets, the Defense Department has no immediate plans to
use it with U.S. forces, in part because the system is not easily
transportable. The Pentagon is working on a variety of other laser
weapon technologies that could be used to shoot down ballistic
missiles in flight, although deployment of such weapons is at least
a decade away.

Momentum Picking Up on China Trade
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of a measure to normalize trade relations with
China claimed to have seized the momentum as both sides of the issue dueled for
a dwindling pool of undecided lawmakers. A showdown vote was scheduled today in
the House. The Clinton administration and business lobbyists worked behind the
scenes to line up the votes needed for passage. The bill would extend permanent
normal trade relations to China, guaranteeing China the same low-tariff access
to U.S. markets that nearly every other country in the world has. For the past
20 years, China has received this benefit, but only after an annual
congressional vote.

Poll: Ruling Party Leads in Mexico

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An independent poll Tuesday showed the presidential
candidate from Mexico's ruling party significantly ahead of an upstart
opposition campaign that could be the most serious electoral threat to Mexico's
establishment in 71 years. The ACNielsen poll conducted for the daily newspaper
Milenio was the latest in several weeks of varying results by different polling
agencies. Discounting undecided voters, Institutional Revolutionary Party
candidate Francisco Labastida was favored by 42.9 percent, while Vicente Fox of
the center-right National Action Party was preferred by 35.8 percent.

United Owner Buying US Airways
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The owner of United Airlines, ranked No. 1 in the world, has
agreed to buy US Airways, which is the world's 10th-largest, according to a
source familiar with the talks. The boards of both UAL Corp. and US Airways
Group Inc. have approved the deal, the source said on condition of anonymity.
The combination will create an airline behemoth with 6,500 flights a day and
hubs on both coasts; in contrast, the world's No. 2 carrier, American Airlines,
offers but 3,600 daily flights. Details of the acquisition were not immediately
known, but the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Tuesday, citing
sources familiar with the deal, that UAL Corp. will pay $4.3 billion in cash and
assume $7.3 billion in debt and long-term leases.

Israel Makes Hasty Lebanon Withdrawal

   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- Israel pulled the last of its troops out of south
Lebanon at daybreak Wednesday, carrying out an unexpectedly hasty withdrawal
that ended one of the most divisive chapters in Israel's history. The final
pullout began with departing troops blowing up most remaining position after
Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered the evacuation, leaving the border region to
Shiite Muslim guerrillas who have been rapidly filling the power vacuum. The
last Israeli troops to leave Lebanon crossed into the Jewish state at 6:41 a.m.

Dollar Coins Being Hoarded

   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Millions of the new Sacagawea golden dollar coins are
in circulation. Trouble is, normally spend-happy Americans are squirreling away
the coins instead of using them as pocket change. The golden-colored coins were
introduced in January. Within its first four months of existence, 500 million
Sacagawea coins were in circulation, U.S. Mint officials said. The U.S. Mint has
been trying to persuade people to circulate the dollars with a $40 million ad
campaign featuring the face of George Washington from the dollar bill.

million Americans. How a product that makes people jittery could keep them from
getting a disease that gives them tremors is not examined in the study of 8,004
Japanese-American men in Hawaii. The study found that men who didn't drink
coffee were five times more likely to develop Parkinson's than those who drank
the most -- 4{ to 5{ 6-ounce cups a day. Non-coffee drinkers were two to three
times more likely to get the disease than men who drank 4 ounces to four cups a

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Shows Some Weakness  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television's seemingly indestructible force,
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' finally showed some cracks in
the armor last week.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC ratings juggernaut was trounced Thursday by the season
finale of ''Frasier.'' The NBC sitcom, which is moving to Tuesday
nights in the fall, had 33.7 million viewers compared to the 18.6
million viewers for ''Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about 9 million fewer viewers than the quiz show has
averaged on Thursday nights this year, Nielsen Media Research said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millionaire'' fans also didn't express much interest in the
Thursday night ''behind the scenes'' special. It had 13.4 million
viewers, compared to the 34.5 million people who made the season
finale of ''ER'' the week's most popular program.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say ''Millionaire'' can be beaten by strong
competition. The game show is ''default viewing'' for many fans,
said top CBS researcher David Poltrack.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of people watch it because there's nothing else
on that they like,'' said Steven Sternberg, a senior partner at the
advertising firm TN Media.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Against more lackluster competition, ''Millionaire'' bounced
back to 27.7 million viewers, just 200,000 fewer than its Sunday
night average for the year. Two competing movies -- ''Growing Up
Brady'' on NBC and ''The Linda McCartney Story'' on CBS -- did
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frasier,'' where characters Niles and Daphne drove off from
her aborted wedding in a Winnebago, was the highest-rated episode
in the program's seven-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The season-ending ''Friends,'' with Monica accepting Chandler's
marriage proposal, drew just under 31 million viewers. NBC quickly
announced it would repeat the episode Wednesday, the final night of
the May ratings sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said 14.3 million people tuned in to the series finale
of ''Beverly Hills 90210'' on Fox, that show's biggest audience in
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   With sweeps nearly over, researchers say broadcast networks have
increased their viewership over last May by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not huge, but at least it's not a decline, said NBC
Entertainment President Garth Ancier.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC had an average of 14.3 million viewers (9.8
rating, 16 share), and second-place NBC had 13.8 million viewers
(9.6, 16). While ABC is poised to capture the May sweeps, it is
running neck-and-neck with NBC among the 18-to-49-year-old
demographic that advertisers crave.
</P>
<P>
   CBS had an average of 12.5 million viewers in prime-time last
week (8.8, 15), Fox had 8.9 million viewers (6.0, 10), UPN had 3.9
million (2.6, 4), the WB had 3.6 million (2.6, 4) and Pax TV had
970,000 (0.7, 1).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with
9.7 million viewers (7.3 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.9 million viewers (6.8, 15), and the ''CBS Evening
News'' had 7.2 million viewers (5.6, 12).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of May 15-21, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''ER,'' NBC, 22.3; ''Frasier,'' NBC, 22.1; ''Friends,'' NBC,
20.0; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 18.2; ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 15.5; ''The Practice,''
ABC, 15.4; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Wednesday), ABC,
15.3; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 12.4;
''Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.3; ''CBS Wednesday Movie: Jesus,
Part Two,'' CBS, 12.3.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Ship Catches Fire in Alaska  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A fire aboard a cruise ship in Glacier Bay
National Park burned for about 45 minutes Tuesday, causing
extensive damage, Coast Guard and cruise line officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nieuw Amsterdam was in the northwestern end of the bay when
the fire was reported at about 9:40 a.m., Coast Guard Petty Officer
Darrell Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze was confined to the crew's quarters in the rear of the
704-foot vessel and extinguished after about 45 minutes, said Erik
Elvejord, a spokesman for Seattle-based Holland America Line, which
owns the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Elvejord said 10 cabins needed to be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   None of the ship's 1,201 passengers and 566 crew members were
injured, Elvejord said.
</P>
<P>
   Some crewmembers will likely be displaced by damage to their
cabins. The ship departed Glacier Bay on Tuesday evening after
Coast Guard investigators inspected the ship to determine whether
it was seaworthy, Elvejord said.
</P>
<P>
   The booming cruise ship business brings more than 500,000
passengers to Alaska's waters annually.

<HEADLINE> Fund-Raising Account Backed  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two FBI officials in 1996 listened as a
Justice Department prosecutor in the Democratic fund-raising
investigation suggested he was under political ''pressure'' and
that Attorney General Janet Reno's job was hanging in the balance,
an FBI lawyer says.
</P>
<P>
   FBI general counsel Larry Parkinson and two witnesses with
conflicting versions of the disputed 1996 comments were testifying
today to the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on administrative
oversight and the courts chaired by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson disclosed Tuesday to the House Judiciary Committee
that an FBI assistant director, Neil Gallagher, participated in the
1996 meeting and corroborates then-deputy director William
Esposito's recollection about the alleged talk of ''pressure'' not
to proceed with the investigation and Reno's job by Justice
Department prosecutor Lee Radek.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Parkinson's House testimony, Specter's subcommittee
added Gallagher to today's witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher ''essentially corroborates the account that is
described'' in an internal FBI memo written by the bureau's
director, Louis Freeh, Parkinson testified.
</P>
<P>
   Radek has said he doesn't recall making such comments and
wouldn't have because there was ''no basis in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Radek's alleged comments were disclosed by The Associated Press
last week in a story about Freeh's memo to Esposito recounting the
director's understanding of what took place at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was under great pressure to seek an independent counsel to
look into alleged fund-raising improprieties in Clinton's 1996
re-election campaign. Reno resisted an independent prosecutor for
fund-raising, but she obtained court appointment of seven
independent counsels to investigate the president and his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo to Esposito, Freeh said ''I ... advised the attorney
general of Lee Radek's comment to you that there was a lot of
'pressure' on him'' and the Justice Department's public integrity
section ''regarding this case because the attorney general's job
might hang in the balance (or words to that effect).''
</P>
<P>
   After the AP reported Freeh's Dec. 9, 1996, memo last week, Reno
said she never bowed to political pressure. ''I call it like I see
it, regardless of the consequences. I've got a month-to-month lease
on my apartment, and I've been prepared to go home from the
beginning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno added she did not recall Freeh briefing her on Radek's
purported remarks or ''talking about pressure because of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo, portions of which were read to the AP by government
sources who have seen it, did not say where the pressure was coming
from. The memo was turned over belatedly to Senate investigators
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson testified about the controversy under questioning by
Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan's questioning was curtailed amid Democratic objections
that it had nothing to do with the subject of the hearing -- the use
of classified information in immigration proceedings. Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., allowed limited questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have great respect for the FBI and I have a lot of questions
about how this Department of Justice handles a lot of things,''
Rogan said after the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Tapes To Be Released  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the crash investigation ongoing, federal
officials are letting the public hear what the pilots of an Alaska
Airlines plane were saying to air traffic controllers just before
their jet plunged into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was en route from Puerto Villarta, Mexico, to San
Francisco when it crashed north of Los Angeles on Jan. 31, killing
all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration plans to release a roughly
2-hour-and-40-minute tape at 10 a.m. EDT. The agency is not
expected to comment because the National Transportation Safety
Board still is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal authorities, Flight 261 was three hours
into its four-hour journey when the pilots of the MD-83 made a
routine check with Los Angeles air traffic controllers at 3:15 p.m.
and were cleared to 31,000 feet. Then, 15 minutes later, the crew
radioed they were having control difficulties and started
descending.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15 p.m., the pilots reported a problem with the horizontal
stabilizer, a tail part that controls the plane's up-and-down
motion, but said they thought they could land at Los Angeles.
During further exchanges, Flight 261 requested clearance for a
lower altitude, which was given.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:17 p.m., the flight was advised to contact another air
traffic controller on a different frequency; that transmission was
not acknowledged. Four minutes later, the plane went off radar
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Following the crash, the government ordered inspections of more
than 1,100 planes in the MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 series
following the crash. Airlines replaced jackscrew devices in the
tail sections of 18 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigators have been closely examining the stabilizer
jackscrew, a long, threaded piece of metal that turns to move
through a stationary nut.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew from the crashed plane had a stripped nut, and the
screw itself carried metal shards of the same material as the nut.
There also were impact marks on the nut, and the board is trying to
determine if the impact marks and stripping occurred before the
plane crashed or afterward or was caused when the plane hit the
water.

<HEADLINE> Marine's Remains Bring Healing  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- Two weeks after the official end of the
Vietnam War, Lance Cpl. Andres Garcia jumped on a helicopter bound
for the Cambodian island of Koh Tang to settle some unfinished
business.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old known as ''Andy'' was among about 200 U.S.
Marines sent by President Gerald Ford on a daring mission to rescue
the 39 American crewmen of the merchant ship Mayaguez, which had
been captured by Khmer Rouge patrol boats.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia -- like the other Marines -- was unaware that the U.S.
crewmen already had been released by the Cambodian communists.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen U.S. servicemen, including Garcia, were killed or lost
when their helicopter was hit by a rocket from Khmer Rouge troops.
Five others also died or were missing after the Mayaguez Incident
on May 15, 1975. They were the last American combat casualties in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Garcia's remains have been identified
and will be brought back to his hometown in southeastern New
Mexico. A ceremony was scheduled today.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say it's like opening a wound again,'' says Garcia's
brother, Alberto 47, his eyes filled with tears. ''And I say no,
it's finally going to close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Garcia family got word just two months ago about the
positive identification. Until then, sister Sara G. Neff and some
other relatives held out hope that Garcia could be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us were in denial, albeit it was a very small chance,''
said Neff, 39, who joined the U.S. Navy in her brother's honor. ''I
didn't accept that he was gone until this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon recently has been able to identify the remains of
Garcia and five others through DNA analysis. The remains had been
recovered over the past several years and brought to an Army
laboratory in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Pentagon released the names of three more: Lance
Cpl. Gregory S. Copenhaver of Port Deposit, Md.; Pfc. Walter Boyd
of Norfolk, Va.; and Pfc. Kelton R. Turner of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For the Garcias, the return of the remains of their son means
they finally will have a place to visit him. Some, like Neff, have
run their fingers across his name on the Vietnam War memorial wall.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia has been memorialized in many ways over the years: Three
children have been named for him. His mother and eight siblings
wear silver wristbands in his honor. And brother Alberto has
planted a pear tree in his backyard, symbolizing the times when
they playfully took fruit from a neighbor's tree as children.
</P>
<P>
   All the family has wanted is to have Garcia home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a good surprise and a sad surprise,'' said sister
Margaret Ornelas, 50. ''This is what we need.''

<HEADLINE> China Faces Market Opening Under WTO  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- For the Chinese, the vote in the U.S. Congress on
China's trade status is a stepping stone. The real changes --
cheaper imports of everything from movies and shoes to wheat and
autos -- will come gradually with Beijing's expected entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, China's trading partners have been chipping away at
Chinese barriers to imports of foreign goods and services. The
proposal to give Beijing permanent low-tariff trade status -- being
voted on today by the U.S. House of Representatives -- is a
commitment made by the Clinton administration in a deal made last
November on China's WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the 15-nation European Union clinched a WTO agreement
with Beijing that will help lower tariffs on 150 major European
imports, such as pasta, wine, shoes and ceramics. It also speeds up
the opening of China's insurance, banking and telecoms businesses
to foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   WTO membership may cost the jobs of millions of Chinese working
in inefficient industries such as agriculture and auto
manufacturing. But in the long-run, China's leaders are betting
that joining the world trade club will help hasten market-oriented
economic reforms and replace antiquated, unprofitable state-run
factories with modern, competitive industries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chinese consumers will benefit a lot. They can enjoy more
foreign products at cheaper prices. Chinese industrial firms can
also benefit from cheaper raw materials and equipment imported from
abroad,'' said Shawn Xu, an economist with the investment house
China International Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement Washington and Beijing reached in November broadly
opened China's financial services, telecommunications and other
long-closed sectors. As part of the deal, Washington promised to
get Congress to approve permanent normal trade relations, known as
PNTR, for Beijing and end contentious annual reviews that have
focused on China's human rights record and other disputes.
</P>
<P>
   China has reached agreements with all but five WTO members and
is expected to seek membership regardless of the U.S. vote. Once in
WTO, all members get to enjoy China's market-opening concessions.
But Beijing has threatened to deny U.S. companies greater access to
Chinese markets if Congress votes ''no.''
</P>
<P>
   While market opening agreements with the EU and the United
States call for gradual changes after China becomes a WTO member,
they spell major changes for many industries.
</P>
<P>
   In retailing, they lift limits on joint ventures by large
department stores and chain stores.
</P>
<P>
   Average import tariffs will fall from 18 percent to between 8
percent and 10 percent. Tariffs on car imports will fall from 80
percent to 100 percent to 25 percent by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Many limits on the operations of foreign insurers, banks and
telecoms in China will be phased out, with foreign partners given
greater managerial control in joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Quotas will be raised and tariffs lowered for imports of many
agricultural products, including dairy products, citrus, meat,
wheat, corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   The government will gradually give up its monopolies on imports
of crude and processed oil, chemical fertilizers and silk and will
eliminate policies preferential to Chinese pharmaceutical,
chemical, tobacco and liquor firms.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of all these changes will be a shift away from
farming and toward urbanization. Farmers will move into towns and
cities, taking jobs in industry and services.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is structural unemployment -- how to train farmers
to be factory workers,'' Xu said.
</P>
<P>
   But the increase in trade will affect China in less tangible
ways as well. The China-U.S. trade deal includes conditions that
will double to 20 the number of imported films China allows in its
theaters each year.
</P>
<P>
   With Hollywood hits looming on the horizon, China's leaders have
launched ideological campaigns aimed at instilling communist values
and at resisting the inevitable influx of more foreign, generally
unwelcome Western influences.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic impact of joining WTO will be nothing compared
with the impact on people's values and culture,'' said Li Xiguang,
a professor at elite Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
   Li said joining WTO will merely accelerate a process of
liberalization already well under way. Chinese no longer take their
cues from the state-run media or the Communist Party, but from
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cars. It's computers, films, the Internet. All of these
things are not domestic in origin. They are foreign,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Withdraws From Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- The last Israeli troops and tanks rolled
out of Lebanon at dawn today, completing a swift and dramatic
pullout from the southern zone Israel occupied for nearly two
decades and closing one of the most bitterly divisive chapters in
the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Unshaven, dirty and euphoric young soldiers gave each other bear
hugs and high-fives as the last Israeli tank crossed over at 6:41
a.m. -- less than six hours after Prime Minister Ehud Barak gave the
final order to leave, and six weeks ahead of Israel's self-imposed
July 7 deadline for getting out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going home,'' the last tank's commander, Sagi Bloomberg,
a 26-year-old captain, said with a big smile. Troops padlocked the
metal barrier of the Fatima Gate crossing behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Relief over the safe completion of the hasty and hazardous
withdrawal was tempered by sadness over the long conflict, which
had cost the lives of more than 950 Israeli soldiers since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nightmare is over,'' said Ephraim Gandelberg, whose son
was killed in Lebanon in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after daybreak, the all-clear siren sounded in Israel's
northern communities, letting people know it was safe to come out
of shelters where many had spent the past two nights as fighting
raged across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The pullback went on throughout the night, with long convoys of
tanks and trucks crossing the border before daybreak. Atop one
tank, several soldiers held up a big Israeli flag. Others waved
olive branches. A few climbed down from the armored vehicles and
hugged each other after reaching Israeli soil.
</P>
<P>
   Questions remained, however, as to whether Israel would be able
to avoid renewed entanglement in Lebanon. Barak explicitly warned
both Lebanon and Syria that Israel would retaliate harshly for any
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had initially planned to begin the pullback some days
from now. But Barak's hand was forced when the South Lebanon Army
militia, Israel's ally, disintegrated in the face of an onslaught
by Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrillas who led the fight to
drive Israel out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Over a span of several days, as Hezbollah and Shiite Muslim
villagers surged into the Israeli-occupied zone, SLA fighters fled
their posts, surrendered en masse or fled south, seeking sanctuary
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Israeli troops blew up most of their remaining
outposts in south Lebanon and evacuated the others. A huge orange
fireball lit the night sky when soldiers leveled the large Karkoum
base with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Israeli warplanes bombarded several positions abandoned
earlier by the SLA to prevent weaponry from falling into
Hezbollah's hands.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fatima Gate, Shai Mor, a 19-year-old soldier who was
posted for nine months at Marjayoun, the principal Israeli command
post in south Lebanon, said the pullout was a tremendous relief to
him and his comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers are now ''finished with all the fear of missiles and
land mines, and all the fear of dying -- in my opinion for
nothing,'' said Mor, as he held a rocket launcher in his arm and
watched the tanks roll rumble past.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Marjayoun was abandoned without fanfare. ''We just
picked up our things and drove away,'' one soldier told Israel
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said in an Israel TV interview late Tuesday that the
homecoming of the troops sent ''shivers down his spine'' and that
bringing the soldiers home safely made the difficulties of the
often-chaotic withdrawal worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and key world
leaders, Barak accused Syria of using Palestinians and
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas to sabotage the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has been exploiting the Palestinians in Lebanon ''to
commit terrorist acts against Israel after the withdrawal'' and is
providing a free hand to Iran and its Hezbollah supporters ''to
build infrastructures which would undermine regional stability to
the point of possible outbreak of hostilities,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982 in an attempt to drive PLO
guerrillas out of Lebanon and prevent cross-border attacks. Several
years ago, the mounting death toll spawned a grass-roots movement
pushing for an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Gandelberg, the bereaved father, called up Israel radio before
dawn and asked to read a prepared statement, his voice cracking
with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, the families bereaved in Lebanon, have paid for the
pointless presence there. The great quantity of blood of our dear
children caused the withdrawal of the Israeli forces,'' Gandelberg
said. ''I wish all the people of Israel peace and sound sleep at
night.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Criticized on Whistleblowers  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nuclear site workers who call attention to
safety problems face retaliation by contractors, who are in turn
aided by the Energy Department in fighting employee complaints,
whistleblowers and House lawmakers say.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials say they have a ''zero tolerance'' policy
on retaliation against whistleblowers, but have to help contractors
prevent a flood of bogus complaints of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zero tolerance makes a great sound bite, but if you're not
going to do anything about it as far as enforcement, the sound bite
rings a little hollow,'' said Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Two whistleblowers told the House Commerce Committee's panel on
oversight and investigations Tuesday that their employers
retaliated against them after they raised pollution and safety
concerns. In one of the cases, the Energy Department paid $500,000
in legal and settlement costs for a company that fired a crew of
pipefitters who raised safety concerns at the Hanford nuclear site
in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ''That means that the people here in this room today are paying
tax dollars to fight us,'' said Randall Walli, one of the
pipefitters. ''DOE should be out guiding these companies and not
paying for their mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   While not discussing the Hanford case specifically, the Energy
Department's top lawyer defended the agency's policy of helping
some contractors fight whistleblower allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zero tolerance does not mean that every whistleblower claim
must be accepted as valid without an opportunity for response or
appeal by the department's contractors,'' Mary Anne Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee hearing was the latest opportunity for
lawmakers to castigate the department's nuclear weapons programs.
Congressional critics have said the department was lax in its
investigation of alleged nuclear spying by China, mismanaged
efforts to clean up nuclear pollution and ignored safety and
environmental concerns at its plants.
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal for a government agency or contractor to retaliate
against workers who complain about unsafe conditions or other
wrongdoing, but the worker must pay the costs of making a claim
administratively or in court.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gutierrez, a whistleblower at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, said he has spent about $50,000 of his
own money to press his case. Gutierrez said he got an unfavorable
job evaluation after he challenged lab officials' claim that the
New Mexico lab did not violate the federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California runs Los Alamos and two other
nuclear labs, while Fluor Hanford Inc. is responsible for cleaning
up Hanford. The Labor Department ruled the contractors improperly
retaliated against Gutierrez and Walli, but in both cases the legal
fight over the allegations continues.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (contractors) can just bleed these poor individuals
dry,'' said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo. ''As far as we can see, DOE
takes no steps to protect these whistleblowers.''
</P>
<P>
   DOE routinely pays contractors' legal costs for whistleblower
cases and other job-related actions, such as racial discrimination
claims, Sullivan said.

<HEADLINE> China Readies For Artillery Drill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan said Wednesday that China's
military will hold live-fire artillery exercises this week near
outlying Taiwanese islands. The drills will be routine and not
threatening, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Taiwanese military has been quick to report
any Chinese actions that might cause public panic as this island
begins a new era of relations with its longtime rival -- a period
that could bring greater possibility of war.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Taiwanese military said China would hold
artillery exercises from Thursday to May 31 in Fujian Province's
Quanzhou Bay and Shenlu Bay in southeast China.
</P>
<P>
   The military said the routine drills are held every year and
pose no threat to Taiwan, which has control over several small
islands off Fujian's coast.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan separated amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing
has repeatedly threatened to invade. Relations have been especially
sensitive since a new democratically elected government took office
in Taiwan last week.
</P>
<P>
   It is still uncertain whether relations will improve or become
more tense during Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian's four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, local and Hong Kong media have caused public panic
and drops in the Taiwanese stock market with reports of threatening
Chinese military displays. Many of these reports have been based on
unfounded rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's military seems to be trying to head off such reports by
immediately sharing information it has collected from its close
monitoring of the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Signs SC Confederate Flag Act  </HEADLINE>
By JIM DAVENPORT
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- With the stroke of a pen, Gov. Jim Hodges
started a countdown to July 1, when the Confederate flag will be
lowered from atop the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ''This debate is over,'' Hodges said after signing legislation
Tuesday that removes the flag from above the Statehouse along with
Confederate banners now hanging in the House and Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us move forward together and united.''
</P>
<P>
   That may take time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the flags will come down -- they will be moved to a museum
-- a square battle flag will rise on a 30-foot bronze pole at the
Confederate Soldier Monument outside the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   That's still too prominent for critics who contend the flag is a
racist symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
vows to continue and expand the tourism boycott of the state that
it began Jan. 1. The civil rights group says the monument, where
the flag will fly, is still too prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our opinion there really is no resolution,'' state NAACP
president James Gallman said after watching the bill signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina alone flies the flag above the Statehouse, where
it was raised in 1962 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the
Civil War. Supporters say it represents the state's heritage.
Opponents say it was put up in symbolic defiance of the civil
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges noted struggles of slaves and Confederates alike in his
speech as he signed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, we bring this debate to an honorable end. Today, the
descendants of slaves and the descendants of Confederate soldiers
join together in the spirit of mutual respect,'' Hodges said in one
of the most politically important speeches of his first term in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Darrell Jackson, a black Democrat, tried to support the
NAACP's position. In the end, he parted with the NAACP and gathered
with about 20 lawmakers in Hodges' office for the signing. He said
he was satisfied that he delivered on a promise to his sons to
remove the flag. ''I can say to them, with the help of my
colleagues in the General Assembly, 'We did it.' And now, I think
it's time for the healing to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill went to Hodges' desk after Republican House Speaker
David Wilkins and Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler, who presides over the
Senate, met Tuesday morning to put their signatures on the bill.
''It's big. It's historical and it felt good,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges was elected in 1998 to a four-year-term with the help of
Confederate flag supporters who said he violated a promise that he
wouldn't take a leadership role in the flag debate.
</P>
<P>
   The political importance of the speech was evident as Hodges
practiced his remarks earlier in the day with a television camera
accidentally piping the signal into the Statehouse press room. At
one point, Hodges said to advisers that he wanted to ''distance
myself as much from the debate'' as he could. ''I know I can't do
it entirely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Morton Brilliant said Hodges was trying to emphasize
that he did not want to be seen as the center of the solution.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 102, Knicks 88  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Last year's non-factor scored 22. Last
year's 'X' factor scored four.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Croshere dominated his matchup with Marcus Camby, giving
the Pacers a weapon they never had in the past, and Indiana got
double-figure scoring from six players Tuesday night in a 102-88
victory over the New York Knicks in Game 1 of the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, Camby was the 'X' factor for them,'' Reggie Miller
said. ''(Croshere) is going to have to do the scoring this year as
well as box Camby out. He can stretch their defense with his
outside shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Croshere did, going 4-for-5 from 3-point
range and tying his career high in points by scoring 11 of his 22
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, displaying the type of potent, balanced offense New
York hadn't seen in weeks, opened an early 18-point lead the Knicks
never fully recovered from. Twice New York got its deficit down to
two, but both times the Pacers responded quickly and decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's lead was down to 52-48 at halftime after Mark Jackson
was called for a flagrant foul against Latrell Sprewell on a
breakaway with 3.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks got within two early in the third before Jalen Rose
finally got on the board and scored six of Indiana's first eight
points of the quarter. The Pacers went up by as many as nine before
the Knicks again cut it to two.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and Rose then exchanged emphatic dunks on alternate
possessions late in the third, as clear a sign as any that the
Pacers had an answer for every Knicks' run.
</P>
<P>
   It was 78-71 entering the fourth, and the Pacers got their lead
back to double digits by opening the quarter with a 7-2 run while
New York was missing seven of its first eight shots.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored 19, Rose 17 and Rik Smits 16. Dale Davis added 14
points and 16 rebounds and Jackson had 11 points and 13 assists as
the Pacers put together the highest-scoring game against the Knicks
this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''To beat a great defensive team, you have to have balance,''
Pacers coach Larry Bird said. ''We had that tonight. It was one of
our best all-around efforts of the season. This team is as focused
as I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, accustomed to focusing on just one or two offensive
threats in the first two rounds against Toronto and Miami, couldn't
cope with the many Pacers who all had their touch.
</P>
<P>
   In their first 10 playoff games, the Knicks had not allowed an
opponent to score more than 88 points. The Pacers reached that mark
with more than six minutes remaining on a 3-pointer by Croshere
that gave them a 14-point lead, and Croshere got them to 100, too,
on a 3-pointer with 42 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting 7-for-10 from the field, including 4-for-5 on
3-pointers and 4-for-4 from the free-throw line, Croshere reached
double figures for the fifth time this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''They left me open,'' Croshere said. ''Everybody was out there
sticking shots, and they had to leave somebody open with their
double teams. I'm sure I wasn't their primary focus, and that's
something I've tried to take advantage of all year -- the attention
teams pay to our other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell scored 22 points, Patrick Ewing had 21 and Allan
Houston 18 for the Knicks, who were coming off seven grueling,
low-scoring games against the defensive-oriented Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Running into a different kind of team, one that can put points
on the board quickly and much more easily, New York allowed the
Pacers to score 35 in the first quarter -- a total the Heat usually
wouldn't reach until late in the second quarter or early in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got the job done earlier than we did. We wasted a
quarter,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''When you waste a
quarter in this league, you get beat. We were ill-prepared for
their intensity in the first quarter, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   With Smits making five of his first six shots, the Pacers jumped
to a 17-7 lead just over six minutes into the first quarter.
Croshere hit his first shot, a 3-pointer, to put Indiana ahead
24-13.
</P>
<P>
   A dunk by Davis, a blocked shot by Miller and a 3-pointer by
Jackson got the lead up to 14, and Croshere tipped in a missed 3 at
the buzzer to give the Pacers a 35-17 lead after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a long series, a dogfight,'' Miller said.
''This is only one game. I'm more worried about Thursday's game
because now they'll have time to prepare.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Since joining the NBA in 1976, the Pacers have played in 21
playoff series before this one. When they win Game 1, the Pacers
are 10-0. When they lose Game 1, they are 0-11. In the five
previous Knicks-Pacers series, the winner of Game 1 has gone on to
win the series. ... Indiana went 12-for-12 from the free-throw
line, marking the ninth time in NBA history that a team hit all of
its foul shots in a playoff game. ... Miller had seven assists, a
career playoff-high. ... Indiana is 5-0 in the postseason when
scoring 100 or more points.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The agent representing St. John's coach Mike
Jarvis has denied that he said his client was considering other
coaching opportunities after ending talks with the Washington
Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, Rob Ades, denied speaking to an Associated Press
reporter Monday night and saying that Jarvis was considering a
major college coaching position and other NBA possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ades said Tuesday he hadn't spoken to the AP at all.
</P>
<P>
   The story was based on a phone call with a person who identified
himself as Ades to an AP sports reporter.
</P>
<P>
   AP sports editor Terry Taylor said the news agency was checking
the source of the call.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis issued a statement Tuesday saying he has ''no interest in
any other college coaching job.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that is said, in regards to any job regarding Mike
Jarvis, will be made by me and only me,'' Jarvis said. ''The
statements that are attributed to Rob Ades are false and
inaccurate.''
</P>

   Jarvis had been discussing the Wizards job with Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Watch Blowout Game Video  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- On the day after their worst loss of the
season, the Los Angeles Lakers were forced to watch video of the
debacle -- a horror movie with an unhappy ending.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Trail Blazers, knowing they don't play again until
Friday, got the day off Tuesday, confident and riding the momentum
of Monday night's 106-77 blowout in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   With the best-of-seven Western Conference finals tied 1-1, the
Lakers find themselves in a position that's been too familiar in
the playoffs for a team that won 67 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   As Lakers guard Ron Harper noted in the Phoenix series, Los
Angeles seems to lack the killer instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the same old thing for us, trying to find a way to get
ourselves up and ready to play, in an attack mode,'' Los Angeles
coach Phil Jackson said after the video session at the Lakers'
practice facility in El Segundo.
</P>
<P>
   A player who once brought that attack attitude for Jackson's
Chicago Bulls, Scottie Pippen, set the tone for Monday night's
victory with his relentless drives to the basket and harassing
defense.
</P>
<P>
   He and Rasheed Wallace, among others, frustrated Shaquille
O'Neal with double- and triple-teams all night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got three strong, long guys doubling me,'' O'Neal
said. ''In Game 1, we lived by the jump shot. In Game 2, we died by
the jump shot. We really didn't get good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday, the Lakers had won 24 of 25 at home, with the
only defeat a meaningless one in a game that O'Neal missed just
after the team had clinched the homecourt advantage throughout the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now that advantage has been lost to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening tip, Pippen took it to the Lakers. In the first
half, he repeatedly drove to the basket, where he either scored or
was fouled.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mind set was to attack,'' he said, ''to establish that we
weren't going to be a jump-shooting team.''
</P>
<P>
   From his days in Chicago, Pippen knows Jackson's triangle
offense as well as any player in the series, and the Blazers
stifled Los Angeles as no team has all season.
</P>
<P>
   ''You try to defend the penetration as much as you can --
basically take it away from a passing standpoint,'' Pippen said.
''We were able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had 21 points, 10 rebounds and three steals. Wallace had
career playoff-highs of 29 points and 12 rebounds. And Steve Smith
scored 24 points, twice as many as Kobe Bryant, and scored 11 in
the decisive 20-0 run in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was 2-for-15 from the field in the quarter and was
outrebounded 14-5. For the game, the Blazers dominated the boards
49-34.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy surrounding Dunleavy's unsuccessful
''Hack-a-Shaq'' tactics in Game 1 was forgotten in the magnitude of
Los Angeles' loss. There was no need to repeat the incessant
intentional fouling of the big guy, who still provided a good
argument for Dunleavy's Game 1 strategy by going 5-for-17 at the
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' vulnerability has been on display before in the
playoffs -- in two losses in Sacramento, in a one-point victory over
Phoenix in Los Angeles and in a one-sided loss in Phoenix. But the
Lakers weren't just vulnerable Monday night, they were awful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've still got three days to practice and get ourselves ready
to go up to Portland. ''We're really respectful of who Portland is
as a basketball team. We know we're going to have to go up there
and play well. We've done that,'' Jackson said, referring to the
Lakers' 90-87 victory at Portland on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are 1-3 on the road in the playoffs. The Blazers are
5-0 at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Garden will be rocking. Will the Lakers be reeling from
that 29-point loss, or will they have recovered from any emotional
hangover?
</P>
<P>
   ''Put it behind you,'' Bryant said. ''That's all. I don't care
if we lost by one, 20 or 40. The series is still tied 1-1.''

<HEADLINE> Actors Union Probes NFL Stars  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 9, Keyshawn Johnson and Eddie George reportedly shot a
commercial for Adidas. On May 10, the NFL Players Union told its
players to honor an actors' strike and not make commercials.
</P>
<P>
   That could make moot an investigation into Johnson, George and
John Lynch that could lead to punitive action by the Screen Actors
Guild.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told our guys one thing -- don't do it,'' Gene Upshaw,
executive director of the NFL Players Association, said of his
action supporting the striking actors.
</P>
<P>
   But Upshaw's memo to executive board members and player
representatives wasn't sent until nine days after the strike began
on May 1. Since this is the offseason, it took awhile for the memo
to trickle down to the rank-and-file, although George is a member
of the union board.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, traded last month from the New York Jets to Tampa Bay,
is the highest-profile player involved and seems to be SAG's main
target, although what the sanctions against him might be aren't
clear -- fines are the most usual. SAG has acknowledged that
Johnson's representatives have told its investigators that the wide
receiver wasn't aware of the strike when he made the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw said that his union -- like those for basketball and
baseball players -- fully supports the SAG strike. It also is
supported by Tiger Woods, who says he won't do any commercials
until the labor dispute is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw said he didn't know the three players took part in the
commercial shoots.
</P>
<P>
   In his memo, Upshaw noted that the actors had been on strike
''for a couple of weeks now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Because many of you are involved with or represent companies
desiring to use your image and services in commercials, we are
urging you to avoid shooting commercials or advertisements that are
considered 'struck work' until further notice,'' Upshaw wrote.
</P>
<P>
   '''Struck work' includes both TV and radio ads on the local and
national level. ... I am asking for your participation in endorsing
this cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Another target for the Screen Actors Guild is retired Gen. Colin
Powell, who is involved in the non-union production of a public
service announcement for the retired general's youth charity.
</P>
<P>
   The spot for America's Promise, The Alliance For Youth, began
filming in Maryland on Sunday, and SAG is picketing the production.

Arabs Celebrate Israel's Withdrawal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Arabs are celebrating what they view as a victory over
Israel, though some worry that Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon happened
so quickly it threatens stability. The Israeli pullout from land it has invaded
twice and occupied since 1982 marked the first time Israel withdrew from Arab
land without negotiating a settlement -- a situation that makes the event more
chaotic -- but to many, far sweeter. Hezbollah, the Lebanese guerrilla group
that led the effort to drive Israel out, was widely praised throughout the Arab
world Tuesday. In the past, Arab nations have supported Hezbollah's goals but
distanced themselves from it.

United Owner Buying US Airways
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The owner of United Airlines, ranked No. 1 in the world,
has agreed to buy US Airways, which is the world's 10th-largest, according to a
source familiar with the talks. The boards of both UAL Corp. and US Airways
Group Inc. have approved the deal, the source said on condition of anonymity.
The combination will create an airline behemoth with 6,500 flights a day and
hubs on both coasts; in contrast, the world's No. 2 carrier, American Airlines,
offers but 3,600 daily flights. Details of the acquisition were not immediately
known, but the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Tuesday, citing
sources familiar with the deal, that UAL Corp. will pay $4.3 billion in cash and
assume $7.3 billion in debt and long-term leases.

Microsoft, DOJ Head Back To Court

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of back-and-forth volleying between
Microsoft Corp. and the government, the question of what sanctions should be
imposed against the software giant now shifts to the federal judge who has
overseen the antitrust case from its start. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson is trying to craft a remedy that will curb Microsoft's future behavior
and restore competition in the software industry. The Justice Department, along
with 17 of the 19 states, has urged Jackson in legal documents to split
Microsoft into two companies.

Momentum Picking Up on China Trade
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of a measure to normalize trade relations with
China claimed to have seized the momentum as both sides of the issue dueled for
a dwindling pool of undecided lawmakers. A showdown vote was scheduled today in
the House. The Clinton administration and business lobbyists worked behind the
scenes to line up the votes needed for passage. The bill would extend permanent
normal trade relations to China, guaranteeing China the same low-tariff access
to U.S. markets that nearly every other country in the world has. For the past
20 years, China has received this benefit, but only after an annual
congressional vote.

Poll: Ruling Party Leads in Mexico

<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An independent poll Tuesday showed the presidential
candidate from Mexico's ruling party significantly ahead of an upstart
opposition campaign that could be the most serious electoral threat to Mexico's
establishment in 71 years. The ACNielsen poll conducted for the daily newspaper
Milenio was the latest in several weeks of varying results by different polling
agencies. Discounting undecided voters, Institutional Revolutionary Party
candidate Francisco Labastida was favored by 42.9 percent, while Vicente Fox of
the center-right National Action Party was preferred by 35.8 percent.

'Millionaire' Shows Some Weakness
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television's seemingly indestructible force, "Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire," finally showed some cracks in the armor last week. The ABC
ratings juggernaut was trounced Thursday by the season finale of "Frasier." The
NBC sitcom, which is moving to Tuesday nights in the fall, had 33.7 million
viewers compared to the 18.6 million viewers for "Millionaire." Against more
lackluster competition, "Millionaire" bounced back to 27.7 million viewers, just
200,000 fewer than its Sunday night average for the year. Two competing movies
-- "Growing Up Brady" on NBC and "The Linda McCartney Story" on CBS -- did
poorly.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Shanghai Noon'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two days after the dust and bombast of ''Mission: Impossible 2''
settle, another action flick high-kicks its way into theaters
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It's risky business to open a fast-paced adventure yarn the same
weekend as Tom Cruise returns with the Impossible Missions Force.
With Jackie Chan's ''Shanghai Noon,'' however, Disney figured it
had a winner. The studio is banking that its comic western can tag
along on Cruise's coattails as ''M:I2'' fires the starter's pistol
(and other artillery) to officially launch Hollywood's busy summer
season.
</P>
<P>
   Smart move. ''Shanghai Noon'' is a merry romp that will help
wash away the taste of last summer's six-shooter fiasco ''Wild Wild
West.''
</P>
<P>
   In this one, the ancient East meets the Old West. Chan plays
Chon Wang, a palace guard in China's Forbidden City who comes to
America in the late 1800s to rescue a kidnapped princess (Lucy
Liu).
</P>
<P>
   Chon hooks up with a new-age, image-conscious train robber, Roy
O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), who's more adept at shooting off his mouth
than his pearl-handled pistols. Roy also is more interested in the
chest of gold coins sent as ransom than in helping to free the
princess.
</P>
<P>
   The mix makes for a very amusing interracial buddy flick. Roy
mistakes his new partner's name as John Wayne and pronounces it a
terrible moniker for a cowboy. He laments that when the two become
wanted men, his ''sidekick'' Chon gets a $1,000 reward posted,
while Roy gets just $500. Roy also envies the cool nickname Chon
picks up, the ''Shanghai kid.''
</P>
<P>
   When they land behind bars, Chon suggests that one of them feign
illness so they can jump their jailer.
</P>
<P>
   ''You mean the sick prisoner routine?'' Roy asks. ''Does that
still work in China? 'Cause it's really been done to death here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Shanghai Noon'' relies on Chan's usual ballet of wild
martial-arts stunts as he chops up cops and robbers and cowboys and
Indians. The high-octane action is nicely choreographed and prompts
Roy to boast of his own skills as a lethal weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know karate, but I know crazy, and I will use it,''
Roy tells a bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Chan makes for a hilariously likable Western hero, and there's
good turns from Liu as the socially liberal princess, Roger Yuan
and Xander Berkeley as scowling villains and rodeo star Brandon
Merrill as Chon's smirkingly stoic Sioux bride.
</P>
<P>
   It's Wilson, though, who rounds up the laughs. Best known as one
of the oilmen-astronauts in ''Armageddon'' and a ghost-hunter in
''The Haunting,'' Wilson breaks out in ''Shanghai Noon'' with a
marvelous comic take on a goodhearted bandit who's less concerned
with booty than how he looks and acts while he's stealing it.
</P>
<P>
   After the pyrotechnics of ''Mission: Impossible 2'' whet
Memorial Day picnickers' appetites for action, ''Shanghai Noon''
makes for a nice, low-tech dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shanghai Noon,'' distributed by Disney, is rated PG-13 and
runs 110 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Caffeine May Deter Parkinson's  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Coffee, a product that makes people jittery, may
prevent Parkinson's disease, a degenerative brain disorder that
gives people tremors, a study published today suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Outside experts said the findings, if confirmed, could lead to
ways to treat Parkinson's more effectively or even prevent the
disease, which afflicts 1 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   How coffee seems to block the disease is not examined in the
federally funded study of 8,004 Japanese-American men in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers said the benefits are probably due to
caffeine -- apparently the more, the better -- and they suggest some
theories about how it might work.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that men who didn't drink coffee were five times
more likely to develop Parkinson's than those who drank the most --
4{ to 5{ 6-ounce cups a day. Non-coffee drinkers were two to three
times more likely to get the disease than men who drank 4 ounces to
four cups a day.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said it is uncertain whether their results would
hold for other ethnic groups and women.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association. It was led by Dr. G. Webster Ross, a
neurologist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said it is possible that heavy coffee drinkers have a brain
composition that may make them resistant to Parkinson's. Previous
studies have found low rates of Parkinson's in ''thrill-seeking''
people who tend to engage in high-risk behavior like smoking and
heavy drinking, and heavy coffee drinking also fits that
personality profile, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also suggested that caffeine may somehow protect against
the nerve-cell destruction that causes Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ross said it is too early to recommend coffee as a
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, this will lead to more basic research on caffeine
and its effect on areas of the brain affected by Parkinson's
disease,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said his study was larger than similar previous research
and took into account other factors that could explain the
findings, such as cigarette smoking, which has also been linked to
a decreased Parkinson's risk.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Carvey, director of the neuropharmacology research
laboratories at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in
Chicago, said the study is important because it traced the benefits
to caffeine, showing similar results with caffeine-laden foods
other than coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Abraham Lieberman, medical director for the National
Parkinson Foundation, called the results ''very interesting and
very provocative.'' He said that if caffeine does have benefits, it
is unclear whether it can actually prevent Parkinson's or slow its
progression.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's is usually associated with aging, though it has made
headlines recently with actor Michael J. Fox's disclosure that he
was diagnosed seven years ago at age 30. Attorney General Janet
Reno and Muhammad Ali are among others with Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   The disease involves gradual deterioration of nerve cell
clusters that make the chemical dopamine, which helps control
muscle movements. Ross and colleagues speculated that caffeine
might increase dopamine levels.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of Parkinson's include hand and head tremors, loss of
balance, and stiffness. Dementia and depression also can result.
</P>
<P>
   Medication helps victims function, but over time the disease
usually renders patients unable to care for themselves. Its cause
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers examined data from the ongoing Honolulu Heart
Program. Participants -- age 53 on average when the study began --
were asked about coffee consumption at the outset in 1965 and again
in 1971. The researchers then measured Parkinson's disease rates
from 1991 to 1996. The disease developed in 102 men.

<HEADLINE> Fatal fire that killed boys is linked to kitchen appliance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- A quick-spreading fire that killed two
brothers started with an electrical problem in a refrigerator,
according to the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the boys and their mother were spending the
night at the Rensselaer County house, which homeowner Kathleen
Seror realized was burning after a fire alarm woke her up Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the thorough on-scene investigation and critique of the
various events, we feel very strongly it was caused by an
electrical problem with the refrigerator on the first floor,'' said
Sheriff Daniel Keating.
</P>
<P>
   After attempting to extinguish the fire with a pan of water,
Seror ran next door to call 911. Her husband, David Seror, ran
upstairs to rouse the guests, who escaped by jumping out the second
floor window.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bus driver indicted in fatal collision with pedestrian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- A bus driver has been charged second-degree
manslaughter in the death of a Cornell University student who he
allegedly ran down in March while under the influence of marijuana
and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Stranger, 37, of Ithaca, was indicted Tuesday by a
Tompkins County grand jury. Stranger remained free. He was to be
arraigned at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charged Stranger with second-degree
vehicular manslaughter, second-degree assault and various drug and
motor vehicle violations. If convicted of second-degree
manslaughter, the most serious charge, Stranger could receive up to
15 years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 21-year-old Michelle Evans was killed March 16 as
she walked near a campus intersection. The indictment alleged that
Stranger drank within six hours of going on duty that day and also
was drinking and smoking marijuana while on duty. Police
confiscated six empty beer bottles from the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Stranger, originally charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol, was fired from his job with Tompkins Consolidated Area
Transit.

<HEADLINE> Occidental to close two facilities  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- Occidental Chemical Corp., moving to
focus on its core business, will shut down its Chemical
Intermediates Group in Niagara Falls and Grand Island Technology
Center, eliminating 340 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''After careful analysis, we have concluded that chemical
intermediates no longer meet our strategic objectives,'' J. Roger
Hirl, president and chief executive, said Tuesday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is one of the biggest economic blows the struggling
city of Niagara Falls has suffered in a decade, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is devastating,'' Joseph Marino, president of the United
Way of Niagara, told The Buffalo News. ''These people are the
blue-collar force of this city, and their quality of life will be
affected tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemical intermediates, chloro/fluorotoluene products, which are
sold to the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries, were recent
introductions to OxyChem operations, whose core business is
chlorine and caustic soda, vinyls and performance products.
Ironically, the bulk of recent capital investments at the Niagara
Falls facility were related to building the new product portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe (chemical intermediates) are better suited to
companies that are already firmly established in these businesses
or who have unique needs which can be met through direct
manufacturing,'' Hirl said.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said buyers would be sought for the Niagara
Falls plant and several related businesses and assets and that
discussions were already under way. However, he said, the company
will begin closing the plant while sales opportunities are
explored.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Texas-based division of Occidental Petroleum
Corp. will not affect operations at OxyChem's two other Niagara
Falls manufacturing facilities, which employ another 580 workers,
or the company's plants in nearby Fort Erie and Niagara Falls,
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives met with the affected workers Tuesday and
explained a phased plan to end production and research. An OxyChem
spokesman declined to release details, including when operations
would cease.
</P>
<P>
   ''They called us all into the lunchroom, sat us down and
bludgeoned us with the news,'' said worker Doug Hess. ''It was just
last year they invested $200 million in this plant. We thought we
were safe. And now this. We're all in a state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Niagara Falls plant, with 255 workers, produced 335,000 tons
of chlorine and 371,000 tons of caustic soda in 1999 along with the
soon-to-be-eliminated intermediate chemicals. The plant has its
roots in the Hooker Electrochemical Company that was established at
the site in 1906. Hooker was acquired by Occidental in 1968 and
renamed Occidental Chemical in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 48; Dow Up 28  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at the start of trading today
as technology shares dragged the Nasdaq composite index lower for a
sixth straight day. A big merger in the airline industry sparked
some buying.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq
composite index was down 47.76 at 3,116.79.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 28.44 at 10,450.71, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 0.67 at 1,373.19.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares remained mired in a slump. JDS Uniphase fell
4[ to 75 and Amazon.com fell 3 11/16 to 43. The technology sector
has borne the brunt of investors' worries over rising rates, which
are expected to cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors have determined that technology stocks, still
among the most expensive issues on the market, are too expensive
given the weakening outlook for profits.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways soared 23~ to 50 3/16. UAL Corp., the parent company
of United Airlines, is buying US Airways for $4.3 billion in cash,
the companies confirmed today. In addition to the cash payment, UAL
will assume $7.3 billion in debt and aircraft operating leases.
That heavy debt load pared UAL shares by 9 5/16 to 51 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 131 million shares,
ahead of Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 5.62 to 453.39.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.7 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was down 1.0 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 1.2 percent.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose today as investors sought
stable investments while technology stocks remain mired in a slump.
A big merger in the airline industry sparked some buying.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 57.22 at 10,479.49, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 23.09 at 3,141.46.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 3.99 at 1,377.85.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares dragged the Nasdaq lower for a sixth
consecutive session, although some scattered bargain-hunting was
preventing the index from repeating the sharp drops it suffered
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase fell 1{ to 77| and Amazon.com fell 2 5/16 to 44].
The technology sector has borne the brunt of investors' worries
over rising rates, which are expected to cut into corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors have determined that technology stocks, still
among the most expensive issues on the market, are too highly
priced given the weakening outlook for profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a bear market in technology,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp. ''What worries me is that
it's beginning to look like more than just a valuation problem.
Investors are now wondering if earnings estimates for tech
companies are too high at a time when interest rates are going
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   US Airways soared 21 3/16 to 47[. UAL, the parent company of
United Airlines, is buying US Airways for $4.3 billion in cash, the
companies confirmed today. In addition to the cash payment, UAL
will assume $7.3 billion in debt and aircraft operating leases.
That heavy debt load pared UAL shares by 9 5/16 to 51 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, news of the merger enlivened the rest of the airline
sector. For the most part, shares of regional airlines that are
also seen as takeover targets rose. Alaska Air rose 2~ to 31 7/16
and KLM Airlines rose 2 5/16 to 22 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Larger airlines that are perceived as potential buyers slipped.
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, fell 4 1/16 to 28 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 348.72 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace.

   The Russell 2000 index fell 6.38 to 452.63.

Audio reviews from The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   Selected new releases:
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Love and Basketball'' (Overbook Music/New Line Records) --
Various Artists
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack to this romantic hoops flick is just as sweet and
soulful as the film itself. The movie, about a couple whose
romantic life takes as many bounces as their respective basketball
careers, is divided into four quarters, as viewers watch the pair
grow up from their childhood in the 1980s to today.
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack has no such time formula: It randomly switches
back and forth from old school jams to neo-soul offerings, but does
it in such a way that the result is a natural flow from such
artists as Angie Stone (who does a smoldering remake of the Simply
Red tune ''Holding Back the Years'') to Rufus featuring Chaka Khan,
to the always fierce Me'Shell NdegeOcello.
</P>
<P>
   Besides conjuring up old memories, the oldies but goodies are
guaranteed to get you grooving again, because their magic is
timeless. Even if ''It Takes Two'' from Rob Base and DJ EZ Rock
does sound dated, it's still one of the all-time rap grooves that
will make anyone want to get up and dance. And who can resist
rocking to the voice of Al Green on the old jam ''Love and
Happiness?''
</P>
<P>
   Just as these tunes stand the test of time, a few of the new
offerings position themselves to be future classics. The standout
is the sexy track ''Dance Tonight'' from Lucy Pearl, the new group
that includes former Tony Toni Tone member Raphael Saadiq and ex-En
Vogue songstress Dawn Robinson. The song fits perfectly with this
soundtrack because it borrows its sound from the past -- the '70s --
to come up with a fun summer groove that will hook you from the
opening note.

   ''WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)'' (Republic/Universal)
-- Chumbawamba
</P>
<P>
   While Chumbawamba's breakthrough smash, ''Tubthumping,''
reverberates in sports arenas and pubs worldwide, the activist
music collective from Leeds, England, rewires with ''WYSIWYG (What
You See Is What You Get),'' an album of tracks woven together like
a memorial quilt.
</P>
<P>
   An array of musical styles morphs from song to song as
Chumbawamba revels in satirical critique of the American psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Chumbawamba meditates upon the Internet's dichotomy of community
and isolation in ''Pass It Along'' (''Pass it along by word of
mouse; Pass it along, don't leave the house''). The civil unrest of
Woodstock III and the World Trade Organization protests is
reinforced in ''I'm Not Sorry, I Was Having Fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The band sends up the NRA on ''Moses with a Gun,'' while the
bombastic ''Jesus in Vegas'' recycles celebrity for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Chumbawamba even gives a nod to the Bee Gees via Martin Carthy
in the nearly a cappella version of the somber ''New York Mining
Disaster 1941.''

<HEADLINE> Band Puts Its All Into Making It  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- The boys in the band take to the
darkened stage amid thick cigarette smoke and the smell of stale
beer.
</P>
<P>
   They are following in the footsteps of legends who played here
at the LKA Longhorn, a dank, dark warehouse at the edge of this
German industrial city -- legends like Metallica. Alice Cooper.
AC/DC.
</P>
<P>
   There are other footsteps, too -- those who came aiming for
stardom and now are forgotten, except for some old concert posters
wallpapering the building.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, industry analysts estimate, more than 1,000 bands
are signed to recording deals. Fewer than 1 percent ever find fame.
Their fate turns on talent, radio play, promotions, tours -- and
luck.
</P>
<P>
   The band at LKA Longhorn is known as Simon Says, a punk rock
band with heavy metal leanings. They've reached the Billboard 100
and are on the edge of blowing up or blowing out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like, 'Now or never,''' says guitarist Zac Diebels.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   In Stuttgart, the audience is loud. The music is louder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are Simon Says from Sacramento, California,'' screams
singer Matt Franks into the microphone to thunderous applause.
</P>
<P>
   This is Day 20 of a month-long tour by bus with German
powerhouse band Such A Surge and newcomers Flow Fy.
</P>
<P>
   The bands sleep by day. They play by night. They share buses.
</P>
<P>
   On this tour, there are no ''Limousines and Penthouse Suites'' --
a track from Simon Says' yet-unnamed upcoming album.
</P>
<P>
   Most days, the guys don't know where they are or where they are
going. Recounting stories from the road, they have to look at all
their access badges, which list cities and dates.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's Monday, it must be, what? Another German city,''
cracks Diebels, 23.
</P>
<P>
   Their bus rolls through Munich, Berlin and other cities, but the
only sites the band sees are the parking lots of concert venues.
The tour is about getting exposure, band members say.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, they look every bit the stereotypical rockers
with their T-shirts, jeans, dyed hair, tattooed arms and pierced
ears. In one case, a pierced tongue.
</P>
<P>
   But each personality plays a distinct role in building the band.
</P>
<P>
   Diebels is the salesman, pitching the band to industry types and
the media. Once a college student with aspirations of being a
Capitol Hill lobbyist, he is articulate and relentless in his
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Drummer Mike Johnston, 23, plays the devil's advocate, always
taking the other side in discussions -- just to make sure all their
options are represented. Twenty-two-year-old Franks prefers to take
the middle road. And bass player Mike Arrieta is the band's
listener. The youngest of the four, at 20, he interjects something
only when he feels it's absolutely needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the years I've known Mike he's been like that. Where I
use a thousand words to say 10, he uses just five,'' Diebels says.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet began, like many groups, as a garage band -- teen-age
friends pounding out notes and playing covers of their favorite
songs. Almost from the beginning in 1993, Diebels, Franks and
Johnston were writing and performing their own songs. They were
joined nearly three years later by Arrieta.
</P>
<P>
   They were kids having fun, even taking their name -- Simon Says --
from the child's game.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little childlike about their music -- aggressive
power chords, ear-shattering drum mixes and solid, sometimes
soulful, lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It started out as something to do and then it became this
thing that we couldn't imagine not doing,'' Diebels says.
</P>
<P>
   They took self-promotion seriously to get their music out to the
public, attacking utility poles and bulletin boards with staple
guns and flyers, spending hundreds of dollars on postage and even
more on telephone bills. They began booking high schools, and
playing to lunchtime crowds by day and clubs by nights.
</P>
<P>
   On a shoestring budget, they released two albums on a local
independent label.
</P>
<P>
   They earned a cult following, rave reviews from the rock
underground and precious local radio air play.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1998, Simon Says was making so much noise, record
labels started to listen. They signed with Hollywood Records to a
seven-year, three-album contract. The producer of the first was Rob
Cavallo, who helped engineer Green Day's smash debut album
''Dookie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Records 12-track debut ''Jump Start'' has
experienced a modicum of success. One of its singles was slapped
onto the ''Varsity Blues'' movie soundtrack, which hit the
Billboard top-selling albums list.
</P>
<P>
   A second song, ''Slider,'' was put in MTV's new artists
rotation, and a third, ''Life Jacket,'' slowly wound its way up the
Billboard rock chart.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, the group started a yearlong tour in cargo vans
of more than 200 high schools and nightclubs, stopping at hotels
only to shower. Halfway through the tour, they got an unexpected
break as the opening act for hard rock's Filter, which was on the
Billboard Top 10 and traveling in luxury buses.
</P>
<P>
   But while Simon Says was putting everything into their
aggressive, in-your-face performances, with songs exploring the
dark corners of their lives, Disney-owned Hollywood Records put
them on the music-video rotation on the Disney Channel. ''Life
Jacket,'' a personal song about their experiences in music, was
sandwiched between the likes of Britney Spears and 98 Degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollywood was working for them. I think they saw it as an
opportunity for them and tried it. But they aren't a boy band. They
are a hard-rocking group of guys, accomplished musicians,'' said
Kylee Brooks, a disc jockey who gave the group unlimited radio air
play on one of Northern California's leading rock stations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought it was going to be easy for them. ... The
appeal of Simon Says is their live show. To get them, you have to
see them and then listen to the album,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a point emphasized by their Stuttgart show -- it's sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those attending never heard of the group. But they leave
with armloads of T-shirts and copies of the CD.
</P>
<P>
   On a balcony overlooking the sales table, Arrieta coaches
potential buyers under his breath. ''Come on. You want the T-shirt.
Buy it,'' he whispers.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the cramped bus, the guys go over their performance with
a couple of friends who have joined them for the final leg of the
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Success is measured in part by audience participation: stage
diving, crowd surfing and slam dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, the band played in the east German town of
Cottbus, a place struggling economically after reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just stood there. It was really strange,'' Diebels said.
''This show was great compared to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the band's formation, weekly meetings and performance
critiques have been part of their work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched bands self-destruct over ego, alcohol and drugs,
Simon Says follows a code of sorts: No drinking the night of a
show; no frontman; no making decisions about the band's future
without the others; and absolutely no ego toward other band
members.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have attitude about what we do, about what we do on
stage,'' says Johnston. ''But we can't have an attitude with each
other. Occasionally, one of us is full of it, but there are three
other people to call us on it.''
</P>
<P>
   To make their rules work, the four share a two-story,
five-bedroom house on the outskirts of Sacramento. They also
collectively share the responsibility and the rewards for writing
and composing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in this together,'' Diebels says.
</P>
<P>
   Even the telephone answering-machine message makes the point:
''You've reached the Simon Says house. Leave a message.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Day 21 of the tour, Simon Says hits Frankfurt's
Batschkapp, a music hall for more than 30 years. The stage is
small. But Franks makes space himself -- crowd surfing. Hand over
hand he's passed from one end of the club to the other, still
clutching the microphone and never skipping a lyric. At the same
time, audience members jump the barricade, climb onto the stage
and, with a running start, jump back into the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston takes to the drums like a maniac. He puts on his own
show, reminiscent of the early days of Motley Crue's Tommy Lee.
Diebels and Arrieta are a team on stage with combined riffs that
echo in the tiny music hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience, Thomas Schwartz, 24, came to see Such a Surge.
He's leaving a fan of Simon Says.
</P>
<P>
   ''These Americans are pretty good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the bus, the band's conversation ranges from girlfriends
to junk food to music. Always, there's an infusion of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you know we're huge in Belgium?'' Franks asks.
</P>
<P>
   The guys howl with laughter. It's a running joke.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like that means anything,'' Franks explains. ''Who cares?
You're nothing anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, the boys in the band are headed into a Los
Angeles studio to cut a second album before heading back to Germany
in August to play a two-day music festival, then on a U.S. tour.
</P>
<P>
   The band members say they're enjoying the musical ride, and
admit they've indulged in a few whims since they got a little
famous.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston bought a new Mustang. Diebels and Franks bought
motorcycles. Arrieta bought a top of the line laptop computer and a
Toyota Cellica.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly they look toward the future, putting their money into
savings and investments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know it's not going to last forever,'' Johnston says. ''But
we're having a blast while we're doing it.''

have rules. So the guys have to sneak me back in.''

<P>
   On performing: ''I get up there and I can just let it go. You're
supposed to be crazy when you perform. If you acted like that on
the street, you'd be a freak.''
</P>
<P>
   Life after Simon Says: ''Computers. Something computer- and
music-related. I enjoy both of them. I can't imagine them not being
a part of my life. But right now, I'm concentrating on the band.''

<HEADLINE> Capt. Cook, Darwin in Exhibition  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) -- ''You will be amused with Fitz Roy's
Deluge Chapter -- Lyell ... has just read it &AMP; he says it beats all
the other nonsense he has ever read on the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The yellowing, tongue-in-cheek letter in the museum cabinet was
written by none other than Charles Darwin. He was describing
geologist Charles Lyell's reaction to an essay by meteorologist
Robert Fitzroy that argues for a literal reading of the biblical
account of Noah's flood.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1839 and Darwin, after five years surveying the wildlife
of the west coast of South America and some of the Pacific islands,
was convinced that the human species had evolved gradually over
millions of years.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzroy, a devout Christian who was captain of the Beagle, the
vessel that took Darwin on his voyage of discovery, had looked at
the same fossils and geological samples and concluded there was
proof that God created humankind -- and destroyed it by water.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of a new millennium, the evolution vs. creation
debate still resonates, and the letter has a prominent place in an
exhibit on time at Cambridge University Library. The library is
open only to accredited students and academics, but has recently
opened an exhibition section, with no admission fee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel it is important to make parts of our collection
available to the public,'' says Adam Perkins, archivist of the
Royal Greenwich Observatory library, the source of many of the
exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Other exhibited items on evolutionary time include a map of
South America hand-colored and keyed by Darwin to show the
continent's geological makeup, with clay, granite and basaltic lava
all noted in the naturalist's spidery hand.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is Darwin's hand-sketched and painted geological
cross-section of the Andes mountains, and also included is Darwin's
own copy of Lyell's ''Principles of Geology,'' which provided much
of the inspiration for Darwin's theories. Ironically, it was given
to him by Fitzroy.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the logbook from the Resolution, one of the ships
on the 1772-75 voyage of British naval explorer Capt. James Cook,
''bound on discoveries towards the South Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   The log was kept by astronomer William Wales, also a
cartographer who mapped the islands discovered by Cook, and
includes a carefully worked drawing of Norfolk Island in the
southern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Featured as well in the exhibition -- which runs through Sept. 15
-- is a lavishly illustrated, leather-bound Persian manuscript from
1566, a translation of the cosmography, or ''wonders of creation''
originally written in Arabic by the 13th-century geographer
Zakariya ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini.
</P>
<P>
   There is a deftly inscribed Chinese manuscript from 1478 showing
the workings of a clepsydra, or water clock, and a 1446 Sanskrit
time wheel written on palm leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition also looks at the development of time measurement
at Greenwich, including the plotting of longitude, and the 1967
discovery at Cambridge of pulsars, nicknamed ''ticking stars,''
neutron stars that spin hundreds of thousands of times per second.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a study of time in literature, from the poems of
Andrew Marvell to H.G. Wells' time machines.
</P>
<P>
   This section includes an early edition of Laurence Sterne's
''The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,'' in which
the 18th-century novelist offers a different theory of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea of duration,'' he writes, ''is got merely from the
train and succession of our ideas -- and is the true scholastick
pendulum.''

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Classics: Milton Berle  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Milton Berle occupies a chair in
the bar section of the Friars Club dining room, not because he
wants a drink -- he says he is a lifelong teetotaler -- but because
the dining area is off-limits for cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the California sun shines brightly outside, Berle is
dressed for a wintry day: wool slacks, tweed sportcoat, pink shirt,
paisley tie, trenchcoat and a gray fedora cocked in rakish John
Barrymore style. He is 91, going on 92, and the years, nearly all
of them spent in show business, are catching up with him. A cane
rests at his side. He peers through thick glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a stroke a year ago,'' he explains, ''and the only thing
it affected was my eyes. I can't see very well.''
</P>
<P>
   His mind seems as sharp as ever. He can recount incidents of
70-80 years ago. He can reel off the latest jokes, a few bawdy,
most of them innocent. He can even tell Henny Youngman-style jokes
about his wife, Lorna, whom he adores: ''My wife has lots of money
-- mine ... I'm going to be 92 in July -- if my wife lets me.''
</P>
<P>
   On the wall behind Berle hang portraits of revered Friars:
Ronald Reagan, Bob Hope, Dean Martin, Jack Benny, George Burns, Al
Jolson. Of the old guard, only Berle remains active, and he
cherishes his status as Abbot Emeritus, the highest position in the
century-old club.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Friars members, singly and in pairs,
approach Berle, announcing their names because of his poor
eyesight. They seem like worshippers before a lama: ''I grew up
watching Uncle Miltie on television''; ''You're looking great,
Milton''; ''We love ya, Milton.'' All this from battle-hardened
veterans of show business.
</P>
<P>
   Berle lights a cigar, takes a few puffs, puts it in an ashtray
and allows it to go out. ''I never smoked a cigarette, but I've
smoked cigars since I was 12,'' he says. ''I figure if George Burns
can smoke 20 cigars a day all his life and live to be 100, why
should I worry if they're bad for me?''
</P>
<P>
   The saga of Milton Berle is inextricably bound to his mother,
Sandra, one of the classic stage mothers of show business. (Berle's
father, German immigrant Moses Berlinger, was a dreamer who lacked
the drive of his wife and son. He worked at various jobs, including
housepainter, paint salesman and night watchman.)
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother had always wanted to be in show business herself,''
Berle remarks. ''When she was young, it was sinful for a woman to
be an actress. The family forbade her. So she brought all her
energies into me.'' She had energy and nerve, having worked as a
detective in New York department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Little Milton's career began at 5, when he attracted attention
on the sidewalks of upper Manhattan with his Charlie Chaplin
imitations. An agent saw him and found him work as the Buster Brown
boy, the advertising image for a line of children's shoes. Chaplin
himself sent for the boy, and Milton appeared in silent films with
Chaplin, Marie Dressler, serial queen Pearl White, Mary Pickford
and Douglas Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   Milton made his Broadway debut in a 1920 revival of the musical
''Floradora'' as a $15-a-week member of a boy sextet. Sandra Berle
then pushed her son into vaudeville, teaming him with a little girl
in a dramatic act as a juvenile Romeo and Juliet. They toured the
country and even played vaudeville's Valhalla, New York's Palace.
As he grew older, Milton shifted into a solo act, telling jokes,
singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mama was with me all the time,'' he recalls. ''She traveled
everywhere with me, made me do my homework on the road, and sat in
the audience for every show -- two a day, four a day, even when I
did 10 shows a day at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City. She used to
be a very big critic to me. She'd say, 'That joke didn't do very
well; take that joke out.'
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother held on to me with a tight grip; she didn't want to
lose me. It isn't considered right today, but I thought she had the
feeling of owning me and not wanting to be my mother but to be my
wife -- without incest. It's the old telltale story about the
mother's power over her son.
</P>
<P>
   ''She didn't worry about the girls I dated. But if I wanted to
get married -- not a chance. God love her, that was the silver cord
story between my mother and me. I didn't get married until I was
44. I hadn't had any real romances in my life until I met Joyce
Matthews, Miss America of 1940. My mother read in a column that I
was courting Joyce and she started to get shaky.''
</P>
<P>
   When Berle announced his plans to marry Joyce, his mother ''got
hysterical.'' But eventually she said, ''It's your life, get on
with it.'' She and Joyce became friends and often attended Milton's
performances together.
</P>
<P>
   Does Berle still dream about Sandra, who died in 1954?
</P>
<P>
   ''All the time, all the time. Reprimanding me, loving me,
cuddling me, bawling me out, different moods.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1940s, Berle remained a headliner in radio, movies
and Broadway shows, and at nightclubs in Las Vegas, New York and
Miami. Then in 1948, his career took a different turn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Texaco people came to me and said they wanted me to do a
television show,'' he recounted. ''I felt like trying a new medium,
and I thought I knew as much about television as anybody else. They
asked me what my format would be. I said I would do what I had been
trained to do and what I did best: vaudeville.''
</P>
<P>
   Able to earn top dollar in Las Vegas -- $25,000 a week -- Berle
started on the Tuesday night ''Texaco Star Theater'' for $1,500 per
show.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Sales of TV sets boomed, and movie house operators
lamented: ''On Tuesday nights you could shoot a cannon through the
theater and not hit a soul.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times writer commented: ''Television didn't make
Milton Berle; Milton Berle made television.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to host, direct, choreograph and script 182 live
hours for Texaco, and later some 60 hours for the replacement
''Buick-Berle Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of stars made their TV debuts on ''Texaco Star Theater,''
and Berle calmed their concerns about the new medium.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were all scared, especially when they came from Hollywood
to New York,'' said Berle. ''I told them, 'Don't worry about the
camera or hitting your marks. Just be relaxed and do your act, and
I'll have the cameras follow you.' When I wasn't on, I was
backstage with a headset, telling the booth: 'Put a wide angle on
this shot. ... Move in for a close-up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Berle was on. He wore outrageous costumes, often in
drag. He sang, he hoofed, he told jokes and milked them if they
bombed. He injected himself into the other acts. It was 60 minutes
of startling entertainment, the likes of which most Americans had
never seen before. Highbrows adored the sophisticated comedy of Sid
Caesar and Imogene Coca. The masses fell in love with Uncle Miltie.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, Berle sued NBC for more than $30 million,
claiming the network lost or gave away 133 episodes of the landmark
show, which he had hoped to sell to the public. NBC did not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   When Milton Berle finally exhausted his TV shtick and audience
in 1955, he continued as a top attraction in Vegas and elsewhere;
appeared in movies and TV series, often in dramatic roles; wrote
memoirs; performed public service, and served as adviser for
seniors for the President's Council on Physical Fitness.
</P>
<P>
   The stroke a few months after his 90th birthday ended his days
as a performer. He professes not to miss it: ''I believe I have
paid my dues. Instead of making people laugh, I want to make myself
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has entered a new career: professor emeritus of comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Every two months, he holds a seminar at the Friars Club.
Aspiring comics, none of them old enough to have known Berle as Mr.
Television, have lunch and ask him questions.
</P>
<P>
   He explained: ''I tell my classes, 'Everything has to have a
beginning, a middle and an end, whether it's a play, a movie, a
book, or even a one-liner. If you've got an opening and an end but
no middle, you're in trouble. If you've got a middle and an end but
no opening, you're in trouble. If you have everything put together,
you can kill the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you're Uncle Miltie.

<HEADLINE> Song Becomes Anthem for Occasions  </HEADLINE>
By MARTA W. ALDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- In a misty-eyed rite of passage at HUM
School for Little People, graduation ceremonies open each spring
with a procession of wide-eyed preschoolers marching in to the
recorded strains of ''Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian singer Michael W. Smith's song has become an anthem
for special occasions -- graduations, weddings, even funerals --
although it's 18 years old and rarely played on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was asked to sing it last year at memorial services for
the students slain at Columbine High School and for professional
golfer Payne Stewart, who was killed in a plane crash. In 1992,
Smith performed it at the White House as a farewell tribute to
George and Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   How does one ballad bridge so many gaps?
</P>
<P>
   ''It speaks to something we try to emphasize in our school,''
said Billie Aita, a teacher at HUM. ''And that's friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the song has an appeal beyond its initial
contemporary Christian music audience because ''it's a simple song
that works.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It stirs people's emotions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has won 25 Gospel Music Association Dove Awards, says
he couldn't complete a concert without performing ''Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My audience wouldn't receive me very well if I left it out.
They're always waiting for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The song's reach and staying power led contemporary Christian
music critics in 1998 to vote ''Friends'' the genre's all-time No.
1 song.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing company owning the rights to ''Friends'' annually
gets requests for permission to reprint the lyrics in senior
yearbooks, on greeting cards and coffee mugs and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ''This song tends to recycle itself every few years,'' said
Casey McGinty, vice president of EMI Christian Music Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ''A new group will come up in high school or college that seems
to identify with it, and it makes its way into the hearts of a
whole new generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The song's lingering popularity surprises no one more than
Smith, who co-wrote ''Friends'' with his wife, Debbie, in spring
1982, just before he began touring as Amy Grant's opening act.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths wrote it to mark the departure of a good friend who
had taught an informal weekly Bible study in their Nashville duplex
during their newlywed year.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife thought we should do something special for him and I
thought, 'Great idea, we'll get him a gift.' But she thought we
should write him a song and play it for him that very night. I
said, 'You're out of your mind. We can't write songs that fast.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, she had written the lyrics and, five
minutes later, he had penned the music.
</P>
<P>
   Smith sang it that night for their study group, where
''everybody cried.'' The song anchored his first album the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Smith has since had 23 No. 1 songs on Christian radio and
seven top 25 tunes on mainstream radio, it is ''Friends'' that
generates the most mail -- most of which Smith says ''will just move
you to tears.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent note from a couple in LaMoille, Ill., describes the
1998 automobile deaths of their teen-age son and his friend, both
of whom would have graduated from high school this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Friends'' was played at each funeral and will be sung at this
year's commencement, where the boys' parents will give each
graduate a ''Friends'' CD.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent concert in Edmonton, Alberta, Smith said, 14,000
young people sang along with him, word for word.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can look down and there's always two, three, four kids
holding onto each other and weeping. I can't even look at them
because I start crying, too. I don't know their exact story, but I
can tell they have lost a classmate or friend or loved one.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Smith said she is honored the song is often used ''for
life's big moments,'' especially in an age when few popular songs
explore friendship beyond romance or partying.
</P>
<P>
   ''The songs are already there for the romantic side of
friendship,'' she said. ''I much prefer to encourage friendship
that carries you through the hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Lyrics to the song ''Friends,'' written by Michael W. Smith and
Deborah D. Smith:
</P>
<P>
   Packing up the dreams God planted
</P>
<P>
   In the fertile soil of you
</P>
<P>
   Can't believe the hopes He's granted
</P>
<P>
   Means a chapter in your life is through
</P>
<P>
   But we'll keep you close as always
</P>
<P>
   It won't even seem you've gone
</P>
<P>
   'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
</P>
<P>
   Will keep the love that keeps us strong.
</P>
<P>
   Chorus:
</P>
<P>
   And friends are friends forever
</P>
<P>
   If the Lord is the Lord of them
</P>
<P>
   And a friend will not say ''Never''
</P>
<P>
   'Cause the welcome will not end
</P>
<P>
   Though it's hard to let you go.
</P>
<P>
   In the Father's hands we know
</P>
<P>
   That a lifetime's not too long to live as friends.
</P>
<P>
   With the faith and love God's given
</P>
<P>
   Springing from the hope we know
</P>
<P>
   We will pray the joy you'll live in
</P>
<P>
   Is the strength that now you show
</P>
<P>
   But we'll keep you close as always
</P>
<P>
   It won't even seem you've gone
</P>
<P>
   'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
</P>
<P>
   Will keep the love that keeps us strong.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat chorus

<HEADLINE> The Uncertainty of Friendship  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's the most intellectually challenging play on
Broadway in years. An unlikely hit about two real-life physicists
that is more about the nature of friendship than the meaning of
fission and fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the popularity of ''Copenhagen,'' the favorite to win the
best-play Tony Award June 4, remains as much a puzzle to its author
as the drama's dense discussion of quantum physics does to most
people in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Just why has ''Copenhagen'' captured the attention of
theatergoers more used to singing cats, falling chandeliers and
stage retreads of Hollywood disco movies from the 1970s?
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea,'' says English playwright Michael Frayn with
an almost gleeful laugh. He's not being difficult. The genial,
white-haired author of such works as ''Noises Off,''
''Benefactors'' and ''Wild Honey'' is unfailingly polite. Frayn
just doesn't know for sure. And not knowing for sure -- a lack of
certainty -- is what ''Copenhagen'' is all about.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, ''Copenhagen'' is a mystery, according to Frayn,
which may explain part of its success. Why did German physicist
Werner Heisenberg travel to Denmark in 1941 to meet with his
colleague and old mentor, Niels Bohr, the great Danish scientist?
The men were now on opposite sides in a great war, and the Germans
were taking their first tentative steps toward developing the atom
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation between Bohr and Heisenberg was never revealed.
The play is speculation on the event by Frayn, who studied
philosophy not physics in school. Yet it wasn't the scientific
discussions between the two men that attracted Frayn to their
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It focused on something that has always interested me
philosophically, which is how we know why people do what they do,''
says the 66-year-old Frayn, a former journalist who worked for The
Guardian and as a columnist for The Observer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it seems very obvious. You feel hungry. So you eat.
But a lot of human actions are more complicated than that. It's
very, very difficult to ascribe motives to them. But we have to
try.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to look at the external evidence, look at the
people's behavior -- what they say, the way they deport themselves --
and make some kind of estimate. But that's different from having
precise, firsthand knowledge of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright believes there is a theoretical barrier to ever
understanding people's motives directly. He sees a parallel with
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ''His principle implies that you can never have absolutely
definite knowledge of the physical world for everyday purposes,''
Frayn explains.
</P>
<P>
   That ambiguity intrigued him, spurring him to begin work on the
play. Frayn struggled with its form for a long time, finding it
difficult to organize all the scientific and historical material.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried writing it all kinds of different ways,'' he says. In
the end, he decided to portray its three characters -- Heisenberg,
Bohr and Bohr's wife, Margrethe -- after they had died, looking back
on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   After all, according to Frayn, that's what the story seemed to
be -- about these three people trying to locate what had happened in
Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no agreement about that for a start -- what Heisenberg
actually said,'' Frayn says. ''And secondly, what his intentions
were.''
</P>
<P>
   As to his intentions about atomic weapons in general, Frayn
continues: ''Was he actually trying to build them? Or was he really
trying not to build them? Or was he somewhere in the middle?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Copenhagen,'' which was directed by Frayn's longtime
collaborator Michael Blakemore, premiered at the Royal National
Theater in London in May 1998 and later moved to the West End,
where it is still running. The Broadway version, starring Philip
Bosco as Bohr, Michael Cumpsty as Heisenberg and Blair Brown as
Bohr's wife, opened in April.
</P>
<P>
   ''Copenhagen'' is the sixth collaboration between Frayn and
Blakemore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I show him what I think is a finished draft, but it never is a
finished draft because we then go through it together and he always
makes suggestions about changing it. Not so much with this play,
but with 'Noises Off' he persuaded me to do an enormous amount of
rewriting.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael and I literally go through it line by line, word by
word. It's a very slow and laborious process, but he makes me
explain what is happening and then offers suggestions. It's a way
of examining the text very closely.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Frayn thought of calling the play ''The Copenhagen
Interpretation,'' but finally thought ''Copenhagen'' simply was
more appropriate. Others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Queen of Denmark, who is an extremely intelligent and
educated woman, came to see the play in London and when the play
was done in Copenhagen, she told the producers, 'You've got to
change the title, because you can't have a play called
''Copenhagen'' in Copenhagen.'
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was very striking that a member of the Danish
royal family would take that level of intelligent interest in the
play. The second most striking thing was the producers didn't pay
any attention to her at all.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the world of science also have been interested -- and
complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scientists have been very generous about the play,'' Frayn
says. ''I expected them to be irritated by some stupid layman
trampling all over their subject. Some of them have pointed out
mistakes, but I hope I've got them all out now. Still, I think I
will have a few more people in New York saying something by the
time the play ends its run.''

<HEADLINE> Fun Is the difference for Steely Dan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, the two men
behind Steely Dan, there's a simple difference between touring now
and touring 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they're enjoying themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, Fagen and their 12-piece band are spending most of the
summer in concert amphitheatres across the country, performing hits
such as ''Peg,'' ''Rikki Don't Lose That Number'' and ''Deacon
Blues,'' plus songs from their first album in 19 years, ''Two
Against Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was, like, tortured when we were on the road in the '70s,''
Fagen says. ''I was a mess. This is the most fun we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Steely Dan exists now primarily as a touring outfit.
Their concerts provided the impetus for the new album; Becker and
Fagen were starting to perform new songs and realized it's easier
for audiences if they have a chance to get to know the music
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   That's an intriguing turn of events for anyone who knows Steely
Dan's history.
</P>
<P>
   Becker and Fagen, who met as students at Bard College, formed
the band hurriedly in 1972 after making their first album under the
name Steely Dan, and performed frequently.
</P>
<P>
   But they quit abruptly in 1975, disbanded the group, and instead
concentrated on writing and recording as a twosome. They produced
their best-known work over the next five years, and developed a
reputation as studio hermits and perfectionists. In their prime, no
one got to hear Steely Dan's music in concert.
</P>
<P>
   They have unpleasant memories of their early days on the road.
Steely Dan was mostly an opening act, struggling with lousy sound
systems, an inconsistent band and staying in cheap motels. They
were piling up debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, we were traveling around in close company with
people who were really having a good time and partying and we
weren't,'' Becker says. ''It was also a total drain from the
creative process of writing songs and making records, which we
needed to keep going at a certain pace just to have enough money to
live. Now, all of these things are more or less reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   Touring today means comfortable hotel rooms, star billing and
competent, consistent musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, we're traveling with likable, professional players,''
Becker says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody is drunk,'' Fagen interjects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody is freaking out,'' Becker continues. ''The police
aren't coming in looking for anybody. Nobody is banging holes in
the walls of hotel rooms. WE'RE not banging holes in the walls of
hotel rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they were never the type to toss TVs in the swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don and I just weren't the guys who wanted to get into a rock
'n' roll band for that particular reason,'' Becker says. ''We ...
wanted to write songs and put echo on stuff and mix records.''
</P>
<P>
   The music business has changed with them. For most acts that
appeal primarily to an older audience, concert tours are where the
money is made now. Fans of artists such as Steely Dan are generally
more interested in hearing classic songs than seeking out CDs of
new material, even though the sales performance of ''Two Against
Nature'' puts a dent in that theory.
</P>
<P>
   The album debuted at No. 6 in Billboard and has sold more than
600,000 copies. That's not bad considering the wait since their
last disc -- or record, since compact discs weren't even around
then.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was delighted,'' Becker says. ''It could have been
completely dismissed as a couple of old guys getting together to
try and bang out a record.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagen, sitting with his friend in a New York office, has a
different way of measuring it. ''I noticed this girl who just came
in to give us some water, she gave us a really big smile,'' he
says. ''Six weeks ago, we were just shmendriks. She couldn't care
less.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not true,'' Becker chides him. ''She's just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men have the easygoing rapport of old friends who can
finish each other's sentences and don't need the punchline to
chuckle at old jokes. They argue good-naturedly about differences
in music over the past two decades. Fagen thinks it hasn't changed
much; Becker isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   There's no dramatic tale to tell of their breakup in the early
1980s. They had grown apart socially and needed time to do some
work on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, like a lot of Americans, we were still in our
adolescence at age 30 or so, and we kind of ran out of steam as far
as life material,'' Fagen says.
</P>
<P>
   Critics found ''Two Against Nature'' remarkable for the way it
seemed to make time stand still; the break could just as easily
have been 19 weeks instead of 19 years. Their music has a slightly
snappier, rhythm 'n' blues feel to it, but it's basically the
airtight jazz-pop that is their signature.
</P>
<P>
   Becker and Fagen find that talk amusing, figuring it's based on
an assumption they're going to change what they do best. Was anyone
expecting a rap album?
</P>
<P>
   Their music is actually a favorite of many rappers, who are
often asking for permission to sample Steely Dan on their own
discs. Becker and Fagen usually grant it, figuring it's just the
modern equivalent of a long musical tradition of borrowing a chord
progression or lyric.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say it isn't a little strange to be sharing space
on the charts with artists who weren't born during Steely Dan's
first go-round.

<HEADLINE> Last of Japan's Master Directors  </HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Thirty years ago, Akira Kurosawa and three other
masters of Japanese film began a project to jointly write and
direct a samurai movie.
</P>
<P>
   Their ''Committee of Four Knights'' got bogged down by artistic
disagreements and other problems, leaving the film unfinished --
and, it seemed, forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But in memory of his three late colleagues, Kon Ichikawa, 84,
has resurrected the film. ''Dora-Heita,'' shown at this year's
Berlin Film Festival and opening in Japan this month, is Ichikawa's
most ambitious work in years.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated to Kurosawa, Keisuke Kinoshita and Masaki Kobayashi,
it is made in the carefully shot, cleverly scripted tradition that
won international acclaim for Japanese films in their glory days
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made fantastic movies back then,'' Ichikawa said. ''We
could go up against the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the story of a cocky warrior named Dora-Heita,
who infiltrates the lowlife of a crime-infested town to battle
corruption. It's fast-moving, slick entertainment, with finely
choreographed sword fights.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, Dora-Heita knocks out 50 swordsmen in a row,
though he leaves them unscathed by the blade of his sword in
accordance with the idealized samurai etiquette for law-enforcement
officials of those times.
</P>
<P>
   The camerawork, which uses a strobe-light effect, transforms
violence into a dreamlike sequence -- a ballet-like flurry of kimono
sleeves and flashing metal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sword fight is a great film aesthetic that our
predecessors created,'' Ichikawa said in a recent interview in
Tokyo, his trademark knit cap on his head and a smoky Camel
dangling from his lips.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dora-Heita'' is a testament to a legacy that includes
Kurosawa's ''Rashomon,'' ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Kagemusha.''
Japan's younger generation of directors -- Takeshi Kitano, Nagisa
Oshima and the late Juzo Itami -- have continued the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Although known less abroad, Kinoshita and Kobayashi are highly
respected directors in Japan. Kinoshita, who died in 1998, is
best-known for his anti-war film ''Twenty-Four Eyes,'' which
depicts the bond between a teacher and her students.
</P>
<P>
   Kobayashi's ''Harakiri,'' which criticized social hypocrisy, and
''Kwaidan,'' a collection of traditional ghost stories, won rave
reviews abroad. Kobayashi also directed the epic documentary
''Tokyo Trial.'' He died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa, who died two years ago, was a friend of Ichikawa. They
made a point of visiting each other's sets for at least a day when
either was shooting a film. ''It was actually more of a nuisance
when he visited,'' Ichikawa recalled, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Ichikawa has directed 74 films. Among them: the sultry yet
delicate ''The Makioka Sisters,'' based on the story by Junichiro
Tanizaki, and ''Harp of Burma,'' about a guilt-filled Japanese
soldier who becomes a wandering monk. Ichikawa made ''Harp of
Burma'' twice, in 1956 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He is especially proud of his 1965 ''Tokyo Olympiad,'' a stark,
pioneering work about the Tokyo Olympic Games that stirred up
controversy for mixing fine art with documentary.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he has made less serious, campy horror-mysteries,
including ''The Eight Tomb Village'' in 1996, that have won a
strong following at home. Earlier this year, he made
''Shinsengumi,'' another samurai period piece.
</P>
<P>
   Ichikawa still has more than a dozen ideas for films and vows he
will never stop making movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe this is what God intended me to do. And I love it,''
he said. ''Spiritually, nothing has changed for me from my first
film.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ''I don't see myself as a master. I'm just a kid who
loves movies.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most Ichikawa works, ''Dora-Heita'' is surprisingly
modern -- even fashionably youthful -- and shows parallels with
recent mysteries out of Hollywood like ''Seven'' and ''LA
Confidential,'' both works that Ichikawa praises.	   Still, the director is
critical of the recent emphasis on
high-tech special effects.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last American movie that truly moved me was Arthur Penn's
'Bonnie and Clyde,''' he said. ''The essence of films is eternal.
It's about looking at life and people through that square window.''
</P>
<P>
   Distribution plans for ''Dora-Heita'' in the United States and
elsewhere are not set.

<HEADLINE> Rhames: God Runs the Show  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ving Rhames doesn't mind that he's become one
of Hollywood's favorite second fiddles, playing a string of
supporting roles to the likes of Tom Cruise, George Clooney, Sean
Connery and Nicolas Cage.
</P>
<P>
   Rhames, who mentions God as often as other people pepper
conversation with the phrase ''you know,'' says he's really
co-pilot to his life and career, anyway. God, says Rhames, runs the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel God has blessed me with a talent that I'm trying to
cultivate,'' Rhames said in an interview to promote ''Mission:
Impossible 2,'' in which he reprises his role as Cruise's computer
and surveillance cohort, Luther Stickell. The movie opens
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think God had and has a plan for me, and whatever it is I'm
supposed to do while I'm on this planet, acting is going to be a
big part of it. I would say I'm a vessel for the spirit of a
character or the spirit of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the words you might expect from an actor who came to
mainstream attention as a sinister crime boss tussling with Bruce
Willis in ''Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The menace of that character seems far away; Rhames was speaking
while wrapped in an apron in a Four Seasons hotel suite, where
hairdressers were applying a hair weave for a new movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're just jealous of my long, beautiful hair,'' says the
actor, who has appeared with head shaved in many roles.
</P>
<P>
   Rhames won a Golden Globe in 1998 for his lead in HBO's ''Don
King: Only in America,'' and gained even more celebrity when he
gave it to fellow nominee Jack Lemmon at the ceremony. He stars as
a drag queen in ''Holiday Heart,'' shooting now in Vancouver to air
this fall on Showtime, then will star as boxing champion Sonny
Liston in ''Night Train,'' produced by Cruise's film company and
Paramount, which is releasing ''Mission: Impossible 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, he has landed a solid run of supporting roles,
to Cage in Martin Scorsese's ''Bringing Out the Dead,'' to Connery
in ''Entrapment,'' to Clooney in Steven Soderbergh's ''Out of
Sight.'' He lucked out with ''Mission: Impossible''; other than
Cruise's Ethan Hunt, Rhames' character was the only one to survive
the bloodbath of the first movie and live on for the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Rhames, 39, has broken out of being typecast as a ''Pulp
Fiction''-style heavy, the guy producers seek when they need ''that
sort of big, baldheaded black guy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't mind being typecast as a second fiddle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very blessed and privileged to work as I do and to make
the kind of money I make,'' Rhames said. ''Be it supporting or lead
role, that doesn't really affect me. And most of the time in films,
the lead role is not the best-written role or the most
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If God wants George Clooney to call me and say, 'Ving, read
this script,' and it's a good script, and they say, 'Ving, we'll
get you at least $2 million,' Ving is no fool,'' Rhames said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To do a film where you don't have to work every day and get
all the bonuses and pluses, and you get a very nice role that shows
you differently, not the heavy, and you're working with a George
Clooney or a Tom Cruise or a Nicolas Cage or a Martin Scorsese. I
can live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Harlem, Rhames played defensive secondary in
youth-league football and thought about an athletic career. At the
urging of an English teacher, he tried out for New York's
Performing Arts high school, depicted in the ''Fame'' movie and TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   He was accepted, and immediately started cutting classes to hang
out with his friends in Harlem. But he knuckled down to acting
studies late in his junior year, then went on to the Juilliard
School.
</P>
<P>
   During a break, Rhames studied at a state college in upstate New
York, where he met Stanley Tucci, who dubbed him ''Ving'' (Rhames'
real first name is Irving).
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Juilliard, Rhames did stage work, moved
into TV movies and guest spots, and was picking up small but steady
roles in theatrical films by the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   His deep voice and imposing presence made him a standout in
1994's ''Pulp Fiction.'' From watching him on screen, people tend
to think of Rhames as a behemoth actor like Michael Clarke Duncan
of ''The Green Mile.'' Rhames said they're surprised when they meet
him and discover he's only 6 feet tall, half a foot shorter than
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happens on screen, I believe, there's an energy inside of
me that comes across. It's not me. It's something within me. I'm
not that physically large,'' Rhames says.
</P>
<P>
   Rhames has not had to play on his expansive presence as the
computer geek of the ''Mission: Impossible'' movies. Despite the
frenetic action choreographed by director John Woo, Rhames spends
much of the movie at a portable computer while Cruise's character
dodges bullets and trades punches.
</P>
<P>
   The new movie has a more straightforward plot than the first
one, with Cruise and the IMF trying to prevent a villain from
unleashing a super-virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''My feeling is that the first one was a bit confusing, even
though it did well at the box office,'' Rhames said. ''I think with
this one, they really decided, OK, everyone should be able to
follow this film.''
</P>
<P>
   And will ''Mission: Impossible 3'' inevitably follow?
</P>
<P>
   ''The first one made, I think, $450 million worldwide,'' Rhames
said. ''What do you think, if this one makes $450 million? I think
so.''

<HEADLINE> Conan O'Brien's Sidekick To Leave  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe, just maybe, this is all some elaborate
joke. Andy Richter has always been able to keep a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. Richter, Conan O'Brien's partner on NBC's ''Late
Night'' for seven years, really meant it when he said he was going
to leave his seat on the couch. Andy's exit comes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The duo will sift through an hour's worth of clips -- Richter
calls it ''a eulogy in which the corpse is present'' -- and then
O'Brien will be on his own.
</P>
<P>
   It's a measure of how far ''Late Night'' has come in seven years
that Richter, who some NBC executives wanted off the air much more
quickly in the show's early days, is permitted a bittersweet,
extended coda.
</P>
<P>
   No animosity surrounds the exit. Richter told O'Brien more than
a year ago that he wanted to try something different, and admitted
he's been a little bored.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love this show, I'm proud of this show, and I'm proud of my
involvement,'' Richter said. ''I didn't want to start becoming
bitter about it. I thought if I stick around here I'm going to
start becoming an unpleasant person, and this place doesn't deserve
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter has always considered himself a comedic actor and
writer, and talk-show sidekick never figured into his career plan.
</P>
<P>
   Those talents enabled him to transcend the role. A skit that
appeared a few weeks ago was typical: He began by chatting with
O'Brien about potential replacements and then introduced his
''little sister'' in the audience. She had a crush on Conan and
desperately wanted the job.
</P>
<P>
   The retainer-wearing actress was a plant, of course. The comedic
bit escalated into slapstick, climaxing with ''little sister''
smashing a bottle over Richter's head.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no word, really, for what it was that Andy brought to
the show,'' O'Brien said. ''We never said, 'You be the Ed McMahon
sidekick, in the traditional role.' The idea was, 'Let's have this
funny guy who has a different rhythm than me sit next to me and do
whatever he wants.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the idea wasn't to have the second coming of Ed McMahon,
O'Brien at least wanted viewers to believe Richter could be.
O'Brien envisions ''Late Night'' as looking like Johnny Carson's
''Tonight'' show circa 1965, with a subversive layer of comedy
lurking beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Richter fit the part perfectly, with his dry humor and baby
face, which makes him, at 33, still look like he's pledging John
Belushi's fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of Andy Richter fans think he's this frat guy, but they
don't know he has very sophisticated tastes,'' O'Brien said. ''He
doesn't want to chug a beer. He wants a vodka and tonic, and he
wears a nice smoking jacket at a party.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter was hired as a writer, but he and O'Brien bonded in the
months before the show debuted and it was decided he would be in
front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   At first, ratings and critical notices were tough.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were so battered in the beginning, battered and fried, that
even when the compliments started, they were sort of left-handed
compliments,'' Richter said. ''The classic left-handed compliment
was, 'You're getting so much better.' That always implied that we
really sucked.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien recalls some of his favorite Richter moments, including
when Andy dressed up as Alanis Morissette. Richter had some of his
best times going out on location, like at Woodstock, where ''Late
Night'' cameras could have fun with bystanders without making fun
of them.
</P>
<P>
   He wishes he had more time to do other things, but the
five-day-a-week ''Late Night'' has demanded monagamy.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I really want most for Andy Richter is for him to be
happy, and I want him to do what makes him happy,'' O'Brien said.
''If staying here for five more years would make him feel like he's
not taking a chance that he needs to take and he starts being
unhappy because of that, it wouldn't be the same Andy.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter won't be replaced right away. O'Brien will fly solo, and
maybe later in the summer test some guests in the role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to be like a widow who wears black for awhile and
doesn't go dating, and then slowly I'll be seen around town with a
gentleman caller,'' O'Brien said. ''And then maybe I'm happily
married in a year or so. If so, great.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter is slowly working himself into other roles. He was the
voice of a talking dog in a pilot television series that, so far,
NBC hasn't picked up. He plays one of Richard Gere's buddies in the
upcoming film ''Dr. T and the Women.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife and I are going to the Caribbean for 10 days after I
leave,'' he said, ''and that's about as far forward as I'm looking.
Most of what I'm feeling is, 'I can't wait to get to that beach.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 27; Nasdaq Down 46  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks remain mired in a slump today,
driving the Nasdaq composite index to its sixth consecutive loss. A
big merger in the airline industry sparked some buying.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 45.59 at 3,118.96.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 26.73 at 10,449.00, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.11 at 1,373.97.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares dragged the Nasdaq lower, although some
scattered bargain-hunting prevented the index from repeating the
sharp drops it suffered earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase fell 2] to 76} and Qualcomm fell 7 47/64 to 71
41/64. The technology sector has borne the brunt of investors'
worries over rising rates, which are expected to cut into corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors have determined that technology stocks, still
among the most expensive issues on the market, are too highly
priced given the weakening outlook for profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a bear market in technology,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp. ''What worries me is that
it's beginning to look like more than just a valuation problem.
Investors are now wondering if earnings estimates for tech
companies are too high at a time when interest rates are going
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of the biggest decliners in the technology-dominated
Nasdaq was Costco Wholesale Corp., a representative of the ''old
economy.'' Shares fell 11| to 29 after the company said it missed
earnings estimates in the fiscal third quarter and is also likely
to miss fourth-quarter estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks drew the most buying interest after UAL, the
parent company of United Airlines, said it is buying US Airways for
$4.3 billion in cash. In addition to the cash payment, UAL will
assume $7.3 billion in debt and aircraft operating leases. That
heavy debt load pared UAL shares by 9[ to 51\.
</P>
<P>
   But US Airways shares soared 22 7/16 to 48]. Meanwhile, news of
the merger enlivened the rest of the airline sector. For the most
part, shares of regional airlines that are also seen as takeover
targets rose. Alaska Air rose 2~ to 31 7/16 and KLM Airlines rose 2
5/16 to 22 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Larger airlines that are perceived as potential buyers slipped.
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, fell 3~ to 28}.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 483.45 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 8.67 to 450.34.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Sarah Brown  </HEADLINE>
By CAROL DEEGAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sarah Brown of ABC's ''General Hospital'' let
out a scream of delight when she named outstanding supporting
actress at the 27th annual Daytime Emmy Awards. It was her fourth
nomination and third Daytime Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ah! Can I scream? Is that OK?'' Brown exclaimed as she stepped
to the podium at Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 25, has played Carly Benson-Quartermaine on ''General
Hospital'' since April 1996. She won the Daytime Emmy for
outstanding younger actress in 1997 and 1998, but lost to Heather
Tom of ''The Young and the Restless'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   Was she nervous?
</P>
<P>
   ''I was more nervous this year and last year than I was the
first two years, 'cause the first two years, I never expected to
win in a million years,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then when you win two Emmys, you have to live up to something.
If you lose two years in a row after winning two years in a row,
they go, 'Oh, she's going downhill, her career's in the Dumpster.
She's over.' So, I'm really nervous, my feet are shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was named favorite actress at this year's Soap Opera
Digest Awards. She won outstanding younger actress in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The following are her responses to some of the questions that
were posed by the media backstage at the Daytime Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   1. Who designed your dress?
</P>
<P>
   Brown: I can't tell you that. I could tell you, but it would be
a lie because I can't remember. I can't reach back there and see
it. The tag is really low. Actually, I had an Escada dress, and I
had it on hold. And they said, 'We're going to call New York on
Monday and make sure that nobody else is already wearing the
dress.' They called me on Monday and they're like, 'Over the
weekend Heather Tom walked in and bought your dress.' Oh, oh, not a
good thing. But, in fact, Heather's not wearing that dress, so how
mad am I now? (laughs)
</P>
<P>
   2. You've had an intriguing story line with Maurice Benard
(Sonny Corinthos) this year. Are you glad you stayed with ''General
Hospital''?
</P>
<P>
   Brown: There were a lot of things that went into my decision,
but not the least of which was the fact that I got to work with
Maurice this year. In fact, they just teased me right at the end of
last year of working with Maurice. It was like, 'Ahh, I want to do
that some more.' ... I get a lot out of working with him. And also
the writers, they were like on their hands and knees outside my
dressing room door like every day.
</P>
<P>
   3. You're one of the leading characters in ''General Hospital.''
Why were you nominated in the best supporting actress category?
</P>
<P>
   Brown: I plan to run for lead next year. Having not been around
this business for more than the four years that I've been here. ...
I didn't realize there was a woman who won at 27 a couple years ago
in the lead actor's category. But I was really under the impression
from what I've seen since I have been here, there's some ageism. If
you haven't been on the show for 10 years, five years, then it's
really tough and there's not a good chance for you to actually get
into that category, to even get nominated for lead. So, I put
myself in supporting because I felt that I definitely don't belong
in younger. I think that it should be left for somebody who hasn't
won in that category and for all the brilliant, really young
actresses. ... You've got to step out of the way. ... So this was a
really challenging category for me.
</P>
<P>
   4. Has being a Daytime Emmy winner changed your career?
</P>
<P>
   Brown: I wish. I only wish. ... It doesn't mean anything, I
guess, to the outside world. Like Spielberg is not knocking on my
door. ... Maybe winning three will mean something, I don't know,
I'll have to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   5. Any future projects?
</P>
<P>
   Brown: I have kind of an exclusive contract with 'General
Hospital' for a while now, not for a long while, but for a little
while, and at that point, once that's over, then I will definitely
be looking to spread my wings, not necessarily leave the show, just
look to maybe do a play. I'd really like to be here in New York
doing Broadway.

<HEADLINE> Chumbawamba Likes Hits, Anarchy  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The eight members of the English rock group
Chumbawamba see no reason why anarchists can't enjoy a hit record.
</P>
<P>
   ''WYSIWYG'' (''What You See Is What You Get'') was just released
by Universal Records. The album is a follow-up to 1997's
''Tubthumper,'' which contained the hit single ''Tubthumping,'' an
ode to drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Chumbawamba, whose members include guitarist Boff, trumpeter
Jude Abbott and vocalist Dunstan Bruce, didn't want to clone its
previous album.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our previous record was 12 songs. This is 22, which play
together -- like sound bites and collages in art -- as one whole
piece,'' Ms. Abbott said. ''It's a snapshot of what is going on in
the world. The previous record was centered on the north of
England.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject matter on ''WYSIWYG'' includes dumbing down, rich
girls becoming social commentators and the growing influence of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the music is sweeter on this one and the lyrics more
vitriolic,'' Boff said. ''On the last album, the bass and drums
were programmed. On this one, a lot of those things were live.
There was more room for us to experiment with the way we sounded.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't against Chumbawamba's anarchist principles to have a
hit single. In fact, band members enjoy the platform
''Tubthumping'' has given them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we'd written songs before that were good singles,''
Boff said. ''For one reason or another, they never sold. Our hit
was more by accident than by design. If we knew how, we would have
had a hit years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been obsessed with the idea of popular culture and being
part of that, rather than spending years and years outside of
things. You get bands who are happy to stay in their own scene or
don't like the idea of having a record that's popular. It wasn't a
problem for us at all.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ''Tubthumping'' did take them on a roller coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a hit all around the world and we were in demand
everywhere at once,'' Boff said. ''It was a totally new experience
for us. We'd been used for years to putting out records, touring
Europe for a month, touring England for a month and taking a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people think of Chumbawamba as a party band.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what was so good about the success,'' Ms. Abbott said.
''Every time we were interviewed, it became obvious we had another
agenda. It was a brilliant opportunity, which is why it was worth
18 months of complete mayhem.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the band never has another hit, it won't go back to its
previous underground status, Bruce said. ''Before the hit, we'd
never sold any records in Japan. If we never have a hit again, we
can still go to Japan and play there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chumbawamba defines anarchism as a fight to keep society from
being corrupted by institutions of authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing to do with chaos and disorganization,'' Bruce
said. ''It is actually about social organization, really structured
and well-organized, between people. There would be no government,
no bosses and no majority rule. Everybody's education is based
around this notion there has to be leaders. It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The band, while believing governments should be thrown out, is
more interested in what is happening around the world. At present,
the group's attention is focused on attacks on Asians and blacks in
England and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   When Chumbawamba began 18 years ago, the band lived together in
an abandoned house -- with the owner's permission. ''It was
fantastic. None of us had any money and the collective idea was how
we wanted to live and what we wanted to do,'' Bruce said.
</P>
<P>
   Chumbawamba had its own record company and sold records at
concerts and by mail order. ''Pictures of Starving Children Sell
Records'' was the title of the band's first album.
</P>
<P>
   Band members describe their songwriting method as getting
together and discussing a direction for an upcoming album, then
each going off and writing fragments of lyrics or music.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bit like a jigsaw (puzzle),'' Ms. Abbott said. ''We fit
in bits and pieces until the whole thing emerges.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does Chumbawamba mean?
</P>
<P>
   ''We've amused ourselves by giving alternative reasons for where
it came from,'' Boff said. ''The word doesn't mean anything at
all.''

<HEADLINE> Shemar Moore Calls Mom After Emmy  </HEADLINE>
By CAROL DEEGAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- He was the actor who shouted that Susan Lucci's
18-year losing streak was over and announced that she was the
winner of the 1999 Daytime Emmy for leading actress.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Shemar Moore of ''The Young and the Restless'' carved
out another piece of Daytime Emmy history: He brought a cell phone
to the stage after winning the award for outstanding supporting
actor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, my God! Hold on a second,'' pleaded Moore, holding his
cell phone to his ear. ''Please answer the phone. Please answer the
phone. My lucky charm could not be here tonight. I'm tripping right
now. I am calling my mother right now. Answer the phone. She's not
answering the phone. Mom?
</P>
<P>
   ''Mom, I won this damn thing,'' he told her voicemail.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Voicemail.
</P>
<P>
   Mom didn't pick up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage at Radio City Music Hall, he told the press: ''I spent
20 seconds trying to get hold of her. I'm going to kill her for not
answering the phone.'' Then he laughed. He was sure his mother was
watching the show, she just couldn't find the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who joined the cast of the CBS soap opera in 1994, said
he was thrilled to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're witnessing a dream come true,'' he said. ''Not so much
that I won the trophy, but what the trophy represents. The best way
to describe my life is in two words: 'Who knew?' This is just proof
that I'm doing something right, the hard work is paying off. When
it gets ugly and it gets hard and you get up anyway and you get to
the end of the day, this just says, 'I've got to get up tomorrow
morning and do it again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his work on ''The Young and the Restless,'' he is the
newest host of television's ''Soul Train.'' Prior to launching his
acting career, he was a successful print and runway model.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really didn't expect to win, but I didn't expect Susan to
win last year and that was a great moment,'' he said. ''Not because
she didn't deserve it by any means. But what's the difference
between 19, 18 (losses), you know?''
</P>
<P>
   He revealed what was going through his mind as he was getting
ready to announce the winner. ''I'm out there, and I'm just praying
that I say everybody's names right.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I turned over the card and the first thing I saw was
Lucci, the first thing that went through my head was: 'Get the
(expletive) out of here!' ... I know I can't say that out loud, so
let's come up with something better. This word 'streak' was in my
head, and you saw the rest of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucci, who was the host of this year's ceremonies, said she was
''thrilled to see Shemar win.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if she would answer her cell phone if daughter Liza
Huber (''Passions'') called her from the stage of the Daytime
Emmys, Lucci replied: ''She is a wonderful young actress and I look
forward to that day. And if she wants to reach me on the cell
phone, I'll be there. Absolutely.''

<HEADLINE> Lucy Pearl: Blend of Musical Tastes  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- You never know which of the multiple
personalities will appear when Lucy Pearl speaks.
</P>
<P>
   It could be Raphael, with his funk/soul sensibility. Or maybe
Dawn, with her harmonizing R&AMP;B girl-group diva self. Or perhaps
even Ali, he of the rich hip-hop legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they speak one at a time; other times, they can all be
talking at once. Now if Lucy Pearl were just one person, this could
be a problem. But since it is the name of a musical collective of
three creative and respected music industry veterans, it's kind of
interesting, especially since the name came out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were coming up with a name and Raphael started saying 'Lucy
Pearl,''' Dawn Robinson recalled during an interview at a Manhattan
hotel. ''The more we heard other people saying it, the more I
started liking the name.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Pearl's name has been on the lips of many hip-hop and R&AMP;B
fans lately. ''Dance Tonight,'' the track being promoted from the
''Lucy Pearl'' album, has been getting considerable radio and video
play since its release on the ''Love &AMP; Basketball'' soundtrack. The
album was released on the Pookie Records label on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Pearl was born in the summer of 1999. The collective
started as an idea of Raphael Saadiq, formerly of Tony! Toni! Tone!
The group, which was well-known for its soul-and-funk-influenced
sound, split in 1998. Saadiq had been working on some solo
projects, but wanted to try something new.
</P>
<P>
   He started talking with Ali Shaheed Muhammad, musical producer
for the groundbreaking A Tribe Called Quest, known for its brand of
lyrically clever, musically innovative, often socially conscious
hip-hop. Tribe had also recently disbanded, so Muhammad and Saadiq
figured it was a good time to create some music together.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who had left the female superstar quartet En Vogue in
1997, was about to sign a solo contract, but decided to join
Muhammad and Saadiq instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great because not only do I get to work with them and do
creative things that I hadn't done before, but it also individually
sets up other things for us as well. ... I had been gone out of the
light for four years; that's a long time for an artist to leave,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the three got into the studio, it was instant chemistry,
they said. There were no rules about who would do what or what each
person's role would be.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just came in the studio,'' Muhammad said. ''People were
just letting themselves go.''
</P>
<P>
   The album was recorded in Los Angeles, New York and San
Francisco. It is a mix of musical styles and influences, thanks to
the trio's varied musical interests. There is also a bit of
listener input. The group held an Internet contest, asking people
to do a remix of the track ''LaLa'' and offering to put the
winner's version on the album.
</P>
<P>
   Do they worry about comparisons with the work they did with
their old groups?
</P>
<P>
   Not really.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day you wake up is a new day,'' Muhammad said. ''Just
get up and make the music and have fun with it. ... What we're
doing is straight from the heart.''

<HEADLINE> Larger Country Music Museum Planned  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The new home for Naomi Judd's old
washing machine, Elvis Presley's Cadillac and Dolly Parton's
scribbled lyrics to ''Jolene'' is shaping up nicely in downtown
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The new Country Music Hall of Fame is set to open in May 2001.
Designers of the $37 million building hope to create a tourist
attraction that tells the cultural story behind the gritty,
working-class music.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through these folks, we can tell the story of American life
and struggle for success, and larger issues that transcend the
subject matter,'' said Hall of Fame director Kyle Young.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is Judd's white-enamel wringer washing machine
from her home in Kentucky. Long before she became a country
sensation with daughter Wynonna, Naomi washed other people's
clothes with homemade soap to earn money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got the recipe for her soap, and then we've got these
fancy costumes that they wore on their farewell tour,'' said Diana
Johnson, the museum's deputy director. ''Stories of human
accomplishments are really the thread that pulls this whole thing
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The new downtown Hall of Fame will replace a much smaller
building that opened in 1967 on Music Row, a three-block area where
most of the Nashville music industry operates.
</P>
<P>
   The new Hall of Fame has been under construction for a year.
From different angles, it looks like a piano, a railway station or
a giant musical note. From the air, it looks like a pile of stacked
records.
</P>
<P>
   There will be room in the museum's 40,000 square feet of exhibit
space to display much of the collection that has rarely been seen
by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we really do our job right, we would like to think that we
will not only be connecting the present with the past, but also to
the future,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit director is Ralph Appelbaum, whose work includes the
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., and
the American Museum of Natural History's new Hayden Planetarium in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more interesting features: Visitors will be able to
make a customized CD of the songs they enjoy during the tour. They
can also visit a booth where they can experience a blast of
applause.
</P>
<P>
   The admission ticket, costing about $15, will resemble a
laminated backstage pass. With it, visitors will be able to take an
elevator ride to the top of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour tour will start with a series of giant mazes,
where visitors walk through the early history of country music.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said artifacts will be placed along the way to help tell
the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be headsets so you can listen to the music, and
there will be video scrapbooks as a way of showing off our film and
still photograph collections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mazes will end at a gateway marked by Presley's Cadillac.
Visitors will then be able to view a display of stage outfits,
including those worn by Reba McEntire, that trace the evolution of
a country star's image.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reba really worked hard with us to show how she went from this
'rodeo belt buckle' kind of look all the way up to this glamorous
look,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes a 2{-story spiral staircase that leads to a room
displaying every gold and platinum album in the history of country
music. There are about 900 albums.
</P>
<P>
   This part of the museum also includes a display of private
memorabilia collected by singer Marty Stuart and the office of Owen
Bradley, producer for Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn, who died in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The structure also includes a theater where songwriters can
demonstrate their craft and space for rotating exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The country music chronology picks up again, tracing the music's
successes from the 1970s through today.
</P>
<P>
   The actual hall of fame will be in a rotunda at the top of the
building.

<HEADLINE> Across country from parched Southwest, rain spells big losses for onion farmers </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELBA, N.Y. (AP) -- They call it the Big O Farm -- O for onions
grown by Ognibene &AMP; Sons for 60 years. With all the rain of late,
enough to temporarily turn some of Elba's mucklands into foot-deep
lakes, this year's harvest could end up close to a Big Zero.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are they going to make it? I don't know, they look pretty
sick,'' said Steve Ognibene, 44, stoically surveying long rows of
green onion tips barely peeping through the waterlogged black soil.
''They should be three inches high by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the continent from the tinderbox Southwest, where
wildfires have devastated Los Alamos, N.M., some spots in the
Northeast are getting twice as much spring rain as usual. Farmers
in soggy western New York have endured weeks of frustration, and a
few could be out of business before it dries up.
</P>
<P>
   Onions are among the costliest commodities to sow at around
$2,000 an acre. At the end of March, Ognibene began planting the
800-acre farm he's worked since age 14, and finished up early this
month just in time for the heavens to open.
</P>
<P>
   The worst came on a mid-May weekend when a fleet of
thunderstorms dumped 3 inches of rain. Drainage ditches that
crisscross the 3,000-acre mucklands near Lake Ontario overflowed.
Some onion and potato fields were submerged for longer than 24
hours -- a perilous duration.
</P>
<P>
   ''With too much water, you can't get enough oxygen to the root
system and the plant suffocates,'' Ognibene explained, dark streaks
under his eyes accentuated by 14-hour workdays.
</P>
<P>
   As much as 75 percent of the onion crop could be lost in the
lowlands, which were converted from swamp in the 1930s. Only about
a dozen large farms operate here now, compared with scores of
5-acre to 15-acre plots when Ognibene's grandfather emigrated from
Sicily during the Depression, and their number could soon contract
even more.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Riner thinks he'll lose at least one-third of his 240-acre
onion crop but hopes to soak up his losses in upland fields set
aside for cabbage, peas, green beans, field corn, wheat and
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   As in other parts of upstate New York and into Vermont, however,
those plantings have been delayed nearly three weeks already by
excessive rain -- and there's no sign of a break in the clouds.
About 9 inches have fallen here since April, nearly 5 inches above
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Some smaller-scale farmers who rely solely on onions and
potatoes could have difficulty surviving.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try not to think of that,'' said Nancy Rowcliffe, whose
husband's onion fields were waterlogged. ''I really don't know how
much chance there is of recovering any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarked Riner, ''Out West, where it doesn't rain a lot and they
use supplemental irrigation water, maybe the risk in agriculture
isn't quite as high. But certainly here, Mother Nature plays a huge
role in the success or failure of a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he calls himself an eternal optimist. ''Even when
the weatherman says it's going to rain tomorrow, you hope there's a
chance it's going to go around you,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Ognibene, his next-door neighbor, knows only too well the need
to keep farming setbacks in perspective -- in 1993, his wife was
killed and two of their four children were fatally injured in a car
crash. And although he still runs the Big O Farm, the burden has
eased somewhat since his father, Joe, sold the farm last year to
another local family.
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed is the struggle it takes to get the product
grown.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have labor, weather, insect, fungus problems,'' Ognibene
said. ''When you think you got one solved, you get another one. And
then it's too dry or too wet and the wind's blowing too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''I laugh too. That's the only way you can get through
it.''

<HEADLINE> Gene Lab: No More Research on Humans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The University of Pennsylvania's gene
therapy institute, under fire over the death of an Arizona
teen-ager during an experiment last September, will no longer
perform research on humans, the school said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Human Gene Therapy will instead focus on
animal experiments and other basic research into gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration already had halted all clinical
trials at the institute, citing serious violations of federal
research rules important for patient safety.
</P>
<P>
   The institute came under investigation last fall when
18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger died four days after receiving
experimental therapy there. He was the first person known to have
died as a result of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   University spokeswoman Lori Doyle said Penn will continue to
conduct clinical trials in gene therapy, but that they will not be
done by the institute.
</P>
<P>
   And the institute's director, Dr. James M. Wilson, may be
consulted in the design of these gene therapy experiments, ''but he
will not sponsor clinical trials. He will not participate,'' Penn
President Judith Rodin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodin said the university will also strengthen oversight of gene
therapy research and other clinical trials, and review its
conflict-of-interest policies.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, one of genetics' brightest stars, founded a company in
1992 that had exclusive rights to discoveries made at his
institute. That financial relationship raised additional concern
about the experiment that killed Gelsinger.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said in a statement that he will remain as the gene
institute's director, hoping to develop ''a foundation of science
necessary to ensure the ultimate success of this field. Although
numerous scientific obstacles exist, gene therapy has tremendous
potential to someday prevent or cure life-threatening diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
offered a proposal to strengthen the safety of medical experiments
by fining scientists who violate federal research rules up to
$250,000, and universities up to $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Fox Names Entertainment Chief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox has hired studio chief Gail Berman, the
executive producer of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' to be the
network's new entertainment president.
</P>
<P>
   Berman has been president of Regency Television, a production
house aligned with Fox Television Studios that makes ''Malcolm in
the Middle'' for Fox and ''Roswell'' for the WB network.
</P>
<P>
   She replaces Doug Herzog, who quit after 14 months when a new
executive, Sandy Grushow, was hired to run both the network and
Fox's television studio.
</P>
<P>
   Berman's hiring was widely expected ever since Herzog left two
months ago. She said she wanted to stay at Regency to see whether
any of the programs that the studio was developing would land on
network schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Two Regency properties made it onto fall schedules when they
were announced last week: ''Fearsum'' on Fox and ''Tucker'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the fourth-ranked broadcast network, suffered through a
disastrous year in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from its special, ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire,'' caused Grushow to renounce reality programming.
The success of two new comedies, ''Malcolm in the Middle'' and
''Titus,'' was a bright spot.
</P>
<P>
   With eight new series planned for the fall, Fox is making more
extensive schedule changes than any other network.
</P>
<P>
   Berman said she's not concerned with Fox's track record in
chewing through entertainment chiefs: Herzog was the fifth person
to hold the job in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to create an atmosphere where creativity will blossom
and people will feel secure that I will be around,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Lead Nasdaq Selloff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks remained in a slump today,
driving the Nasdaq composite index to its sixth consecutive loss.
Trading was once again volatile, with the weakness in technology
threatening to dismantle the broad market's modest gains.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was down 60.99 at 3,103.56.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators had recovered from midday declines and
were mostly higher. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 42.15
at 10,464.42, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 1.41 at
1,375.27.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares dragged the Nasdaq lower, continuing a slide
that has knocked the Nasdaq 39 percent below its March 10 peak of
5,048.62. The technology sector has borne the brunt of investors'
worries over rising rates, which are expected to cut into corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, investors attacked the largest, best-capitalized
companies, which just weeks ago were seen as a safe haven. JDS
Uniphase fell 3 63/64 to 75 9/64 and Qualcomm fell 7 47/64 to 71
41/64.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors have determined that technology stocks, still
among the most expensive issues on the market, are too highly
priced given the weakening outlook for profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a bear market in technology,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp. ''What worries me is that
it's beginning to look like more than just a valuation problem.
Investors are now wondering if earnings estimates for tech
companies are too high at a time when interest rates are going
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of the biggest decliners in the technology-dominated
Nasdaq was Costco Wholesale Corp., a representative of the ''old
economy.'' Shares fell 10{ to 30[ after the company said it missed
earnings estimates in the fiscal third quarter and is also likely
to miss fourth-quarter estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks drew the most buying interest after UAL, the
parent company of United Airlines, said it is buying US Airways for
$4.3 billion in cash. In addition to the cash payment, UAL will
assume $7.3 billion in debt and aircraft operating leases. That
heavy debt load pared UAL shares by 9[ to 51\.
</P>
<P>
   But US Airways shares soared 22] to 48 5/16. Meanwhile, news of
the merger enlivened the rest of the airline sector. For the most
part, shares of regional airlines that are also seen as takeover
targets rose. Alaska Air rose 2~ to 31 7/16 and KLM Airlines rose 2
11/16 to 23 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Larger airlines that are perceived as potential buyers slipped.
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, fell 3~ to 28}.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 744.50 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 12.05 to 446.96.

<HEADLINE> Young named as head of Newington skating center  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- Figure skating coach Bob Young, who
brought Olympic gold medalists to Simsbury, is hoping to do the
same here in his new job as executive director of the Connecticut
Skating Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very exciting,'' said Young. ''We'd like to continue to
do the same thing here and we'd like to put Newington on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, 45, resigned earlier this month as coach of the
International Skating Center of Connecticut in Simsbury amid
allegations of sexual harassment by a former student.
</P>
<P>
   He declined Wednesday to comment on the case, saying ''I'm
focusing on the future.'' As far as the status the case, he said,
''I don't have that information right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he resigned from the Simsbury center to ''move
forward to a new opportunity,'' not to escape the allegations by
23-year-old skater Jessica Roos.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Roos, who trained at the Simsbury facility, filed a
lawsuit claiming Young made sexually oriented comments and
inappropriately touched her for nearly five years. Young has
maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Roos has said she sees Young's departure as a vindication of her
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who was responsible for bringing Olympic gold medalists
Oksana Baiul, Ekaterina Gordeeva and Viktor Petrenko to train in
Connecticut, was placed on paid leave in February. He had worked in
Simsbury for nearly six years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The East Granby resident, who grew up in East Hartford, said he
is looking forward to returning to his ''old back yard.'' Young
would not get specific, but said he has been working diligently on
plans that would be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking world wide right now,'' he said. ''The Olympics is
upcoming in two years-- and in the U.S.-- the same situation as in
1994.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Budnick, the center owner, said he plans to make a
''major announcement'' within the next two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who began skating at age 13, was 15 when it ''just
clicked.'' He joined the U.S. National Figure Skating Team as an
amateur in 1967 and turned professional in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's absolutely the most experienced person who is capable of
organizing a top-notch figure skating program,'' said Budnick. ''He
brings us a level of professionalism that's second-to-none.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, which opened in February 1999, already is
established in ice hockey. The general manager, Chris Kiene, is a
former defenseman for the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to do the same with skating that he's done with
hockey,'' said Young.
</P>
<P>
   Roos' lawsuit was to be heard by the state's Commission on Human
Rights and Opportunities. A message was left Wednesday at the CHRO
office.
</P>
<P>
   Simsbury police were also investigating Roos' allegations. A
message was left for detectives Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 108; Nasdaq Up 48  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned higher today as blue-chip
technology stocks made a modest recovery, lifting the Nasdaq
composite index out of its sixth consecutive loss. Trading was once
again volatile, with market averages changing course several times.
</P>
<P>
   With less than an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular
session, the Nasdaq composite was up 47.95 at 3,212.50. Earlier in
the day, the Nasdaq had been down as much as 121 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators had also recovered from midday declines
and were nearing their high points of the day. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 107.60 at 10,529.87, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 18.90 at 1,392.76.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks reversed their declines as investors began seeking
bargains in the battered technology sector. Steep, steady selling
in the past few sessions has wiped away nearly all of the
spectacular gains the Nasdaq achieved between early November and
early March.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the largest, best-capitalized companies, which some
see as a safe haven, erased early declines. Cisco Systems rose 4
1/64 to 54 9/16 and Intel rose 7[ to 117. Applied Materials rose 4
13/16 to 76 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks have borne the brunt of investors' worries
over rising rates, which are expected to cut into corporate
profits. Many investors have determined that technology stocks,
still among the most expensive issues on the market, are too highly
priced given the weakening outlook for profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a bear market in technology,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp. ''What worries me is that
it's beginning to look like more than just a valuation problem.
Investors are now wondering if earnings estimates for tech
companies are too high at a time when interest rates are going
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors proved willing to reward technology companies
that are performing well. Intuit rose 5 15/16 to 33 after releasing
an upbeat profit report.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks drew the most buying interest after UAL, the
parent company of United Airlines, said it is buying US Airways for
$4.3 billion in cash. In addition to the cash payment, UAL will
assume $7.3 billion in debt and aircraft operating leases. That
heavy debt load pared UAL shares by 7~ to 52{.
</P>
<P>
   But US Airways shares soared 22] to 48 5/16. Meanwhile, news of
the merger enlivened the rest of the airline sector. For the most
part, shares of regional airlines that are also seen as takeover
targets rose. Alaska Air rose 2~ to 31 7/16 and KLM Airlines rose
2} to 23\.
</P>
<P>
   Larger airlines that are perceived as potential buyers slipped.
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, fell 3~ to 28}.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 906.99 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 4.47 to 454.54.

<HEADLINE> Smashing Pumpkins Breaking Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Say goodbye to Smashing Pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based rock band that was a leader in the alternative
rock revolution of the early 1990s has slumped in sales recently
and will break up at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Billy Corgan called Los Angeles radio station KROQ this
week to announce the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was planning the split even before Smashing Pumpkins
released the album ''Machina/The Machines of God'' in February. He
said the group may release another album from those sessions later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The band is now touring the United States and has concerts
scheduled in Europe. There may be a farewell tour of the U.S. in a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   Corgan said he intends to continue making music but has no
immediate plans. Guitarist James Iha will also stay in music.
Drummer Jimmy Chamberlin wants to pursue a career in auto racing.

<HEADLINE> R&AMP;B Producer Riley Files Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Rhythm-and-blues producer Teddy
Riley, who led the Grammy-winning group Blackstreet, claims he was
slandered by a former bandmate.
</P>
<P>
   A $2 million lawsuit filed Friday in Virginia Beach Circuit
Court says former Blackstreet member Chauncey Hannibal defamed
Riley on MTV and on radio shows by playing a rap song that says the
producer stole from him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lyrics ... imply that Riley is an unethical and dishonest
person, that he engages in unethical and underhanded business
practices,'' the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   Riley also wants the court to order Hannibal to stop playing the
song, called ''Shame on You,'' and making further accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Hannibal, who goes by the stage name Chauncey Black, told The
Virginian-Pilot the song doesn't mention Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never said his name in that song,'' Hannibal said. ''If you
want to take it like that, OK. The truth hurts. But I never said
his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackstreet, formed in 1993, won the best R&AMP;B group performance
Grammy in 1998 for ''No Diggity.'' The band broke up last year.

<HEADLINE> Pataki bans MTBE in New York; signs acid rain bill  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki continued to try to
follow in the boot steps of Theodore Roosevelt Wednesday by banning
a controversial gasoline additive, battling acid rain and opening a
nature center named for his political hero.
</P>
<P>
   ''The use of MTBE in gasoline has significant environmental
impacts on groundwater,'' Pataki said. ''While today's action is
necessary to protect public health and safeguard the state's
precious water resources, we will continue to fight for federal
action to ban MTBE and identify an acceptable alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Methyl tertiary-butyl ether increases oxygen in gasoline so it
burns ''cleaner'' and reduces air pollution, but it has
increasingly been found in ground and surface water statewide. It
is a particular concern on Long Island because residents there
depend on aquifers for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision will help protect water quality and public
health on Long Island and across the state,'' said Sarah J. Meyland
of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   The effects on the environment of banning MTBE are not that
clear, critics said. The trade-off of banning MTBE, effective in
2004 under the bill signed by Pataki, is that more toxins will be
released into the air from vehicles statewide. That is an
unacceptable and unnecessary trade, said Peter Iwanowicz, director
of environmental health for the American Lung Association's New
York chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a more concerted federal action is needed, one that
will help make cars pollute less without threatening ground water.
Such action, Iwanowicz said, is possible now.
</P>
<P>
   Federal action is also called for because disparities between
states can affect prices at the pump. Suppliers have said that
blending fuel differently to meet a state's standards could
increase prices in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also signed into law a measure that will prohibit New
York state utilities from helping Midwestern companies that exceed
their allowed emissions. The state law closes a loophole in a
federal law that provides for the buying and selling of pollution
''credits'' among industries.
</P>
<P>
   The law was two years in the making because the state Assembly
required that it be applied to pollution credits dating to 1990,
not starting this year as was proposed, said Assemblyman Richard
Brodsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester Democrat, who sponsored the bill in his chamber,
said the difference is the new law will cover about 750,000 tons of
emissions that create acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want any utilities to profit from essentially
unethical behavior whenever the credits were earned,'' said
Brodsky, who wasn't invited to Tuesday's bill-signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The law ''will begin the process of healing New York's
wilderness forests and lakes to the benefit of generations to
come,'' said Neil Woodworth, counsel to the Adirondack Mountain
Club and the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York-based utility companies have a stake in seeing that
similar companies in nearby states follow similar air pollution
standards,'' said Timothy Burke of the Adirondack Council. ''It's
no secret that it's cheaper to produce power at older, dirtier
plants than at the newly equipped, modern facilities that dominate
New York's landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said that unless Congress takes action to better regulate
Midwest emissions that are carried by prevailing winds to fall as
acid rain in New York, the state's utilities will be at a financial
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements were made at the Theodore Roosevelt Nature
Center at Long Island's Jones Beach State Park. Pataki opened the
center with indoor and outdoor exhibits about coastal environments
and wildlife in New York state. It was built with $425,000 in state
and federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as the life of Theodore Roosevelt has always been a
tremendous source of inspiration to me, it is my hope that this
center will inspire and educate our children and all New Yorkers
about the importance of protecting and preserving the
environment,'' Pataki said.

<HEADLINE> Half of Europeans Said Face Obesity  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) -- About half of European adults will be
obese by 2030, partly because of an emerging epidemic of obesity
among children and adolescents, a health researcher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The growing problem of obesity among European children means
they will face many of the weight-related diseases earlier and die
younger, researchers said at the start of a four-day European
Congress on Obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Heart and circulation problems and the type of diabetes usually
seen in older people are increasingly occurring in European
children -- even 10-year-olds -- because more of them are getting too
fat, said Luc Van Gaal, co-president of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent to 20 percent of European adults are now obese,
compared with about 24 percent of American adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not reach yet the U.S. levels, but we are unfortunately
approaching it,'' Van Gaal said.
</P>
<P>
   Practically nobody in Europe is eating an appropriate diet,
according to Philip James, chairman of the International Obesity
Task Force, an independent group of obesity scientists from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have failed to get people into a sane state of thinking
about diet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People are obese if they are so fat that their health is harmed.
It is defined universally by measuring the body mass index, or BMI,
which is calculated by multiplying weight in pounds by 703, then
dividing that result by height in inches squared.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization's threshold for obesity is a body
mass index of 30 or more. People who have a BMI of 25 or more are
considered overweight.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 to 20 percent of European adults are currently obese,
meaning they have a BMI of 30 or more. That figure will grow to as
high as 50 percent in the next 30 years, said Jaap Seidell,
president of the European Association for the Study of Obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people who are obese or overweight, meaning they
have a BMI of 25 or more, will soar to 60-70 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only a minority of people will be able to maintain a healthy
weight in the environment we are creating,'' Seidell said.
</P>
<P>
   Children are getting fatter mainly because their lives are
dramatically different from those of their parents and
grandparents, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Junk food and unhealthy convenience meals are everywhere, while
the computer and television age has kept children sedentary for
longer periods than ever before. Fear of crime also has made some
parents frightened to let their children play outside or cycle to
school.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, 54 percent of 10-year-old girls in Malta and 36
percent of 10-year-old boys in Italy are obese, James said.
</P>
<P>
   Seidell said the food industry spends 1,000 times more on
advertising and marketing fast and convenience foods in Europe and
the United States than the total amount spent by all agencies on
promoting health in the two regions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way in which we structure our society has an impact on the
rate of obesity,'' Seidell said. ''We have to focus on
prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   European health ministers will meet in September at the World
Health Organization to agree upon new food and nutrition strategies
to improve health, and a special European Union conference to
gather expert opinion on nutrition was held in Greece last week.
</P>
<P>
   The EU also is poised to establish the European Food and Public
Health Authority, which will, in part, tackle the prevention of
obesity.

<HEADLINE> Lakewood rabbi admits tax charge, forfeits Newark housing project  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- An influential Ocean County rabbi on
Wednesday pleaded guilty to a felony tax charge and, as part of a
related civil settlement, forfeited a notorious Newark housing
project.
</P>
<P>
   The company owned by Rabbi Meir N. Hertz that controlled the
Brick Towers Apartments agreed to pay $1 million to the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development and cease operations as
part of the civil settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The company, BTA Properties Inc., also pleaded guilty Wednesday,
admitting it lied to HUD, which gave it millions of dollars in
low-income housing funds, by certifying twice in 1995 that the 298
apartments were ''decent, safe and sanitary.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the 1,000 tenants lived in ''deplorable conditions,''
complaining for years of leaky roofs, balky elevators and sewage
backups, said Paul Aprigliano, director of HUD's enforcement center
for the area.
</P>
<P>
   HUD assumed control of the housing project several months ago,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz resigned last month as executive director of the Lakewood
Housing Authority, a move that was revealed Wednesday to be part of
the settlement. He also accepted a five-year ban on participating
in federal housing programs.
</P>
<P>
   He is still executive director of the Lakewood Township Rental
Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
   Lakewood Deputy Mayor Marta D. Harrison, a member of the
Township Committee, said she did not know if the township has the
power to remove Hertz, who has an indefinite employment contract.
She said it would be discussed with the four other members of the
governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Other Lakewood officials did not immediately return messages
seeking comment on Hertz.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz, 51, refused to speak to reporters following his guilty
plea. He faces up to three years in prison when sentenced Sept. 25,
but could get probation. He also could be fined up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   He remains free on $10,000 bond. With no objection from
prosecutors, U.S. District Judge Mary L. Cooper said Hertz would be
permitted to travel to Israel in July with his family for a son's
bar mitzvah ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz does not preside over a congregation but is a major figure
in Lakewood's large Orthodox Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Edward J. Dauber, said outside court that Hertz
admitted no wrongdoing in connection with his positions at the
housing authority and the rental assistance program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's going to continue with his occupational and
philanthropic activities,'' Dauber said.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty to the tax charge, filing a false 1992
return, Hertz admitted he did not include $30,000 he received from
Brick Towers for providing management and security services through
another of his firms, Hertz Management. The money was reported on
his children's returns, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his plea bargain, Hertz agreed to refile his 1992
return, as well as his 1993 return, in which he failed to report
$89,000 of income from Hertz Management by having it put on his
children's returns, court papers showed.
</P>
<P>
   He must pay back taxes, estimated by Assistant U.S. Attorney
Perry A. Carbone at about $20,000, and penalties, before
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz's Brick Towers Associates owned the apartment project
since 1987, court papers said. HUD has provided BTA with about $2
million a year to be used for upkeep, but not all needed work was
done, Aprigliano said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The building needs at least $6 million to restore it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   HUD's enforcement center has recommended that the Brick Towers
tenants be moved, Aprigliano said.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been made on relocation, said Sandi Abadinsky, a
HUD spokeswoman in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Whitman to chair new commission on health of America's oceans  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, who gets
mixed grades from a coastal protection group for her stewardship of
the state's coastline, took the helm Wednesday of a new commission
that will assess the health of America's oceans.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Oceans Commission, formed by the Pew Charitable Trusts,
will spend 18 months studying issues like pollution, overfishing,
coastal development and the health of marine life.
</P>
<P>
   The commission expects that lawmakers will be interested in its
recommendations despite the fact that it was formed by a nonprofit
group.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do a credible job, then I think whoever is president and
whoever is in the Congress will want to pay attention to the report
of this commission,'' said panel vice chairman Leon Panetta, former
White House chief of staff to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking via telephone from Trenton, Whitman, the panel's
chairman, told reporters in Washington that the commission will
''gather the best scientific advice available'' before deciding
what to recommend, and to whom.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue that is going to require the cooperation of
government and the private sector, as well as the public in their
everyday life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With Whitman as governor, New Jersey has won praise from
environmental groups for restricting ocean dumping of silt dredged
from harbors and waterways. Cindy Zipf, executive director of New
Jersey-based Clean Ocean Action, has said that New Jersey leads the
nation in developing environmentally responsible alternatives to
dumping.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 agreement closed the so-called ''mud dump'' located 6
miles off Sandy Hook. Only clean material, as defined by the
government, can now be dumped at the site, as a means to bury
contaminated material already there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clean Ocean Action has criticized Whitman of late for not
joining the group in fighting the federal government over its
definition of ''clean.'' The group is particularly angry at the
Whitman administration for agreeing to a project that will dump up
to 310,000 tons of silt dredged from the Raritan River.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor said federal environmental
officials found the Raritan River material to be ''category one,''
or clean, thus leaving the administration little choice but to
concur that it meets the standards of the 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Kristen Milligan, staff scientist for Clean Ocean Action,
said: ''It's ironic that (Whitman) will be leading this national
commission when she's not engaged in current New Jersey
ocean-protection issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Whitman and Panetta, the panel's 15 other members
represent conservation groups, industry, fishermen and the science
community.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is designed in part as a successor to the Stratton
Commission, which issued a report in 1969 that led to the creation
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and passage
of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are convinced that the ever-deepening ocean crisis requires
an independent and comprehensive reexamination of basic issues in
marine policy,'' said Rebecca Rimel, president of the Pew
Charitable Trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta said there is a growing consensus among scientists on
five ''principle threats'' to marine life -- pollution, coastal
development, fishing, climate change, and the introduction of
nonnative species when ships discharge ballast in bays and harbors.
</P>
<P>
   There is no consensus on solutions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 106; Dow Up 113  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Buyers returned to the stock market Wednesday,
helping the Nasdaq composite index snap a five-day losing streak as
investors sought bargains among blue-chip technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   After a rocky first half to the session, buyers stepped in on
the sense that many well-established stocks have fallen far enough,
analysts said. Volume was robust, ending a two-week long drought.
</P>
<P>
   But the interest rate worries that drove investors to the
sidelines are still in place, leaving the recovery vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite rose 106.06 to close at 3,270.61. Earlier
in the day, the Nasdaq had been down as much as 121 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average also bounced back from early
declines and finished up 113.08 at 10,535.35.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher, too. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 rose 25.19 to 1,399.05, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 2.73 to 461.74.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors bought stocks because they believed a
five-day decline that knocked 15 percent off the Nasdaq's value
left many stocks at bargain prices. Steep, steady selling in the
past few sessions has wiped away nearly all of the spectacular
gains the Nasdaq achieved between early November and early March.
</P>
<P>
   From an emotional standpoint, many investors were simply tired
of selling, said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime
Charter Ltd. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors' fear has led to miserable market action,'' he said.
''Today, that fear finally reached a pessimistic crescendo that
allowed the Nasdaq to put in a bottom and move higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq volume reached 2.05 billion shares by the close of the
regular trading session -- its busiest day in more than a month.
Among the first stocks to benefit: the largest, best-capitalized
technology companies, which some see as a safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems rose 4 37/64 to 55[ and Applied Materials rose 6
9/16 to 78 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks have borne the brunt of investors' worries
over rising rates, which are expected to cut into corporate
profits. Many investors have determined that technology stocks,
still among the most expensive issues on the market, are too highly
priced given the weakening outlook for profits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors proved willing to reward technology companies
that are performing well. Intuit rose 8 to 35 1/16 after releasing
an upbeat profit report.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Intel gained 7{ to 117] after releasing its Pentium III
microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks drew the most interest Wednesday after UAL, the
parent company of United Airlines, said it is buying US Airways for
$4.3 billion in cash. In addition to the cash payment, UAL will
assume $7.3 billion in debt and aircraft operating leases. That
heavy debt load pared UAL shares 7 3/16 to 53 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   But US Airways shares soared 22 11/16 to 49. Meanwhile, news of
the merger enlivened the rest of the airline sector, lifting shares
of regional airlines that are also seen as takeover targets.
America West rose 2 13/16 to 18 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Larger airlines that are perceived as potential buyers slipped.
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, fell 2 9/16 to 30 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks continued a surprising winning streak. Those
stocks are traditionally viewed as most vulnerable to rising
interest rates, which can shrink lending volume and cut into the
value of fixed holdings.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, shares of many financial companies have
thrived. Analysts said some stocks were sold off too steeply in
recent months. Robert Robbins, chief investment strategist at The
Robinson-Humphrey Co. Inc. of Atlanta, said the sector's good
health indicates that the overall market remains fairly strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''For financial stocks to be advancing in the context of a bull
market is phenomenal,'' he said. ''That tells me that there's no
fundamental economic problem hurting stocks right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America rose 3 9/16 to 56[, and Mellon Financial rose 2
3/16 to 38 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers across the board,
underscoring the fragility of the rally. Decliners led by a 10-to-9
margin on the New York Stock Exchange and by a 3-to-2 margin on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.37 billion shares, compared with 1.03
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.7 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 1.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 2.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Casino pres put on leave for gambling addiction treatment  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A troubled executive who was promoted
to president of Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino despite a
gambling problem has been given a leave of absence to be treated
for it, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gary DiBartolomeo, 45, of Margate, who admitted his problem to
regulators and agreed to attend weekly meetings of Gamblers
Anonymous as a condition of his license renewals in 1995 and 1997,
is being investigated by the state Division of Gaming Enforcement
for violating the ban, Deputy Attorney General James Fogarty said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Casino Control Commission voted 4-1 Wednesday to let
Park Place Entertainment Corp., which owns Caesars, put
DiBartolomeo on a six-month leave to seek treatment for what he
called a ''medical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While I view this as an intensely private matter between
myself and my family, I am receiving treatment to assist me in
overcoming a compulsive condition related to gaming,'' he said in a
statement issued by Park Place Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, executive-level casino employees are forbidden
from gambling in casinos. They may do so in other states, though.
</P>
<P>
   According to Casino Control Commission documents obtained
Wednesday, state investigators tried to block DiBartolomeo's
license renewal in 1995, when he was vice president of customer
development for Trump Taj Mahal, citing his gambling, his record as
a scofflaw and his failure to cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   According to the DGE:
</P>
<P>
   --In 1993, DiBartolomeo took out more than $25,000 in
high-interest loans to cover gambling losses at Bally's in Las
Vegas; the Crystal Palace in The Bahamas; and Foxwoods Resort
Casino in Ledyard, Conn. DiBartolomeo could have gotten better
interest rates but the lenders that were offering them required his
spouse to co-sign the loans and he didn't want her to find out
about the losses.
</P>
<P>
   --He told Division of Gaming Enforcement investigators in 1995
that he hadn't gambled since December 1993, but the probe showed
that he had ''incurred significant financial debt as the result of
gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   --DiBartolomeo, a native of Philadelphia, moved to New Jersey in
1972 but never obtained a driver's license until it threatened to
interfere with his casino license renewal in 1994. In 1985, he
pleaded guilty to driving with a revoked driver's permit and was
fined $500, but didn't pay until the fine was referred for
collection. He also ran up thousands of dollars' worth of fines
from parking tickets he ignored. Taken together, those actions
demonstrated ''a cavalier attitude'' toward motor vehicle laws that
called into question his character and his ability to function in
New Jersey's tightly regulated casino industry, Deputy Attorney
General Dorothy Turi said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear Wednesday whether Park Place officials knew
about his gambling when they promoted DiBartolomeo from his job as
vice president of national marketing. Park Place spokeswoman Sharon
Pearce said she wasn't aware of the previous commission actions on
DiBartolomeo.
</P>
<P>
   She declined comment on whether the leave of absence was timed
to coincide with an upcoming vote on Caesars' license. On June 7,
the commission will hold a hearing on whether to renew the casino's
license.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty told casino commissioners he was not sure Caesars could
be relicensed if DiBartolomeo were still president; to renew the
license, regulators would have to find that he possessed the ''good
character, honesty and integrity'' required by state casino law.
</P>
<P>
   Commission member Michael Fedorko, a former acting
superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, was the only
commissioner to vote against the leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I see it, Mr. DiBartolomeo has a problem,'' Fedorko said.
</P>
<P>
   He grilled Fogarty on the reason for it, asking why the Division
of Gaming was not seeking to suspend DiBartolomeo's license instead
of allowing him to step aside; Fogarty said it was because the
investigation into whether DiBartolomeo had violated the gambling
ban had just started and no information had turned up ''of a
quality that would we would find reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty said the investigation into DiBartolomeo would go beyond
New Jersey but he declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Barr, executive vice president of Park Place
Entertainment, said he hoped DiBartolomeo would eventually return
to his job. First, the casino commission would have to agree to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This matter highlights for us in the gaming industry the
sensitivity we should have for dealing with these issues,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Dentists reach agreement with state on Medicaid fees  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A federal magistrate signed an agreement
Wednesday ending a dispute between the state and the Dental Society
and resulting in higher fees for dentists treating Medicaid
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will provide $573 million more in Medicaid dental fees
over the next four years and should reverse what the executive
director of the Dental Society, Roy Lasky, called the ''collapse''
of the state's dental Medicaid system.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some areas of the state, currently no dentists will accept
Medicaid reimbursement,'' said Dr. Bertram Bildner, president of
the Dental Society. ''Patients are relegated to seek emergency care
from hospitals or to travel to neighboring counties or out-of-state
for their dental treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13,000-member Dental Society filed suit in February 1999
claiming that dental Medicaid rates have not appreciably increased
in New York for three decades. That, in turn, had left more than 1
million low-income New York children without access to important
dental health care, the suit claimed.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to the two sides argue the case in court,
District Judge Norman Mordue in Syracuse had urged the parties to
try to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The new fee schedule, which goes into effect June 1, calls for
the current dentists' reimbursement for a basic examination or an
adult to go from $10 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   A typical four-picture set of X-rays will increase from $5 to
$20 and a common procedure where a fluoride sealant is applied to a
tooth will go up from $18 to $25.50.
</P>
<P>
   Reimbursement for a crown will increase from $300 to $400, the
same as for dentures.
</P>
<P>
   The old fee schedule only covered 30 percent or less of
dentists' costs for treating Medicaid patients, said Dental Society
spokeswoman Judi Schub.
</P>
<P>
   Lasky said the fee scheduled had been allowed to deteriorate
under Govs. Hugh Carey, Mario Cuomo and George Pataki. But he
credited Pataki with being willing to improve reimbursement rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Dental Society sued when Carey was governor for higher fees,
though the settlement of $10 million at that time was
''microscopic'' compared with the ''earth-shattering'' settlement
finalized on Wednesday, Lasky said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, $132 million more will be available in
Medicaid funds to dentists for the period from June 1 to March 31,
2001. It also calls for Pataki to appoint a committee with members
from the Dental Society and the Health Department to study the new
fee structure, how it is affecting the availability of services to
Medicaid patients and to recommend further changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be an innovative and creative approach,'' Schub said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was signed Wednesday by U.S. Magistrate David
Homer in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Department could provide no information about
the $573 million agreement Wednesday nor comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new 2000-01 state budget, the state also raised
fees for physicians and other medical professionals treating
Medicaid patients. Advocates for the poor said the old fee schedule
was deterring many doctors from opening their doors to Medicaid
patients.

<HEADLINE> Black Leaders Gather For AIDS Plans  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE BRYAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSKEGEE, Ala. (AP) -- Many blacks know little about AIDS and HIV
because of a deep mistrust of white health care workers that stems
partly from the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study, black church
leaders said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 clergy members from around the country met this week
to address AIDS in the same town where the study, shut down in
1972, took place. It involved about 400 black men with syphilis who
were denied treatment as part of a 40-year study of the disease by
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has resulted in a community that is very paranoid about
health care and about white doctors,'' said Pernessa Seele, an AIDS
activist who organized the conference at Tuskegee University. ''We
have to get people into treatment, into care.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is the number one cause of death for black men and women
ages 25 to 44, and one in 50 black men and one in 160 black women
are HIV positive, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders can help members overcome their mistrust of white
doctors by teaching them to ask questions, said the Rev. Debra
Hickman, an associate minister at City Temple of Baltimore Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a deep-seated mistrust of doctors among members
of the black community, especially doctors who don't look like
them,'' Hickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman started a program in Baltimore in which black church
members and public health workers visit poor urban areas on weekday
evenings to offer free health care testing.
</P>
<P>
   The conference comes about a week after the release of a study
conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham that found
poor black males' mistrust of health care givers, especially white
male doctors, contributes to a high rate of AIDS in black
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Many poor blacks' only experiences with health care as children
came when they were examined in youth detention centers or clinics
that treat sexually transmitted diseases, the study found. As a
result, many of the study participants associated health care with
being in trouble.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Probe Stories Conflict  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An FBI official and a prosecutor gave Congress
conflicting testimony Wednesday in the ongoing argument between the
bureau and the Justice Department over the campaign fund-raising
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The latest dispute, before a Senate subcommittee, concerned
whether prosecutor Lee Radek told two FBI officials in 1996 that he
felt pressured because Attorney General Janet Reno's job hinged on
the department's handling of the probe of fund raising for
President Clinton's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant FBI director Neil Gallagher said the prosecutor told
him he was under ''pressure'' which was ''attributed to the fact
the attorney general's job may hang in the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Radek testified he never said that: ''It would be a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the December 1996 meeting at FBI headquarters,
director Louis Freeh was pushing for the bureau to be brought into
the fund-raising probe, which Justice was conducting without it.
Freeh was also upset that Reno hadn't sought his views before
rejecting the appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Freeh repeatedly recommended that an independent
counsel be sought to investigate top Clinton administration
officials in the campaign fund-raising controversy. Reno has
maintained that ''the facts and the law'' dictated her decision
that an independent counsel wasn't warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, suggested that prosecutors feared
an aggressive fund-raising probe would lead to Reno losing her job
as Clinton began his second term.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like the Public Integrity Section at the Justice
Department just dropped the ball,'' Grassley said, referring to the
office headed by Radek.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., pointed to ''the large number
of independent counsels'' sought by Reno as ''substantive proof of
the attorney general's integrity'' in investigating the Clinton
administration when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my gut, I believe in Attorney General Janet Reno,'' Schumer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Radek denied that his work was affected by questions about
Reno's tenure. He clashed with Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who
suggested there was more than enough information to require an
independent counsel investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did my best to administer the law as best I could,'' Radek
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor acknowledged that he disliked the now-defunct
independent counsel law because of ''the damage I thought it did to
our system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the atmosphere of the campaign-finance probe as ''a
pressure cooker. We were being scrutinized by Congress, the news
media and the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the only pressure was ''to do a good job, do it
vigorously and do it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher's account of the meeting corroborated another FBI
official's recollection, as recorded in a 1996 memo by Freeh,
turned over belatedly to Senate investigators and reported by The
Associated Press last week.
</P>
<P>
   According to the memo by Freeh, who was not at the meeting,
then-FBI deputy director William Esposito quoted Radek as saying
''that there was a lot of 'pressure' on him ... regarding this case
because the attorney general's job might hang in the balance (or
words to that effect).''
</P>
<P>
   Radek said he has ''no recollection'' of the meeting in
question, but was sure he would not have linked Reno's job with the
''pressure'' he felt in the campaign finance probe.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has obtained court appointment of seven independent
counsels, said she never bowed to political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call it like I see it, regardless of the consequences,'' she
said recently. Reno added she did not recall Freeh briefing her on
Radek's purported remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, legal sources say the Justice Department's campaign
task force found no evidence of wrongdoing regarding more than $1.3
million in donations to Democrats by Loral Corp. chairman Bernard
Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   At a May 2 hearing, Specter described a 1998 memo by
then-Justice Department prosecutor Charles LaBella as saying
President Clinton should be investigated in connection with the
donations. Loral obtained a waiver from the Clinton administration
allowing the company to do satellite business in China.
</P>
<P>
   However, by the time of LaBella's memo, he and the task force
had effectively excused Loral and Schwartz from the probe and
LaBella said there had been only a ''whisp of information'' to
justify the Justice Department's inquiry of Schwartz to begin with,
said legal sources familiar with various internal Justice
Department documents in the fund-raising probe. The Los Angeles
Times earlier this week first reported on the additional
information clearing Schwartz.

<HEADLINE> Study Warns Vs. E. Coli Treatment  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Children suspected of being infected with a
particularly nasty form of the E. coli food poisoning bug should
not be treated with antibiotics because they may trigger dangerous
complications, a study warns.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of the usually harmless E. coli bacteria called
O157:H7 causes an estimated 73,000 cases of food poisoning in the
United States annually. The infection often spreads through eating
undercooked contaminated meat and typically causes bloody diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   A rare complication in children, usually under age 5, is
hemolytic uremic syndrome, which results in destruction of red
blood cells and kidney failure. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention estimates that 2 percent to 7 percent of E. coli O157:H7
infections lead to the complication, and between 3 percent and 5
percent of those victims die.
</P>
<P>
   A study by doctors from Children's Hospital and Regional Medical
Center in Seattle found the link with antibiotic use, which had
already been suspected. Their study is scheduled to be published
June 29 in the New England Journal of Medicine, which released it
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle doctors reviewed the cases of 71 children under age
10 who had diarrhea caused by the bacterial infection between 1997
and 1999. They found that hemolytic uremic syndrome developed in
five of the nine children given antibiotics, compared with five of
the 62 who did not receive the medicines.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli O157:H7 infections usually clear up without treatment,
and use of antibiotics is not recommended for any patients.
</P>
<P>
   While the latest study does not prove that antibiotics are to
blame for the syndrome, the team led by Dr. Craig S. Wong wrote
that the evidence of an association ''is strong and plausible.''
</P>
<P>
   They theorized that antibiotics cause the release of toxins from
injured bacteria into the intestine.

<HEADLINE> Indian Affairs Boss Wants Changes  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a surprise announcement, the head of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs said Wednesday the agency no longer wants
to be the entity that grants federal recognition to Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have reluctantly reached the conclusion that I will not be
successful in reforming this program. The more contentious and
nasty things become, the less we feel we are able to do it,'' Kevin
Gover told the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Federal recognition makes tribes eligible for several federal
assistance programs and classifies them as sovereign nations. More
than 550 tribes are federally recognized and about 200 cases are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Many more tribes have sought recognition since the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled in 1987 that tribes may open casinos on their land.
</P>
<P>
   The BIA requires reams of historical documentation from tribes,
and sometimes takes as long as 12 years to make a decision on a
request for recognition. Critics pressing for change say that's too
long.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is considering legislation by Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, R.-Colo., that would create a three-person commission
appointed by the president to decide which tribes are recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say such a move would streamline the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased and surprised, very frankly,'' Campbell said of
Gover's announcement. ''With the administration's support, we might
be able to get something passed this session.''
</P>
<P>
   Gover said he would support legislation removing recognition
responsibility from the BIA, though not necessarily Campbell's
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The recognition issue is particularly pressing to Chief Richard
Velky whose Kent, Conn.-based Schaghticoke tribal nation filed a
petition in 1994 and has been told it could be six more years
before it's acted on.
</P>
<P>
   The delay has impeded the 300-member tribe's land claims,
including one seeking the return of 43 acres the National Park
Service seized for the Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, federal recognition is essential to our ability to
safeguard what remains of our tribal holdings and to secure our
survival into the future,'' Velky told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S.B. 611.

<HEADLINE> In spending blitz, Corzine keeps distance from news media  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- While spending his own wealth on tightly
crafted TV commercials, U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine has been
warily avoiding too much exposure to news reporters and
photographers over whom he has no control.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic primary opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, has
taken every chance to draw as much attention as possible from
newspapers and broadcasters. Corzine has done the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his campaign, Corzine this week invited
news reporters to watch him on the stump when he visited a senior
citizens center Monday in one of Trenton's poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the only Corzine events to be broadly publicized
were a handful of staged news conferences at which prominent
officials gave him their endorsement. Events at which news
reporters could watch him spontaneously meeting and talking with
voters have been unpublicized.
</P>
<P>
   He has also refused to accept invitations to appear in debates
to be broadcast on network television, most recently from the Gabe
Pressman show on WNBC-TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The independent press is their one means of getting
consistent, independent coverage to make up their minds who they
want to vote for,'' said Rem Rieder, editor of the American
Journalism Review based at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no law that says he has got to make it easy, but if
(the campaign) is not providing readily accessible information
about where he is going to be, that is reprehensible because voters
really deserve aggressive, independent coverage of a candidate,
particularly when they are being bombarded by so much paid
advertising,'' said Rieder, who was editor of The Times of Trenton
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine denies his campaign staff has been trying to hide him.
He said news reporters have an open invitation to attend and
observe any campaign stops, and have been accommodated for lengthy
one-on-one interviews. He said reporters need only contact his
staff in advance to find out where the campaign might be on any
given day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just not consistent with the facts. We have never
restricted any of the press. You've been welcome at any of my
speeches. We encourage people to come visit,'' Corzine said.
''People are around me all the time. I had a reporter from New
Republic with me all day (Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   ''I will show you my schedule for weeks and weeks and weeks,''
Corzine said.
</P>
<P>
   But since Monday, Corzine's campaign, which grinds out dozens of
documents to news organization fax machines each day, has not
issued a single advisory about any such campaign activity.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hartmann, retired professor of journalism at Rutgers
University, said there is a big difference between permitting news
reporters to attend events and giving adequate notice about events
that are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never faced anything like this before. Usually people
are vying for free media coverage,'' Hartmann said. ''Usually the
campaign will send out a schedule. This is where the candidate will
be today. ... And you hope that some reporters will come along and
cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Political and media analysts agree it is strange for any
political candidate to seek something less than maximum exposure.
But when coupled with a spending frenzy bound to shatter national
records, some find Corzine's caginess with the news media
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to have a sugarcoated package, not the unvarnished
version that comes when you have reporters along watching what you
are doing,'' said Rieder.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Jim McQueeny, who covered statewide campaigns
as a reporter for The Star-Ledger of Newark in the 1970s, said, ''I
have not seen this in 20 years of New Jersey politics.''
</P>
<P>
   McQueeny said Corzine is revealing a businessman's approach:
Having invested so heavily in his campaign image, he wants to
protect the investment.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine had a brief public-relations problem when it was
revealed last month he had made mob jokes during a meeting with
some Italian-Americans last year. Corzine said he did not recall
the remarks but he apologized for them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   McQueeny said a second mistake like that in the days leading to
the June 6 primary could literally do millions of dollars of
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think that after investing $20 million to put forth the
best portrayal possible, that you want a $30,000-a-year reporter
covering some chance encounter to jeopardize that image,'' he said.
''One unfortunate street encounter can undo everything that $20
million in TV tried to do for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann said he was inclined to disagree. He suspected rather
that the Corzine campaign was just so fixed on commercial TV
spending and the views of strategic consultants, there is little
interest in newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''They maybe don't give a damn. I don't know if it is so much
that they are worried that he will say something wrong, or that
something negative will come out of it,'' Hartmann said. ''It would
say to me that maybe candidates are getting to the point where they
are just not interested in the free media.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Proposes Arsenic Water Limits  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency proposed
Wednesday to reduce the limit for arsenic allowed in drinking water
to one-tenth the current standard in an effort to reduce cancer
risks for 22 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The agency proposed to reduce the arsenic allowed in drinking
water from 50 parts per billion to 5 parts per billion. The
announcement came two weeks after an environmental group, the
Natural Resources Defense Council, filed a federal lawsuit to force
the White House to allow the agency to propose the long-awaited
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to take actions to protect public health by
strengthening existing standards when necessary, as we are doing
today,'' said Carol Browner, EPA administrator.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 6,600 water systems nationwide serving at least
22.5 million people would need to upgrade their systems to meet the
standard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly a very good start,'' said Erik Olson, a senior
lawyer for the environmental group, which advocated an even lower
standard of 3 parts per billion. ''If this rule goes final, which
we sure hope it will, millions of Americans will have water that is
safer to drink and have a lower history of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry officials warned the new standard could increase
household water costs up to $100 a year for customers largely in
the rural Southwest and pockets of New England where arsenic levels
are highest.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as the impact on small systems, it can be brutal,''
said Doug Marsano, spokesman for The American Water Works
Association based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is asking for public comments for 90 days about lowering
the standard. After reviewing the comments, a final rule could be
put in place by early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If a lower standard is set, large water systems serving 10,000
people or more would have three years to make improvements and
smaller systems would have five years. About 95 percent of the
systems failing to meet the proposed standard are small systems.
</P>
<P>
   Water industry representatives, who agree that the current
arsenic standard is too high, are pushing for a standard of 10
parts per billion, which would match the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers working for the water association estimated it would
cost $600 million a year to meet an arsenic standard of 10 parts
per billion in water, after spending $5 billion on new equipment.
The cost would more than double to $1.4 billion a year after $14
billion in capital costs, to meet a standard of 5 parts per
billion, the association said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reduce arsenic drinking water followed a National
Academy of Sciences report in 1999 that found arsenic in drinking
water causes bladder, lung and skin cancer, and might cause kidney
and liver cancer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Visit Barrier Island  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will travel Friday to the
barrier island famous for an annual roundup and sale of wild
horses, the White House said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to highlight environmental threats at
Assateague Island, home to bands of wild ponies that roam the
scrubby beaches of a national wildlife and marine preserve.
</P>
<P>
   In a tradition dating back a century, wild ponies annually swim
the channel between Assateague and Chincoteague islands off the
Maryland-Virginia coast. Some are then auctioned in the town of
Chincoteague, Va., as a local fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Many tourists are drawn to the event due to its mention in the
1947 novel ''Misty of Chincoteague,'' by Marguerite Henry. The
children's book tells the story of a brother and sister who want to
own a wild pony and her filly.

<HEADLINE> Dems Split Over China Trade Vote  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The agenda will include prescription drug
legislation when President Clinton welcomes Democratic lawmakers to
the White House on Thursday. The subtext will be party unity, in
short supply in the brutal struggle over China trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton pushing for the China measure in the waning months
of his administration and organized labor determined to defeat it,
the Democratic rank and file split, predictably and publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that happened -- the North American Free Trade
Agreement in 1993 -- was prelude to the elections that ended 40
years of Democratic control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to sting for awhile,'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., who chairs the party's campaign committee. ''My hope is
that with the passage of time they (organized labor) will come to
see the bigger picture,'' he said, ''and decide it's not worth them
making this a cause for separation, let alone divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge win, because we think it puts their party at
peril,'' both in the battle for control of the House this fall and
the campaign for the White House, said Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a certain amount of glee when we are able to put a
policy issue on the floor'' that divides Democrats, he said.
Republicans, he noted, are often on the other end of that sort of
thing -- listening to Democratic leader Dick Gephardt demand passage
of legislation dealing with HMOs, the minimum wage or prescription
drugs that tend to cause splits within the GOP ranks.
</P>
<P>
   With the House narrowly divided along party lines -- Democrats
need to switch six seats in the fall to gain a majority -- Clinton,
Gephardt and Bonior should have no trouble putting China behind and
refocusing their attention on the poll-tested issues that divide
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But that leaves open the question of organized labor, whose
support is vital if Al Gore is to win the White House and Gephardt
succeed in his drive to become speaker next fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the head of the United AutoWorkers Union, Stephen
Yokich, issued a statement suggesting that Green party candidate
Ralph Nader might be preferable to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As for the House, vows Teamster spokesman Bret Caldwell, ''This
electoral cycle there will be no free passes. We will reassess our
support of any candidate who votes'' in favor of the China trade
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would grant China permanent normal trade
relations. Supporters said the bill would open vast markets to U.S.
companies and help promote democratic change by exporting American
values. Opponents -- including the religious right and a coalition
of environmental, human rights and veterans organizations in
addition to labor -- asserted it would reward a brutal regime and
result in a loss of domestic jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure cleared on a bipartisan vote of 237-197. Among
Democrats, there were 73 votes in favor and 138 opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Teamsters, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney threw
himself into the effort to defeat the China measure, and the effort
has struck sparks among some Democrats who are loyal supporters of
labor's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   There was a contentious meeting with the Congressional Black
Caucus last week, and Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., an elder in the
group, publicly questioned the wisdom of organized labor's effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very difficult for me to understand why, at this time
and this place, the unions have decided to make this a litmus
test,'' he said, adding that the union's pressure tactics were
''very threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope not. I hope we're not being hard on anybody,''
countered Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't so sure, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''This business of threats and intimidation over one vote, no
matter whence it comes, is not very constructive,'' said Rep. John
Tanner, D-Tenn., a supporter of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   There's an ''undercurrent of a backlash developing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, who has labored more than five years to unite an
unwieldy Democratic caucus, sought to remain publicly aloof from
the China struggle. Opposed to the bill, he decided that minimizing
internal divisions was more important than joining Bonior in the
campaign to derail the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't drop everything else that I do here to work on one
issue,'' he told reporters recently. ''I have a wide-ranging job
that encompasses a lot of issues and a lot of activities.''
</P>
<P>
   He stepped in on one occasion last week, though, when it
appeared that Clinton would make a nationally televised address to
seek support for the measure. Several Democratic officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gephardt called the White
House and personally told Clinton he would deliver the formal
response to any presidential speech.
</P>
<P>
   That raised the politically unappealing prospect of very public
divisions on the issue, and the speech was scrubbed.

<HEADLINE> Family members still awaiting identifications of loved ones  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Mourning families of the 19 victims of
a weekend plane crash were still awaiting formal confirmation from
coroners that the bodies of their loved ones had been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The final word from investigators would allow friends and
relatives to begin making funeral arrangements and help bring some
closure to the tragedy, some said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to get to a point where we can just reflect,''
said Elizabeth Mates, a friend of 63-year-old Joan Kunkle, who was
killed on the flight. ''All I can think of is her laying up there
waiting for the autopsy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an airport conference room Tuesday, families were told by
National Transportation Safety Board investigators that definitive
answers as to what may have caused the plane to have a double
engine failure could take months.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors from several community and religious groups prepared
them Wednesday for an even more disheartening possibility: They may
never know.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to suggest that families not concentrate just on
getting answers about why the plane may have crashed,'' said Wilma
Edwards, a counselor with the American Red Cross who spoke with
family members. ''Often times, even after the answers come, they
just raise even more questions. We encourage them to mourn and
celebrate their loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Counselors said that most families were still dealing with the
shock and second-guessing the everyday decisions that led their
respective loved ones to head to Atlantic City, N.J., for a weekend
gambling trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the process is accepting that these types of things
never make any sense,'' said the Rev. Paul Dickinson, who counseled
family members Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now a lot of people are still thinking 'She would still
be alive if only I had told her not to take the trip,''' Dickinson
said. ''Life just doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, coroners spent the day at an airport hangar
attempting to identify victims using dental records, medical
records and family photos.
</P>
<P>
   There was some question as to whether the final body had been
removed from the crash scene, and local coroners were unavailable
for comment Wednesday. National Transportation Safety Board
officials also did not immediately return calls by The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials on Wednesday directed the continued removal of
the wreckage from the mountainside. Tuesday, construction workers
retrieved the plane's engines and propellers and prepared to send
them to manufacturer assembly plants for study.
</P>
<P>
   Crash investigators hope a computer-enhanced examination of two
recordings of the final conversation between air traffic
controllers and pilots will yield hidden clues as to why a charter
plane crashed in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigator Frank Hilldrup said he also did not know how
long it would take for the last of the wreckage to be removed,
ending the on-site investigation. He said a final NTSB report could
take up to a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe they did have a general outline of what
happened just before the Executive Airlines twin-engine turboprop
crashed in the rain nine miles south of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton
International Airport late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots declared an emergency soon after missing their first
approach of an airport runway, according to investigators. Just
before the second approach, the pilots said they had lost both
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers began providing information about the
terrain and elevation after radar indicated the plane was flying at
about 2,000 feet above sea level, considerably lower than the
minimum safe altitude, Hilldrup said. The crash site was 1,765 feet
above sea level.

<HEADLINE> Senate Confirms 16 Clinton Judges  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate confirmed 16 of President Clinton's
judicial nominees to lifetime terms on the federal bench after
voting Wednesday to place on the Federal Election Commission a
conservative professor who believes there should be no limits on
political donations.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley A. Smith was confirmed 64-35. The judges and 47 other
Clinton nominations were approved either on voice vote or by wide
margins.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmation of Smith, who was lauded by his main Senate
backer as ''the most qualified nominee'' in FEC history, was
sharply criticized by Common Cause, the leading lobbying group for
overhauling current campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Senate has made a weak and ineffective agency even
worse,'' said Scott Harshbarger, the group's president.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have any idea what I'll do as a commissioner,''
countered Smith. ''They have one view of what reform is and they
don't want another voice to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Clinton's judicial picks -- Timothy B. Dyk for the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and Gerard E. Lynch for
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York --
were criticized on the Senate floor as too inclined to be activist.
</P>
<P>
   But both were confirmed, Dyk on a 74-25 vote and Lynch on a
63-36 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope today's votes represent a new beginning on the road
toward full and fair consideration of all nominations currently
pending before the Senate,'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockart. He said 36 more judicial nominations and 204 other
nominations to senior government posts had to receive a hearing
and/or a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Senate Republicans refused to schedule votes on
any of the nominees because Democrats were blocking a vote on
Smith. His nomination became a rallying point for lawmakers
frustrated by the Senate's failure to act on campaign finance
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a vote about whether we are serious about reform and
getting some of the money out of politics,'' said Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Smith) has long advocated the repeal of campaign finance
regulation. How can he now take an oath to uphold the laws?'' asked
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who made his long-standing effort to
eliminate unregulated ''soft money'' donations a cornerstone of his
unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who teaches law at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio,
believes it is unconstitutional to limit campaign contributions,
and has written many scholarly articles critical of current
campaign law.
</P>
<P>
   He was recruited for the FEC post by the Senate's most
aggressive foe of campaign finance reforms, Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell called Smith ''the most qualified nominee in the
25-year history of the Federal Election Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   The FEC enforces federal campaign finance law, making sure
candidates comply with disclosure requirements and contribution
limits. The six-member commission is evenly split among Republicans
and Democrats, all of whom serve six-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, the Senate's Democratic leadership recommends the
three Democrats and the GOP leadership recommends the three
Republicans. In almost every instance, whoever has occupied the
White House has deferred to those wishes.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's writings on election law gave critics considerable
fodder with which to oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause and other groups organized a campaign against Smith
last summer, and Clinton held off on the nomination for a year.
Frustrated by the failure to get quick action on what normally is a
routine nomination, McConnell and Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., delayed confirmation of Richard Holbrooke as U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   More negotiation was required to get Smith's nomination up for a
vote. Democrats were forced to accept it as the condition for
whittling down the backlog of unconfirmed judges and securing votes
on other nominations, including director of the Mint, ambassador to
Poland, U.S. attorneys for Kentucky and Missouri, and members of
various boards.

<HEADLINE> Study: Chest compressions alone can save lives after cardiac arrest </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when many people are afraid to give mouth-to-mouth to
a stranger in cardiac arrest, a surprising new study found that
performing just chest compressions until the ambulance arrives may
save more lives than doing both.
</P>
<P>
   The finding could soon lead to major changes in the CPR
instructions dispatchers give to ordinary people who call 911.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will probably catch on quickly,'' said Dr. Russell
Harris, past president of the New Jersey chapter of the American
College of Emergency Physicians and chief of emergency medicine at
Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an excellent recommendation that may actually increase
the number of people who receive bystander CPR'' by ending worries
of catching hepatitis, AIDS or other diseases from mouth-to-mouth
contact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a study in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine, University of Washington researchers found that 40
percent of Seattle-area cardiac arrest patients who were given only
chest compressions by bystanders survived to reach a hospital,
compared with 34 percent of those who also received mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 15 percent of the 241 patients receiving chest
compressions alone eventually made it home from the hospital,
compared with only about 10 percent of the 279 who received both
components of CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   That means that patients getting both seemed only three-quarters
as likely to make it out of the hospital alive.
</P>
<P>
   Al Hallstrom, a professor of biostatistics who led the research,
said there were not enough patients in the study to say for certain
whether those getting only compressions really do fare better, but
''we are reasonably sure it's better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom said one explanation is that it takes longer for a
dispatcher to explain to someone with no medical training how to
perform both components of CPR -- 2.4 minutes vs. 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and other experts also said it is too complicated for
many untrained people during an emergency to correctly alternate
chest compressions with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, which
involves extending the person's neck, squeezing the nostrils shut
and blowing forcefully into the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on cases of cardiac arrest caused by
ventricular fibrillation, a quickly fatal condition in which the
heart's main pumping chambers quiver instead of delivering blood to
the rest of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom said giving chest compressions alone works because
when the heart goes into ventricular fibrillation, most of the
blood still contains oxygen. So compressions that keep the blood
circulating can supply the brain, heart and other organs with
enough oxygen for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Martin, executive director of the National Academy of
Emergency Medical Dispatch, which writes CPR instructions for
thousands of dispatchers nationwide, said that in August, the group
will debate whether untrained bystanders should be told to give
just chest compressions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's likely going to be accepted at some time in the near
future,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was done from 1992 to 1998 in the dispatch center in
Washington's King County.

   When someone witnessing an apparent cardiac arrest called 911, a
dispatcher would send help and ask if the caller knew CPR. If not,
the dispatcher would randomly instruct the caller either to give
just chest compressions, or to give mouth-to-mouth too.

   The researchers excluded cases where respiratory arrest, drug
overdose, stroke or something else was the primary problem.

   Jerry Potts of the American Heart Association said the
compression-only strategy ''may be a preferred way for instructing
someone who has never had CPR training.''

   The association is drawing up new guidelines for release in
August. In the meantime, ''overall, we would still recommend that a
combination of chest compression and ventilation be used whenever
it's by a person who has had training in CPR,'' Potts said.

   Meanwhile, Harris said medical personnel may end up scrapping
the term CPR because the ''pulmonary'' part -- the lungs -- would no
longer be involved.
