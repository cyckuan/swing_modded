<HEADLINE> China's Moratorium on Nuclear Testing Encourages Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government expressed
the hope today that China's moratorium on nuclear testing "will
encourage all others to join in concluding the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT)."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Chinese government statement on nuclear test,
a British Foreign Office spokesman said that "this means that all
of the declared nuclear weapon states have now indicated that they
do not plan to carry out more tests" so that the treaty can be
opened for signature in New York in September.
</P>
<P>
"This is good news as the Conference on Disarmament resumes to
conclude negotiations on a CTBT," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
On China's latest nuclear test, the spokesman said, "We do not
intend to comment on the test itself, that is a matter for the
Chinese government."
</P>
<P>
"However, we note the Chinese have said that, following
Monday's test, they will adopt a moratorium forthwith," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "We share the international community's
strong wish that Monday's test should be the last ever."

presented on July 12 to members of the International Olympic
Committee's Executive Board in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Gap Between U.S., European Forces Enormous: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Gap between American armed
forces and those across the Atlantic remains enormous and is
widening in key areas, according to defense experts and NATO
officials.
</P>
<P>
Despite Western Europe's avowed intent to build a robust,
autonomous military capable of acting without massive U.S.
support, its armies seems to have failed to prepare for the
missions the alliance faces following the end of the Cold War, the
Washington Post quoted the officials as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The disparity between U.S. and West European militaries can be
seen in the size of the forces, the money devoted to defense
research and procurement, the key capabilities of movement and
intelligence as well as in technological acumen.
</P>
<P>
Particularly in the technological acumen, the United States
already possesses a 21st-century military while Europe for the
most part remains in the here and now, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
German Gen. Klaus Naumann, who chairs NATO's military
committee, urged the European members of the Western military
alliance to invest more on military technology.
</P>
<P>
"The train of future technological developments is about to
leave the station. If the Europeans would like to be in the
first-class compartment then we have to invest now and not place
our hopes on 2004, 2005. It's a question of being a partner on an
equal footing," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Accord with TV Industry on Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced today that the television industry has agreed to ensure
three hours of educational shows a week for children and rate the
programs to warn viewers about violence and sex.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with 50 TV executives, children's advocates, program
producers and actors in the White House, the president declared
that the deal "says to America's parents: You are not alone."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that a typical child watches 25,000 hours of
television before his or her 18th birthday. Preschoolers watch 28
hours of television a week. "This proposal fulfills the promise of
the Children's Television Act that television should serve the
educational and informational needs of our young people."
</P>
<P>
The Children's Television Act of 1990 ordered stations to
increase educational and informational programming for children.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour minimum would not include public service
announcements or specials, unless special permission is given by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the FCC to adopt the accord "to make the
three-hour rule the law of the land. Television can build up young
lives, rather than tear them down."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also pushed for a V-chip in new televisions, a
technology that allows parents to ban violent or sexual shows from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
The television industry executives agreed to implement a
voluntary television ratings system by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Minister Stresses Incentives For Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government intends to
introduce incentives to attract investors who can process and
market local precious minerals into finished and value-added
products.
</P>
<P>
Mines Minister Swithun Mombeshora told a Zimbabwe investment
centre conference on Monday that the government is looking at
value-adding minerals as a way of increasing foreign currency
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Despite increasing explorations and mining of such precious
stones as gold and diamonds, Zimbabwe lost out in accrued revenue
because the minerals were not processed and marketed outside the
country, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"We need to look at the correct incentives which can attract
the right type of investor who would be able to go into this
final processing and marketing of mineral products," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe mining sector, whith a 45 percent foreign exchange
contribution, has total annual revenue of 640 million US Dollars.

<HEADLINE> UK Small Firms Lag Behind Whole Manufacturing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized
manufacturing companies in Britain are lagging behind the rest of
the sector as a whole, according to the latest business survey
from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was conducted in conjunction with the
accountants group Pannel Kerr Forster, reported that small firms'
output, new orders and business confidence are all below the
levels in larger companies.
</P>
<P>
Measured overall, the survey showed that the balance of small
and medium-sized firms reporting higher output in July is almost
the same as those reporting lower output.
</P>
<P>
This is markedly worse than the balance for largest firms, and
the most downbeat figure since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those firms consider their domestic and export
orders to be well below normal and the proportion of firms
reporting spare capacity has risen. Most of them say that they
have no plans to create jobs in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the optimism of smaller companies has
dropped markedly in recent months, and it was the fourth
consecutive survey for which optimism has fallen.
</P>
<P>
Tony Bonner, chairman of the CBI's small and medium-sized
businesses council, said, "Our survey paints a gloomy picture with
small and medium enterprises lagging behind the manufacturing
sector as a whole in terms of output and new orders."

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that its
military forces killed at least 20 "senior members" of the Kurdish
Democratic Party (KDP) in a two-day military operation in the
western border regions.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) declared in a
statement that its military operation has ended successfully with
the aim to suppress "anti-revolutionaries and bandits."
</P>
<P>
The statement did not mention whether the Iranian troops chased
the KDP forces into Iraqi soil or how many Iranian government
forces were involved in the operation.
</P>
<P>
However, an Iraqi embassy official in Iran said about 3,000
Iranian troops and a number of armored combat vehicles pushed into
northern Iraq and launched attacks on the Iraq-based Kurdish
Democratic Party, causing some casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
Iran said Sunday that its military forces killed eight KDP
members and wounded several others in heavy long-range artillery
shellings in its western border region, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRAN)
reported that the bodies of the 20 senior members of the outlawed
grouplet have been identified in the region.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the political bureau, training garrison,
auditorium and other premises belonging to the outfit and a large
number of vehicles were destroyed, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Minister Underlines CIS Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov today stressed that the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) will be a key field of his country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The CIS is "the key field of Russia's foreign policies," the
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Primakov as saying at a three-day
meeting of Russian ambassadors to CIS states which opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of the CIS integration, improvement of
stability in Russia and other CIS states, and solution of problems
of Russian-speakers in the CIS through cooperation and integration
would be the three priorities of Russia's foreign policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
He cited as a challenge of increasing importance the settlement
of regional conflicts within the CIS. "In the recent months, we
have stepped up peace-making efforts in all conflict zones.
However, a breakthrough in finding a durable settlement has not
happened anywhere so far," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the situation is most disturbing in Tajikistan
and called for further military presence of Russia in this region,
warning that "waves of Islamic extremism" from "destabilized
Afghanistan" can cause a domino effect which may hit other Central
Asian republics.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon NATO's expansion plan, he said Russia cannot
ignore this issue in dealing with other CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
"The non-movement of the military structure of the alliance
eastwards is in the common interest of all CIS members, but this
interest is not always and everywhere realized," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Britain Plans to Outlaw Strikes in Essential Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
considering to force workers in essential services to sign
no-strike contracts under union reform laws which it is trying to
include in the Conservative election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
Ian Lang, the trade and industry secretary, is overseeing a
radical examination of employment law with the aim of preventing a
repeat of this summer's strikes in public services such as the
Royal Mail and London Underground, the Financial Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
A host of measures are being considered, but the most favored
option is to require public sector workers to sign new contracts
in which they agree not to take strike action. In return,
employers would agree that industrial disputes would be settled by
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Some measures have been rejected because of legal difficulties.
The most radical one was to make all strikes in essential services
illegal, but it would be almost impossible to achieve a legally
watertight definition of what was "essential."
</P>
<P>
Other proposals, such as to make unions liable to pay damages
for disrupting public services, were also rejected because they
also posed legal problems.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of no-strike public sector contracts, backed by an
agreement that disputes are settled in arbitration, is currently
the favorite option," a government official said.

LUSAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and South africa will soon
set up a joint hide enterprise to improve treatment of animal
skins.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reports said here today that the 1.2 million
U.S. Dollar project is expected to start in Kafue, a town about
50 kilometers south of Zambia's capital of Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to improve the quality of the local
hides, which are fetching low prices on the export market because
of unprofessional methods of treatment which have led to the poor
quality.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, South Africa will provide
technical equipment and know-hows while Zambia will provide skins
and personnel.
</P>
<P>
Kafue will become a center to collect skins and hides from
primary producers in Lusaka and southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
The project will later produce leather goods such as handbags,
traveling bags, belts, coats and hats for export.

<HEADLINE> French PM Launches New Bank for Small, Medium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today formally launched a new bank designed to help the country's
small and medium-sized enterprises, which are having difficulty
obtaining low-interest loans from financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with financial and business experts in
Val-de-Marne southeast of Paris, Juppe said the creation of the
Banque de PME (Bank of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) will
"endow France with an instrument... which is a real bank of
development for the PMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises)."
</P>
<P>
The establishment of this bank was officially confirmed in
mid-July after President Jacques Chirac sharply criticized on the
July 4 National Day France's banking institutions for refusing to
offer low-interest loans to PMEs.
</P>
<P>
The bank will start running by autumn this year and will be in
charge of two other already-existing banks which cater for PMEs --
Credit d'Equipment des PME (CERME) and Societe Francaise de
Garantie de Financements des PME.
</P>
<P>
"Today, our PMEs are having difficulty financing themselves.
They don't have access to credits, and one should remedy this
situation," said Juppe at the meeting held in the new seat of
CERME outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said the new bank is not created to compete with other
banks, but "will act in partnership with other banks."
</P>
<P>
Le Monde said in its Tuesday edition that French banks, which
have been reluctant in accepting the bank since the government
proposed it in November 1995, seem to have accepted this
"holding."
</P>
<P>
The local daily said that the "death rate" of French PEMs is
much higher than their European counterparts, with half of them
going bankrupt within three years of running after coming into
existence.
</P>
<P>
"While difficulties crop up (for PMEs), some bankers show
themselves to be particularly inflexible and seize all the
personal belongings brought in for guarantee by the chiefs of PME
enterprises, throwing their families into the street," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The new bank will offer credits with favorable terms to the
PMEs located in the "grey zone," meaning enterprises that are weak
but hopeful of development in the market at the same time, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Commerce Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that by creating
the bank, the government wants to "see to it that there will be a
greater readability of public aid in order to re-establish the
balance between PMEs and their financial partners."

<HEADLINE> China Wins First Diving Gold At Centennial Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China won its first diving gold
medal at the Centennial Olympic Games through defending champion
Fu Mingxia in the women's 10-meter platform on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Fu collected a total of 521.58 points for the title, her second
Olympic gold in the event following her easy win at 1992 Barcelona
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Annika Walter of Germany took the silver medal with a total of
479.22, followed by Mary Ellen Clark of the United States in the
third place at 472.95.
</P>
<P>
Fu Mingxia was the only diver in the final who executive all
the 5 dives successfully. Other divers, including Fu's teammate
Guo Jingjing, all made some serious mistakes during the
competitions and that made the final a silver-medal contest.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to win the title, finally I didn't let down all the
people who supported me in the past four years," Fu said at the
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Fu said her next goal would be the women's 3-meter
springboard. "The springboard is a new event as I turned to it
after the 1992 Olympic Games. I hope I can win the gold as well,"
said Fu.
</P>
<P>
Fu Mingxia and Tan Shuping, world champion of the springboard,
are the top favorities for the springboard title. The final of
the event will be held on July 31.

<HEADLINE> 83 Injured in Train, Truck Collision in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-three people were injured,
six of them seriously, when a passenger train collided into a
stalled truck at a level crossing in the southern port city of
Pusan, reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The late-Saturday night accident hurled four carriages of the
train off the rails and two of them overturned, which carried 150
passengers from the nearby port city of Pohang, Yonhap television
news reported.
</P>
<P>
But neither of the two drivers was seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to slam on the brakes when I saw the truck-trailer,
but it was too late," the train driver told Yonhap news agency.
</P>
<P>
The trailer-truck driver said about one-third of his truck was
still on the level crossing when it was hit by the train.
</P>
<P>
"I saw the train, but I could not escape because the engine had
stalled," he said.

<HEADLINE> Downpours Leave 75 Dead or Missing in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The torrential rain which hit some
parts of South Korea in the past three days left 52 people dead,
23 missing and over 31,000 people homeless, said the Central
Anti-Calamity Headquarters here today.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said that the number of casualties is likely
to increase as weathermen predicted up to 100 millimeters of more
rain for today in South Korea's capital Seoul as well as Kyonggi
and Kangwon Provinces which were hit hardest by the recent
downpours.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead are 45 soldiers. Most of them fell to the
victims of the torrential downpours while sleeping in their
barracks in Kangwon Province which borders with the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The three days of downpours inundated 3,760 hectares of
farmland, 7,967 houses and 6,389 units of other structures,
leaving 31,865 people homeless, according to the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The rain also destroyed a total of 1,638 meters of roads, 9,522
meters of streams and 165 irrigation facilities, causing over 8
million U.S. dollars of property damage.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam today instructed
ministries and government agencies concerned to come up with
comprehensive measures to help the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
He also requested Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung to pay a visit to
the military units and the most serious flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and Economy decided today to provide
175 million U.S. dollars, taken from the reserve fund, for the
flood victims to help themselves recover from the disaster.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China entered the final of the
women's soccer tournament at the Centennial Olympic Games after
beating Brazil 3-2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's eleven dominated the first half and outshot
their Brazilian counterparts 5-1. Sun Qingmei opened the scoring
at the 7th minute with a supeb 25-meter shot.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team had to play the first 20 minutes of the
second half with 10 players as Tania received her second yellow
card at the 42nd minute in the first half and was sent off. But
they fought harder and forced the Chinese into defence.
</P>
<P>
Roseli, the star forward of the Brazilian team, levelled the
score at the 67th minute after Wen Lirong of China was also sent
off for a tackle.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tests for School Teachers, Lunch Workers in Japanese Sakai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's western city Sakai, which
was hit by an outbreak of food poisoning in recent weeks, has
ordered tests for all school lunch workers and teachers in an
effort to prevent the further spread of E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The Sakai authority Sunday ordered that all 382 people working
for school lunch program undergo tests for the strain of E. coli
bacteria, known as O-157, which was believed to have caused
sickness, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Also, the city will run stool tests for 3,851 teachers, who are
now on summer break, and free, voluntary stool tests for its
residents.
</P>
<P>
So far, 6,490 people, mostly school children, have fallen ill
in Sakai, the second largest city in Osaka Prefecture with a
population of 800,000. Of them, 366 children were still in
hospitals, and 38 in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Health officials suspect tainted school lunches caused the
outbreak of the O-157 E. coli bacteria that has killed seven
people, but they have to find out what food exactly caused the
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The O-157 coli bacteria, with a week-long incubation period,
causes bloody diarrhea and flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
People carrying the bacteria don't necessarily show symptoms,
but could pass it on to the more vulnerable children or elderly.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China won its first ever long
distance Olympic gold medal when world record holder Wang Junxia
took the women's 5000 meters title here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The 1.62-meter Chinese from Northeast China's Liaoning Province
clocked 14:59.88 for the title, beating strong challenger Pauline
Konga, 26, of Kenya to second.
</P>
<P>
Konga took the silver medal with 15:03.49, ahead of Roberta
Brunet of Italy who won the bronze in 15:07.52.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Chinese said: "I'm just surprised the others
ran so badly. I'm not bothered about trying the double. I run
distances like this every day."
</P>
<P>
Reigning 10,000 meters champion Derartu Tulu would not agree.
The Ethiopian gave up her double hopes and slammed the organisers
before the Games over a schedule that included a 5,000m heat and
final on the first and third days of the athletics program,
sandwiching a 10,000m heat.
</P>
<P>
Wang emerged in world long distance races in 1993 when she
stole the show by winning the 10,000 meters title with 30:49.30.
At the 7th National Games less than a month later, she created
wounders by setting two world records -- 8:06.11 in the 3,000
meters and 29:31.78 in the 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
For her outstanding achievement, she was awarded the prestige
Jesse Owens International Trophy Award in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, she did not gain good results and failed to attend the
world championships in Sweden in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Losing to an unknown Jiang Bo at the National Inter-City Games
in Nanjing last October, she has shosen the city as her base for
winter training before the 26th Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Under the individual coaching of Mao Dezhen, an old coach, she
threw all herself into her intensive preparations for the Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
At the national pre-Olympic trials earlier this year, she once
again showed her strength in the women's 10,000 meters
preliminaries, clocking 31:01.76 to create the world's best mark
for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Before she arrived here she said: "My aim is very clear. I want
to revive my former glory at the Olympics in Atlanta."
</P>
<P>
Today's race showed that Wang did what she said and she fully
recovered to her top form in long distance races.

<HEADLINE> On-Line Travel Booking Service to Be Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- American Express and Microsoft
Corporation today announced a new alliance to provide an on-line
travel booking service that allows business travelers to make
reservations from their personal computer.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have already begun developing, and the
corporate on-line travel product with full roll-out is expected in
the first half of 1997. All transactions will be backed by
American Express' worldwide customer service.
</P>
<P>
The on-line booking system will enable corporate travelers to
make complete air, hotel and car rental reservations on-line. The
system also will allow companies to capture travel data critical
to expense management. In addition, corporations can include their
negotiated fares and rates, as well as travel policy guidelines,
into the system, making sure their employees take advantage of
available discounts.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement with Microsoft represents an important step
forward in launching the next generation of travel services," said
Harvey Golub, chairman of the American Express Company.
</P>
<P>
Bill Gates, chief executive officer of Microsoft, said that
"This agreement with American Express represents an exciting
opportunity for corporations to apply Microsoft's intranet
technologies to the challenge of managing corporate travel."
</P>
<P>
On-line travel purchases are growing rapidly, according to a
research company's survey about on-line shopping. The survey shows
that now there are between 7.2 and 10.8 million pleasure travelers
on the World Wide Web. This represents potential spending power of
more than 10 billion U.S. dollars on travel.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account Deficit Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit in the first half of this year rose to 9.29 billion
U.S. dollars, up 55.9 percent from the same period last year, the
Bank of Korea announced today.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance is more than the 8.95-billion-U.S.-dollar deficit
registered for all of last year and is expected to surpass the
revised estimate of 12 billion U.S. dollars for the whole of this
year, according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade deficit in the first six months of this
year increased by 20.1 percent from the same period last year,
with exports reaching 64.47 billion U.S. dollars and imports worth
69.68 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gap was mainly due to the declining international prices of
semiconductors and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Increased travel expenses abroad and royalties and freight
payments overseas pushed up the half-year invisible trade deficit
125 percent from a year earlier to 3.53 billion U.S. dollars, a
bank official said.
</P>
<P>
Unrequited transfers also registered a deficit of 116 million
U.S. dollars for the January-June period of this year, up 33.3
percent from the same period last year largely because of
increased remittances to students abroad.
</P>
<P>
The official, casting doubt over the possibility of the current
account deficit narrowing in the latter half of the year, said
that the government will hardly hold the imbalance to the revised
estimate of 12 billion U.S. dollars for the entire year.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Traditionally strong Europeans
suffered defeats when they were all eliminated in the mixed
doubles event in the Olympic badminton competition here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The players from Asian countries shared the four semifinal
berths after the quarterfinals with South Korea and China each
having two pairs in the semifinal competition.
</P>
<P>
World powerhouse Indonesia was also shocked when their two
pairs Trikus Heryanto and Minarti Timur, second seed, and Nimpele
Flandy and Rosalina Riseu were ousted by joint fifth seeds Kim
Dong Moon and Gil Young Ah of South Korea and joint third seeds
Liu Jianjun and Sun Man of China respectively.
</P>
<P>
Top seeds Park Joo Bong and Ra Kyung Min of South Korea, top
favorites for the gold, sailed into the semi-finals by handing out
a 15-7 15-9 win over the Chinese pair of Tao Xiaoqiang/Wang
Xiaoyuan. They will meet the above Chinese pairs in the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"We are used to the technique and style of Chinese players. So
if we meet Chinese I am confident," said former two-time world
doubles champions Park, who returned to the court for the second
time at the request of South Korean Badminton Confederation.
</P>
<P>
The only European pairs of Michael Sogaard and Rikke Olsen of
Denmark in the last eight, could not cope with their opponent's
powerful smashes before giving up the touph match 15-10, 15-5 and
18-15 to the chinese pairs Chen Xingdong/Peng Xingyong.
</P>
<P>
Badminton was introduced to the Olympics for the first time at
the Barcelona Games four years ago. But the mixed doubles was
only played in the current games and the only mixed event at the
Olympic ball events.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Reopen in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Talks on a comprehensive treaty
banning nuclear testing reopened here today with non-aligned
countries and China calling for further negotiations to sort out
some key outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks resumed after negotiators came back from one month of
study at capitals of a draft treaty text proposed by the Dutch
chairman of the negotiations, Jaap Ramaker, at the end of the last
negotiating session in June.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats emerging from the closed-door session today said
India had declared that it would block consensus on a treaty
unless it dropped the requirement for India, Pakistan and Israel
-- the three so-called nuclear "threshold states" -- to sign and
ratify the pact before it could go into force.
</P>
<P>
A veto from India would mean that the treaty could not be
forwarded to the UN General Assembly for signing.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomats, Cuba, Iran, Pakistan and Egypt of the
non-aligned group also asked for further negotiations to address
their concerns.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the preamble of the treaty lay more emphasis
on nuclear disarmament and more restrictions be introduced to
prevent abuse of the so-called national technical means to trigger
on-site inspections in case of a possible treaty violation.
</P>
<P>
China, who announced a moratorium on nuclear testing today,
also sought further negotiations on the trigger mechanism of
on-site inspections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the meeting this afternoon, Chinese
disarmament ambassador Sha Zukang said that with regard to on-site
inspections, the current draft treaty had not been able to reflect
the reasonable demands of some countries including China.
</P>
<P>
"Only after the outstanding issues including the trigger
mechanism of on-site inspections is resolved by consensus, can the
negotiations be concluded," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Russia, Britain, France and a number of
other countries declared that they could accept the current draft
treaty as it stood.
</P>
<P>
Ramaker told a news conference after the meeting that he would
conduct consultations with the delegations to try to break the
apparent deadlock.
</P>
<P>
He said he was still hopeful that a treaty could be submitted
to the UN General Assembly. But in order to achieve this goal,
negotiations should be concluded within the next one or two weeks.

Launching the Institute for Political Leadership in Pretoria,
de Klerk warned against complacency after the country's

"We will have to do better than we are doing at the moment if

Despite Assurances by President Nelson Mandela, the government
was making more and more mistakes through "bad management of the
country" by an increasing African National Congress (ANC), said
the opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
The NP withdrew from the ANC-led government of national unity
on June 30 to become an opposition because it claimed that the

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal investigators have
identified several Americans as potential suspects in the bombing
of Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, which led to two people
dead and more than 100 others injured, a law enforcement official
said today.
</P>
<P>
The federal law enforcement official in Washington, asking not
to be named, said the potential suspects are white American males,
not international terrorists, according to an Associated Press
report.
</P>
<P>
The FBI has said it believes the bomber is a white American man
according to an analysis of the voice heard in a telephone call to
the emergency 911 number 18 minutes before the bomb exploded. The
caller warned that a bomb would go off in Centennial Olympic Park
in a half hour.
</P>
<P>
Since the investigation began immediately after the bomb, the
federal investigators have been flooded with information,
including videotapes and photographs, that could lead to the
bomber.
</P>
<P>
FBI officials said that the bureau had received fragments from
the crude pipe bomb as well as more than 600 telephone calls
offering information about the crime.
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman David Tubbs said the bureau was also reviewing
film from four surveillance cameras that overlooked the site of
the bombing. And an FBI lab was analyzing the pay telephone that
was believed to have been used to call in a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
Tubbs said sketch artists have drawn composite portraits based
on eyewitness accounts. However the sketches will not be released
to the public before investigators have determined the
authenticity of those accounts.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we will solve this horrible crime,"
Tubbs said Sunday after the bureau had completed its search for
evidence in the park.
</P>
<P>
The park remained closed today, but Atlanta officials said it
will be reopened Tuesday, but security in the park will be
enhanced, with twice as many police as before and police will be
empowered to conduct random searches of visitors' bags.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Growth Recorded in S.Africa's Money Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The annual growth in South
Africa's stock of money supply far exceeded market expectations
for the year to June, growing at a disappointing 15.65 percent
against 13.56 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said yesterday that the surge could force the
Reserve Bank to cut the bank rate by only next year, the South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Credit extension to the private sector for the year to June
remaind constant at 18.6 percent compared to 18.63 percent in
May. But this was far above the informal guidelines of between 10
percent and 12 percent which was previously set by the Reserve
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The economists had expected a slow-down in credit extention as
the effect of higher interest rates started to filter through.
</P>
<P>
The economists said with both the private credit extension and the
money supply figures much higher than expected, one might only see a bank
rate cut at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
They said the strong growth could have been caused by
pre-emptive buying by consumers and businesses trying to combat
the effect of a depreciated rand.
</P>
<P>
A further reason cited by the economists was companies moving their
loans onshore.
</P>
<P>
The Bank used money supply and credit figures as a barometer
for inflationary pressures and economists said that the figures
would weigh in very badly on the financial markets.

LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Parties at the Northern Ireland
peace talks have finally reached agreement on how negotiations are
to progress, according to a BBC report this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The deal took six weeks to reach and allows the substantive
talks, chaired by former US senator George Mitchell, to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the talks, which started in June, is to reconcile
Northern Ireland's Protestant majority, whose leaders generally

minority.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) ended its ceasefire in February
with a series of deadly bomb attacks in England. Because of this,
Britain and Ireland have excluded the IRA's political wing Sinn
Fein from the talks.
</P>
<P>
But the row over arms decommissioning remains the main obstacle
to further progress being made before the talks stop over
Wednesday for a five-week summer break.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments have been working all weekend
to reach some form of compromise. But sources close to Mitchell
said Unionist leader David Trimble had agreed to the compromise,
but the Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley and others
had not.
</P>
<P>
Big blocks remain -- especially the issue of arms, which has
ruined efforts at peace talks since guerrilla ceasefires in 1994
got the process rolling.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has vowed not to give up even a bullet before a full
Northern Ireland settlement is negotiated, and pro-British
Loyallist guerillas say they will not disarm unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
There are also fears that the loyalist Apprentice Boys' march
in Londonderry, on 10 August, will provoke further clashes with
nationalists and bring Northern Ireland back to the brink of
disaster.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Trade Union Attacks Government Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's national
labour union, The Congress of South African Trade Unions
(COSATU), has strongly criticized the government's new economic
policy to create jobs and redistribute wealth.
</P>
<P>
The policy, growth, employment and redistribution aims to
create some 400,000 jobs a year in the country where unemployment
is estimated at about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The policy, issued last month by the cabinet, also projects an
annual economic growth rate of six percent for next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy, the government will continue to
tighten its own fiscal belt. It slashed its deficit from six
percent to 5.1 percent in this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
COSATU says, however, that the new economic policy will take
the government in a direction that is out of touch with its
realities as a developing country.
</P>
<P>
The 1.3 million-strong labour federation is particularly
concerned about aspects of the policy which calls for brisk
expansion in private sector investment, better management of the
fiscal debt and privatization of state assets.
</P>
<P>
According to COSATU, the policy is based on economic reform
models that have failed in other African countries.
</P>
<P>
"These conservative models are not going to bring about the
envisaged creation of 400,000 new jobs, or deliver the social
needs of our people," COSATU said in a statement last weekend.
</P>
<P>
It also said at the moment, the policy "will increase the gap
between the poor and the rich, and condemn the homeless and
jobless, into extreme levels of proverty".
</P>
<P>
The labour union said the proposed economic policy will also
hamper the government's five-year Reconstruction And Development
Programme (RDP).
</P>
<P>
COSATU proposes an alternative macro-economic framework which
ensures redistriction of wealth, elimination of unemployment,
improved labour standards, and increased social spending.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, this approach is the only one with a reasonable
prospect of success," COSATU said in its statement.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela said few days ago that he was
ready to discuss the demands with COSATU.

<HEADLINE> African Refugees Protest Against Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- About 300 refugees from 12
African countries today protested agaisnt their deportation by
the South African government.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, who gathered at the Pretoria office of the
United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), said the
South African government had ordered them to leave the country
within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
"Many of us fled dictatorial regimes. And we are still not
being treated fairly," said a refugee.
</P>
<P>
Some Ethiopian refugees claimed that the South African
government should protect the rights of asylum seekers until they
found countries where they could resettle, adding that Ethiopia
had "consistently assisted South African refugees" during the
apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNHCR representative Nicolas Bwakira said it is up
to the South African government to decide whether or not to grant
asylum to refugees, saying it would be difficult for his
organization to resettle them elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were from Zaire, Angola, Burundi, Ghana, Senegal,
Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroun and Liberia.

<HEADLINE> EC Report: Unilateralism in US Trade Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission expressed
once again in an annual report published today its increasing
concern about extraterritorial provisions in US laws.
</P>
<P>
The report is the EC's twelfth annual report on barriers to
trade and investment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Report stated that many previous problem areas, between the
European Union and the US in bilateral economic activity, had been
resolved as a result of multilateral disciplines imposed by the
Uruguay Round.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that the EU remained concerned about lingering
barriers in such areas of public procurement, tax, and continued
to oppose extraterritorial or unilateral developments in American
trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
"Recent legislation over Cuba, Iran and Libya has increased the
EU's concern about extraterritorial provisions in US laws that
hamper international trade and investment," it pointed out, saying
that "unilateralism in some US trade laws undermines WTO rules".
</P>
<P>
The Reported stated that the EU was anxious to see a reduction
in the use of national security "as a disguised form of
protectionism", notably in relation to import, procurement and
investment restrictions, as well as the extraterritorial
application of investment curbs.
</P>
<P>
In public procurement, the EU remained concerned at the wide
variety of "Buy America" provisions in the US.
</P>
<P>
On maritime services, the EU was disappointed at the failure to
agree a multilateral deal by the WTO deadline.
</P>
<P>
On financial services, the EU was hopeful that ongoing reforms
in the US would sweep away interstate restrictions that currently
impede access by foreign banks.

<HEADLINE> Inquiry into Cause of TWA's Crash Gaining Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The inquiry into the cause of the
American Transworld Airlines's Boeing 747 Jumbo jet is gaining
momentum as investigators found that the plane was decapitated in
the air.
</P>
<P>
The front end of TWA's flight broke away, plunging toward the
Atlantic Ocean, while the rest of the plane continued to hurtle
through the air before bursting into an enormous fireball seconds
later, New York Times quoted today law enforcement officials as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure was a major development in the investigation,
the newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
The new finding strengthened the prevalent belief that a bomb,
possibly stored in the front cargo hold, blew off part of the
forward section of the plane.
</P>
<P>
But, up to now, there are no forensic tests that have
conclusively shown that an explosive device caused the crash. It
was reported that a plane carrying pieces of the front end of the
downed jetliner flew to Washington for forensic testing in the
Federal Bureau of Information laboratory last night.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said that they would not be able to conclude
definitely that a bomb caused the explosion until they had found a
piece of fuselage that contains chemicals consistent with an
explosive.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated TWA plane exploded and crashed into the waters
off Long Island, New York, on the night of July 17 after leaving
Kennedy International Airport for Paris. All 230 people aboard
were killed.
</P>
<P>
Eight more bodies were recovered yesterday, bringing the total
to 153. And salvage workers early yesterday found pieces of the
front of the plane, including first-class and business-class seats
and two nose wheels, in an area of the Atlantic about one and a
half miles behind a large area of debris where other pieces of the
plane's fuselage, including chunks of a wing and three engines,
were located on the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
For the first time today, some recovery work will be diverted
from the ongoing search for more human remains and concentrates on
recovering wreckage, officials said.

<HEADLINE> PC Growth Strong in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The world PC market continues to
grow in a two-digit pace between April and June despite of
constant worries from Wall Street investors, according to
Dataquest, a market research company in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The world-wide sales of personal computers rose 16.5 percent
from the same period of last year. According to the company, 15.9
million machines were shipped during the three months, and the
U.S. accounted for 35 percent of the global PC market, the same
percentage as a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
But the 16.5 percent of world-wide unit growth for the second
quarter represents a decline in growth from the 18.4 percent
increase of the first quarter. Market analysts expect stronger
growth for the remaining months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest is standing by its prediction of 19 percent global
growth for 1996, according to a spokesman for the company.
</P>
<P>
The company is also projecting a 13.6 percent increase for the
year for the domestic market, which another research company --
International Data -- is expecting a U.S. market increase of 16.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Many industry observers are expecting a stronger second half of
the year. They argued that PC prices are falling faster than usual
because of an over supply of parts and components. And the
shipment next month of a new version of Microsoft Corp's powerful
Windows NT operating system is expected to prompt more corporate
demand.
</P>
<P>
The first few strong PC vendors were still Compaq Computer
Corp., International Business Machines Corp., and Packard Bell
Electronics Co., according to researchers.

<HEADLINE> Refugees in Yugoslavia Apply Actively for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Response of refugees who register
themselves for voting in the upcoming elections in Bosnia is very
good, according to the early unofficial results released here
today.
</P>
<P>
Bratislava Morina, Chairwoman of the Yugoslav government
commission for extending assistance to refugees in Yugoslavia,
said that concerning the registration, "the response of refugees
from Bosnia in Yugoslavia is remarkable, and extending the
deadline for registry into voters books by August 5 will make it
possible for all to check whether their names are on the 1991
lists of voters," Tanjug news agency quoted Morina as saying
today. Earlier regulations said the registration time ranged from
July 22 till 30.
</P>
<P>
Morina said the good response means that the refugees had
declared themselves that, in the first place, they want to go
personally back to Bosnia and cast their votes in the
municipalities in the Bosnian Serb territory regardless the fact
that they had earlier lived in the municipalities that now belong
to the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
"The Serb refugees in Yugoslavia are well aware that, with
their votes at the forthcoming elections in Bosnia, they are in
fact struggling for the state of the Serb state Republika Srpska,
without obligation to return there," Morina stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yugoslav refugees commission, there are a
total of 215,000 refugees eligible for voting in the first
post-war elections in Bosnia scheduled for September 14.
</P>
<P>
Under the election rule, the refugees' voting date in
Yugoslavia would be set between August 25 and September 1, two to
three weeks earlier than the election date in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Mills in Nepal Close Down After Rise in Textile Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- All the 210 textile mills in
Nepal closed down indefinitely today in a negative response to the
government's doubling of the sales tax on textile products, the
official RSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The country's Textile Industry Association said the mills could
not resume operation unless the government meets its demand for
eliminating sales tax, checking textile smuggling and levying a
mere one-percent customs duty on raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the association Mahesh Pradhan was quoted as saying
that the sales tax of 10 percent that came into force earlier this
month made it difficult for Nepal's textile industry to run
business.
</P>
<P>
He complained that little was improved in the control of
smuggling, rectification of faulty customs evaluation procedures
for textile goods and lifting of sales tax, although local textile
manufacturers have been making the requests to the government for
years.
</P>
<P>
Citing the example of neighboring India where concessions in
sales tax are provided on textile items, Pradhan noted that the
Nepali government had not taken any initiative to hold talks on
the demands of textile manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's textile industry employed an estimated 20,000 workers.

BEIDAIHE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-premier Li Lanqing
said today that officials must pay attention to food supplies for
Chinese people. He told a meeting in Beidaihe that a major
responsibility system must be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials from 17 large and medium-sized cities and
relevant ministries and commissions under the State Council
attended a meeting to discuss reforming the system of circulating
foodstuffs other than grain. It ended today after several days of
talks.
</P>
<P>
The non-grain food supply project, or what is termed as the
"shopping-basket project" or the "vegetable-basket project", has
been officially implemented in China since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that the supply of vegetables and other
non-grain foods was a matter of great concern for the broad
masses. The issue is closely associated with the effort to control
price hikes and central government's macro-economic regulation.

ISLAMABAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- New Afghan Prime Minister
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has expressed the hope for relations between
Pakistan and Afghanistan to continue to flourish, the official
Associated Press of Pakistan reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The friendly relations between the two nations stem from deep
religious, historical and cultural roots that have acquired
strength during the Afghan Jehad (holy war)," he said in a letter
to Pakistani Foreign Minister Aseff Ahmed Ali.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar described closer relations with the "fellow Muslim
and neighboring country of Pakistan" as a major objective of his
government's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that closer relations between the two
nations will help strengthen Islamic brotherhood and
understanding, in full conformity with mutual national and
historical interests as well as regional and world peace.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan prime minister was responding to a message sent by
Aseff Ali of felicitation on his new appointment.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar, a former archrival of Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, was sworn in as prime minister of the country on June 26,
after reaching an agreement with Rabbani on power-sharing in the
government.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns Japanese PM's Visit to Yasukuni Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The visit by Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to Yasukuni Shrine on Monday is an
intolerable insult to the peoples of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and other Asian countries, said the Korea
Central News Agency (KCNA) in an commentary today.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's claim that he went to the place which enshrines
many World War II criminals in his private capacity cannot
disguise the insidious attempt of the Japanese reactionaries to
revive militarism and to realize the ambition of re-invasion, the
commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, the first serving prime minister to pay homage to
the controversial shrine since 1985, had paid regular visits to
the Tokyo-based Shinto religious place before, the latest being on
August 15 last year in the capacity of international trade and
industry minister.
</P>
<P>
KCNA warned that the peoples of DPRK and other Asian nations
are closely watching the movement of the Japanese aggressive
forces, who want to revive the old dream of establishing a "Great
East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the commentary warned that the Japanese
authorities should have a clear understanding of the overall
situation and refrain from acting recklessly.

<HEADLINE> G-7, Russia to Draw Int'l Convention on Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven (G-7) most
industrialized countries and Russia said today that they would
work out an international convention on terrorist bombings or
other terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
In the text of 25 concrete measures adopted against terrorism
today at the ministerial conference on terrorism, the eight
countries said that they call on all states to "promote the
consideration and development of an international convention on
terrorist bombings...creating collective danger for persons."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said that a working group will be set up by November to
prepare for such an international convention.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to roll up our sleeves and give ourselves
the hand," said de Charette who chaired the conference today,
which is the first of its kind ever held.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken today notably include calls for the
restraint of travel by terrorists, control of fund-raising for
terrorist groups and an increase of exchange of information on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The eight countries urged all countries to act against any
organization that supports terrorism, and prevent terrorists from
using "electronic or wire communications systems and networks to
carry out criminal acts."
</P>
<P>
They called on all states to "refrain from providing any form
of support, whether active or passive, to organizations or persons
involved in terrorist activity," and to "intensify information
exchange concerning international movement of funds...intended for
persons, associations or groups likely to carry out or support
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The ministers urged all countries "to take strong measures to
prevent the movement of terrorist individuals or groups by
strengthening border controls and controls on issuance of identity
papers and travel documents."
</P>
<P>
They appealed for the exchange of information on "actions and
movements of persons or groups suspected of belonging to terrorist
networks," traffic in arms, and all sorts of explosives and
harmful substances.

<HEADLINE> Monster Size Onions Developed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agricultural scientists
have succeeded in growing a new variety of green Chinese
onion. The monster-sized onions are up to 1.6 meters tall and have
long and white stalks.
</P>
<P>
Li Yanjun, head of a vegetable institute noted for the
development of scallion in east China's Shandong, spent six years
improving a five-leaf green onion which had received Co-60
radiation.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that after turning green early in spring, the new
variety grows at a fast speed to about 1.3 meters tall, some even
to 1.6 meters tall.
</P>
<P>
The very white stalk is approximately 70 cm. in height and four
cm. in diameter, with experts saying that the newly-improved
scallion tastes sweet and crisp.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the monster-sized green Chinese onion has
an average per hectare output of 107.95 tons, a record for
scallion-planting in the country.
</P>
<P>
So far, 29 provinces have planted the new green onion totaling
on 80,000 hectares, and earning 1.85 billion yuan for farmers.

<HEADLINE> US Defense Secretary Arrives in S. Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry today arrived in Saudi Arabia's western port city of Jeddah,
a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the kingdom, Perry would meet with Saudi
King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Second Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Defense Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Kuwait News
Agency (KUNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Perry is expected to hold talks with the
Saudi side on moving the U.S. troops from urban areas to remote
bases in a bid to guarantee their security.
</P>
<P>
Perry reportedly would ask the Saudi side to share hundreds of
millions of U.S. dollars to be used to move up to 4,000
U.S. troops from Dahrain to the Al-Karij Air Base, 60 miles
southeast of Saudi capital Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed to protect some 5,000 U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia and other U.S. forces in the Gulf region after a truck bomb
explosion in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on June 25, which killed 19
U.S. Air Force servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan had publicly signaled
support for the U.S. move. However, Perry wanted to discuss the
specifics of sharing the cost.
</P>
<P>
Washington expressed the hope that the wealthy oil kingdom
would pay at least half of the cost of the new security measures,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Perry carried with him a security plan
which was sent to the Pentagon last week by U.S. army General
Binford Peay, Chief of the U.S. Central Command based in Tampa,
Florida, which is responsible for the U.S. forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Perry was scheduled to fly directly to Saudi Arabia last Sunday
from Australia where he paid a visit. But He changed his plans
and headed for Washington after the Atlanta bombing which claimed
two persons' lives and injured more than 100 others Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Perry and U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher visited Saudi
Arabia to inspect the U.S. troops after the Dhahran explosion.
</P>
<P>
The explosion and the blast last year that killed five
U.S. troops in Riyadh have put the Americans in the kingdom on a
very high state of alertness.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is also pressing ahead with plans to return hundreds
of family members of the military and civilian personnel to the
United States from Saudi Arabia for their safety.

<HEADLINE> Haining tide culture attracts the world </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people will be
heading to the ancient Chinese city of Haining soon to watch the
tide coming in.
</P>
<P>
But this is no ordinary tide - it is one of the most amazing
phenomena in China - known for centuries as the birthday of the
God of Tide.
</P>
<P>
The annual tide-watching activities have turned the city on
Qiantang River, in southeast China's Zhejiang province, into a
world famous place.
</P>
<P>
As early as in the Southern Song Dynasty (A.D.1127--1279), the
custom of watching the tide of the Qiantang River in Haining was
established as a not-to-be-missed spectacle.
</P>
<P>
Every year on August 18 of the traditional Chinese calendar,
known as the birthday of the God of Tide, people gather along the
Qiantang River, to enjoy the splendid natural view of the great
tide coming and going.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that in mid-autumn, the sun, the moon and the
earth come in a straight line, with their gravitational forces
becoming much greater, leading to greater and more powerful tides.
</P>
<P>
The bell-shaped mouth of the Qiantang River also contributes to
the unique natural view of the tide. When the sea water flows
backward from Hangzhou Bay, and surges between the increasingly
narrower river banks, the tide grows higher and higher, until
reaching its peak in Haining.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that in Haining the white wall-like tide-head
can be as high as 3.5 meters, with a tide range of nearly 9
meters, ranking "Haining Tide" the number one in China.
</P>
<P>
In Haining, the high tides appear from the first day to the
fifth day and the fifteenth day to the twentieth day of every
lunar month, so there are more than 120 watching days, of which
the mid-autumn day is the best.
</P>
<P>
Many people these days even drive along the Qiantang River to
catch the "Haining Tide" at different spots for more exciting
views.
</P>
<P>
Babu, Yanguan and Laoyancang are all famous spots for watching
the tide.
</P>
<P>
Besides the natural view, old temples, iron bulls, historical
ruins, as well as the stories about them all paint a fascinating
picture of Haining for tourists.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 Haining decided to hold the "Tide Watching Festival" in
mid-autumn of every lunar year. Now the festival has become a
gala international event, for not only tourists and sightseers,
but also for business people and scholars.

<HEADLINE> Australian-PNG Relations Strained Over Defense Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime
Minister Julius Chan warned today that his country's relations
with Australia had become a little strained in recent months over
defense aid issues.
</P>
<P>
Chan protested against Australia's threat to withdraw a
20-million-Australian-dollar (15.8-million-US-dollar) per annum
defense aid to PNG when he addressed parliament today, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"I consider that the excellent and close relationships we have
always had with Australia have become a little sour over recent
months, and I regret this," he told parliament.
</P>
<P>
At the ministerial meeting of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Jakarta earlier this month, Australian
foreign minister Alexander Downer warned PNG not to use
Australia-supplied helicopters in military actions against the
anti-government Bougainville Revolution Army (BRA), or Australia
would stop defense aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
Chan responded to Downer's warning by threatening to
"nationalize" and "diversify" PNG's defense relations.
</P>
<P>
"Now that Mr Downer has seen it fit to issue an open threat to
PNG, then I guess it's time for the entire DCP (Defense
Cooperation Program) arrangement to be reviewed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said Australia had halted direct contacts through
telephones between ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Australia has expressed concern over the PNG government's
handling of the armed groups seeking autonomy in the Bougainville
island.
</P>
<P>
The PNG government lifted an official ceasefire and sent army
troops to fight the BRA in the island in May. But the BRA later
claimed that they had successfully repulsed the government's
assault, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Small clashes have been continuous since then, with three PNG
security force members killed in the latest one this week,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
"I fail to understand how Mr Downer can continue to get it so
wrong," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I am appalled that some people can be so naive about
what is actually happening on the ground at Bougainville, and
continue to fail to see the absolute need for the PNG government
to maintain the presence of security forces on the island," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Australia for its refusal to extradite
Bougainville secessionists in Australia to PNG.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Raise Hope for Brain Disease Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of the way the gene
responsible for Huntington's disease kills brain cells may make it
possible to use drugs to prevent the disease's development,
according to Canadian scientists.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Center for Molecular Medicine and
Therapeutics in Vancouver found that an enzyme produced by a
mutated form of the Huntington gene leads brain cells to commit
suicide, today's Globe and Mail Newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
While everyone's genetic code includes a Huntington gene, the
one person in 2,000 who inherits the mutated gene begins to
experience the lethal effects of the enzyme in middle age.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms begin with moodiness, and may expand to involuntary
movements and uncontrollable facial expressions, and eventually
mental impairment.
</P>
<P>
The process begins when patients are about 35 years old, and
progresses until a patient dies, generally in about 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found cell death only occurs when an area of
the Huntington's disease gene -- called CAG -- expands, and if
that can be controlled, it could prevent development of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Once brain cells die, they can't be replaced. Treatment would
have to begin before the destruction starts, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
"In a testing tube, we can prevent the cleaving of the
protein," a scientist at the center said, referring to a prototype
inhibitor developed in collaboration with the Merck Frosst Center
for Therapeutic Research in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
But it will be years before such drugs could be used to treat
human patients, he added.

<HEADLINE> SADC Secretary-General on Trade Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) Kaire Mbuende said here
today he was optimistic that trade ministers would reach a
compromise and adopt a draft trade protocol at their summit in
Maseru, Lesotho, on August 24.
</P>
<P>
The SADC trade protocol seeks to boost intra-regional trade
through effective tariff reduction which will subsequently make
the region a non-tariff zone.
</P>
<P>
The bone of contention is the time frame for the
implementation of the free trade area, the period for effecting
tariff reductions up to zero. Some countries push for a shorter
period while others, like South Africa, are pressing for a longer
period.
</P>
<P>
It is widely bedlieved South Africa wants to prolong the
signing of the protocol to protect its domestic industry from
competition from its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Mbuenda said under the World Trade Organisation, such a period
could not exceed 10 years. SADC is looking at a period of
between five and ten years.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the process of tariff reduction will start
immediately after the signing and ratification of the protocol
and, in my view, there are a number of sensitive products which
each country would like to move slowly on because of their impact
on the national economy.''
</P>
<P>
He said although each member had a sensitive area, there was
no country with more than five products it regarded as crucial.
</P>
<P>
''So I am quite confident that the Dar es Salaam meeting (on
August 8) will resolve the problem of time frame and produce a
compromise. This is optimism based on realism,'' he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Use More Overseas Investment for Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to use more overseas
money to develop agriculture in the capital's suburbs under a 15
year plan announced today.
</P>
<P>
Officials want agriculture to develop so that it plays its part
in the city's character as a political and cultural center, as
well as an industrial and tourism city.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yucheng, vice-mayor of Beijing in charge of foreign trade
and economic cooperation as well as tourism, told a news
conference about the city's 15-year investment plan for
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The city will resort to overseas investments to develop
breeding and plantation industries, in a bid to build a large
number of farms and sideline products bases to supply the city's
growing demand for food.
</P>
<P>
It will also put more effort into ecological agriculture, and
improve cooperation between agriculture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will attach more importance to export-oriented
agriculture. The city exported more than five billion yuan's worth
of farm products last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first half the year, the city gave the go-ahead to
487 foreign-funded enterprises, involving 783 million US dollars
in overseas investment. And 60 percent of the funds were invested
in local agriculture, an increase of 64 percent over the same
period in 1995,
</P>
<P>
The city now has more than 10,000 foreign-funded enterprises,
two-thirds of which involve agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year more than 50 overseas firms
increased their investments in Beijing, totaling nearly 400
million US dollars, compared with 500 million US dollars in all of
1995.
</P>
<P>
As a group of major foreign-funded projects are to start
construction work soon, this will speed up the use of overseas
investment in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Law On Trial in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Law courts in south China's Hainan
Province have carried out extensive reforms to ensure fair and
more efficient trials.
</P>
<P>
Judges used to talk to litigants and conduct investigations as
soon as they received a lawsuit. Then they mediated or ordered a
trial, and sometimes judges would come to a decision before a
trial began.
</P>
<P>
In those cases a trial was often viewed as a mere formality
with litigants dubious about the fairness of the justice meted out
by the judges.
</P>
<P>
Now judges will bring lawsuits to court after preliminary
preparations.
</P>
<P>
In the past judges took charge of all investigations, claimed
to be the main reason for low efficiency.
</P>
<P>
At present litigants are able to raise facts and witnesses
freely in court. If one trial is not enough, successive trials
follow until the lawsuit is completed.
</P>
<P>
In the past, judges who were engaged in trials had no decision
making rights, and they had to report the trials to chief judges,
who normally did not attend any trials.
</P>
<P>
This administrative way of handling lawsuits harmed the
initiative of judges, while chief judges were busily involved in
lawsuit files and hearing reports, leading to low efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Higher People's Court has taken the lead by organizing
capable judges to form special courts which can directly reach
final decisions. This is helping to overcome problems of
low-quality judges in some of the lower courts.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries (CZI) has told its members to stop supplies to the
government departments which have a history of not paying bills
on time.
</P>
<P>
CZI President Jonee Blanchfield said today the government
departments owed industry substantial sums of money after a
facility introduced last year to curb overspending by ministries.
</P>
<P>
Under the stop payment facility introduced in July last year,
treasure was entitled to stop releasing any additional funds to
ministries which would have exhausted their budgetary
allocations.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government departments have not been able to
meet creditor obligations.
</P>
<P>
''We have told our members to stop supplies to people who
don't pay for services,'' said Blanchfield. ''I don't have exact
figures of what industry is owed but i can tell you it's a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
Blanchfield said the CZI had already advised the National
Airline, and Air Zimbabwe to stop giving air tickets to the
government officials who do not pay.
</P>
<P>
Many companies have been experiencing severe cashflow problems
because of failure by the government departments to pay for
services.

BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Four people have died of
heatstroke in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, according to
China Women's News.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from 20 local hospitals show that the number of
people catching summer flu has reached more than 5,000, while
patients suffering heatstroke numbered almost 300 in scorching
July, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
According to doctors, people suffered flu mostly because of
insufficient rest in the hot weather, which resulted in decreased
appetite and immunity against viruses. Frequent come-and-go
through rooms equipped with and without air-conditioning could be
another important cause.
</P>
<P>
Among the patients suffering from sunstroke, most were outdoor
workers, such as pedlars, the doctors said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Makes Major Breakthrough in Wheat Production Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have provided a
grain of comfort as ways are desperately sought of boosting food
production.
</P>
<P>
China has succeeded in developing a new technology that can
increase wheat output by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Highly praised by Chinese experts as another revolution in
agricultural production technology, after hybrid rice and maize,
the new technology applies ground sheeting and pocket methods of
sowing. It has been developed by Gansu Academy of Agricultural
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Chinese agricultural scientists have been working hard to
explore new ways of increasing wheat production.
</P>
<P>
Experiments with the technology conducted in Gansu, Inner
Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang and Shanxi show that it is efficient
in increasing wheat output.
</P>
<P>
According to calculations, China can expect to harvest another
7.5 to 10 billion kilograms of wheat if the technology is applied
to 6.67 million hectares of wheat fields during the 1996-2000
period, representing half or one third of the planned increase in
wheat output during the period.
</P>
<P>
China grows four million hectares of spring wheat and 6.67
million hectares of winter wheat each year.

<HEADLINE> Karasin Likely to Oversee Russia's Asian Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The newly-appointed Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister, Grigory Karasin, will most likely replace Deputy
Foreign Minister Alexander Panov in overseeing the Asian affairs,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a government source as saying that Panov is leaving
for Japan to take the position of Russia's Ambassador to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still unclear whether Karasin will also replace
Panov at the forthcoming Russian-Japanese consultations at the
level of deputy foreign minister, Itar-Tass noted.
</P>
<P>
Karasin, 47, was appointed Deputy Foreign Minister by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin on July 27.
</P>
<P>
Before the appointment, Karasin was the chief spokesman for the
Russian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Born in Moscow, Karasin graduated from Moscow State
University's Institute of Oriental Languages. He has a command of
three foreign languages -- English, French and the African
language Hausa.
</P>
<P>
Between 1974 and 1992, Karasin worked in Senegal, Australia and
Britain. In 1992, he was named head of the Department of Africa
and the Middle East of the Russian Foreign Ministry. In 1993, he
was appointed chief spokesman for the ministry.

<HEADLINE> China Cuts Prices On International Rail Trips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China's rail authorities are to
cut ticket prices on joint international passenger train services
from August 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Railways, the journey prices for
all international trains between China and other countries will be
cut by various amounts.
</P>
<P>
The cost of a journey on the Sino-VietNamese international
train, for example, will be cut to 1,200 yuan from the original
1,502 yuan. The price is even lower for package tours, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, domestic travelers who intend to take the
train will be able to buy tickets in its China section at cut
prices. For instance, the ticket for a trip between the Beijing
Western Railway Station and Guilin, a scenic city of south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will be 819 yuan, rather than
the original 1,142 yuan.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Chinese people fly on long-distance
journeys and take buses on short tours, leading to a sharp
decrease in train passengers.

<HEADLINE> Top Military Officer: Syria Sticks to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Syria will never give up a single
inch of its soil in seeking peace with Israel, according to Syrian
Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Hekmat el-Shehabi.
</P>
<P>
Shehabi has rejected secret talks with Israel, saying that
Syria has "nothing to hide or to feel ashamed of" at negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The senior military officer made the remarks in an interview
published today by Syrian newspaper Al-Baath to mark the Syrian Army
Day, which falls on August 1.
</P>
<P>
In the interview dealing with the Middle East peace process
with the Syiran-Israeli track in particular, Shehabi announced
that his country's position is summed up in the following points:
</P>
<P>
-- Syria has rejected secret talks, as it has nothing to conceal
or to feel ashamed of at the negotiations;
</P>
<P>
-- An incomplete peace based on separate deals is inviable,
so it is rejected now and in the future;
</P>
<P>
-- Syria wouldn't accept a peace that would cause a single inch
of its native soil to be surrendered;
</P>
<P>
-- Security is linked to peace, and security arrangements are no
alternative to a complete (Israeli) withdrawal (from the Golan
Heights);
</P>
<P>
-- There is no room for bargaining with Syria over a
complete Israeli withdrawal up to the June 4, 1967 lines.
</P>
<P>
Shehabi criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for his evasive attitude towards the land-for-peace principle,
saying that that to abolish the land-for-peace principle is to
abolish the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is widely known for his hardline policy in dealing
with the Arabs, with the Syrians in particular. He has time and
again stated that Israel will not return the Golan Heights, which
Israel seized from Syria in the third Middle East war in 1965 and
later annexed it.
</P>
<P>
Shehabi warned that the peace march could collapse completely
if the land-for-peace formula laid down in the Madrid conference
is abandoned. He accused Netanyahu of making his own
interpretations of the land-for-peace formula, saying that Syria
will never accept any concession or compromise.
</P>
<P>
Syria's attitude toward the peace process is principal, despite
the hindrances set by Israel in the way of its negotiations with
Syria, Shehabi said, adding that Syria hopes the negotiations will
lead to the establishment of a fair and overall peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syria will continue to strengthen its military
capabilities by purchasing new weapons.
</P>
<P>
He called for implementing the resolutions of the recent Cairo
Arab summit so as to toughen the Arab stand against anti-Arab
challenges.

CANBERRA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
closed lower amid concerns about a weaker economy today.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index dropped 4.9 points to close at 2130.8
points.
</P>
<P>
Local dealers said that the trade was quiet and the volume
remained low in the local bourse, because investors were cautious
to take major positions before the August budget came out.
</P>
<P>
There were concerns that the federal government's move to slash
budget expenditure by eight billion Australian dollars (6.3
billion US dollars) in two years would further dampen the economy.
</P>
<P>
Latest official statistics showed that the Australian economy
was growing at a slower pace, with a softer building market,
dropping inflation rate, subdued wage growth and weaker consumer
demands.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index lost 3.5 points to 3216.7 points,
while the all resources index shed 6.5 points to 1308.1 points.

National turnover stood at a modest 178.7 million shares,

<HEADLINE> Commodity Sales Grow Steadily in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China's social retail sales
reached a total of 1,144 billion yuan (about 137.8 billion US
dollars) in the first half of this year, a 13.1 percent rise in
real terms over the same 1995 period, the Ministry of Internal
Trade revealed today.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the ministry on 80 major department stores shows
that the sales of food rose by 65.9 percent, the highest among all
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Household electrical appliances, such as color TVs with screens
of at least 25 inches, automatic washing machines,
air-conditioners, and cameras, also won a big share in the market.
</P>
<P>
The retail sales price increased by 7.1 percent over the first
half of last year, revealed Ding Junfa, spokesman for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
It was already the sixth straight month to witness the
one-digit price hike, laying a solid basis for the goal of a ten
percent price increase for 1996, Ding said, adding that the price
hike for grains has been lowered to seven percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Ding, China's State Council decided to raise the
purchasing price of rice, wheat, maize, and beans by 40 percent
this year. The Ministry of Internal Trade decided to raise their
marketing prices correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
China's grain and oil markets now have a strong supply, and the
price is very steady, a signal for the smooth adjustment of the
grain price, Ding said.

The retail price index, a major indicator measuring inflation,
has been falling gradually in the past half year period to 5.5 per

The industrial added value has maintained a steady growth,
rising 14.6 percent to reach 85.7 billion yuan by June 30. Light

<P>
The province has strengthened investment in fixed assets, with
the amount rising 35.1 percent to reach 24.09 billion yuan for the

</P>
<P>
Foreign trade volume increased 6.7 percent to reach 5.7
billion US dollars by June 30, with export values accounting

23.2 percent to reach 14.6 billion yuan, with 51.9 percent of the

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- With the help of Chinese
policemen, three American visitors stranded by China's worst
floods for decades, safely left the flooded area and caught their
scheduled flight to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The travellers were trapped in a hotel and feared they would
miss a flight to Hong Kong because every road was blocked.
</P>
<P>
But two policemen came to the rescue and found a way for the
trio to reach their destination in time.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese police are wonderful", remarked the grateful three
American visitors, as they safely left Jingzhou, a city besieged
by floodwaters in south China's Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
For the three Americans, experiencing the biggest flood in
decades in China might provide life-long memories.
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of July 17, the three American went to Guilin
by way of Jingzhou. Due to the floods traffic was stopped, so the
visitors had to stay in a hotel on high land - and safe from the
floodwaters - in Jingzhou.
</P>
<P>
They thought they would be delayed for days and would
definitely miss their flight to Hong Kong three days later,
because they could clearly see that roads in all directions had
been cut off by water.
</P>
<P>
But two Chinese policemen appeared on the evening of July 18th,
just one day after being stranded by the flood, they were safely
guided by the officers along a flood-free path in a nearby
suburb.

CHANGSHA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Flood wrecked main roads in
South China's Hunan Province have been reopened to traffic after
a round-the-clock race to repair them.
</P>
<P>
Massive efforts by work teams have allowed the busy highways to
resume operations.
</P>
<P>
Five of the province's seven state highways and 28 provincial
highways were completely blocked by the floods.

The province immediately raised more than 60 million yuan and
dispatched more than 60,000 laborers to take part in the operation
to repair the destroyed roads.
</P>
<P>
Now four of the state highways and the 28 provincial highways
have re-opened to full traffic.

Many railway lines running through the province also
collapsed, suffered landslides, or were inundated by floods,
causing major delays to local rail movements, and service
cancellations. Now the rail services have resumed normal schedules.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Austria Agree to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Austria today
agreed to step up bilateral trade and cooperation in education at
a meeting between Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
visiting Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Haji Ahmad Bawadi said Austria has offered
scholarships worth 500,000 Austrian shilling (about 50,000 U.S.
dollars) for Malaysian students in post-graduate studies on
sustainable rainforest management in Austria.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to expand trade between them, which is
below 80 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on Bosnia Herzegovina,
reforms to the United Nations and efforts to enhance Asia-Europe
relations.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the relationship should be based on
cooperation and should not be confrontational in nature, Badawi
said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders witnessed the signing of an agreement and four
memorandums of understanding between the private sectors of the
two countries, which cover cooperation in the fields of management
of medical equipment and hospital information services as well as
health care, water treatment technology and power generation.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian chancellor arrived here earlier today for a
four-day visit.

<HEADLINE> G-7, Russia Discuss Terrorism in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and security ministers of
the Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialized nations and Russia
gathered here today to discuss cooperation in the fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
They are supposed to adopt several practical anti-terrorist
measures, which include sharing intelligence and techniques,
easing extradition, improving surveillance of funding to
terrorists and denying the access of terrorists to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers are poised not to react actively to
U.S. President Bill Clinton's call for economic sanctions against
Iran, Iraq, Libya and Sudan, which are accused by Washington of
patronizing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
France has publicly rejected the request and insisted a
separation of the fight against terrorism from economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette today told a French
television that it is not by "finger-pointing" that terrorism
could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Officials said if Washington raised this issue at the
conference, it would be told that it could not set trade rules
unilaterally and that the European Union will maintain its
dialogue with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The United States has recently enforced the so-called
Helms-Burton law to tighten its embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, lawsuits could be filed in the United
States against foreign companies which buy or sell U.S. properties
confiscated by Cuban communists after the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congress also passed a similar bill last Tuesday to punish
foreign companies that do business with Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Experts on terrorism from the eight countries held a meeting
before a plenary session of the ministers at 10:30 (09:30 GMT) in
downtown Paris.
</P>
<P>
Two round-table meetings of foreign and interior ministers,
together with security officials, have also been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is absent from the
meeting and an assistant secretary of state was sent in his
place.

<HEADLINE> Seven Gold Medals on Offer at Atlanta Olympics Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Seven gold medals are to be
awarded Tuesday with the hectic athletics enjoying a rest as the
26th Olympic Games enter the 11th day of competition here.
</P>
<P>
Weightlifting and softball are winding up today while modern
pentathlon, mountain cycling, freestyle wrestling and synchronized
swimming going into action.
</P>
<P>
Mountain biking, making its Olympic debut this time, will
produce two titles this afternoon. Frenchman Miguel Martinez and
Dane Jan Erik Oestergaard,the silver and bronze medallists at 1995
world championsips in Germanyh, are obvious choices in the men's
event, while Canadian Alison Sydor and Italian Annabella Stropparo
are tipped in the women's section.
</P>
<P>
Modern Pentathlon which includes 10m air pistol shooting, epee
fencing, 300m freestyle swimming, riding jumping and 4000m
running, will see action among 32 entrants, the outcome of which
is wide open.
</P>
<P>
Weightlifting that has already given birth to 14 new world
records over the past ten days is drawing to an end with
competition in the last event -- over 180kg class. Russia's
Aleksandr Kurlovich may well win his third consecutive Olympic
victories if he can overcome younger rivals such as his compatriot
Andrey Chemerkin, Germany's Ronny Weller and Australia's Stefan
Botev.
</P>
<P>
The other top honors will be provided by table tennis, softball
and yachting.
</P>
<P>
By the end of Tuesday, 170 out of the 271 gold medals at stake
will have been awarded.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Military Chief on Land-for-peace Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Armed Forces Chief of
Staff General Hekmat el-Shehabi has said that to abolish the
land-for-peace principle is to abolish the Middle East peace
process and to cause it to collapse completely.
</P>
<P>
The military chief made the remarks in an interview published
by Syrian newspaper Al-Baath today on the Syrian Army Day.
</P>
<P>
Syria's attitude toward the peace process is principal,
despite the hindrances set by Israel in the way of its
negotiations with Syria, General Shehabi said, adding that Syria
hopes the negotiations will lead to the establishment of a fair
and overall peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He called for implementing the resolutions of the recent Cairo
Arab summit so as to toughen the Arab stand against anti-Arab
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Middle East peace process, the Syrian Armed
Forces Chief of Staff announced that his country's position
is summed up in the following points:
</P>
<P>
- Syria has rejected secret talks, as it has nothing to conceal
or to feel ashamed of at the negotiations;
</P>
<P>
- An incomplete peace based on separate deals is inviable,
so it is rejected now and in the future;
</P>
<P>
- Syria wouldn't accept a peace that would cause a single inch
of its native soil to be surrendered;
</P>
<P>
- Security is linked to peace, and security arrangements are no
alternative to a complete (Israeli) withdrawal (from the Golan
Heights);
</P>
<P>
- There is no room for bargaining with Syria over a
complete Israeli withdrawal up to the June 4, 1967 lines.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Big Consumer of Gold Ornaments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China has struck gold as consumers
race for ornaments made with the precious metal. The country's
domestic market uses over 200 tons a year of gold.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the country has more than 400
gold ornament manufacturers, employing 50,000 people and producing
eight billion yuan's worth of gold products a year (about 964
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Most gold consumers, official surveys say, are in the
country's major and medium sized cities, where the average urban
dweller possesses up to two grams, a level approaching the world
average.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 80 percent of the consumers buy
gold ornaments, such as jewelry, for decoration with over 70
percent of the gold items owned by women.
</P>
<P>
As many of China's gold ornaments are regarded as poor in
variety and style, many manufacturers are importing advanced
technology and equipment to follow the world fashion, thus
providing new opportunities for Sino-foreign cooperation, experts
say.

<HEADLINE> Half of South Asian Kids Suffer from Malnutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Over 50 percent children in
South Asia are suffering from malnutrition mainly due to poverty
and negligence, according to the regional office of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) here.
</P>
<P>
Rates of malnutrition cases among children in some South Asian
countries are much higher than those in the poorest countries in
Africa, UNICEF regional representative Daniel O'Dell told local
reporters at a recent press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that half of the malnourished children in the world
were found in three South Asian countries -- Bangladesh, India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to O'Dell, besides poverty, household negligence is
another main cause of the high malnutrition rates among children
in the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF official also attributed child malnutrition in the
region to lower birth weights. He pointed out that pregnant women
in South Asia put on only five kilograms on average while African
expectant mothers generally gain 10.
</P>
<P>
He said that the lower birth weight is a result of certain
cultural practices in South Asia where mother-in-laws often force
their pregnant daughters-in-law to remain on low diet.
</P>
<P>
Poor sanitation and lack of breast feeding and child care also
lead to fragile health and malnutrition of children in the region,
he added.
</P>
<P>
A 1996 UNICEF report has urged governments to address the child
malnutrition problem as a political task by promoting equal
educational opportunities for girls and decision-taking rights for
women, both inside and outside home.

<HEADLINE> HK to Build Refuse Transfer Station at Lantau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Environmental
Protection Department (EPD) today signed a contract for the
development of the North Lantau Refuse Transfer Station (NLRTS).
</P>
<P>
As part of the Hong Kong new airport core program and one of
the nine of its kind in the territory, NLRTS is scheduled to be
commissioned in April 1998 to correspond with the opening of the
new airport.
</P>
<P>
Located at Siu Ho Wan on north Lantau Island, the refuse
transfer station will be built at a capital cost of about 251
million HK dollars (32.38 million US dollars) and with an annual
operating cost of about 34 million HK dollars (4.38 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The contract was awarded to Ecoserve Limited, a joint venture
between Waste Management International plc and Citic Pacific
Limited.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the contract signing ceremony, EPD's acting
Assistant Director, Benny Wong said that NLRTS will be capable of
handling up to 1,200 tons of refuse daily arising from Chek Lap
Kok Airport and Tung Chung New Town.
</P>
<P>
The NLRTS will be built to very high environmental standards
with the provision of a wastewater treatment plant and odor
removal equipment to ensure that no nuisance will be brought to
the developments nearby.
</P>
<P>
All wastes received at the station will be properly compacted
and containerized before being transported by marine vessels to
the West New Territories Landfill for disposal.
</P>
<P>
The NLRTS is the sixth refuse transfer station contract awarded
 by the Environmental Protection Department. At present three
transfer stations are already in operation with the fourth and
fifth one being built.

<HEADLINE> HK University Succeeds in Right Liver Grafts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong University has
succeeded in performing world's first two right liver transplants
in the past two months, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
South China Morning Post said that Hong Kong's two successful
right-liver grafts were a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
It said that Germany and the United States have performed
right-liver transplants, but both countries have failed.
</P>
<P>
The two patients in Hong Kong suffering from acute liver
failure could not receive left-side livers as they were too small
for their builds and there were no suitable dead donors available.
</P>
<P>
Ng To-wang, 28, who became the world's first successful patient
 having a right liver transplant in May, is now recovering from a
marathon 25-hour surgery.
</P>
<P>
His elder brother, Andy Ng To-ming, agreed to give up
two-thirds of his liver to his 90-kilogram brother.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lo Chung-Mau, associate professor of the university's
Department of Surgery, said the elder Ng brother's liver had
almost grown back to its previous size in the two months since the
 operation.
</P>
<P>
The second patient, Lau Hing, 22, who received the right liver
from his father last month, is expected to be able to go home
today.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated 90 people in Hong Kong need a liver
transplant. In the past three months, at least six patients have
died while waiting for matching donors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Companies Optimistic About Future Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, JULY 30 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the Chinese
enterprises expressed their optimistism about their future
performance as they are expecting a more favorable macro-economic
climate, according to a recent survey by the State Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which covers 10,000 firms nationwide, indicates
that 39 percent of the companies forecast a better performance
during the third quarter, while 46 percent of them regard that
their performance will not improve or decline. Only 13 percent of
the Chinese companies deem that they would expect a downward
performance.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 36 percent of the companies surveyed expect a better
macro-economic climate during the July-September period while
nearly half of the companies anticipate the macro-economic climate
to remain the same as in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
China's lowering the interest rates for bank deposits and loans
on May 1 has helped ease the fund shortage of Chinese companies
and improved their performance, experts say, adding that quite a
few people are talking about the possibility for the central bank
to lower the interest rates again in view of the differences
between the current interest rates and the declining price growth
rates.
</P>
<P>
The survey finds that 42 percent of the Chinese enterprises
reported a rise in their production volume during the second
quarter over the first quarter, while production in nearly 30
percent of these enterprises remained the same as in the first.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 40 percent of the companies claimed that they
have received more orders from their clients during the second
quarter over the first while the equal number of the companies
said that the orders they had received in the second quarter
remained the same as in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
There reported a still better, improved sales situation for
enterprises during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
It is also learned that 28 percent of the Chinese companies
said that the macro-economic climate turned more favorable during
the second quarter whereas only 24 percent of them took this view
in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Enhances Relations with ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has enhanced its relations
with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with its
recent admittance to ASEAN as an observer at the grouping's 29th
ministerial meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The admittance is seen as a step closer towards Myanmar's full
ASEAN membership.
</P>
<P>
At their two-day meeting on July 20-21, the ASEAN foreign
ministers rejected criticisms against Myanmar by some Western
nations. The ministers also rejected the imposition of economic
sanctions against Myanmar and decided to maintain its constructive
engagement with that country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's internal affairs were "no concern to ASEAN," they
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said at the ASEAN annual
meeting that ASEAN looks forward to closer cooperation with
Myanmar after it became an observer of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has sought better ties with the ASEAN countries. It
acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia
at the 28th ASEAN ministerial meeting in Brunei last year, and
Myanmar leader Than Shwe attended the 5th ASEAN Summit in Bangkok
last December, further promoting its relations with ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar maintains friendly relations and cooperation with all
other Southeast Asian nations, and has made marked progress in
efforts to fully integrate itself with ASEAN since the country
attended the 27th ASEAN ministerial meeting in Bangkok in July
1994. It was the first time for Myanmar to attend an
ASEAN-sponsored meeting as a guest of the host country.
</P>
<P>
Economically, official figures show that some Southeast Asian
countries, mainly Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the
Philippines, have invested in Myanmar with over 1.04 billion US
dollars out of a total of 3.34 billion US dollars of foreign
investment by 19 countries and regions by the end of May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that Myanmar's eventual entry into the
ASEAN family would not only benefit Myanmar but also contribute to
peace, stability and development in the Southeast Asian region.

<HEADLINE> Delhi High Court Upholds CMM Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi high court today
upheld the order of chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM), Prem
Kumar, summoning former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao as an
accused in the L. Pathak cheating case.
</P>
<P>
Rao appealed to the Delhi high court last week for quashing the
July 9 CMM order summoning him to appear in the lower court on
July 24.
</P>
<P>
Justice S.K. Mahajan dismissed Rao's petition, saying that the
former prime minister could approach the lower court for necessary
remedies.
</P>
<P>
The CMM had earlier fixed August 2 for the personal appearance
of Rao in the court in the cheating case, as the high court had
directed deferment of Rao's presence in the lower court on July 24
in view of the pendency of the decision on the petition.
</P>
<P>
UK-based non-resident Indian businessman l. Pathak had
testified before the CMM court that he gave 100,000 US dollars to
controversial godman Chandraswami and his associate to secure
contracts for the supply of newsprint and paper pulp to India on
the assurance of Rao, who was the then external affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
Chandraswami and his associate are now lodged in the Tihar jail
for their role in the cheating case and their bail applications
have been rejected several times by courts.
</P>
<P>
During the arguments before the high court, Rao's counsel Kapil
Sibal had claimed that he was never in the US on the alleged date
of December 22-23, 1983, meeting with l. Pathak.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Draws up Plans for Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's key state figures in
charge of economic and financial matters, led by Deputy Prime
Minister Amnuay Virawan, have worked out long-term measures to
revive the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here Monday, Amnuay, Finance Minister Bodi
Chunnananda and Governor of the Bank of Thailand Rerngchai
Marakanond explored methods for boosting exports, slashing the
current account deficit, reducing inflation and accelerating the
growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held at a time when some major economic
indicators showed lower-than-expected growth in Thailand's economy
during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June, the country's exports grew by only
six percent, as against an earlier forecast of 18 percent. The
index of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) fell from this
year's peak of 1,423 points in February to 1,097.02 points on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Bank of Thailand adjusted its forecasts for the
economy in 1996, lowering the predicted economic growth rate from
8.3 percent to 7.8 percent and export expansion rate from 18
percent to 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The projected current account deficit was raised from 6.5
percent of the GDP to 7.8 percent and inflation rate from 4.9
percent to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the new strategies aimed at stimulating Thailand's
economic performance, efforts will be focused on promoting a total
of 40 product lines in traditional agriculture, agricultural
industry, labor-intensive industry, high-tech technology and
services and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's traditional agriculture products include rice,
rubber, sugar, tapioca and coffee. Its agricultural industry
products include frozen chicken, frozen seafood and canned food.
Its labor-intensive industry features textile, footwear industry,
furniture making and rubber industry.
</P>
<P>
The country's high-tech technology products include electrical
appliances, vehicles, computers and jewelry while its services and
foreign investment categories include tourism, airlines, power
supply and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to bolster production of value-added
goods, especially agricultural products, and encourage savings to
narrow the current account deficit -- the gap between savings and
investment.

<P>
PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The foreign ministers and interior ministers of the Group of
Seven industrialized countries and Russia meet today in Paris to
adopt concrete measures against terrorism. U.S. President Bill
Clinton is pushing Western countries to adopt concrete measures
against Iran, Iraq, Libya and Sudan, a request disagreed to by
France.
</P>
<P>
-- The explosion of TWA 800, caused most probably by a bomb in
the luggage hold, reminds one of the explosion of the Pan-Am Boeing
747 above Lockerbie in 1988, because of the similarity between the
way of explosion of the two planes.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The G-7 ministerial conference against terrorism is planned
for a long time, but the attack on Atlanca Olympics reinforces the
determination of the participants. U.S. President Bill Clinton wants
America's allies to "do more" against countries suspected of
patronizing terrorism. Differences appear between Washington and
European countries over the measures to be taken against these
countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Nine hundred agents of the FBI are following "promising
trails" of the bomb attack on Centennial Olympics Park in Atlanta
last Saturday. Several portraits-robots have been made after
thousands of evidence statements, video cassettes and photos were
submitted to the investigation bureau.
</P>
<P>
-- Bombs are shown in kit form on internet. Manuals of terrorist
apprentices cover whole screens of computers linked with the
network. For one who has an internet computer, nothing is easier
than to find all sorts of data on making bombs.

<HEADLINE> Israel Asserts Not to Block Consensus on CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel, one of the three so-called
threashold countries considered capable of having nuclear arsenals,
has agreed in principle not to block an international consensus
on reaching the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), reported
The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The decision, however, falls short of formal acceptance of
CTBT, said the report. But it suggests that Israel would sign
CTBT, assuming a consensus on the current terms is reached
involving two hold-out states, India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy declared earlier, "In
the spirit of Israel's commitment to the banning of all nuclear
weapon text explosions, Israel will not seek to open the present
compromise on CTBT text for further negotiations, provided that it
is not opened by other participants in the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva."
</P>
<P>
Levy added,"Israel decided to adopt this position even
though the present draft text of CTBT does not adequately
address some of Israel's concerns."
</P>
<P>
Levy had made the remarks in a statement at the end of a meeting
with the visiting Director of the United States Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, John Hollum, earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Israeli officials say the move was
taken as a gesture to the Clinton Administration, which has
made the passage of CIBT a priority.
</P>
<P>
The decision, carefully worded, was taken after an agreement
between the U.S. and Israel was hammered out which potentially
would ensure no flights over the Dimona nuclear center, south
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms, Israel would have to approve all flight
plans in advance, including the quality of cameras used by
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The move by Israel on CTBT is important to the U.S., as
Washington seeks to coax other states suspected of having nuclear
weapons or of being on the threashold into joining.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reports say that Israel conducted one underground
nuclear test in the Negev Desert bordering with Egypt and
Jordan in 1966 and tested a tactical nuclear warhead in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has denied the reports, and declared
to stick to the formula that "Israel will not be the first to
introduce nuclear weapons" in the Middle East.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will set up a
rubber fund of 3 billion baht (120 million US dollars) to boost
rubber prices and promote exports.
</P>
<P>
The program is intended to maintain rubber prices at least at
25 baht a kilogram (about 1 dollar). Rubber is currently selling
for 27-28 baht a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Current prices are still low when compared with the same period
last year when rubber was trading at 30-40 baht a kilo.
</P>
<P>
Rubber importers are temporarily slowing down production due to
lackluster rubber export performances in several producer
countries, According to Deputy Agriculture Minister Charnchai
Pathumarat.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also set aside a 240-million-baht fund to
build up rubber stockpiles in the two rubber producing provinces
-- Krabi and Chachoengsao.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the funds, rubber exports this year are
expected to reach 1.8 million tons and bring in about 80 billion
baht (2.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand exported only 1.7 million tons of rubber.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Thai police will soon step up
crackdown on organized crime by foreigners in Pattaya to salvage
the seaside resort's image as a safe tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
The reputation of Pattaya, about 160 kilometers southeast of
Bangkok, has been tarnished by underworld activities that have
greatly damaged legitimate business investment and scared off
tourists, the English-language daily, the Nation, today quoted
Immigration Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Kiettisakdi Prapavat as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Pattaya police have been closely monitoring
the activities of some aliens who disguise themselves as tourists
and run criminal rackets.
</P>
<P>
Several underworld figures, especially German nationals, often
set up beer bar operations run by their Thai wives as a cover for
crime, such as narcotics trafficking, and extortion and
blackmailing of tourists.
</P>
<P>
Local police have also sought cooperation from the local
business community to put an end to the crime against tourists.
</P>
<P>
The problem of Pattaya street children harassing foreign
tourists has been significantly reduced but it needed a
comprehensive and long-term solution to be completely resolved,
Pol Lt Col Piya Suraprasert, deputy superintendent of the Pattaya
police station, said.

TOKYO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has called for administrative reform, saying, "reform at
the Finance Ministry (MOF) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is vital,"
Kyodo News Service reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with business leaders, Hashimoto said that in view
of the numerous and varied opinions on administrative reform,
efforts must be made to hold calm talks.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to begin discussing reform. However, we should
try to hold talks in a calm, focused manner, and also discuss the
revision in the Bank of Japan Law, said the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Other issues the government should address are Okinawa and the
public nursing care insurance program, Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
On the public nursing care insurance program, Hashimoto noted
that local governments are against shouldering bigger burdens. He
said corporations should express their opinions on the program
since they, too, will be called upon to have new burdens.

BUCHAREST, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Defense Minister
Gheorghe Tinca and his British counterpart Michael Portillo signed
here today three memorandums of understanding on the promotion of
cooperation in arms production and on British troops training in
Romania.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Portillo today, Romanian President Ion Iliescu called
for the prevention of creating contradictions among those applying
for NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu added that it is wrong for NATO to accept the central
and eastern European countries in batches, stressing that NATO
should consider the demands of all applicant countries and guard
against discremination.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Romanian Defense Ministry today, Portillo
said NATO hopes that Russia understands that NATO is neither in
a hurry to admit new members, nor malicious towards Russia. NATO
will have talks with countries that are approaching the criteria
for membership by early next year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Key Liberian Warlord Ready to Disarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Alhaji g.v. Kromah, member of the
Liberia Council of State and leader of the United Liberation
Movement (ULIMO-K), said he is ready to disarm his troops without
any preconditions as a prelude to peace and future elections.
</P>
<P>
''Whenever the West African Peacekeeping Force (Ecomog) is
ready for the disarmament exercise, i'm willing to lead the
way,'' Kromah said in a statement issued on Monday in Abuja,
capital of Nigeria, where the 19th summit of the Economic
Community of West African States (Ecowas) has just concluded.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, Kromah made the
statement at the observation that no warring faction should be
allowed to participate in the forthcoming elections in Liberia
without first disarming.
</P>
<P>
But Kromah said he had never eyed the presidency and none of
his activities so far had been geared toward that direction.
</P>
<P>
He however added that there was growing public pressure on him
to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
According to Kromah, elections could be held in Liberia within
the next six to nine months and that disarmament could be
achieved by December this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that ULIMO would be the direct beneficiary of peace in
the war-torn country as his faction constitutes 700,000 refugees
and displaced persons out of an estimated population of two
million in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Charles Taylor, also member of the
Liberia Council of State and leader of the National Patriotic
Front of Liberia, said he would continue ''the quest for peace in
Liberia."
</P>
<P>
And for this purpose he would have a meeting with the newly
elected Ecowas chairman, Nigeria's head of state general Sani
Abacha, before he left Abuja for home.
</P>
<P>
According to sources here, Taylor's planned meeting with the
Ecowas chairman came on the heels of last Saturday night's
disappointment of scores of unofficial observers and some
Liberian delegates who openly wept because the expected sanctions
against Liberia's warring factions were not announced.
</P>
<P>
However, the timing of the unannounced meeting was not
discloyed.

COLOMBO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops today
continued to consolidate the situation in the newly captured areas
of Paranthan Town in the Northern province while clearing mines

</P>
<P>
According to a military spokesman here, the clearing operations
around Paranthan town were time consuming because it was an area

The spokesman said the government troops around Paranthan were
being harassed by rebels' mortar fire, but they had not suffered
any casualties.

The spokesman added that the Tamil rebels had abandoned their

KUALA LUMPUR, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will set up a
permanent reserve force from among ex-regulars as provided under
the Armed Forces (amendment) Bill 1996 tabled in the parliament
today.
</P>
<P>
Tabling the bill, Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar
said the reserve force would have two components: ex-regulars and
civilian volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, when a soldier completed his term of service
with the armed forces, he would be required to be a reservist for
five years or until he is at the age of 50, whichever came first.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces Council will, however, have the discretion to
exempt any soldier from such reserve duty, the minister said,
adding the soldier would have the same rank in the reserve force
as he had when he was in regular service.

SANAA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
left here early this morning after an one-day visit to Yemen
during which he had talks with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh on the latest developments in the region and bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference before leaving, Arafat said he had asked
King Hussein of Jordan, in his capacity as chairman of the
Jerusalem Committee, to hold an urgent meeting of the committee to
examine the effects that may result from the Israeli authorities
allowing Jews to perform prayers at the Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
"The recent Cairo Arab summit was not in reaction to the
forming by the right-wing Likud bloc of a government in Israel,
but it was a positive Arab action led by Cairo and arranged by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in collaboration with a number of
Arab leaders, with the aim of securing a unified Arab stand on
the Middle East peace process and the legitimacy of setting up a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital," said the
Palestinian President.
</P>
<P>
Arafat emphasized that peace is not only a Palestinian demand
but also an Israeli need and a worldwide wish, calling on all
parties concerned to promote peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had arrived in Sanaa Monday from Saudi Arabia
accompanied by both Mahmoud Abbas, Secretary of the PLO Executive
Committee, and Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), and Sayeb Oreikat
Minister of Local Government in the Palestinian National
Authority.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Exports 1.5 Million Tonnes of Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has already exported nearly
1.5 million tonnes of rice this year, Vietnam News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Over 87 percent of that amount has been shipped out of the
southern region, particularly the Mekong Delta provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Food Corporation topped the list of major rice
export companies, exporting over half a million tonnes of rice.
</P>
<P>
Southern provinces have also transported 548,700 tonnes of rice
to northern areas of Vietnam since January this year.
</P>
<P>
Indicators show that this is one of Vietnam's greatest ever
rice harvests exceeding last year's harvest by one milion tonnes,
despite the severe damage caused by fierce storms in both the
north and the south on the remaining winter-spring rice crop.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development wants the
government to increase the export quota by 500,000 tonnes.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Ruling Party votes on U.S.Military Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's pro-Islamic Welfare Party
(RP) led by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan is expected to make
a critical vote today on the future of the Operation Provide
Comfort (OPC), a U.S.-led air force based in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
RP leader Erbakan once said in parliament: "We are saying to
the Americans: 'Go Home' "
</P>
<P>
However, Erbakan said in his government program that Turkey
would maintain its close links with the Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan obviously does not want to take risks, though he has
supposedly persuaded the RP group to vote in favor of the
extension of the OPC mandate.
</P>
<P>
Turkish former President Kenan Evran has said that any
government must extend the OPC mandate as Turkey depends on the
West too much politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
Operating from the Incirlik base in Adana, southern Turkey,
the U.S., British and French fighter planes which take part in
the operation have been patrolling northern Iraq since 1991 to
prevent Iraqi government troops from launching attacks against
Iraqi Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Turkish parliament has regularly renewed the
OPC mandate, but this time there have been certain difficulties
arising from within the ruling RP, which had consistently voted
against the OPC while in opposition.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Turkey's National Security Board decided to
recommend to the government that the OPC mandate be renewed for a
period of five months.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Democratic Left Party (DSP) and the Republican
People's Party (CHP) are expected to vote against the OPC, as is
the ultra-rightist Grand Unity Party (BBP).
</P>
<P>
The BBP had previously supported the government during the
vote of confidence. Meanwhile, opposition Motherland Party (ANAP)
Deputy Chairman Murat Basesgioglu recalled that his party had
declared it would vote in favor of the OPC provided that the
operation's headquarters in northern Iraqi town of Zakho was
moved to Silopi on the Turkish side of the border, and that the
OPC mandate was renewed for a two-month period.

AMMAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan denied Monday that it had
any role in an alleged plot to topple the Iraqi regime and
reiterated that it "does not intervene" in Iraq's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan has never been involved in any plot to topple the
Iraqi regime or assassinate the Iraqi president. I categorically
deny this," Minister of Information Marwan Muahser said at an
informal press briefing Monday. His remarks were published by
"Jordan Times" today.
</P>
<P>
Muahser's comments were in reaction to a statement made by an
Iraqi opposition leader who accused the United States, Jordan and
"another country in the region" of plotting to overthrow the
regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Baqer al Hakim, president of the Supreme Council for
the Iran-based Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) said 25 to 30
Republic Guards officers were executed after the Iraqi
authorities uncovered the plan.
</P>
<P>
"The American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) did not move
in a determined and loyal manner, despite its expressed desire
for changing the situation in Iraq," Reuters quoted Hakim as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Some 150 officers from the Republic Guards have been arrested
of whom 25 to 30 were executed in mid- July," he reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the CIA of working only to achieve its own goals
and interests even if that led to bloodshed and disclosure of
people working with it.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said that the failed coup might be made by Iraqi
National Accord (INA).
</P>
<P>
Sources said Iyad Elawi, leader of the INA which is based in
Jordan, had received a payment of 5 million dollars from
Washington in a bid to topple the Iraqi president.
</P>
<P>
The INA had made no word on the allegation so far.

<HEADLINE> New Insight Into Near-Death Experience from Earthquake Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese psychiatrists
has just finished doing research on near-death experiences and
hope to find beneficial ways of using the results.
</P>
<P>
The findings were contained in a report released by Tianjin's
Anding Psychiatric Hospital. Researchers studied more than 40
types of experiences of 100 survivors of the devastating Tangshan
earthquake 20 years ago. They had been seriously injured and on
the verge of death, but had survived as paralytics.
</P>
<P>
A near-death experience is described by doctors as a kind of
subjective experience of people who have almost died because of
serious injuries or disease, or who find themselves in a dangerous
situation and have a presentiment of death, but who survive or
escape.
</P>
<P>
"Research on near-death experiences may help us find some
effective ways of prolonging the lives of critically ill patients
and of preventing suicides," said Feng Zhiying, head of the
psychiatric researching team.
</P>
<P>
According to the patients, the experience included having a
strange sense about their bodies, their thoughts becoming
extremely clear, a sense of having no emotions, a dream-like
state, a feeling of death coming, a sense of calmness, a total
recall of past events, and thought processes becoming faster.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that when people feel calm, happy, and
without fear as they approach death, their lives may be prolonged,
and conversely, their lives end more quickly if they are
frightened or under stress.
</P>
<P>
"This finding may help nurses provide better care for dying
patients," Feng noted, and went on to point out that a near-death
experience could possibly help world-weary people understand the
preciousness of life better and avoid attempted suicidal behavior.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Chinese scientists have done any
research on near-death experiences since theories about the
subject began to appear over a century ago.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that the experiences varied depending on
such factors as education, career, marital experience, and other
personal characteristics. Those with a higher education background
often felt a clearness of thought at the moment of death, while
those who were poorly-educated had a stronger sense of leaving
their bodies, or a strange sense of their bodies and of the
unreality of the human world.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the study, which involves medical science,
sociology, psychology and sciences in other fields, is expected to
be conducted further at the Anding Hospital in Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Doctors Help to Cure Color Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of Japanese doctors who
are specialists in color blindness have come to the Sino-Japanese
Friendship Hospital here to help treat color-blind patients.
</P>
<P>
Taketoshi Yamada, chairman of the Tokyo-based Wado Doctors
Group, invented an instrument called "Just point, just channel"
more than 20 years ago, which has been used to cure some 177,000
people of color-blindness.
</P>
<P>
The treatment involves using an electrical impulse from the
instrument to stimulate six points: two beside the eyes, two by
the ears, and two in the nose.
</P>
<P>
Ba Denian, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science,
has described the treatment as being a miracle, because
traditionally color blindness was thought to be related to an
inherited genetic defect and not curable.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shaowu, director of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital,
says that the treatment complies with traditional Chinese medical
theories and provides a valuable clue for using traditional
Chinese medicine to treat color-blindness.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 20 million color-blind people living in
China.

XI'AN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Seven years ago, Shi Ronghai, a
young teacher, quit his job at a university and established a
computer and information research institute with three friends and
30,000 yuan they borrowed. Today, that same research institute has
34 enterprises overseas and 37 branches in China.
</P>
<P>
This is only one of many success stories to be found among
the privately-owned (non-state-run) technology-intensive
enterprises in the province. There are nine such enterprises whose
annual income is more than 100 million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
As recently as in 1991, there were fewer than 1,000 such
enterprises in the province. In contrast, by the end of last year,
the number had swelled to 4,700.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the provincial science and
technology commission, the enterprises concentrate on electronics,
information, medicine, biology, chemicals, machinery, instruments
and meters, construction materials, and health food.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the more than 49,000 employees of these companies help
produce a total income of 6.2 billion yuan and foreign currency
earnings of 35 million US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
enhanced efforts to protect the declining number of varieties of
livestock and poultry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that at least 10 livestock and poultry species
have died out, and eight species are on the verge of disappearing
in China, according to today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to halt this trend, the Ministry of Agriculture
has taken the lead in helping establish a national committee for
protection of livestock and poultry as national resources.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 590 species of livestock and poultry in
China, giving it one of the broadest selections of livestock and
poultry in the world.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade or more, government departments have
singled out more than 100 leading species for preservation, while
scientists and agro-technicians have developed several dozen new
species. Also, in 1995, the Ministry of Finance set aside special
allocations for helping preserve 33 animal and poultry species.

<HEADLINE> India, Nepal to Enhance Civil Aviation Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- India and Nepal have agreed to
enhance their civil aviation cooperation by increasing flights on
each other's routes, it is learnt here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are in favor of multiple designation where we can fly more
than two airlines into India," said an official of the Nepalese
embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Nepal was also in favor of increasing 2,000 seats per week, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreed minutes singed in the just concluded
Indo-Nepal Civil Aviation talks here, the two countries can have
two airlines operating on each other's routes. The two sides
decided to have a further discussion later to work out details.
</P>
<P>
The first memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the two
countries was signed in 1964. In the second MOU in 1972, Air India
was designated as a flag carrier and was permitted to fly into
Nepal among other airlines.

<HEADLINE> Hope Schools To Be Available In All Poor Counties In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China expects to set up Hope
Project Schools in all of its poorer counties to help all
drop-outs have access to an education.
</P>
<P>
At a recent national coordination conference, the China Youth
Development Foundation, sponsor of the project, promised to set up
Hope schools in all of the country's poor counties this year, and
urged all members of society at the same time to donate to this
worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, a total of 2,574 Hope schools had been set
up in 421 poor counties, but 171 other counties, most of which are
in southwest and northwest China, still have no such schools,
according to China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has decided to raise another 10 million yuan
(about 1.2 million US dollars) to set up at least 60 Hope schools
in remote areas in nine provinces and autonomous regions. Hope
schools in other parts of the country will also be established
with funds from other sources.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that a minimum of 100,000 yuan is needed to build
a Hope school.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Project began in 1989 and had nearly 700 million yuan
in donations by the end of 1995, which helped fund 2,074 Hope
primary schools, giving 1.25 million drop-outs the opportunity to
return to class.
</P>
<P>
Another project, the Spring Bud Program, received 9.97 million
yuan in donations over the past year and helped more than 100,000
girls in poor areas to resume schooling.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Survey Targets Rural Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- More than two million rural firms
in China are scheduled to be checked in a nationwide survey on
pollution, the biggest of its kind in China, according to the
Ministry of Agriculture and the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China is conducting the examination of rural enterprises,
hoping that it will help discover and put an end to the sources of
rural pollution.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises have registered rapid growth since the early
1980s and have played an important role in the national economy
and helped increase farmers' earnings.
</P>
<P>
But they have also led to severe pollution because of low
technological standards and lack of suitable controls.
</P>
<P>
The survey will take a look at the actual situation of
pollution by rural enterprises, including the discharge of
pollutants, losses caused by the pollution, and damage to the
environment. The survey has already started and will be completed
by the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Indian Airlines to Raise Domestic Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Airlines (IA) has
decided to raise its domestic fares to offset the impact of the
recent increase in the price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF), IA
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The domestic carrier was likely to increase its fares by 10 to
12 percent. The final fare structure is expected to be worked out
within a week.
</P>
<P>
The IA and private airlines pay 1.70 US dollars per liter of
ATF, compared to the international price of 55 US cents per liter.
</P>
<P>
The IA increased its fares by about 20 percent in October last
year.
</P>
<P>
Following IA's decision, private airlines are expected to
follow suit. "Our costs have gone up on all accounts. Therefore, a
fare hike is imminent," said Kapil Kaul, vice-president of
marketing, East West Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Apart from ATF, the domestic airlines have been affected by a
60 percent hike in airport charges levied by the Airports
Authority of India, he added.

<HEADLINE> Eight Arrested on Explosives, Guns Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Eight people including a woman
are accused of arming themselves to fight against the the United
States government.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors on Monday charged the militia members who were
arrested over the weekend by the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI).
</P>
<P>
The eight were arrested in a roundup after the group was
infiltrated by a FBI agent, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
Five of them were arrested while attending a class on how to
use explosives in Bellingham, about 130 kilometers north of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with conspiracy to make and possess explosive
devices and machine guns.
</P>
<P>
The arrested allegedly planned to use the devices "to arm
themselves for what they believed would be an eventual
confrontation with the United States government or the United
Nations," said court documents.
</P>
<P>
Four were members of the anti-government Washington State
Militia, including the organization's founder. Four others were
members of a Seattle-area group called "Freemen."
</P>
<P>
The FBI stepped up its efforts in cracking down on
anti-government groups in the U.S. following the explosion at a
federal government building in Oklahoma in April last year. The
explosion killed 168 people and injured hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
The latest arrests were made in the wake of a bomb explosion at
Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta where the Summer Olympics is
being held. But the FBI did not link the groups to the Atlanta
bomb.

imprisonment and a fine of 100,000 rupees ( 2985.07 US dollars) by
a city court for smuggling drug out of India.

The court order said that in the event of his failure to pay
the fine, he would undergo another year of rigorous imprisonment.

In all, five Nigerian citizens have been allegedly involved in
the drug peddling case. Godson Crukwu Dnwutolobi, the alleged
master-mind of a conspiracy to export heroin out of the country,
is absconding. The others were discharged.

<HEADLINE> Slower Growth in Post-Reform Period Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to popular belief, the
annual average growth rate of industrial production has been
slower in the post-reform period than pre-reform period, the local
press said here today.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of Indian industrial production for the last 15
years shows that annual average growth rate in post-reform period
( 1991-92 to 1995-96) at six percent was way below the 8.4 percent
achieved in the five years immediately preceding reforms (1986-87
to 1990-91).
</P>
<P>
It is also lower than the annual average growth rate of
industrial production of 7.8 percent in the 80s (1981-82 to
1990-91).
</P>
<P>
The lower growth rate in the industrial production in the
post-reform period is mainly due to the extremely poor performance
of the industry in the first two years of liberalization. The
industrial production grew by mere 0.6 percent and 2.3 percent in
1991-92 and 1992-93 respectively compared to 8.6 percent and 8.2
percent in the two years immediately preceding reforms, the local
press said.
</P>
<P>
The silver lining, however, is the industrial growth of 12.1
percent witnessed in 1995-96, which was higher than growth rate in
any single year in the last 15 years.

WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense Secretary
William Perry left here today for Saudi Arabia to discuss security
measures for American troops stationed in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Perry was said to have delayed his trip to Saudi
Arabia and returned home from Australia. Clinton administration
officials, however, said he departed from nearby Andrews Air Force
Base on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The trip has been described as a "secretive" one and a
statement issued by Perry's office only said the defense secretary
was going to look after the "security and welfare of the troops".
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials said last week that Perry's trip to Saudi
Arabia was to ask the kingdom to pay at least half of the expected
cost of a security plan, including movement of around 5,000 U.S.
troops from densely-populated cities to a safer, remote military
base in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The plan was drawn up following the truck bomb in Dhahran last
month which killed 19 American servicemen.

ATLANTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Andreas Wecker finally gave
something to cheer for the German fans on Monday when he won his
country's first gymnastics gold on the horizontal bar, the last of
the 14 Olympic gymnastics events.
</P>
<P>
It was the first Olympic gymnastics title for the Germans in
their outings to the last three Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old veteran, three-time Olympian, accumulated 9.850
points to chalk up the crown in the final. He was also a finalist
in the event at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The native of Berlin came out as a black horse at the World
Championships in Sabae, Japan in 1995 when he grabbed the
horizontal bar title.
</P>
<P>
Krasimir Dounev of Bulgaria had to settle for the silver with
0.050 points behind, followed by a trio of bronze-medalists:
Alexei Nemov of Russia, Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus and Fan Bin of
China, all tied at 9.800 points.
</P>
<P>
The name of Scherbo became a buzzword in the Barcelona Olympic
Games as he grabbed a total of six golds. After a hiatus of four
years, he had to settle for four bronzes, three of them from the
apparatus events this evening.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old took his first medal in Monday's vault final,
which was won by Alexei Nemov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Nemov collected 9.762 in his first attempt and 9.812 in his
second for a winning point of 9.787 points.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Russian, who grabbed a gold in the men's team
event, added the second to his gold credit after a firm landing in
his second vault.
</P>
<P>
Scherbo's another bronze came in the parallel bars. Ukraine's
Rustam Sharipov took the title with a winning point of 9.837.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoshuang of China, winner in the individual all-around,
pre-tournament favourite, failed on his landing in his first
attempt and was a step away from the podium in the vault, the only
event he competed in tonight.
</P>
<P>
Shannon Miller, silver-medalist in the women's all-around at
Barcelona Games, made her home fans crazy as she scored a winning
point of 9.862 for the women's beam laurel.
</P>
<P>
Pumped up by the partisan fans, the 19-year-old Miller
displayed her near perfect performance with a firm landing.
</P>
<P>
Lilia Podkopayeva of Ukraine, fresh women's individual
all-around title winner, celebrated her first apparatus crown as
she bagged the gold in the floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old gymnast, only seventh finish in the event at
the World Championships in Sabae in 1995, collected a winning
point of 9.887, the higheset point of the gymnastics tournament,
with her perfect somersaults and firm landings.

</P>
<P>
The two Americans brought the packed crowd to their feet by

respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Lewis, who had eight Olympic golds under his

long jump.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, he has joined discus thrower Al Oerter of the
United States as the only athlete to win four gold medals in one
Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
"I am very excited. It is my last Olympics and I realised my
dream at last," said Lewis, who had his name tarnished in the past
few years, and was regarded as an out-of-time star in track and

<HEADLINE> World Food Program to Expand Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) said
today it has expanded its emergency operation to alleviate the
worsening famine in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), which will feed three times as many people as before by
next spring.
</P>
<P>
The United Nation's food-aid agency said an estimated 1.575
million Koreans in the DPRK will benefit from the new
25.9-million-U.S.-dollar strategy, hammered out after the
organization's mid-May special alert on the nation's dire food
crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, WFP officials warned that it is still hard to raise
two fifths of the total fund, or 10 million dollars, although the
United States, Japan, South Korea and other donors have covered
the other three fifths.
</P>
<P>
The first ship, which carries 9,075 tons of rice purchased in
Vietnam, will arrive at the DPRK in mid-August. It will be
followed by a second consignment of 13,000 tons of rice, corn meal
and corn soya blend later that month.
</P>
<P>
Besides the original food rations to the half million victims
of the DPRK's flooding last summer, the expanded package will
include rations to some 525,000 children under five in the most
vulnerable areas of the country, 125,000 flood-affected collective
farmers, mostly women, and 425,000 family dependents.
</P>
<P>
An earlier WFP emergency operation has provided 7.3 million
dollars to the DPRK after the 1995 floods, the worst natural
disaster in the country's history. Over 40,000 hectares of land
were devastated and no crops are expected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the WFP, the United States contributed 6.2 million
dollars in food to the new package, while Japan, South Korea and
Sweden contributed 5.25 million, 2 million and 1.2 million dollars
in cash, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Other donors include Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, Finland
and an American non-governmental organization.

<HEADLINE> Unbeaten Italy Defeats Yugoslavia to Lead Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- World champion Italy turned up the
speed at crucial moments to beat Yugoslavia in straight-set and
finish the preliminary matches with unbeaten record Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Italians, helped by Andrea Giani's 20 kills and Samuele
Papi's 18, thrashed Yugoslavia 15-12, 15-8 and 15-12.
</P>
<P>
It was undramatic match because the outcome did not change the
standings in pool B, where Italy ranks first and Yugoslavia third,
behind of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Neterlands defeated South Korea 15-4, 15-11 and 15-12 with
a 4-1 win-loss.
</P>
<P>
"It was very satisfied having completed this round without
defeat," Italian coach Julio Velasco said.
</P>
<P>
Italy played without middle bloker Vigor Bovolenta who was hurt
two day's ago, when he was accidentally hit in the face by a
teammate's elbow.
</P>
<P>
"He should return to play in the quarterfinals, and certainly
the semifinals," Velasco added.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's Dorde Duric led the team with 19 kills and Vladmir
Grbic had 17.
</P>
<P>
Russia beat Tunisia, also in straight sets 15-9, 15-10, 15-11,
and placed fourth with a 2-3 preliminary outcome, going to the top
eight team competition.
</P>
<P>
In pool A, Brazil upset Cuba in straight sets 15-11, 15-10,
15-11 to move into the top eight round contest with 3-win and
2-loss record.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, 1-4, still led the group and Brazil was second.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria rallied from a 1-2 behind to beat the United States
15-11, 13-15, 11-15, 15-5 and 15--12 to finish third in 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Argentina took a hard-fought 3-1 (7-15, 17-15, 15-10, 15-9)
victory over Poland earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine, 3-2, overcame a sluggish start to steal set two
from Poland. At 15-15, an erratic pass by Poland and a stuff block
by Argentina's Jorge Elgueta and Pablo Pereira gave the South
American team the narrow win.
</P>
<P>
The host America, 2-3, disqualified for the quarterfinals with
Poland, who was winless.

<HEADLINE> China Finishes 1-2 in Olympic Men's Springboard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Xiong Ni of China finally won his
first Olympic gold medal after being beaten by Amercian Greg
Louganis in the 1988 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, who finished second to Louganis in Seoul and third
behind teammate Sun Shuwei and American Scott Donie at Barcelona
in the men's platform, totalled 701.46 points to take the 3-meter
springboard title, which is also the first Olympic springboard
title for China.
</P>
<P>
His teammate Yu Zhuocheng had ensured the gold medal for China
earlier as he outdived defending champion Mark Lenzi of the United
States by 4.44 points.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Ni, the last diver on the springboard, made a brilliant
dive of inward three and a half somersaults in tuck position,
which gave him 87.72 points and the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the final round of the six-dive final, Lenzi
collected a high 92.40 points. But that was still not enough for
him to make up the deficit in the previous five rounds.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zhuocheng, who made his first appearance in Olympic Games,
finished second at 690.93 points, followed by Lenzi in the third
place with a total of 686.49 points.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad that I won the first springboard gold for my
country," said Xiong Ni, "there was a fierce competition between
my teammate and I, but the most important thing is that China
takes the gold."
</P>
<P>
Lenzi, who had a layoff after the 1992 Olympics, said that he
didn't perform well today. "It seemed that my ability of
resisting the pressure decreased."
</P>
<P>
"Xiong Ni is a very good diver and it is his third Olympics. He
is deserved for the gold."
</P>
<P>
It was the second diving gold China won at the Centennial
Olympics. Defending champion Fu Mingxia won the women's 10-meter
platform title on Saturday.

SAN JOSE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican cabinet met today
to discuss the consequences of the devastation left by hurricane
Cesar last weekend.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 people were killed and 29 are missing after
storms and torrential rain hit the Caribbean island. Property
damage has been preliminarily estimated at 200 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since Saturday, heavy rain has caused severe flooding in many
parts of the country, destroying houses and crops. Many bridges
and highways have been seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
The South Inter-American highway is still cut off in at least a
dozen places after parts of the road were washed away due to landslides.
</P>
<P>
Public Works and Transportation Minister Rodolfo Silva said
repairs are being carried out in the area to reopen the main roads.
</P>
<P>
The government believes that it will take a week to complete an
evaluation of the damages, but has earmarked special funds for the
emergency.

<HEADLINE> Mindanao War Costs Philippines 2.7 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has lost
73 billion pesos (2.78 billion US dollars) in war with the Muslim
MORO National Liberation Front (MNLF) in Mindanao during the last
26 years, the Manila Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted government negotiator Eduardo Ermita as
saying that the 73 billion pesos spent by the government came from
the defense budget and the amount represented about an average of
40 percent of the annual appropriation for the military.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present about 30 percent of the budget of the
Philippine Air Force, 40 percent of the budget of the navy and 60
percent of the budget of the army are spent in Mindanao, where the
MNLF has been fighting for autonomy since 1970.
</P>
<P>
Of the 100,000 casualties recorded in the last 26 years, at
least 50 percent came from the MNLF side and government troops
accounted for 30 percent and 20 percent of them are innocent
civilians, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ermita said that the cost of the conflict has been too high and
it must now end through a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
Government negotiators and MNLF representatives are expected to
meet in Jakarta, Indonesia, early next month for the last round of
peace talks, during which a peace accord to end the 26-year-old
war could be signed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Swimmer Appeals over Positive Doping Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia has appealed against the
disqualification of swimmer Andrei Korneyev, who was stripped of
his bronze medal after failing a dope test, an International
Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA) official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
FINA director Cornel Marculescu said the Lausanne-based Court
of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) met on Monday to consider Russian's
appeal against the decision to take his medal away.
</P>
<P>
The court, which has an ad-hoc "flying squad" of arbitrators in
Atlanta in a bid to settle disputes quickly, gave no immediate
comment. The panel aims to make decisions on any case within 24
hours of hearing a case.
</P>
<P>
Korneyev, third in the men's 200 meters breaststroke, tested
positive for the stimulant-cum-masking agent bromantan.
Marculescu said the Russians said Korneyev needed the substance
for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
FINA disqualified Korneyev after the International Olympic
Committee's medical commission tested him positive. The IOC
decided to strip him of his bronze.
</P>
<P>
FINA said on Sunday Britain's Nick Gillingham, who finished
fourth in the race, had been awarded the bronze forfeited by
Korneyev. The Russian left for home the same day.
</P>
<P>
Korneyev was one of three athletes who tested positive for
bromantan. The others were Russian wrestler Zafar Guliyev and
Lithuanian cyclist Rita Razmaite.

<HEADLINE> Food Import Company to be Set Up in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Minister of Trade,
Commerce and Food Kingsley T. Wickramaratna has appointed a high
powered committee to work out the details for setting up a food
import company (FIC), according to official sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the committee has been asked to submit
its report by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the company, which is designed to
control prices in essential food items, is a result of a cabinet
decision to reduce living costs, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The FIC would be free from tedious and time consuming
bureaucratic procedures, such as the calling for tenders for the
import of food items.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the FIC would be given hand to conduct
direct government-to-government negotiations on food imports,
thereby effectively eliminating speculators.
</P>
<P>
Currently, food prices in Sri Lanka are soaring. Prices for
essential food items have reportedly increased by 15 percent since
January this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China has secured the men's table
tennis doubles title and came closer to the women's singles crown
after Monday night's action at the Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Defending Olympic champions Wang Tao and Lu Lin routed their
German arch-rivals Jorg Rosskopf and Steven Fetzner 3-0, while
Chinese new combination of Kong Linghui and Liu Guoliang downed
South Korean duo Yoo Nam-Kyu and Lee Chul-Seung, also in straight
sets.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Lu, reigning world champions, handed a 21-19, 21-17,
21-7 defeat to the German duo, who won the silver medal in the
Barcelona Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Kong, world number one who was upset by South Korean pen-holder
Kim Taek-Soo in the singles event on Sunday, took a sweet revenge
after pairing up with Liu to win the doubles semi-final 21-17,
21-16, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
"We had been studying the performance and possible strategies
of two rivals pairs for five hours last night and we were well
prepared," said Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
"I have been worrying about Kong and Liu, who have been pairing
up for less than one year and lack teamwork," Cai said. "But today
they did really well."
</P>
<P>
Chinese have booked three semi-final spots in the women's
singles event with the other berth snatched by 1988 Olympic
champion Chen Jing, who is now playing for Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
World number one Deng Yaping, who combined with number two Qiao
Hong to beat teammates Liu Wei and Qiao Yunping in the women's
doubles final three hours ago, trounced European champion Nicole
Struce of Germany 21-16, 21-19, 21-13 to book a semi-final berth.
</P>
<P>
Qiao clinched a 21-19, 21-19, 21-16 victory over Chire Koyama,
who won the 1987 world championship for China and now represents
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wei, ranked third in the world, beat Kim Hyon Hui of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea 21-12, 22-20, 21-14, also
moving into the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing nipped 21-12, 21-15, 21-19 Chan Tai Lui of Hong Kong
to reach the top four.

<HEADLINE> Seles Eliminated at Olympic Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Monica Seles of the
United States suffered a defeat at the Olympic tennis tournament,
losing to Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic in the women's
singles here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who has yet to win a major tournament to prove her
power, lost to Novotna, seeded six, 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (8-6).
</P>
<P>
Seles, co-number one player with Steffi Graf of Germany in the
world rankings, had 5-3 leads in both the first and third sets
against the Czech player, but Novotna used her potent
chip-and-charge tactics to dictate the course of play.
</P>
<P>
"I had many chances and I didn't take advantage of them," said
Seles. "She played better when it came to crunch time."
</P>
<P>
It the second time that Monica lost to Novotna this year. The
Czech player defeated Seles at the French Open last month.
</P>
<P>
Novotna will meet Spaniard Arantxa Vicario Sanchez in the
semi-finals. Sanchez, seeded third here, roared up from first set
deficit to defeat eighth seed Kimiko Date of Japan 4-6, 6-3, 7-6
(10-8).
</P>
<P>
It is the consecutive eighth time Sanchez, ranked third in the
world, claims win over Date.
</P>
<P>
"We both gave our best, but finally at the good moments I came
-- probably concentrated better and go more for my shots," Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
Other semi-final match will pick Lindsay Davenport of the
United States against her teammate Mary Joe Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
Davenport ousted Iva Majoli of Croatia 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 and
Fernandez defeated second seed Conchita Martinez of Spain 3-6,
6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The men's singles quarter-finals will be held on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is to
provide 100,000 tons of grain to the government of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), according to an exchange of

Luo, also secretary-general of China's State Council, was in
the DPRK at head of a Chinese government delegation to attend the
celebrations marking the 35th anniversary of the signing of the

<P>
ATLANTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Kang Keon-wook scored two goals
from the run of play that helped build four-goal lead midway
through the second half as South Korea won its first game in men's
Olympic field hockey Monday, beating Malaysia 4-2.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans finished the preliminary-round play with a 1-2-2
record and four points, and were in fourth place in Pool B pending
the outcome of Monday night's final match between South Africa and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
A draw or victory by South Africa would move it back ahead and
send it to the classification matches against India on Wednesday.
That would also knock the South Koreans back to fifth and send
them to a match against the United States.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia finished 0-2-3 and will take on Argentina in
Wednesday's classifications.

MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon "Huaning" gained strength
on Monday as it roared toward extreme northern Luzon, following
the same path as typhoon "Gloring" which killed 55 people and
destroyed billions of pesos worth of property.
</P>

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical

kilometers per hour (kph), "Huaning" intensified to center winds
of 165 kph and 200 kph, much stronger than "Gloring."

The typhoon brought rain showers and thunderstorms over the
western section of Luzon, particularly Metro Manila and
lahar-affected areas. The rain showers triggered by the southwest
monsoon will last until Thursday.

wanted to see stronger, multi-faceted cooperation and friendship
with the ROK, in the interests of each country and for peace,
stability, cooperation and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Muoi stressed the Vietnamese people's constant support for the
aspirations of people in the north and south of Korea to enjoy
peace and unity in the peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Pemex Takes Steps To Guarantee Gas Supplies After Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's state-owned oil
company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) said today that it has taken
steps to guarantee gas supplies after last Friday's massive
explosion at the country's largest natural gas refinery complex in
the southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
Six people died and more than 40 were injured in a series of
explosions at the Cactus gas processing plant, one of the most
important petrochemical complexes in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas imports have been increased for northern Mexico,
where large numbers of maquiladora (assembly plants) has made the
region a large gas consumer, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Production in wells with little gas but a lot of crude
oil has been raised temporarily and the volume of gas treated in
other processing plants has been increased by 160 million cubic
feet a day.
</P>
<P>
Domestic gas supplies are estimated at 4.02 billion cubic feet
per day. Cactus processes 1.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas
and the explosion knocked out a third of its processing capacity.
</P>
<P>
Pemex added that the production of crude oil in the
southeastern states of Tabasco and Chiapas is likely to fall since
several wells were shut down after the explosion.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Separatist Leader Maskhadov Survives Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatist chief of staff
Aslan Maskhadov narrowly escaped death today in an ambush by
unidentified gunmen in southern Chechnya, but one of his
bodyguards was wounded, according to local press here today.
</P>
<P>
About five to seven gunmen, armed with machine guns and
sub-machine guns, attacked Maskhadov's car near a village in the
breakaway republic's Nozhay-Yurt district at 16 pm (Moscow times),
the bodyguards said.
</P>
<P>
In return fire, Maskhadov's bodyguards killed one gunman, but
they found no papers on the dead body.
</P>
<P>
As head of Chechen separatist delegation, Maskhadov
participated in the peace talks being held in Moscow and the
Ingush capital of Nazrani in the past months. He is also scheduled
to meet the Russian commander in the Northern Caucasus, General
Anatoly Kvashin, in the coming days to seek a resumption of the
stalled talks with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen rebels described today's attack as a prepared
terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen separatist leadership said some Chechen hardliners
have been trying to continue their fighting against Russia by
conducting sabotages and terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Chechen separatist leader, Salman Raduyev,
once given up for dead until he suddenly reappeared earlier this
month, today told a press conference that he firmly opposed the
planned meeting between Maskhadov and Kvashin. He vowed to do
everything possible to torpedo any peace accords between the
Chechen separatist leadership and the Russian government.

<HEADLINE> Helms Wants 25 Colombian Officials Barred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States Senate
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, Jesse Helms, has urged
President Bill Clinton to revoke the entry visas of 25 senior
Colombian political and military officials for alleged ties to
cocaine trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Helms, a leading conservative Republican in the U.S. Congress,
told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing today that he
made the request in a letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"To welcome to our country foreign nationals who have protected
drug traffickers or have prospered politically and financially
from these traffickers' blood money is unconscionable," said
Helms, from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The officials listed by Helms include Colombia's Interior
Minister, Horacio Serpa, Senate sources told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to further deteriorate relations between
the United States and Colombia. In March, Washington disqualified
Colombia as an ally in its war on drugs, charging that Colombian
President Ernesto Samper had allowed the drug cartels to corrupt
the entire Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
On July 11, the Clinton administration decided to revoke
Samper's entry visa to the United States, alleging that he had
accepted drug money to finance his 1994 campaign and allowed those
contributions to influence his policies.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Colombian government has been strongly
denouncing moves taken by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Abolish Poverty By End of '97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong government officials
expect to abolish poverty in the province before the end of 1997,
according to today's China daily.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 800,000 people living in the mountainous region
have an annual per capita income of less than 300 yuan, which is
below the poverty line, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
During the past ten years, more than 3.2 million people in the
province have risen from poverty, thanks to government measures to
develop rural economy, it added.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, about 18.5 billion yuan was spent
on road construction. Now, container trucks drive through remote
counties and cargo trucks can be seen in small mountainous
villages, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Cities and towns near the affluent Pearl River Delta are making
donations or providing technical support to the more remote
regions.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, has invested
more than 1.3 billion yuan along with manpower and technology to
help Meizhou, a village in the north.
</P>
<P>
A plan to relocate the poor who live in areas deemed
uninhabitable has been adopted.
</P>
<P>
The local government devoted about 100 million yuan to help
move 150,000 people from calcareous sandstone areas to better
areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 130,000 people from Qingyuan in the northern part of
the province have settled in 784 new villages in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Tourism development has been an important source of income in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
The State Tourism Bureau said that about three million people
from 10,000 villages in China have risen out of poverty by
developing tourism.
</P>
<P>
Beautiful natural scenery in northern Guangdong has attracted
many visitors.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Economy Grows 9.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's economy grew by 9.6
percent during the first half of 1996, but it does not mean the
end of economic problems the country is facing.
</P>
<P>
"In no way does this growth signify the solution to our needs,"
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told a press conference
today at the Andres Bello diplomatic academy, in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Robaina arrived in Chile last night for an official visit. He
had a working meeting this morning with Chilean Foreign Minister
Jose Miguel Insulza. Afterwards he inaugurated the Chilean-Cuban
mixed cooperation commission.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba's economy was on the rise with a 0.7 percent
increase in 1994, 2.5 percent in 1995 and the 9.6 percent in the
first six months of this year. Nonetheless the growth rate for the
end of the year would be five percent.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba stood only "in the first part of a very long and
very difficult road". For those who thought Cuba had put the
special period behind, "we are still far from it. Now we can see
the light at the end of the tunnel but the tunnel is still very
long.,"
</P>
<P>
Robaina criticized different aspects of U.S. policy towards
Cuba and the Helms-Burton Act and said Chilean investments in his
country would be protected.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Cuban President Fidel Castro was interested
in going to Chile for the Ibero-American summit to be held this
November.
</P>
<P>
Robaina will stay in Chile until Thursday on the first official
visit yet made by a Cuban foreign minister since their diplomatic
relations were broken off in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Chile and Cuba resumed their consular relations in 1991 and
renewed their ambassadorial relations last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Books to Go Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China plans to export 10 million
books of various kinds by the year 2000 in order to meet the
growing overseas demand for Chinese publications, according to a
"China Daily" report.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas bookstores run by Chinese publications
exporters will be increased as an entry of Chinese books into the
world market, the paper quoted Zhou Hongli, president of China
National Publishing Industry Trading Corp., as saying.
</P>
<P>
About five million books from China are purchased overseas
annually, and dozens of Chinese bookstores have been set up in
North America, Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the China Book Export Working Committee under the
China Book and Periodical Distributors Association called upon
publishers to improve printing quality and service and raise the
prestige of their products.
</P>
<P>
The committee has mapped out a proposal, suggesting the State
Press and Publication Administration tighten up supervision of the
trade, work out a national action plan and support the creation of
bookstores overseas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The committee also plans to conduct a survey on the situation
of Chinese publications in the world market to provide data for
the government in drawing up polices and as a reference for future
export plans, it said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 30 book exporters nation-wide that sell
more than five million copies of books in about 40,000 categories
annually, with growth averaging 15 to 20 percent yearly.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the growth of China's influence in international
affairs means that more foreigners are getting interested in
Chinese publications.
</P>
<P>
Increasing cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Straits and
with Hong Kong are also increasing the demand for Chinese
publications in those two areas, Zhou noted.
</P>
<P>
Books on minority nationalities, religion, traditional Chinese
medicine, health care, construction and ancient books are
especially popular among overseas readers.

<HEADLINE> Manila Cuts Budget for Military Modernization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The government of Philippines has
reduced by 50 percent to 170 billion pesos (6.5 billion US
dollars) the proposed budget for a 15-year armed forces
modernization program.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said on Monday that President Fidel Ramos
issued the order last week after a Senate monitoring group
reported that the government can not raise the 340 billion pesos
(13 billion dollars) needed for the modernization even if the six
percent gross national product (GNP) growth rate double in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
But the Senate pressed armed forces officials to allocate more
funds for the modernization of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos also reduced the modernization budget for the
national police by 33 billion pesos (1.26 billion dollars) to only
15.3 billion because of pressure from senators that the
government's tight finance may not allow such funding.

<HEADLINE> Brazil: Crocodiles Appear in Urban Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Crocodiles have been seen
roaming the avenues, squares and airports in the northeastern
Brazilian cities of Joao Pessoa and Recife, police said today.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected presence of these reptiles in urban areas in
broad daylight has caused alarm, but experts say the crocs are not
aggressive and will only attack if provoked.
</P>
<P>
Although vicious and dangerous in water, they can only walk
slowly on land and so pose no threat.
</P>
<P>
The "papo-amarrillo" crocodiles are leaving their natural
habitat in search of food caused by the destruction of forests and
water contamination, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
At least 28 crocodiles have been sighted in the urban areas of
Recife and Joao Pessoa over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
But environmental problems are not the only reason for the
crocodiles' appearance on city streets. They just like to go for a
walk now and again, the experts added.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Calls for Exercise of Restraint in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Monday called on rival parties in Burundi to exercise utmost
restraint so as to prevent further escalation of the crisis that
was caused by the July 25 coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
The coup d'etat, which was waged by the Tutsi soldiers, ousted
democratically elected Hutu President Ntibantunganya. Diplomats
feared that the event might lead to widespread ethnic fighting
between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement read by French Ambassador Alain
Dejammet, the council condemned the coup d'etat and urged coup
leaders to respect the will of the Burundian people.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council calls upon all Burundian leaders to
respect the Burundi constitution and the will of the people of the
country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council urges the military leaders of Burundi to restore
constitutional government and processes, including the
continuation of the elected National Assembly and civil
institutions and respect for human rights."
</P>
<P>
But the statement fell short of saying what action the council
will take to help restore the constitutional government although
some African countries have asked the United Nations to intervene
militarily.
</P>
<P>
"The Council stresses that the present situation in Burundi
requires utmost restraint and calls upon all concerned to refrain
from any actions and statements which could provoke escalation of
the crisis," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council stresses their responsibility to protect the
lives of all persons, including President Ntibantunganya, Prime
Minister Nduwayo and members of their government, and expects
them to maintain democratic institutions and to enter into
negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the crisis," the
statement added.

Sergey Syrtsov of Russia was second at 420 kilograms, with 195
from the snatch and 225 from the jerk. Romanian Nicu Vlad, who
also had 420 in the total, finished third with heavier bodyweight.
</P>
<P>
World champion Ihor Razorenov of Ukraine was forced to withdraw
from the competition after he injured his back in the warming up.
The Ukrainnian was rushed to the nearest hospital after the
injury.
</P>
<P>
The competitions did not witness much strife today when
Taimazov opened his jerk lifts with much confidence.
</P>
<P>
After making 195 and finishing third in the snatch, the
Ukrainian lifter lifted 227.5 kilograms to establish his win in
the category.
</P>
<P>
Vlad, who won the Los Angeles Olympic Games at the age of 21
twelve years ago, led the snatch with 197.5 kilograms. But in the
clean and jerk, he only managed to lift 222.5 kilograms before
missing 227.5 and 230 in his last two attempts.
</P>
<P>
With his first Olympic gold in hands, Taimazov asked a new
world record weight in his second try and made it a success.
</P>
<P>
The strong Ukrainian hercules did not stop at that weight. He
continued to ask 240 kilograms in his third and last jerk but only
managed to lift the barbell above his knees.
</P>
<P>
After taking his first ever Olympic title, Taimazov, who missed
the last world championships due to wrist injury, said:"I know the
competition would be hard at the Olympics, but it is great to win
here."
</P>
<P>
The last category of over 108-kg category will be held on
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States will provide
Jordan on lease 16 F-16 fighting Falcon warplanes, the Pentagon
announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The five-year lease agreement was signed by Robert Bauerlein,
deputy undersecretary of the U.S. Air Force, and Field Marshal
Abdal Hafiz Marei Kaabneh, the head of Jordan's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the $220 million deal, agreed on Jan. 7 by U.S.
Defense Secretary William Perry and Jordan's King Hussein, will be
paid for by the United States, and delivery of the planes, 12
F-16A single-seat and 4 F-16B two-seat aircraft, will begin in
December 1997, Defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
Kaabneh said his country would like to have 50 of the fighter
planes in its arsenal to bolster its military forces.
</P>
<P>
The multi-role F-16 fighter jets are considered one of the
finest in the world due to their high maneuverability and the
long distances they can fly into combat.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Raps U.S. over Extraterritorial Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette today rapped the United States over its extraterritorial
provisions in laws on toughening sanctions against such countries
as Cuba, Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"These American laws have nothing to do with the fight against
terrorism. They are bad laws," said de Charette in an interview
with the local daily "Parisien".
</P>
<P>
He said that France is "totally opposed to it that one state
could change the rules of international trade and impose it on
others."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it would be useless to isolate Iran, and
that it is France's objective to let Iran be "one responsible
partner of the international community and let it take part in the
fight against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
On the ministerial conference on fight against terrorism to be
held by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries and
Russia in Paris on Tuesday, de Charette said that the overall
objective of the meeting is to send a "strong political signal"
to the governments and public opinions of all countries around the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers would present 25 measures, including the
one of overwatching some associations in the Middle East which
patronizes terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Measures can also be taken against "private encodings" on
such networks as the internet that are being used by terrorists to
communicate among themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some thoroughfares in central Paris will be closed on Tuesday
morning when the conference opens in the International Conference
Center here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French newspapers today highlighted the fact that
the bomb attack on the Atlanta Centennial Olympics Park last
Saturday was most likely done by American ultra-rightists such as
the Michigan Militias who blew up the Federal building of Oklohoma
City a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde said that adding to the list of terrorists is "a new
format, originating from the home base, more or less in organized
or purely domestic, and carrying the seal of some fringes of
society (Oklahoma City)."
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Central Intelligence Agency and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation did not -- although reluctantly -
exclude the possibility of a "home trail" which could have made
bomb attacks on the TWA Boeing jumbo jet when they offered a long
list of suspects to the "Time" weekly recently.

WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry has postponed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia to discuss
security measures for American troops stationed there, U.S.
defense officials said on Monday.

Perry has flown home to Washington from talks in Australia over

</P>
<P>
it was reported last week that Perry's trip to Saudi Arabia was
to ask the kingdom to pay at least half of the expected cost for a
new security plan, including movement of around 5,000 U.S. troops
from densely-populated cities to a safer remote military base.
</P>
<P>
The plan was drawn up following a truck bomb in Dhahran last
month, killing 19 American soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Holds Talks with Christopher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher both agreed
on Monday that it is necessary to keep diplomatic momentum in the
Middle East to push the movement of peace process forward, said a
U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak, who arrived in Washington on Sunday to start
a four-day visit, is seeking U.S. assurances that it would not
waive its efforts in pulling the Israeli Likud government back on
peace track.
</P>
<P>
His one-hour meeting with Christopher, who just returned from a
trip to Jakarta and Sydney, was a preparation for consultations
between Mubarak and U.S. President Bill Clinton at White House on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"They both agreed on the importance of maintaining the kind of
diplomatic momentum in the region to maintain movement in the
peace process," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is wary about U.S. commitment to press Israel toward
compromise in accepting the land-for-peace formula adopted by
former Israeli Labour government, as it is the election year in
the United States and President Clinton is unwilling to alienate
Jewish- American voters for his confrontational attitude towards
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"Mubarak's mission is to make the Americans understand that
backing away from the land-for-peace formula is harmful not only
to the Arab countries, but to Israel and the huge American
interests in the region," an Egyptian observer said on the eve of
Mubarak's travel to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition to peace process issues, President Mubarak will
discuss with President Clinton a variety of questions, such as the
conflicting positions on Egyptian-born Boutros Boutros-Ghali
serving a second term as Secretary-General of U.N. and sanctions
against Libya, Iraq and Sudan.

WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Reform Party named
billionaire Ross Perot and former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm
on Monday to compete for the party's presidential nomination,
party officials announced in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
Perot and Lamm each got the support of at least 10 percent of
the Reform Party members who answered a mail-in survey. No one
else actively sought the nomination.
</P>
<P>
The party did not immediately release raw survey results to
show how much support each candidate had claimed, saying the data
would be released later, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Lamm's organization has requested that the survey numbers be
made public, including the total number of surveys mailed, the
number returned, the number deemed valid, the percentage of valid
votes received by each candidate and identification of all
candidates who received 1 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
Reform Party spokeswoman Sharon Holman said she did not know
when specific vote results from the mail-in survey would be ready.

SARAJEVO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Implementation Force
(IFOR) Has detained two uniformed Bosnians after searching for a
gunman who attacked an IFOR patrol, the peace-keeping force said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
An IFOR statement said that an IFOR patrol driving near Visoko,
a town controlled by the Bosnian government, on Saturday was fired
upon by a lone gunman, injuring one French soldier.
</P>
<P>
An investigation was immediately carried out by the IFOR French
troops in conjunction with local police and on Sunday, IFOR
conducted a search operation in order to apprehend the sniper.
</P>
<P>
The search turned up two persons in Bosnian army uniform and
confiscated some 30 guns and a large amount of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the two men were arrested because they
violated the Dayton agreement which bans weapons in disarmament
zone and will be transferred to local authorities after further
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Athletes Sign Large Billboard Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Olympic
Athletes have signed a large billboard against poverty in Olympic
Village, Atlanta, as part of the recent appeal launched by the
U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Olympic
Committee, a U.N. press release said today.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the initiative reinforces the commitment
made by athletes to mobilize the international community against
poverty, which burdens the lives of 1.3 billion people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The appeal coincides with the International Year for the
Eradication of Poverty, as proclaimed by the U.N. General
Assembly. It has already resulted in many local activities by
athletes.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, in Malaysia, Olympic team
members started an "Athletes Against Poverty" fund. In Botswana, a
swimming pool for the disabled that meets Olympic standards is
being built and will be inaugurated next year. In Belarus, UNDP
and the National Olympic Committee sponsored an Olympic art
exhibition that opened this month in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
UNDP Resident Representative in Belarus, Pavel Kral, said
that cooperation between Olympic athletes and UNDP should
increase access of the poor to sports and result in anti-poverty
projects.

NEW YORK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street slipped
today in cautious, inactive trading as interest rates rose before
a potentially bumpy week of economic news.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 38.47 to 5,434.59.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume reached only 281.35
million shares, down from 349.85 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 2.23 to 338.64, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.00 to 630.90.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.31 to 1,069.13, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 3.03 to 536.12.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes also held near opening levels for much of
the day before dipping in the last hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were pressured by falling bond prices, which sent the
yield on the 30-year Treasury to 7.09 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Tuesday's report on the quarterly employment
cost index and Friday's report on July employment and wage levels
should provide important clues on whether payroll costs are rising
at an inflationary clip, forcing price increases on the consumer
level.
</P>
<P>
Two mild economic readings last week had eased inflation fears,
but analysts said it was unclear whether the economy was slowing
enough to avert an inflation-fighting interest rate hike by the
Federal Reserve.
